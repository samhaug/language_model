we had yeah bro i just drank some last night and it was not not nearly like this no this [ __ ] actually tastes like death the other [ __ ] was just sweet bad this is like it really tastes like cannabis like the cbd i see where the medication that they're talking about like the people say that the end the aftertaste is like you know medicine but that's like literally the cannabis that's legit shoo i'm not gonna lie it makes my cup like it makes the drink look so much look and we still got more in there too we can't even we couldn't fill up the whole cups that this is gonna be good for you ladies what i'm saying yeah we're gonna try and drink it listen if you guys feel like you need like an extra a mix then do this that's why you got the double chest honestly i still feel like it was just mixed just as good and like just doing what we did with this i wish you all could [ __ ] taste this it really is like a [ __ ] hitting like a [ __ ] cart or some [ __ ] for real really like really [ __ ] crazy i got like a little drip or two it says it takes up up to two hours to fill the effects but i bet bro i always feel it in like 30 minutes i start feeling like a little low you know what i mean i'm probably going to finish this [ __ ] off and we will come back in like 30 minutes and tell you all how the high isn't [ __ ] but realistically i think we're going to be feeling this here in like 15 20. soon i swear you don't have to drink all this [ __ ] like we don't have to drink all this [ __ ] to start feeling it i really feel like it says that the um the serving size is like a teaspoon and there's six in each bottle i really feel like a serving size will probably sauce you up bro yes i'm gonna pour more of my saucy in here i'm trying to get all that saucy today i'm

of the bottom of the liquid oh [ __ ] you poured a little bit on there it's just nice we're that hot i didn't drink all of it i drank like a good half and then i poured some more sprouting to make it taste better so i got like melt left this shit's so strong like we had to pour a little bit more [ __ ] spray in it just to make it taste a little more you know freaking strong yeah i don't recommend doing the six servings it's ridiculous it's not like it's bad strong it's just really medicating you can really taste the disc not really it's not distally but you can taste the live rosin in there you can really taste that salt we've had like two two different lean videos now and this is the strongest soap and i have all the animals that we had out of all the edibles that we've had [ __ ] these these little pieces of shits right here [ __ ] rocked our damn heads the smallest milligram of all the edibles we had stony patches we had nerd ropes we had a whole bunch of different [ __ ] a bunch

lot peace y'all the coolest", "FVknGOg-FT4": "ha ha welcome back to how to be a rapper you only need three things your sprite you lean two cups ready just cherry on top that's it that's it gang just kidding what's up i'm not kidding that's how you be a rapper for real but what uh today we're talking about this [ __ ] right here probably seen this before on your plug snapchat on reddit on youtube it is some dank czar chronic elixir man some thc lean if you will i've never had one of these before actually i have i went to this like cannabis event and they had like bottles of these but it wasn't in some like it wasn't this it was like it looked like the [ __ ] a bottle you could buy off of amazon um and they just put lean in and they're like yeah dude it's [ __ ] a thousand milligrams a whole bottle it's like bet bro and i paid 50 bucks for it and i don't think i got high but this [ __ ] did not pay that much for it but hopefully it'll do the trick so technically i've never really had one of these before so i scooped up grape there's hello flavors there's like watermelon strawberry peach grape fruit punch pineapple there's hella flavors but scooped up the grape for the first time and if this is good i'm gonna be coming back for some more but to drink it we have to get a sprite i feel like so when you're drinking something like this like a lean or something sprite it's just your best bet your safest bet like why you can't go wrong with some sprite but i was told to drink some of my sprite first and i was told to not pour it all at once because then it just fizz up like mentos that's the worst bro like if you [ __ ] up and you get like a fizzy drinker like like a you get like a bottle drink like this and you shake it up and you try to open that [ __ ] and it just fizzes up to the top those are one of those things where you just gotta take the l you just can't you can't do anything about it you just literally have to watch yourself [ __ ] like watch your [ __ ] up just like build up and then come all over you yeah one cool i think i'm just gonna pour it and then start talking because [ __ ] also you may be wondering about like the serving size there's 200 milligrams in this entire bottle and one serving size is one teaspoon of this which is 33 milligrams so i'm gonna have the whole bottle pour me a drink sir [Music] [ __ ] [Music] kind of smells like weed to be honest [Music] all right now it's all in there now this looks like some dirty ass [ __ ] i guess that's dirty sprite that's some [ __ ] big brain [ __ ] i don't know what they're gonna oh all right first taste think he's up they cheers everybody all right eight out of ten great profile solid the sprite couldn't go wrong with it it was a good base the only thing is that i don't think you can really do anything about this there's that aftertaste it's not as bad as other thc lean that has um it's uh infused with flour and so that's what i want to talk about this [ __ ] but yeah it gives you a little bit of like a like a i don't think like a burn but it's kind of bitter at the end very end just a little bit like on a bitterness scale probably like two out of ten so i don't know if you can see on the in the bottom right here in the white it's solventless live rosin in this that's what's infused into the syrup and live rosin i don't know if you saw the last video but it's this stuff the the like the best stuff that you can smoke is infused into the syrup and dank czar also makes also has their own line of live rosin and if you know about hash rosin you probably know about dank tsar they make a [ __ ] ton they have like all different levels too they have like tiers of hash and they're all fire and when you so when you combine some rosin that's already dope and you put it into a syrup it's bound to be something that's probably going to be firing that's probably why i hear about this [ __ ] a lot so the process is the same in making the syrup for both rosin or flower you have to de-carb decarbon decar do you give the decarbon all right the full words right here i'm not going to say that [ __ ] you have to decarbot which gets it from a smokeable substance to an edible substance so you activate it and then you literally just make the syrup however you make syrup and you just infuse it the good thing about using rosin is that it's already an extraction of all the good things that you want from the flower rosin is super clean because there's no solvents it's a solventless based extraction method which is dope so after i think after i finish this we're gonna take a dab in i'm not doing that chugging soda so hard hold it bubbly this is the body part all right we're done so while we wait for this little syrup to kick in i thought only appropriate that while we wait for this to hit us for drinking hash rosin we might as well smoke some pastures it's only appropriate to get oh my god that poon tang that's like stinky but like fruity at the same time ping is up everybody and big cheers hopefully it doesn't focus on too bad [Music] all right so we got the timer going right there i'm going to come back and check in with you guys in like an hour hour and a half however long it takes to kick in when i really feel my when i'm really feeling it so i don't know i'm just going to go like be my meat or something i know i'm doing that again all right i don't know you definitely can't see that uh we're in uh hour and ten to the drink i feel great before i say anything about the drink though i was watching bleach in my time okay anime talk for just for people who don't watch it spoilers i guess so like skipped it right here if you don't want to hear anything so but i just finished the fight ichigo and eisen just finished like just now like eisen got sealed just now kisuke came in at the last minute like always just out of nowhere i don't know what the [ __ ] he was that entire fight he was like haha i got you ichigo being like taking the final ketsuka fire he looked fire sick he had that one attack and it worked out all right they're sick we can all agree on that now i also want to see him fight a little bit you know what i'm saying like he should have just played like done something a little bit like tried a couple of textures to regular like guys we've got tanjun you know he did that 50 times a fight um but you know it was so cool nonetheless um so yeah that was good but anyway the drink i feel great it's definitely like definitely 200 milligrams 100 uh yeah i think so i don't i don't feel bad it just went down easy with the sprite um yeah if your tolerance isn't that high don't down the whole thing maybe i suggest try it out if you don't know if you smoke a lot i would say started like 50 right just to see right because you don't want to take a [ __ ] ton and you [ __ ] yourself up and you never want to try edibles again because you think oh my god they're going to be so bad i'd say try like 50 milligrams right if you don't really do edibles right you don't know how much to take in [ __ ] but if you're really trying to freaking feel some [ __ ] feel crazy feel loopy it this it's this it's good 200 milligrams it's all right you know i feel great it might be some clips that this is the end of me if i feel super weird or something but yeah this might be the end who knows so if it is peace see you wednesday [Music] you", "7bM2Zh6Owt8": "what's up y'all southern damper here and this is gonna be my official review on chronic elixir but y'all know me first things first I got to put some smoke in there get the mood right and yeah cheers in much love y'all that's how you start a video booth week all right chronic elixir chronic elixir is THC syrup that also has CBD in it so it's five parts TAC one part CBD so yeah it's really good I've tried a lot of the the THC syrups and there's not too many that have CBD in it now have CBD to stray CBD that has 200 milligrams or they have the 1500 milligram that has five parts TAC one part CBD this is the one that I prefer it's real clean when you mix it there's no floating particles or anything like that there's one thing to it it has a little CBD kick at the back end of it little medicine kick but if you've had CBD you know what that is and it is a medicine so me I don't mind the taste of a little medicine if that's what you're ingesting and CBD has medicinal purposes so I got apple soda from Jamaica and I'm gonna pour some strawberry and liquid strawberry chronic elixir in there it one tablespoon is sixty three milligrams I go about 2 tablespoons it has a nice plastic seal on it and then foil seal also beautiful labeling really professional all right so that's why I take a combo to set the mood give me nice and toasted so watch the pour up on this it's really clean mixes really well don't really bubble up too much it will bubble up but not too much that was a little over tablespoon we'll put a little bit more in there I like to go about like I said two servings it did spew over just a little bit but it's fine that's what paper towels are for all right so now that we're ready take that give it a nice little mix and as you can see there's no floating particles it all mixes nice and well and then I always pour it over ice makes it nice and cool ready to go Cheers very good strawberry taste it's all organic and the owner has Crohn's and can't digest dairy products and that's the reason why he created this is because he likes edibles and things like that so there you go all right let me see what else all right the effects of this usually within about 30 minutes I start feeling a little bit of the effect Nelo a little bit of body thus you feel the CBD and then you also feel the THC kick in it mellows you out and this is also great for appetite every time I drink a dose of this it increases my appetite makes me hungry and I tear the kitchen up but yeah they have several flavors I think for four or five flavors they have a CBD and the THC you know the pure CBD so you can have in the morning without having any hand high and then you can have the CBD and the THC after a long day's work to get that mellow body relaxation and you know it feel right in the hand get a little bit relaxed there as well Machat other than that you need to check into it I'll leave the link down below chronic elixir you can read all about it how everything's tested and it's clean yeah like I said there is a little bit of a sea wheedies taste at the back end of it which i think is good because if you don't want it too sweet you want to know it's a medicine that's my that's my opinion you don't want a kid to grab your drink if you like no this is good you want to have you want it to be good but you want to have a little bit of a something just so you know that's my opinion and I'll stand by that Cheers all right I'm gonna take one more dab one more ball grip to close it out I call that a combo as you all know I hope y'all enjoyed the video I hope it was as in formidable as possible with my limited knowledge as far as all the specs and everything on that of the product but I know it's a great product I've been using it for about a year and I have no complaints everybody that I introduce it to say it's a wonderful thing and it's a man it's it's for medical purposes so no it's a medicine all right and it works so with that being said I'll leave the link down below check in to email them email me ask me questions about it I will be a little bit more informative if I can and I will ask the right people the right questions and get you the right information cheers a much love y'all hope y'all have a wonderful day this dab and ball rip it's for you guys cheers in much love have a great day peace",

read as Dixie there di xi\u00e8 elixir there are half and half lemonade NT th C infuse 100 milligrams so I reviewed a lot of drinks here on wheats and I find them to be pretty good there's some really great ones out there cannabis quenchers awesome Jasper's amazing there of course some Dead's out there but on the whole I do like the drinks so I'm really looking forward to this Dixie elixir half and a half a pretty cool little bottle here it's got a wrapper on the outside I kind of like the idea is that the cap there at the top if you want a dose the cap is designed to help you dose appropriately helps you decide like you know oh what's 10 milliliters blah blah blah blah blah what's it what's a dose of course we're going to ignore that and just drink the whole bottle in terms of half and half I love me some Arnold Palmer's which is what a half lemonade half iced tea is love love love them so I'm hoping like this the drinks in terms of taste are all over the map sometimes they're really bad like as Aspen but that means they can produce excellent rewards like zest and sometimes they're not too bad but they often have this really bitter aftertaste and I find that to be pretty often the case with the drinks I'm having trouble getting it off which is you know par for the course for me we're almost there keep peeling this plastic layer off until we eventually get to the goods oh boy there she goes okay there she is all defrocked there's a little cap that you can pour it in so on the back we've got our ingredients and our nutrition information I sadly don't see any lab and testing results but that's okay we're gonna hope that it has 100 milligrams in here it says shake gently before consuming which is what we shall do I assume this opens like a childproof lid it does handsome looking bottle there down the hatch hmm it's okay definite cannabis taste to it more tea than lemonade taste it's not too bad um it's only eight and a half ounces so I'll be done with it in no time again there is a slight cannabis taste to it it's not as bitter as the cannabis quench reserves ASP but but it is there so if you really hate that cannabis taste you might want to pass on this one but for me I'm uh I'm I'm I'm David it's again it's not as bitter as some of the the other brands out there hopefully it means it's still gonna be nice and strong so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I'm gonna come back to you in two hours like all of our reviews to let you know how this Dixie elixir has landed thanks for watching weeds guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] Dixie elixir half and half and it's pretty good it is in the oh it got me to about a six I'm about a six right now 400 milligram edible that's not bad and one that only costs eleven bucks which I think I neglected to mention the first half I'm pretty pleased with it the taste was good for a drink it wasn't outstanding tasting and it didn't get me crazy high but overall it's a pretty good little product one that I'm pleased with if you pick if you see it at a dispensary near you and you're looking for a drink and they don't and you don't want to get completely [ __ ] up the Dixie elixir might be the product for you I think I might try another one in the future see how it goes for me but overall this is a it's gonna give them my own thumbs up for me not a not a ringing endorsement but but far from uh from a negative review so uh that's gonna do it for this review here guys a nice short and sweet one but before I go and share with you a little cherry on top something

how much that is but we shall see some people see from their plastic comes off squeeze the sides twist so um let's do this it was one to and at three so 23 23 23 that's 46 69 so be 71 so that's about like Sony and a half milligrams of THC waiting and it looks pretty nice color much about to go all crazy with this add a little work tomorrow so see how it is elixirs Pete's tea peached iced tea 200 milligrams 23.5% hmm I get that I don't know if you get guys in all the drink horchata it kind of has like a dry aftertaste to it and won't be honest I don't really taste anything I don't really taste any type of cannabis flavor or peat I don't know what I taste but it's nothing flavorful but it's not bad it's just it reminds me of horchata not sweet but that dry you know what it needs oh all right so I feel like I needed a little boost to it so we're gonna add in a little vodka and that boost of flavor some peach schnapps we're gonna get a little cross food but uh yeah I want to see just a little bit of the snaps and just a little bit of the vodka give that a twirl and let's see um yeah that didn't really go as as I planned just made it taste more medicine there's nothing sweet about that all right well alright let's still manage bring it this is actually hmm I don't know what to put my finger on it but I definitely don't taste peach but it has like a dry taste aftertaste I do not taste the cannabis or anything but uh yeah I mean if you want to I'm gonna be honest I'm starting to feel something about it I don't know I'm just trippin all right so this is the product review of

channel if you're new here I am Judith and today's video I am going to be eating a hundred milligram edible for you guys I did get this on 4/20 and I am barely going to eat it with you guys just because I don't know it's been in the fridge it's been getting cold and I thought why not do it today today is my day off so your grocery and yeah so I'm gonna consume this a hundred milligram edible for you guys and see what it does to me I am a huge smoker so I don't know if it would hit me as much but honestly it probably will because edibles hit different than smoking like honestly honestly if you eat edibles they will hit like major but yeah so I'm gonna eat this for you guys hopefully I don't feel like I'm dying and then from there who knows this video will probably be a short vlog and yeah I'm just gonna go about my day on an edible and see the effects of what happens so let me set the camera for you guys and then open this oh so I am in my little sister's room I am at my mom's house and yeah there's nowhere else I'd rather take a hundred milligram edible than my mom's because if I freaked out which I probably won't but if I freaked out my sisters are here and my mom is here and everybody is here so if your girl feels like she's dying everybody is here hominy yeah yeah so let me set this camera up for you guys and then let's do it okay you guys I'm so mad at myself because I literally broke the freaking edible and I didn't want to do that I wanted to show you guys exactly what it looked like and your girl is just not paying attention if you guys have ever tried these let me know in the comments down below and what you guys thought about them so I've tried these before they were good and let's do this again so here we go I'm gonna break this seal for you guys know it's childproof it's childproof you guys it doesn't even have a little cut for you to follow do you have scissors money so you legit might need a knife or some scissors to open the packaging which is always good that's like an a-plus because if you have kids or you have little adults around you don't want them to easily access these things because yeah Oh Jax is sad he's crying outside right now but I don't want him inside because he's just gonna he's just gonna bark and do odd things possible but he's sad because jenna so just dipped or she went somewhere I'm not sure but okay so I went ahead and cut it open I'm sorry my nails are a little rough right now one is really bitten your girl has been super anxious and nervous and if you know me you just have a lot of anxiety sometimes and believe it or not I get and I get anxiety attacks and it's just a struggle you guys so if you guys know what they feel like or you guys are also going through the same thing I hope that you guys are doing everything possible to just stay calm and everything is gonna be fine you guys I always try to remind myself that but anyways it smells so good these are dark mint chocolate bars and they legit smell like dark mint chocolate they really do you guys let me push them it to the front they literally broke it in there I am so upset with myself but they still looks so good okay let's do it I'm gonna eat the whole bar you guys so let's do this they are look look at how they're packaging for their chocolate is like go ahead and hold that for you guys look at that it literally tells you the milligram of each little bar that is crazy I don't even remember eating the other one and I don't remember being this excited about having the milligrams on the bar I don't know I guess yes yes if you guys how do you say it um if you guys are dosing or how would you say I money you just oh yeah mone is smart she okay so if you are micro dosing and you are a big believer or a big person who does micro seeing these are exactly what you need but let's do this image it tastes like dark chocolate man mm sorry 20 milligrams yeah 820 milligrams right there let's go ahead and eat oh my god I'm such an idiot you guys and you guys are not telling me so apparently it doesn't give you the milligrams on here I just assumed that they did but no it doesn't it actually says THC on the bar d\u00f6 oh my god I'm either dumb or I'm blind you guys I'm so dumb but it does say THC on them on the packaging and lets you know that each bar is 10 milligrams so I just assumed that that's what it was on that's what was written on the bar but you know what it's still cool it still lets you know how many milligrams each little bar is and honestly dude the reason why I like these is because ok 30 more milligrams and then it's 50 milligrams total and you can't argue with that [Applause] and I got this one this one didn't break yeah so this one didn't break you guys and 15 milligrams for this little bit is yes yes I love edibles that are tiny but they pack so much like a little brownie that's 100 milligrams like thighs the best because you don't have to eat as much like it legit gets to the point it's not like you have to eat 50 cupcakes to get 100 milligrams like no I love that they high dose these things so that you can eat less of it but get more of a punch like those are my favorite edibles look 20 more milligrams what is that now 70 milligrams oh my god I'm freaking myself out honey you're gonna be here with me okay my sister said if I feel like I'm dying she's gonna be here with me you're gonna remind me that I'm not dying she was gonna remind me I'm not dying guys honestly I can always have I can always be having a bad day but once I get on camera for you guys and I talk to you guys I just make a difference I do feel better I do feel the best I could be sometimes but yeah like I really like being here with you guys you guys motivate me of course I do want to do big things when I'm older I hope you guys stay to see what the [ __ ] that J and J twins are gonna do in the future my sister has a boyfriend and they're hella cute you guys so shout out to all the couples out there especially my sister's relationship because he is so nice you guys like so next so nice oh hi there any more milligrams and that's gonna be a total of 100 milligrams you guys so recently hmm yeah I would buy these again mm-hmm yes mm-hmm so recently I took half a tab with Hubert he took the pool tab you guys I don't know I don't know people could do the most and still survive but me knowing I'm gonna take a full time I know that it's gonna be full-blown everything like everything I'm gonna see God I'm gonna see [ __ ] mythological things everything so I took half a tab right you guys I swear I couldn't stop laughing like I was trying I was trying so hard to keep it together because like I wouldn't look at Hubert and I was just like in my mind it was so funny like to even look at him was so funny like I didn't know I didn't know why looking at him was so funny and while I was doing that I was applying to new things so that I can get my life together and go find better things so I was on my laptop like the laptop looked cool whatever but then I started to realize oh my god oh my god it's hitting like my half tab is hitting and that's why I only take half a tab Jax our guard dog our long-haired dachshund or jealous long-haired dachshund even after the tab was over and we woke up the next morning I even asked him I was I asked him how his tab fell and if he felt it and he said smack - smack but yeah I am my my half tops max I didn't think it was going through because I've never had great oh my god looks so young with short hair so I never like I never really have good experiences with papertabs usually jalisa gets us gel tabs and those are the ones that really really like always boom like and these paper tabs one time we took them and they just it didn't work out so yeah lesson learned gels are my favorite my point is don't be afraid to microdose don't ever feel like you have to eat the whole edible or take the whole tab like no I even take quarter tabs and I feel good I feel like I could take a quarter tab and go throughout my day or take a quarter tab and drink and have a good time so everything is possible you guys don't hurt yourselves but I will come back check up with you guys and see when this hits so I'll make sure to time this for you guys let me check and you're gonna wash my hands because I do not want to lick my fingers so it is currently 138 I will come back whenever these shit's hit which will be in like 30 minutes hopefully or maybe an hour who knows no one ever knows um yeah and I'll check up with you guys and see you later my dude shoutout to jealous because she is hooking it up with some boiling crab but yes but yes okay so it's been like 45 minutes okay you guys so it's 229 now and oh my gosh that's so weird why is it doing that anyways so it's 2:30 you guys and I am pretty faded I don't know what that means that's so weird oh it's doing it's like something the camera can see but not us okay guys so the edibles definitely hit you guys I was watching a really good movie right now called private life it's called private life and I was crying you guys I can't stop oh my gosh this edible is definitely hitting I was watching this movie called private life and if you haven't watched it you guys need to watch this movie like the movie is so it's real and I like that so yeah the edibles this is like 45 minutes after or 15 minutes after so like about an hour it took me to really get the feeling like I am super faded right now you guys like I'm just like deeply in movies right now if you guys want something that's gonna hit you guys should definitely get some wounds and if you like the mint flavor with chocolate this is definitely that so yeah thanks for watching and I will see you guys in the next video", "jb1W1xJtNcI": "did you know iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder in the world according to the World Health Organization more than 40% of the world's population suffers from iron deficiency women infants children vegetarians and frequent blood donors are among the most at-risk populations so why do you need iron iron is an essential mineral the major reason we need it is that it helps to transport oxygen throughout the body iron is an important component of hemoglobin the substance and red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to transport it throughout your body hemoglobin represents about two thirds of the body's iron if you don't have enough iron your body can't make enough healthy oxygen carrying red blood cells a lack of red blood cells is called iron deficiency anemia it's important to be aware of the signs and symptoms as iron deficiency can cause heart problems and stunt growth here are some signs and symptoms you should know 1 fatigue iron is used to make hemoglobin the material in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the entire body when your iron deficient your blood cells take a hit this can make you feel exhausted chu shortness of breath due to a low iron level less oxygen reaches different parts of your body when the body's oxygen level is low it will cause shortness of breath no matter how deeply you breathe when your blood cells are deprived of oxygen easy activities like walking can make you gasp for breath 3 pale skin another common sign associated with iron deficiency is pale skin or a washed-out appearance due to a low iron level your body is unable to manufacture sufficient hemoglobin it's the hemoglobin that gives your blood it's red color and your skin it's rosy hue as the onion deficiency worsens your skin begins to lose its normal color and becomes pale for brittle nails if your nails look pale fragile and brittle it can be a possible sign of iron deficiency along with brittle nails a concave or spoon shaped depression in the nails can indicate an vision iron level in the body a 2015 study published in clinics in dermatology reports that virtually every nutritional deficiency can affect the growth of nails in some manner and iron is one of them five hair loss there are many possible causes for hair loss and iron deficiency is one of them a low iron level sends your body into survival mode during which it channels oxygen to support vital functions as opposed to less important functions like hair growth a 2011 study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology shows that iron deficiency has a much closer link to hair loss than most doctors realize adequate iron intake may be the key to restoring hair growth 6 sore muscles when you don't have enough iron your muscles are unable to recover properly if your regular morning jog is causing you more pain than usual you may be iron deficient so the best way to not be on you're deficient is eat foods that are high in iron such as grass-fed beef poultry seafood beans lentils and dark green leafy vegetables such as spinach and kale", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check me out on instagram at the NJ chef don't forget to

you saw it in your childhood room would you think twice about it it's called cush the drug got a Miami Dolphins player arrested in Collier County this week and then he was cut from the team we sent NBC to investigator David Hodges to find out what it is and you know if these illegal drugs are hidden in plain sight being a big issue for parents and Peter the biggest danger is that they're far more pwned than anything parents may have seen or even tried when they were young so to help your kids we're gonna help you spot them at a quick glance you might not recognize it what does this look like to you ketchup pills that looks like marijuana syrup the final answer is correct Kush syrup found in the car of Miami Dolphins player and Collier County sold in a medical marijuana dispensary in California but not untouchable for kids in South West Florida pretty much everything through online channels you can figure out a way together Steven hill helps kids with substance abuse at Sal's care he says teens will try something like Co syrup just because it's new but I just think it's a different way to do it different and possibly more dangerous syrup has a thousand milligrams of THC the active principle of marijuana per bottle and if taken all at once 10 to 20 times what you're typically going against smoking a joy the side effects would be palpable a lot of times very erratic hallucinations and you can also get psychosis on a temporary basis so the the judgment and your behaviors are definitely impacted grown-ups don't know Lesley Robinson is founder of Street chicks and recovery which runs a marijuana adolescent prevention program in Lee County middle schools she also produces videos helping educate kids about some of the side effects of marijuana in products like Co syrup and it's so potent you're gonna be able to tell your child is high she says the best way for parents to spot these drugs is to pay attention to the new products on the market educate yourself on the other forms besides the bag and the smell the Collier County Sheriff's Office told us they don't recall ever making any arrests where this kind of syrup was down before but many of these drugs come and wave so the best advice for parents be on the lookout if you didn't buy it or authorize it question it for the NBC to investigators I'm David Hodges call email or download the NBC 2 news app and submit your tip now", "iXJWNv1ZWmU": "yo what's up a.m. homeboys at Dixie hooked it up cherry limeade we're gonna down this whole bottle right now so I'm not gonna mess around stoner proof yep I do a good job of sealing it yo said sprite 7up whatever helps it i dribbled you know it's not that bad i just down about half of it yo definitely he was 100% right he was getting pissed at me because

(upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually.

here and a reminder this video is for a mature audience so if you're not a mature audience going on today's video we're going to talk about the THC drinks and we'll get drink them obviously I got a bunch of different things here there's a lot of stuff out there I got a few of the things that I like and we're gonna get started by doing it a nice cold start DAB here out of the Davidge you know I've filled it up with some Sun evil water mom and we're just gonna get started with a cold start before we get into anything [Music] [Music] I'm gonna drink it right just add a little more th in there isn't using it with the dab right now well damn now it's good only Clements real quick let's talk about these drinks that we got so oh that was the sons of sativa and it's a two hundred two hundred milligram watermelon sativa drink and it's sixteen point five ounces and they save 20 servings on here but we'll probably finishing the whole bottle so we got that I got another two hundred milligram Dixie elixir fruit punch here and I've had these before these are delicious it actually says two hundred and twenty milligrams like have that variance now this one says 193 it was one since 220 so if you if you get the chance look at the labels you might be able to anyway what percent bro this is made with pure cane sugar no artificial flavoring sweetening then a few different flavors I guess but I got the fruit punch flavor and this is 200 milligrams and the bottle is eight and a half ounces so about half as much liquid in this one for the same dosage so if you're not trying to drink a lot of liquid and then I got two of these a little bit little flasks here we're gonna have some fun with these they're made by I don't know how to pronounce the mark aha ma r QA h a but they're called flasks and they got a fruit punch infused beverage this is a hundred milligrams per bottle and this is just a few ounces that would think if it says on here this is like a mixin or a flavor utter flavor edition and this one is the blueberry chamomile aka very marriage berry this one is supposed to be there indica put you to sleep that one and these both have 100 milligrams but we're gonna have some fun with these and I just realized I want a glass of ice but before these over some ice and let's really enjoy the show all right let's have some fun I got a couple of couple of glasses of some nice here and ourselves a couple of drinks here maybe we'll mix some of the the flavors a shake that [ __ ] people who don't shake their drinks before drinking them oh my god let's pour some of this over some ice see how it looks this is the duck fruit punch I mean it's basically just a regular fruit punch with [Music] nice shot a big glass oh there we got some of that makes it look so pretty oh yeah oh that's nice stuff it says 30-minute activation time on here so we're about to get really good but that's the the one thing I guess I like about drinks if it's a [ __ ] quicker sometimes you'll eat an edible and then you have to wait an hour so some people find themselves just roast involves doing dabs and they're like I don't know if I got high from the animals I just put up like my smokes tomorrow but with these you just enjoy a nice drink and then a little bit later it feels pretty good let's we're gonna keep sippin that one I just want to pour this other one here and take a look and there's a there's even more drinks that I didn't have actually just thought about these sunglasses that I have are keep cola sunglasses and keep call it makes a lot of sodas obviously and I don't drink soda I haven't had a soda in several years it's just something I've decided to try one day hey hey let me see if I can go you know a week or so without drinking soda and then it's just like several years later I'm just like yeah I just I never want to soda let's take a sip of this and see if we like it well I guess I already took that out of it you know but this is this is the this is the stuff right here the watermelon is so good like picture your favorite watermelon candy for a second it tastes like that it's [ __ ] good [ __ ] jeez the sentence atiba like I said there's more liquid for the amount of tissue they both have 200 milligrams but there's twice as much liquid recycle sativa bottle but it's tasty who's feeling a Bhangra playing I'm asking like like you can tell me right now maybe drop a comment if you're feeling a bomber up right now leave a comment let me know let me know if you've ever had a PhD drink are you [ __ ] kidding me oh my gosh I didn't bring a lighter I brought every [ __ ] thing on the damn plane of that one Oh got one gosh alright let's just ripped it just rip this and then we're gonna have some fun with the mixers [Music] buddy let's do another [Music] Oh boom [Music] but massive blueberry into the water will make a blueberry water lightning fast absorption it chooses lightning fast absorption on here it's like not syrupy thick but it definitely it definitely made a Duggar Oh oh that's not bad it's still really sweet [Music] well there i weirdly want to mix the fruit punch into the fruit punch like I don't know why it definitely changed the Flair back that gets better I think the other flavor hit a little weird [Music] very very little - it's interesting for me to think that I have an option of getting high not drinking juice like think about you drink a gator right above your high or some [ __ ] like that you know what I mean I'm literally drinking juice with some THC in it and I'm pretty high it's way less harsh than smoking if you [ __ ] think about it think about ripping a bunch of bombs right now all that buckets of all that combustion ruining you I mean you're gonna get pretty blasted by like rather just sucking sips I'm some watermelon [Music] [Music] I feel like because of sipping it slowly me not super slow it's really tasty because I've been drinking it over the span of a little bit while making this video this is gonna happen nice for ramping effect on my high later like ah here you go ah here you got me before a inedible and then like I waited an hour and I didn't feel anything and then I got highlights and 15 minutes later and then I got really high like an hour later they tell you you could you know drink the bottle intense 20 doses or whatever but if I drink a tenth of that bottle and I don't think I'm gonna feel anything I don't know hi I'm a daily or nightly Dever device which stream at which TV / Cupid I might be live right now if you watch that next time look like so - just pop over right now and just say what's up half the to be the next person but I'm a daily never so I think there's so many they consume cannabis or THC and a concentrated form you might have a weird hollering swith edibles I've talked to a lot of people that say this and some people speak about having a different tolerance I don't know it kind of berries for everybody but for me and I know I need at least a few hundred milligrams to start the village so for me I'm probably gonna drink all these I think it's like 600 milligrams here total took two drinks for 200 in the two blasts or a hundred so that yeah at 600 I'll probably get a nice-lookin I'll probably get a nice hype at this and I'll probably just start screamin around so definitely go watch the put somebody

actually is a thc product um this is the first time that i've actually tried this product itself um so we're just gonna go ahead and just start jump right into it quite honestly i've already took the initiative and took the top off of this but um the brand is pretty much called keith uh i really don't know much about them it's apparently a mocktail garbage cannabis infused with lemonade um again this is the first time that i'm ever going to try this this cost me about like 20-26 dollars um yeah so there goes that and it goes for like 200 milligrams uh thc so without any further ado let's go ahead and just dive into it and see if it's actually i'm excuse my language if it's even worth the uh 30 you know for a drink anyways i don't know how i feel about it i don't know if it needs more sugar because i expect lemonade to be sweet this is not really as sweet and it has a weird taste to it but either way i mean i can taste the marijuana in it or the flour whatever you want to call it to be quite honest with you but all in all taste wise out of 1 to 10 per taste i would have to give it a 6. it could be way better it could be way way better but all in all i mean still drinkable but um i don't know the thick like how it's gonna affect me in about 30 minutes i would say about 15 30 minutes around that time frame so i'll update you guys as soon as you know that what whatever i'll be right back what's up you guys i'm back okay so after it's been about 30 um what time is it it's been about 15 minutes um i'm starting to actually feel it i feel good um it's not making me freak out or anything so i really enjoy this product though excuse me the only thing that i don't like is the fact that the taste the taste is disgusting you guys i can't really handle the taste but um it tastes kind of not bitter i wouldn't say better but kind of like let me try it one more time i don't know you guys i just plain i guess you can say but either way you guys it does the job and i'm not

show that might be true I don't know there might be somebody else doing it but we definitely have the most videos so take that whether what you will today guys we are taking our look at our final look at cannabis quencher at least for now we are gonna take a look at their 200 milligram old-fashioned lemonade here from cannabis quencher this is I believe the fourth maybe the fifth review we've done from them I've loved all of their products I'm gonna go and take a rest after this one if this one's great we know that cannabis quencher is a-okay and we can stick with them if they release new products in the future we might take a look at them but this will be our last look at cannabis quencher and so guys this is your first time tuning in two weeks the way our reviews work is I'm gonna drink this bad boy some bit of it in front of you let you know how it tastes I'll be sure to drink it all over the next few minutes and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours to let you actually

this vegan gluten free product ooh-la-la we've got the gondolier on the back again I still have no idea what the gondolier has to do with cannabis glacier pieces life like most drinks these days is just too complicated take a trip back into simpler times with our old-style lemonade I intend to shake well let's go back to older simpler and more high times lemonade lemonade lemonade weed weed weed

let you know how we're feeling thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I had the cannabis quencher 200 milligram lemonade and I am more than happy to tell you it's just as good as all the other cannabis quenchers all the flavors uniformly excellent do not hesitate to grab cannabis quencher if you're not afraid of trying a drink at a dispensary near you I think they're great they're a little bit pricier than the confectionaries but but they are good for a nice change of pace and they're not quite as filling as the sort of confectionaries like the brownies and cookies as well so I like them as a good alternative here and there and the cannabis quencher is the sort of drink that I now go for when I would like a bowl that excuse me a drinkable I'm gonna go with cannabis quencher so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on the next review peace I'm not gonna throw this at the camera I'm just gonna do that hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "Q1tHFHQVDrY": "[Music] my name is Willie Christie and we're here at the pottery in Los Angeles today we're going to talk about cannabis sublinguals people like tinctures if they don't like to smoke anything if they prefer faster method of ingestion or faster activation compared to edibles and it's more direct than say a topical or anything like that it's still getting into your bloodstream and it's still you know if you're taking active THC it's gonna get into your bloodstream as an active cannabinoid a team shirts are good for places where you can't smoke maybe you can't even be seen smoking something just discrete easy to use one you would just take your dose is worth you know whether that's a drop or a full dropper full and you just put it you know open the dropper put it under your tongue and let it rest under your tongue for about 15 seconds it usually takes about 15 to 40 minutes to feel the effects but it could take up to two hours so don't double down until those two hours have passed so the first one I want to talk about is the love potion number seven from Humboldt apothecary this is just a strictly THC tincture technically a sublingual it's in MCT oil and it's got it also has damiana cinnamon kava kava I guess to get the blood pumping if you will considering this one's called love potion number seven that sounds good and then next I've got a CBD sublingual from prana this one there p5 is a non psychoactive or non intoxicating CBD only tincture and this one's got 400 milligrams CBD in it and nothing else besides ACDC terpenes which is your CBD strain so it's CBD flour whole plant cannabis derived terpenes and CBD but there is no trace THC in this this is just pure CBD in terms of cannabinoids this one is a normal eye dropper I just don't have it is childproof on the outside so I can't quite take it out to show you but rest assured it's gonna look like your typical eyedropper it's gonna look like an eye dropper but you in your mouth so the next one I've got a high CBD meta haze tincture from chemistry so this one is interesting because it has CBD a in it CBD a is the raw form of CBD so it still has an extra oxygen molecule but in this case we've got both it's got CBD and CBD a as well as THC and THC a so this is a really nice combination of the raw cannabinoids as well as active cannabinoids you will experience a little bit of psycho activity due to the THC the high CBD should help with any anxiety or paranoia again if you're not comfortable with THC this one's probably not for you if you are comfortable th see this would be a really great awake painkiller or anxiety reliever now we've got a 1 to 1 tincture that's THC to CBD strictly coconut oil cannabis oil nothing more nothing less in a 1 to 1 ratio which is the you know the optimum healing ratio it is going to be psychoactive but it's also going to be very effective for pain relief maybe help you sleep at night as well but this one will definitely have some psychoactive effect so up next we've got something from one of my favorite brands poppin barclays right ratio pack this is a new thing from them you've got a 30 to 1 CBD the THC tincture and a one to thirty th see the CBD tincture essentially what they want you to do with this is create your own ratios they're giving you the full CBD one with trace THC and the full THC one with trace CBD that way you can make your own ratios you can do a four to one or essentially they're giving you the power to find out what works best for you it's a really good product for somebody who wants to experiment maybe try a little bit more THC than they're used to or a little more CBD to see what that does so all in all I like to think that sublinguals and tinctures as opposed to something like a pill or a vape pen stays true to the spirit of cannabis and that sort of holistic natural wellness side of things where you know you'll take a team cheer for it as opposed to taking a pill or a battery vape pen or something it's a very natural way of dealing with things [Music]", "n9TVKkdAUuo": "hello everybody this is Josh Heinrichs and I'm back with another ganja video for you another edible video this is a thousand milligrams of the dad's elixir look at that boom it says warning this [ __ ] is strongest [ __ ] those who dare drink this shall enter this Shadow Realm I've actually already drinkin a bunch of these back in the day but they sent me some more for me to try it out on camera and show everybody if you see me before I did a video one time actually I've done a couple videos but one at one of the videos I did I ate 1500 milligrams of edibles on my last tour when I was playing music and that video did good but everybody in the comments that a the edibles weren't real because it was 1500 milligrams that didn't really affect me but I just have a huge tolerance I have a very high tolerance I smoked all day every day a DAB all day every day and edibles have never really affected me I've done edibles my whole life and they've never really gotten me these on the other hand I did these after my show in February and I did a bottle and I have 1500 milligrams or 1500 and they got me so but I didn't record it so this time I'm gonna record it and see what happens to show you also this is a thousand and a thousand and yeah so we'll see what happens also last time people I don't know what's up with my highs I don't know if I just have naturally dilated eyes or something but people would thought I was on drugs or something and that's why the edibles weren't working for men do drugs people I smoke weed that's it anyways I'm a reggae artist man reggae is against drugs don't you know that so here we go I shook him up real good dad's elixir here 1000 milligrams boom this was a month 1000 milligrams - you can get these at their website or dad's elixir on Instagram just hit them up if you live in a legal state and yeah here we go here's 1000 now I know people use this as like scissor you know to like put with like a sprite or something and that might have been a little bit better because that was really thick who that's what she said anyway so here's another we're gonna do mm and I'll check back like every hour every couple hours and let you know how I'm feeling how I'm doing people also said on my last video will he smoke in the whole time so he can't get high that's not true also people have crazy comments on here about these things people were like his eyes are red you don't your eyes don't get red when you do that opposed yeah your eyes get revenue do edibles trust me you get stoned no matter what there's so many crazy things people saying you can't smoke you won't get high if the edibles that's not true you'll get high no matter what you get a person that has never done weed and you give him 2000 milligrams of edibles and let him smoke or not smoke there every high no matter what there we go alright there's 2000 milligrams dad's elixir holy crap play a little tune for you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it's been about ten minutes and I can already feel it there we go okay reporting back it's 11 a.m. now and I took the two thousand milligrams at 9:30 a.m. and is this probably the best edibles or drink or you know non-smoking way of ingesting ganja that I've ever done I took that back one time I did I played it this place in Las Vegas wing King Las Vegas is what it's called big up winking oh my gosh okay so let's just talk about vag elixir for a second 2000 milligrams I just did it I'm feeling ripped my eyes damn red yeah you can see it people thought on my last video that I was doing other things besides ganja and I don't do any other things I'm just doing ganja so I don't know if my eyes look weird I have no I have no control over my eyes sorry dudes anyways mm-hmm this is I'm I'm feeling extremely rip edge but my whole point of this story is one time in Las Vegas like a couple two or three years ago me and scones I played there and winking and they have everything Las Vegas is legal and so you can get all your food infused and we're homies with the owner and so the owner was like how do how do you guys want your meals you want it like fully prepped or you know half prepped what do you want you know with infuses weed and I was like dude I love weed do me have holy cannoli he gave me like my whole like I'm a vegetarian you can't tell Big Boi but still I had like spaghetti with like marinara he put it in the marinara I had like a salad with the salad dressing he put it in the salad dressing I had tea unsweetened tea he put it in the tea somehow he gave me like did everything like a dessert it was in the desert and he like made it as strong as possible anyways whoa I was whoa net dudes like an hour later we had to play like three hours later and an hour later me and Skelly I looked at him and I was like dude oh my hands were shaking and I was like what did you put in that and he's like it's just weed and I was like oh my god I was like dude I was scared I wasn't gonna be able to play music but a couple hours later it really set in and the time came where we had to go on stage and I always go first in there say if you know my set I played the first half and then skill like Jones me halfway through but uh as soon as I went on stage we went to the first of the band started and the first song started playing I knew I was okay because I I could start singing and everything was okay but I could feel like I was gonna be okay but when skille came on it's a different story his so high and he freaking started if we started into the first song and it comes up is like a dance hall part you know when I go like a boom boom boom boom boom boom and he starts to do his part and he just sits down like right in the middle of it right in the middle of the stage like it in front of the whole big crowd yeah we're like what's going on I look at him I'm like is he okay and he just like sits down and I was like and then the song like finishes and anything I walked over like girl bro do you want it into the show are you okay you needed me to just end it right now and it was like no I was just gonna like sit down and then like jump up like dynamically and make it like a big comeback in the middle of the song is so I just couldn't get back ah so there you go there's a little weed story for you I know I'm making this video extremely long but I feel like that was a good story for you so love you skille I miss playing shows and that's probably the highest that both of us have ever been they got bling King and that was edibles too even though I said I don't really get high from edibles that was the highest I've ever been in my entire life I felt like I was tripping on mushrooms almost so I was just like I remember my hands were shaking my legs were shaking I had to stand up and like just keep walking around if I sat down I would like sink into the whatever I was sitting in I was like oh my god this is weed like damn that's extreme weed but uh so now I see you have people that don't really smoke feel when they do smoke too much you know so you know it's all about your tolerance um what you can handle so this is where we're at we're trying 2,000 milligrams and it is getting me and look at me I'm talking my brains out anyways alright we'll report back later this is 11:00 a.m. you it's as well 30 and it's 12:30 and I am feeling super Irie oh yeah I've had a couple little laugh attacks about things and I told my wife that I haven't felt this way for a while so this is awesome yeah doing good I was gonna go somewhere with her but apparently I look too high so I'm gonna stay at home and I don't want to put eye drops in because people have left comments like that and saying when you put eyedrops in you lose the high which is not true but mentally sometimes I feel like that is true just kind of kill the experience but I know it's not true it's in your blood here obviously ripped but um yeah anyways I'll report back it's 12:30 right now feeling good whoa this is crazy strong and I just told my wife but I do not suggest this for anybody that is not a pro you know it doesn't mean it medically just this is just trying it out oh my god I'm ripped all right but I'm having fun so it's not too much too much but whoa if you didn't know what you're doing no I'm not tired I want to go outside and go enjoy the weather I told her I feel like I'm gonna be one with nature but it's raining but we have a cool deck but I'll check it out here saying got a TV yeah yeah nice beautiful bag but it's raining [Music] I'm enjoying the squirrel and the birds right here check it out we built a little thing of free right there for the squirrels and birds and all the birdseed so it's pretty cool device I can watch it under my little thing I'm doing good feeling good this is 2,000 milligrams I think the food has really helped me calm down a little bit also yes I did eat this morning when I took the two thousand milligrams people say you got to eat and that's how the effects come obviously the effects game but I ate him on a empty stomach but immediately afterwards they're so syrupy I since I didn't mix it a sprite or anything I ate two pieces of toast with avocado and that was pretty good so that helped me drink a couple cups of water and now I'm eating this pasta having a beer all right we went ran the errands I got to go that wasn't too high looking to put somebody's in it but holy cannoli this is some good good stuff and I've enjoyed my day totally immensely felt more connected with nature more I get a little cry looking at all the nature but we've been in quarantine so long it's not like full-on crying it just made me tear up a little bit looking at all their beautiful stuff anyways this suite is powerful it's 2,000 milligrams baby Hey enjoy yourself cosmic too sometimes dude I'm Tony this [ __ ] makes you feel like you're tripping a little bit micro dosing a little bit it's pretty dope but that's 2,000 milligrams - like I said this is this would probably kill a small horse anyways cool well report back later but my eyes aren't red anymore I don't think no they're good also I'm not driving as you can see my wife was driving in the last video where I did the 1500 milligrams people were like dude I can't believe he's driving I don't know why it looks like I'm driving I'm making these videos I couldn't does the way I'm driving but I'm not driving I'm never driving in the last video where I'm on tour and I'm playing music my homie Wayne always drives for me and that's all the driving so pick up Wayne love you bro so I'm not driving and today of course but I am responsible oh my and all of this experiment was that dad's elixir is insanely good works amazing the 1500 I did before people might have been right it might have not been as strong as it was said on the box so be careful what you buy and get from the stores because it might not be as strong as it says it is but the dad's elixir that's definitely as strong as I said it is because 2,000 mg s got me yesterday I was laughing enjoy nature like I was micro dosing so this is good stuff", "nMsAeMXsZBo": "[Music] well I had a duty folks and welcome to wait to the marijuana animal review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another new product we doing a lot of new brands in products recently which I love gotta love that diversity today we are looking at another syrup or what they call an elixir we are taking a look at the chronic elixir in this fancy bottle I quite like their packaging nice glass bottle I like their branding like the whole thing chronic elixir 375 milligrams of THC in this tiny little 20 milliliter bottle 30 milliliter bottle I think so tiny little bottle to it they claim 375 milligrams of THC I hope that to be the case if that is in fact the case this is gonna be a great deal I believe this only cost me $15 maybe perhaps it was 20 I actually cannot remember which is a shame for sure it was 15 or 20 dollars I'm sorry I cannot remember the price off the top of my head either way it's gonna be a good deal if it's $15 it's an outrageously great deal at the dispensary I picked it up so let's hope for that and let's go ahead and open it up and just give it give a taste now I'm not gonna mix this one with anything for the first time we'll see how it goes and then if we like it we'll come back and review some more and new it with some mixing try to find a better way to to ingest it so ok here we go and if you guys have never tuned in two weeks before the way that our reviews work here is I'm gonna drink this up drink this whole product over the next couple of minutes finish it off sometime in the next few minutes and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm actually feeling because that's what you guys really care about in the edible review not really how it tastes but how [ __ ] up it gets you so I'll come back to you guys in two hours but of course it'll be just a couple of seconds for you through the magic of editing so let's shake well as suggested almost forgot that part okay we are well shook little cap on the top comes off this is the watermelon flavor and it smells of watermelon or watermelon flavored things I have no idea what to expect I assume it's not going to be good but we'll do it anyways down the hatch oh wow yeah ooh that is strong that is very strong strong cannabis tastes strong watermelon syrupy taste strong everything I mean it's not that much different than like the cannabis syrup taste you know what this is gonna taste like guys it's not gonna taste great I mean obviously it's not gonna taste great but it's this is not let's give it another sip I've had worse I've had worse it's still not good alright guys almost done here I'm gonna finish this off you can see I just got a little bit left in the bottle I'm gonna finish it off and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching weights see you soon peace [Music] hi guys welcome back two weeks it's been two hours since I last checked in with you that's the two-hour mark since I had the product elixir watermelon 375 milligrams and I gotta say it is definitely not a 375 milligrams product and I find syrups to usually be quite potent for their milligram age this is less potent than say like a the cannabis 200 milligram edibles substantially so those cannabis edibles can get me up to like a set this 200 milligrams came up to like a seven and a half eight maybe eight and a half sometimes and I would say I'm maybe at a four to five range right now with this may be lower so yeah it's it is not living up to to the other syrups and things that I have tried is not as good not nearly as good the price was right for it or the price was right if it were 375 milligrams or even if it were 200 actual milligrams the price would been good at $15 but for what I feel for the price does not feel it's not it's not quite up to snuff I'm afraid so this is not a first good experience with chronic elixir I will maybe try to review some other products in the future to see if maybe this one was just an inconsistent thing but right now not not the best first impression that is the chronic elixir 375 milligram watermelon getting a thumbs down for me thank you so much for watching wheat skies and we will check you out on the later review peace", "lK2pxyo3R8Y": "hi there I'm Mandy Lee the host of try this and try this is an educational show that is all about cannabis and cannabis products every Thursday we share with you how to videos and product reviews and much more to ultimately help you get the most value from our favorite plant and today we have for you for tips on how you can get the most value from cannabis tinctures so let's get to it let's dive in and let's try this now tinctures are extracted cannabinoids which are mixed into either an alcohol glycerin or coconut oil solution and they're ideal for people who are using cannabis for medicinal reasons or for people who are new to cannabis as well there's a few reasons for this one is that they're administered via a syringe so you're able to easily and accurately dose yourself in really small increments because you can basically count each drop as you administer it also the tinctures come in many non psychoactive options and they also carry little to no smell and involve no vapor or smoke now the most popular and beneficial way of taking them is sublingually so the solution is absorbed in the body through the oral mucus all and to do this you use a dropper and you place the cannabis solution right underneath your tongue you hold it there for about a minute before swallowing and then you will feel the effects typically in about fifteen to thirty minutes and the last you for about three to four hours this way of administering it the cannabinoids and the terpenes they're absorbed through the tissue lining into your bloodstream so this increases the bioavailability of the cannabinoids so if this is the method that you're interested in then here are four tips for you on how you can get the most value from cannabis tinctures now number one is specific cannabinoid options so when it comes to tinctures many people don't realize that there are many options pass the sativa indica and hybrid options that they're used to tinctures can be made with specific cannabinoids and some with different ratios of one two one three two one or twenty two one of a combination of cannabinoids to meet different patient's needs because each cannabinoid is known for helping to treat different symptoms and ailments and can cause different effects so you can find teachers that are in THC which is psychoactive CBD which is non psychoactive THC and CBD a which is the acid form of THC and CBD before it's exposed to heat and both of these are they're fairly new cannabinoids to be offered and studied their non psycho active but there are astounding results that have been discovered with patients who are using these cannabinoids for an assortment of different reasons number two is using whole plant tinctures from flower so here at green flower we tend to favor whole plant tinctures from flower as opposed to trim now the flowers are just the most cannabinoids and terpenoids aplan whereas the trim it doesn't have as many terpenes and it mostly has the cannabinoid THC in it so these types of tinctures they'll give you the fullest entourage effect from cannabis and provide you with the widest range of terpenes now the cannabinoids and terpenoids resides and with some trim only tinctures you just lose quite a bit of the medicinal value from this lack of a rich terpene profile so when entourage effect is present in many of these flower rich tinctures what happens is you have multiple cannabinoids and chirping that are present and they work together to enhance the medicinal value of each of their individual properties now number three is choosing alcohol extractions so we also tend to favor tinctures that are made from an alcohol extraction process since this process it's just the gentlest on the plant and so it keeps the terpenes more intact because some extraction processes they strip the terpenes from the cannabis and other ones like co2 break apart the bonds between the cannabis and the terpenes and then they reintroduce the terpenes then ultimately what we've seen is that when you keep the terpenes completely intact with the cannabis that's when you'll see the best benefits and the terpenes make the benefits of the cannabinoids even more effective in your system and they carry a bunch of medicinal value themselves as well now Alison Attell from treat well which is a leading cannabis tincture company here in California she said that with alcohol extractions she's seen that with her clients and patients that they're not building up a tolerance to the cannabis so they're able to use less cannabis to achieve the exact results that they need which is a really big plus number four is choose products with testing and proper labels so when you're purchasing tinctures there are a few that you want to make sure to look for and to favor you want to make sure that the bottle itself says how many total milligrams of THC and other cannabinoids are also present in it as well as how many milligrams are in each dropper otherwise you're not going to be able to accurately and safely dose yourself and then we also recommend checking the company's website before purchasing to make sure that the cannabis teacher that you're purchasing has been lab tested for things like molds and pesticides and consistency potency and residual solvent now if you are interested in learning even more about tinctures and all the different ways that you can use them to help enhance your life and to treat different ailments and symptoms that I

a request last video to show how amnesia works on distributed systems and that's a lot to cover in five minutes I tried to make this channel brief insights of elixir in five minutes but you know what I thought I'd show a little bit about amnesia that I do know and and show how it's kind of cool and we're gonna set up a multi node system right here in the shell so let's get started so Nisha is an overlying module you can run it across multiple servers and you can decide to save down to your core post Christy be later or you know whatever we do a lot with it at a my current job so I'm gonna start up a like basically two nodes two servers fake servers here using just ie X right so I can pass in this s name and defined the name of my shell that we're going to create and I will I think I need to use localhost in order for this to work I haven't tried not doing well I've tried actually not not using localhost and I think it had problems connecting so we're gonna create one on top one on bottom and so now now when we can look at node itself I think yeah or you can just simply say node and there we have our named IX shell so you know you can imagine these are two servers you know two database or two connections or whatever on them multiple nodes out there on G cloud or AWS or what have you hmm so let's go ahead and alias you can see I've done a little bit of work here I'm gonna alias amnesia so you a liasing this erlang module as amnesia just to make it a little bit easier to write and what's sweet about some of this it's already been now there's not documentation on all these things but at least you can kind of quickly see what what functions you have and you can at least see the type of arguments they take so that's pretty cool so to get started and I'm actually kind of just following a lick sir school which I'll link to in this video but you know I think it's really helpful I also found another article that I'll link to for anybody getting started with amnesia so I'm going to create a schema of nodes and I'm going to use the node I'm on and I'm also gonna connect to this node down here below right so node 2 and you know if this works pass in inode list node 1 local host already exists okay let's just make sure that I'm like connected to these guys so that should loops true and I should be able to connect to this other node down here connect 9 and localhost I might have like not okay so so that's good so we have our nodes connected and I believe in these just talking to both I'm going to start amnesia in both of these projects and let's go ahead and add a table so you can create a you know a table like any other sequel database table or any kind of data table you do it like so this is again just straight out of elixir school documentation but you get the idea so this will be our person table I already created it well let's add let's add games since I work at a gaming company and the game has an ID and a name and I don't know I guess it's got the same things so if I did this right we should be able to write to that same table now I'm gonna do it in a show you the dirty way first I guess they like to do transactions since you're dealing with distributed systems that make sense so we'll dirty write to this game table that we just made we'll pass in an ID and I don't know what I've been playing lately days gone if you like zombie games it's pretty good so look at that in a different system we wrote to our database if we're over back here on this node we should be able to read from that data table data table dirty read from that table and there you go oh no if you're going to really get into using amnesia you shouldn't really use the dirty read and dirty write what you should be doing is more of a transactional approach so you basically you have a wrapper function that's going to write to your database and I believe I haven't added people to this yet so you know you can do something like this or you might write several times person three and now you have your function and you would call an amnesia transaction to go ahead and execute that that's not know completing there we go and what do we call that data and now it's written to that so we can check it with dirty read you could also do a transaction around a read function but just for brevity we'll do this and what do we say person - whoops so we've got our Jane who did I add before the video nobody oh yeah okay so and of course like if we did this correctly this should exist over here on this node and so we can dirty read into that same attribute come on type and there you have it so that's an eejit across multiple nodes now of course it's I'm not showing you all the set up of DB stuff and Postgres and whatnot but I will link to some articles about amnesia and you know it's not that much different like you know in your config settings you have your databases and you you basically you have your node list and you pass that in as you set up your database as you spin up your app and you know if people really want that maybe I'll dig into that but that's more configuration than actually like using elixir code so anyhow that's well over five minutes hope you enjoyed the video thanks for watching", "_pg1lPaeQaA": "in your words tell me about the very basic difference of ingesting marijuana via and edible versus smoking or vaporizing it sure so so the first thing is your body deals with cannabis very differently when it's ingested it if you're eating something it's actually processed by the GI tract and processed by the liver it changes from Delta 9 THC to hydroxy 11 which is more potent and the biggest thing is that takes time right we when we drink wine with a meal we don't get drunk like that right we let it kind of prickly and enjoy the experience so edibles are very similar when consumed there's other uptake or delivery systems right your oral mucosa is a very efficient delivery system our mints for example are dissolved in the mouth or tinctures right go under the tongue those are quicker one of the hardest things about edibles is the delay and getting consumers to understand that you have to be patient we are not a patient people so there is a learning curve there right education we have to talk about it we have to talk to tourists we have to be able to have a dialogue and not be afraid to ask questions especially because if we do have history with marijuana maybe smoking marijuana it's kind of an instant gratification thing we know if we're at a six or even an eighth about five minutes in edibles it can be anywhere from what an hour maybe sometimes more than two yeah so the the state language is this will this product may be delayed by two or more hours what we see is depending on the product type really you're looking at 30 minutes to an hour and a half depending on a lot of things right are you eating an edible and then putting a meal right on top of that that will get the THC into your system much faster than if you eat a meal and then take something that is a slower process the state changed some of its regulations regarding labeling just earlier this year on February 1st and and and part of that was being more explicit about this could take more than two hours but I know before you guys were before that regulation took place the Dixie had some really creative activation illustration on the back of its products and and I'm wondering have you guys tweaked those since the states regulations have kind of caught up with you guys on that level yeah you know we always continue to tweak those as we get feedback on on how long products are taking to affect someone we will adjust our barometer right it's a strength time scale and one of the things we believe really strongly is we can have a whole paragraph of warnings that no one's going to read or we can make a visual icon that someone's going to see and get information from quicker so when we say that a serving size is 7 milligrams or 10 milligrams and we'll take 60 minutes that is a easier way for a consumer to understand faster what they need to do and and everything we do on our labels as much as possible is to get consumers to understand how to take that product and how to dose that product", "AaX6sMvQvKU": "and trip what kind of products are you going to sell aside from just the old roll and smoke them if you got them good evening geraldo we um dixie elixirs and edibles is a manufacturer of infused products uh primarily the aspect being thc providing euphoria to both patients here in the state of colorado and hopefully uh elsewhere they're not too distant did you bring any displays i did i did indeed i have a small display of uh some of our various products which would include medicated elixirs uh 12 ounce medicated elixir would provide the equivalent of 40 milligrams of thc to a consumer or to our patient we also have sublinguals which are under the tongue uh glycerin-based tinctures and then most recently later this earlier this month we uh launched a mint a medicated mint which is very socially acceptable so we're very excited about what the opportunity so you have these products so you can get stone without smoking you just put a little thing in your like a mint as you say and and it has the thc and you get loaded right well uh we do focus on products that provide a euphoric aspect or a psychoactive aspects of uh a medical cannabis obviously in the next month or so we'll be focusing more on consumer related products but uh that is correct all of our products do provide generally a state of euphoria to a patient state of euphoria to a patient uh vivian uh so are you afraid the feds might not pay attention", "OnHREYntpZE": "many patients don't realize how difficult constipation and stomach upset will be when they first start taking iron supplements you may need iron to treat anemia which will improve your thinking energy and boost immunity but very quickly your stomach feels like it is killing you today i will teach you how to get relief from the side effects of iron supplements hey guys my name is dr sam now iron is pretty rough on our gut and it's extremely common for people to get constipation nausea indigestion gas and bloating unfortunately the cause of these side effects is the iron itself not any of the added ingredients so what can you do try it with vitamin c rich fruit or fruit juice you want the best bang for your buck when it comes to iron absorption as iron is absorbed best on an empty stomach so one hour before food or two hours after food however if this is just not working for you try taking the supplement with citrus fruit like an orange or mandarin kiwi fruit blackcurrant strawberries raspberries or try orange juice and fruit juices with added vitamin c ascorbic acid or vitamin c has been proven to help the body absorb up to four times more iron this step may help with side effects like constipation and nausea avoid foods that reduce iron absorption on the flip side of this coin you should avoid foods that reduce iron absorption for one hour before or two hours after taking a supplement dairy products tea coffee wine calcium supplements and antacids are all known culprits that can undo your good work switch types of supplement you need about 100 to 200 milligrams of elemental iron a day to build up your iron stores when it comes to getting enough elemental iron not all supplements are equal if you take 300 milligrams of ferrous sulfate you'll get 60 milligrams of iron within each dose if you take 300 milligrams of ferrous gluconate you'll only have 34 milligrams of iron in each dose ferrous gluconate will give you less side effects but the trade-off is that it replaces your iron more slowly slow release or sustained release supplements slow release forms of iron supplements tend to cause less side effects but they have their drawbacks you absorb iron best in the first part of your intestine which is called the duodenum a slow release iron supplement can travel past this area before releasing iron so that you don't ever have a chance to absorb it the other problem is that they tend to be more expensive than other types of iron halve the dose when it comes to having no iron or having some i will always compromise if it makes it easier for my patients by having less iron it will cause you less side effects one unconventional solution is to ask your doctor for a liquid form of iron you can then experiment by gradually lowering your dose until you get to a level that does not cause you symptoms then once your body gets used to the iron you can slowly increase the dose up again liquid iron can sometimes stain your teeth though so try drinking it through a straw to reduce this split the dose another really simple solution is to halve the dose and take half a tablet in the morning and the other half in the evening or you can take the supplement every other day again if you are having less iron it will cause your gut less side effects please be aware that sustained release preparations should not be halved iv iron infusion if you have tried iron supplements for three months and you clearly cannot tolerate them because of the side effects have a chat to your doctor about whether it's safe for you to have an iv iron infusion now bear in mind that an iron infusion isn't a total picnic either in terms of side effects but it may be the lesser of two evils in my home city a medicine called ferric carboxymaltose or fear inject is the common treatment given as an intravenous infusion a blood test is checked about six to twelve weeks after the treatment is completed to see if you need another infusion are there any other side effects that you should worry about the most common side effect by none is which can frighten you so much is to get dark colored bowel motions or black stools when you first start taking iron this isn't harmful although it may disturb you the first time you see this please give this video a like if you enjoyed it hit the subscribe button for new videos every single week and hit the bell to get

determine which products at your dispensary behind that big glass case are worth your hard-earned dollars so today we are looking at another product from cannabis quencher I have found them to be worth your hard-earned dollars so far we're looking on another one of their your 200 milligrams their passion fruit today this will be I think the 4th cannabis quencher I have reviewed so far I have enjoyed them all immensely so first things first says shake well we shall do that cooking well now let's open her up and take a sip and if this is the first time you've tuned in to wheats the way our reviews work is I will drink this maybe not all of it in front of you but I promise you I will drink all of it next a little bit I just don't want to bore you to death and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that is the most important part of any edible or in this case drinkable review mmm that is passion fruity and then there's that weedy aftertaste just like all the others but certainly not bad certainly drinkable and hopefully I'm gonna get me quite high alright guys well thank you so much for watching wheats and we will check you out on the next review peace what drive change just shower but I'm back it's been two hours welcome back to weed skies and this might be the first time I have taken a shower this stone before and if you guys have never taken a shower while incredibly high I really recommend it it's really oh my god I had the Bluetooth speaker the warm water the whole thing oh my god it's just a wonderful experience all about to say the cannabis quencher passionfruit 200 and great love it I am quite high right now the taste again it's not not wonderful you've got to go through it's got a decent taste upfront but that again that's sort of really bitter weeding aftertaste that seems to be in all the drinks is present so you got to get through that but it's again you can you can suffer through it I promise and and the rewards at the end are well worth it it's a little pricey and I believe 20 dollars but I got it for discount at my dispensary so you know comes out to a little bit less but again highly highly recommend it that might be the last cannabis quencher review that I do just because it doesn't seem to be any more reason to review their products they seem to be uniformly great highly recommended all the way around so guys that I think that's gonna do it for this here review on wheats one last time highly recommend it if you've got a Bluetooth speaker and an edible go get really high and take a shower or a bath it'll be wonderful you'll love it I promise alright thank you so much for watching wheats guys we'll check you out on the next review peace I don't have the bottle can't throw it at you bye hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "5gtKMKD53Aw": "in this tutorial I'll show you how to calculate dosage using milligrams per kilograms per day sometimes you might get a dose that stated in the manufacturer's information as milligrams per kilograms per day this means we can calculate the patient's weight in kilograms multiply the recommended dose and take into account a number of times per day the dose is to be given the goal here is to determine how many milligrams can be given in each dose in case you're confused let's read the question an infant 15 months old and weighing 20 pounds needs streptomycin sulfate which is usually administered to adults as one gram or 1000 milligrams as a daily intramuscular injection determine the pediatric dosage if it is recommended to administer 20 milligrams per kilograms per day for a maximum of 1 gram of streptomycin sulfate notice the mismatch already the information provided by the box is in kilograms whereas this infant is in pounds so what we have to do is convert 20 pounds into kilograms now the conversion ratio for pounds to the kilograms is the following 2.2 pounds is equivalent to one kilogram as a result I can take 20 pounds and multiply it to one kilogram for every 2.2 pounds in other words I'm taking the amount of pounds and dividing it by 2.2 so let's go ahead and do that 20 divided by 2 point 2 gives us approximately 9 point zero 9 and I'll round this to one decimal place just for simplicity sake so there should be 9 point 1 kilograms now that we have this information the box tells us that we have to give 20 milligrams per 1 kilogram for one day now there isn't a 1 written here but there is a 1 and so is there a 1 over here so that's for 1 kilogram if the child was 1 kilogram then we can simply take 20 milligrams and give it to the child per day we would be fine like that instead what we have to do is take 20 milligrams per 1 kilogram and multiply it to the number that we found because by multiplying the to the number that we found this kg in this kg will cancel out leaving us with 20 times 9.1 using our calculator 20 times 9.1 gives us 182 milligrams per day so according to the milligram per kilogram per day the patient should be given 182 milligrams of streptomycin sulfate as a daily intramuscular injection in question number two if a patient weighs 180 pounds and an order is given for a dose stated as 20 milligrams per kilogram tid three times a day how much should the patient receive so this time we have 180 pounds we need to convert it into kilograms I'll take 180 pounds and multiply it to the exact same conversion ratio as before one kilogram per 2.2 pounds I'll use my calculator I'll take 180 divided by 2.2 and we end up with eighty one point eight one I'll round this to one decimal place as eighty one point eight eighty one point eight kilograms notice that these units cancel out mathematically leaving us with kilograms according to the medicine itself we have to administer twenty milligrams per 1 kilogram so I'll take now 20 milligrams per 1 kilogram I'm simply rewriting this number and multiply it by 81 point 8 kilograms and notice what happens that cancels out with that so I'll multiply the number that I have on my screen times 20 and I end up with approximately 1636 rounded to one decimal place 0.416 36.4 milligrams of this medicine for the whole day not three times a day because unlike in question number one where it was per day this one is three times per day so technically this number is being divided by three doses and if we divide this by three doses we actually end up with how much should be given for each dose which is five hundred and forty five point five five hundred forty five point five milligrams per every one dose and there you have it three examples on how to calculate dosage when given in milligrams per kilograms per day", "0_Q_zEW0hdk": "okay this pediatric question states the order is tylenol with codeine 12 milligrams every cue for our so every four hours as needed for a two-year-old weighing 28 pounds the dosage range says it's point five to one milligram per kilogram per dose every four to six hours how many milliliters would be given and is this a safe range so the order is the 12 milligrams every four hours and it says two-year-old weighing 28 pounds and we can convert 28 pounds by dividing by 2 point 2 and we get 12 point 7 kilograms it says that the dosage range is 0.5 to 1 milligram so 0.5 to 1 milligram per kilogram dose every 4 to 6 hours so that the time range is safe the 4 hours since its stated 4 hours so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the 12 point 7 kilograms and I'm going to multiply by the 0.5 and by the 1 so I can get my range in the milligrams per the patient's weight and then we're going to verify that it's within that 12 fits within that range so 0.5 milligrams per kilogram times the 12 point 7 equals 6.36 I'm just going to round it a 6.4 milligrams and then obviously the twelve point seven times one is just going to be twelve point seven and so the range here is six point four to twelve point seven and so since the order was twelve it's a safe dose it's in the range so you can administer that dose and then how many milliliters would you give well you would take the twelve the available is 12 milligrams per 5 milliliters so 12 milligrams per 5 ml and you really don't need to do any kind of math of this since 12 is the same number you would administer 5 mil which is also one teaspoon just in case I asked that so anyway so there's some light there so 5m I didn't know so hope that was helpful", "lBJT-1YagcU": "Oh friends welcome back to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are looking at another drink from cannabis quencher we're looking at their 200 milligram strawberry lemonade peace love cannabis if you saw my previous cannabis quencher review you know that I quite liked the product I thought it lasted a while I liked the taste and I like that it hits pretty quickly so let's take a look at the bottle a little bit more than we looked at the last one they've got some interesting things on it including this weird random piece of literature from a writing from the gondolier Strawberry Fields in cannabis fields equals are sweet and refreshing strawberry lemonade forever the gondolier I don't know who the gondolier is or why he's telling you that but thank you nonetheless we do have some ingredients on the back water sugar lemon juice o no H at the sea s no high fructose corn syrup we've got two servings 110 calories per serving through 220 calories in this small bottle of cannabis winter that's about enough preamble here what's let me shut up and take a sip so again this is the cannabis quencher strawberry lemonade variety from bcc brands apparently here we go quite dilemonade or quite the weed odor but that's okay cuz i remember the other one had a weed odor but not a weed taste refreshing as a strawberry lemonade taste and just like the other cannabis quencher the weed aftertaste is pretty strong but not insurmountable better than dozers for sure there's definitely a weed aftertaste but it will not affect your enjoyment too too much I don't think you might just want to have another drink on hand just if you really hate that taste disturbs help you wash it down but in terms of taste another way never from her went another winner from cannabis quencher really looking forward to finishing this one off and hoping it's just as potent as the pomegranate blueberry acai berry variety that we had the other day all right guys well I'm going to drain this bad boy over the next couple minutes and if you've never seen weeks before the way we do this is I'm gonna drink this bad boy off and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that is the most important part of any edible review so with that guys I will see you in two hours thank you so much for watching waits [Music] oh my god it is a beautiful day out here in Long Beach and it has been 2 hours guys and welcome back two weeks since I have had the cannabis quencher 200 milligram strawberry lemonade flavor and it is another winner for cannabis winter I am quite high right now feeling pretty great pretty wonderful it came on quickly just like the last one and I am feeling it I think still intensifying even these two hours later enjoy the taste it's not perfect it's not my first choice term even my hundredth choice for a strawberry lemonade but for a strawberry lemonade with a [ __ ] ton of marijuana in it tastes pretty good I would definitely definitely recommend it it is on the expensive side you do pay a premium for the fact that you are getting this through a liquid or a variety instead of just through a sort of like confectionery or a gummy but if you're willing to spend the premium and if you're looking for some novelty in your edible life I got to say the cannabis quencher worth the money so if you see in a dispensary near you go for it and with that guys that's gonna do it for this episode of wheats and we will check you out on the next review thank you so much for watching hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review

today I'm doing a really quick video on a new product I have in the shop which is called ultra CBD and ultra CVD is a product I'm really hot on right now reason being is that currently this bottle is the best value for your money in a one ounce CBD texture okay so most other manufacturers that are producing a CBD texture right now in a one ounce bottle usually contains 100 milligrams total in the whole bottle of CBD ultra CBD is a one ounce bottle that has twice the amount this actually has 200 of milligrams of CBD in it most other manufacturers sell their one ounce 100 milligram bottle for around $40 ultra cv/gate offers you this 200 milligram one ounce bottle for $45 so for five dollars more you're getting 100 more milligrams of CBD and another thing this right now in my opinion is the most delicious texture on the market I've sold every almost every single manufacturer of CBD texture and this one has a spearmint flavor that in my opinion rocks and it tastes just like a stick of Wrigley's spearmint gum other things they put here this has ginger extract in it and natural honey I believe let me see here yeah ginger natural honey and a spearmint extracts so yeah if you're looking for a low dose low milligrams CBD texture you don't have a lot of money to spend you have some minor ailments definitely pick up a bottle of ultra CBD because this stuff is the best bottle on the market for you know the best value on the market for a one ounce of CBD bottle so yeah definitely you can purchase this on my website WWF RMG's calm underneath the CBD elixir tab and I want to

thousand people attending here this place is packed with people it is did you expect this yes this is for the weekend warriors for the professional athletes anybody who really is just thirsty you know beverages don't have that cannabis taste that a lot of people think that they're going to get the drinks tastes delicious they work great and it's just a nice feeling how is it very good [Music] the size of the crowd says it all cannabis could be the next big frontier in the beverage world but it wasn't a natural fit every single one of these drinks is made with an ingredient that doesn't dissolve in water our first beverage you can turn it upside down and you'd see that cannabis go up and down THC drinks were a little bit like salad dressing so they had to be shaken and bottom didn't taste or smell that good it all comes back to a simple truth oil and water don't mix it's backbase it does not mix well once you add it to beverages though it starts out as the green plant we all recognize the cannabis we're talking about gets distilled into a thick oil that's nearly solid at room temperature it mixes well with the makings of chocolate which are also fat based so companies like Stillwater ingredients hired experts from the candy industry we've solved it before our eyes they pour these crystals into a glass of water and they appear to dissolve lipids cannot dissolve in water but you can do is coat them in a surfactant and then enable them to be water compatible Industrial sauna mechanics makes this contraption that sends sound waves through the cannabis oil to break it up into tiny particles then coat them with a slippery substance that stays suspended in water it's nanotechnology and it's the solution that's unlocked a whole new kind of adult beverage Keith

neighborhood bar our whole approaches and alcohol inspired type strategy so we've got ready to drink tonics stoned AZ which would be compared to a margarita they offered tastings here at the show of samples without cannabis oh yeah it is ice-cold there are cocktails and shots it smells very cinnamon it may be no surprise the industry's going after a specific customer those who are less experienced with cannabis but love trying new drinks craft beer consumers are perfect for cannabis drinks because they're into experimenting new beverages and though there is hemp beer and weed wine there's one thing you won't find drinks can have cannabis or they can have alcohol but they can't have both it's the ultimate irony stopping nausea was a major reason marijuana was first legalized for medical use because remember cannabis isn't only about getting high all right bring CBD into the sports world now legal in all 50 states hemp derived CBD is making his way into seemingly everything including this sports drink it really is calming it helps with pain inflammation Guardian taps into a whole other market for these drinks those looking to use cannabis for wellness so we wanted to go with the all organic no refined sugar they're going after the same crowd as eat green people come to cannabis to help them with their health I don't want to give someone diabetes while trying to help them come back eat Green makes cold-pressed juices in three different versions it's this the packaging right here the hemp drinks can be sold anywhere the first thing I smell is watermelon is there

industries in Colorado the makers of edibles they cannot keep up with the demand well one Colorado cannabis company Dixie elixirs is going big the now as Christians kuvira with a rare behind-the-scenes look at one of the biggest pot factories in Colorado step inside the industrial kitchen at Dixie elixirs and you have to admit it kind of reminds you of this yeah but this is Colorado's largest maker of marijuana infused products so you might not want to try this Joe Hoda's took me on a grand tour of their new headquarters located just north of Denver in commerce city probably almost quadrupled our size here the state-of-the-art facility is built with transparency in mind they can come and actually see what we're doing literally as we're doing it by looking through the windows but even with their open-air policies many people are still concerned these pot products pose dangers to consumers and look too much like candy for comfort my new rules and regs coming down the pipe rules like limiting the dose on each individual piece that limit will be capped at 10 milligrams per piece moving forward and making the packaging child resistant before the products ever hit the shelves a lot of stuff that edibles companies are gonna have to adapt the building is still under construction but Joe tells me they'll be celebrating their grand opening September 19 we're not fully moved in by then I got bigger problems to worry about it all right kristen is here with us down with kristin i mean my question is why are edible in such high demand well according to Dixie elixirs two reasons smoke has carcinogens so people want to stay away from that altogether and also marijuana users say that eating an edible is a completely different experience it takes longer to feel the effects but the effect is longer and some would argue better I know well like you mentioned this in your story and protecting the public from an overdose and and realizing how much marijuana you're getting that has to be that one priority yeah and they say that's moving forward and a lot of those pieces i showed you they were a little big these are going to have to be smaller something that you can break down I don't know like a kit kat bar and 10 milligrams of THC that's it that's it that's the most all right Kristen thanks a lot right now people in our state are sending out massive amounts of pot through the mail 493 pounds of marijuana was seized last year going from Colorado to other parts of the country that's up from just 57 pounds three years earlier I guess people think it's legal here so i can send it out legally to other places well that is not the case the top three destinations well florida maryland and illinois and right now as I said marijuana is still illegal in those states let's get", "FakuDQ4IXzQ": "In today's show, we're going over\ncurcumin. I'm Dr. Travis Zigler and I'm Dr. Jenna Zigler and in the next 10\nminutes you're going to learn what curcumin is what it's used for, potential side effects, \n and then we're going to answer some frequently asked questions that we \n received around curcumin but let's just jump right in and go over what is curcumin Curcumin is a yellowish colored pigment and a substance that's primarily found in turmeric Turmeric is a flowering plant that relates \n to the ginger family and it's best known as a spice that's used for the purpose of\ncooking curries and things like that Now, curcumin is a polyphenol which is a\nmicronutrient substance that's obtained through certain plant-based food and it\nhas anti-inflammatory properties along with the ability to enhance the number\nof antioxidants that the body produces It possesses certain importance in the\ncultures of traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicines and it's absolutely wonderful basically for \n its antioxidant properties It's often used as a daily\nsupplement for promoting a healthy inflammatory response in the body\nbecause it is such a great anti-inflammatory highly potent supplements can be \n produced by extracting curcumin and curcuminoid from turmeric. However, curcumin is absorbed poorly during digestion and\ntherefore it is essential to formulate it with other compounds in order to\nimprove its bio-availability for example black pepper is commonly\nincluded with curcumin in supplements that you'll find on the market. Now,\ncurcumin has grown particularly in the southern and southeastern parts of Asia\nand once the process of cultivation comes to an end the rhizome of the plant\nis sent to be processed to the form of turmeric and then 2 to 5 percent of curcumin can be \n extracted from the turmeric plant Let's jump into all the benefits of curcumin \n that's the reason you're here and the first benefit is for depression. In recent studies curcumin has been shown to possibly be\nbeneficial for those suffering from depression but again the research is\nlimited on this. Many trials have not been very successful in producing the\nexpected results in significant effects and this may have resulted from the lack\nplacebo groups. A placebo group is just simply a person that does not get the\nthe curcumin. Recently, a study was conducted on curcumin and depression.\nIt found that tumeric and curcumin were far more beneficial than the placebo when it\ncomes to reducing the symptoms of depression This study used a larger\nsample size and the duration of the study was 3 months. However, they\nfailed to determine whether a high dosage of curcumin was better than the\nlow doses and reducing the symptoms that can result in depression.\nNow, the next one we're going to talk about is curcumin for pain, arthritis, and\njoints in general for the past several years people in Asia have believed that\nturmeric or curcumin is a substance that has the potential ability to decrease\npain. People have been using it for inflammation, arthritis, and general\npaints and symptoms for centuries this potent substance has proven to be\nvery successful. Curcumin is involved in reducing a range of inflammatory signals\nand many of them are linked with arthritis and inflammatory joints.\nWhen dosage of curcumin is 200 mg per kg that means it's 4.6 to 8.3 percent more productive than many\nother vital ingredients of ginger in the elimination of inflammation affiliated\nwith cytokines circulating in those affected joints. It can be concluded\nthat curcumin is an herbal supplement that contains the potential ability to\ntreat arthritis and other joint problems However, as with most things there is\na vast need for more well structured randomized control trials to\nfind out if this curcumin formula can actually be proven to show that there is benefit The next benefit is curcumin for migraines.\nRecently, a study found that there was significant reduction in migraine attack\nfrequency with the use of curcumin This has been recorded in those who have \n been taking both curcumin supplements and omega-3 fatty acids together after\nseveral studies there's way less logical evidence available to support the intake\nof curcumin with the aim to prevent migraine attacks however a famous\njournalist recently published a study from Iranian researchers that states\nthat fusion created when the omega-3 fatty acid and curcumin are\ntaken together may result in a reduction of TNF or tumor necrosis factor. TNF is a\ntype of protein that is integrated in the procedure of sending signals from\none cell to another which then results in increase impulsiveness of neurons\npain and neuron inflammation In this study, the group was given the\ncombination of omega-3 and curcumin I'll decrease in their TNF levels and hardly had any migraine attacks unlike the other 3 groups studied The next one is curcumin for ALS. Now, ALS is also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or \n Lou Gehrig's disease This is an ailment of motor neurons located in the\nspinal cord of the human body which then results in continuing weakness of the\njoints and shrinking of muscles Now, three validated ALS reversals have\noccurred on curcumin and there was even a positive clinical trial conducted and\ninvestigated on an Iranian patient with ALS This is not to say that there's\na lot of evidence that curcumin is going to cure ALS or anything like\nthat but it may be beneficial Studies are very limited. There is hope\nthat it may be of a benefit but there's room for a lot more study here. The\nnext is curcumin for autoimmune disease Curcumin contains both antioxidants and\nis anti-inflammatory and it could be proven to be helpful in preventing and\ntreating some major diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's as well. The use of\nherbal and nutritional supplements such as curcumin have received a lot of\npublicity among patients suffering from different autoimmune diseases. The reason\nbehind this is simple. It is often more effective, cheaper, more widely available,\nand comparatively safer than some of the drugs prescribed for these conditions\nwith that being said make sure you talk to your doctor before starting a\ncurcumin or tumeric regimen Now, we've come to curcumin for weight\nloss. According to a meta-analysis recently conducted, it is specified that\nconsumption of curcumin results in a noticeable decrease in weight, BMI, and\nleptin in a major rise in the level of adiponectin Further advanced studies\nprovide the evidence that not all but some spices that include curcumin may\nplay a role in the management and stabilization of obesity and curcumin is\nthe main player here. Now, curcumin allows patients to decrease their weight while dealing with metabolic disorders. More \n researches needed of course but this is promising Curcumin for your dogs and cats.\nWhat if I told you that a little curcumin could make a huge difference in\nyour pet's health and even his lifespan Yes, curcumin has been proven to be\nbeneficial herbal treatment of several chronic and serious diseases not only\nfound in humans but dogs and cats as well It is a safe supplement for most\nanimals and will boost immunity while leaving the symptoms of many conditions.\nThe four primary benefits of curcumin that are highlighted when we talk about\ndogs include prevention of cancer, arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease as\nwell as other GI disorders or gastrointestinal disorders. Curcumin\nintake can allow you to replace steroids and many dogs are on steroids for\nallergies and joint pain but some studies also show that curcumin is just\nas effective as steroids. The healing properties found in curcumin may also be\nbeneficial for cats with autoimmune diseases, liver disorders, and those\nneeding heart and circulatory support Curcumin for cats may help lower bad cholesterol and also help in reducing the risk of blood clotting Now, we have a few other benefits here.\nCurcumin for prostate inflammation through several different studies and \n investigations, it has been proven to have positive essential benefits for prostate health including reduction in the size of the\nprostate, fighting against inflammation caused by prostatitis and\nhelping to manage pelvic pain Another one, is back pain. This goes along \n with the joints and the pain in general that we talked about earlier. Curcumin has\nanti-inflammatory properties which may be beneficial for painful flare-ups of\nthe upper and lower back as well The last one is curcumin for cancer.\nNow, some researchers and experts claim that curcumin also has anti-cancer\nproperties. There have been many different studies conducted which\nsupport the view and suggest that curcumin certainly does have anti-cancer\nproperties. It's possible that it can not only stabilize it but may also be an avenue for a \n potential cure for the disease in the\nfuture but most of the studies that were organized and conducted in test tubes\nand not necessarily on a human body Those can't really be considered absolutely reliable We've talked about all the benefits of it. Let's jump into the contraindictions and side effects of curcumin because that's also important and with that being said make sure\nyou're working with your functional medicine doctor or your doctor in\ngeneral when you're starting curcumin or tumeric regimen because it is such a \n potent polyphenol It's clinically proven that taking up to 8 g dose\nof curcumanoids is not associated with any serious adverse effects. However,\nlong-term studies are necessary for more detailed and comprehensive reports and\nobservations. According to some researchers has been stated that a high\ndose of curcumin can lead to nausea and GI problems as well as skin rashes.\nFurthermore the use of curcumin along with piperine may result in an adverse\ndrug reaction. This is because piperine greatly increases intestinal\npermeability. There are many in vitro studies regarding the side effects of\ncurcumin but no clinical trials have been organized and operated on the human\nbody to prove and show its toxicity However, in a 90-day experiment a rat was\ngiven a dose of curcumin supplements It was found that as the dosage increase in\ncurcumin was taken for a longer period of time, oxidative stress increased and\ninflammation increase which can later result in liver injury. Clearly, more\nresearch needs to be done but we do know that curcumin is thought to be safe at\nlower doses and when intake is monitored by a physician.

The first one is\ncurcumin the same as turmeric? What are the differences between turmeric and\ncurcumin? We talked a little bit about this already. Turmeric is a popular spice obtained from the roots of the turmeric plant and\ncurcumin is basically the active compound found in turmeric. Now, curcumin\nis present in the rhizomes of the plant in a very little amount we said 2 to 5\npercent and therefore taking turmeric is considered to be less effective than\ntaking the dose of naturally extracted and anti-inflammatory supplements of curcumin directly Next question is, how much curcumin is in turmeric? Just as spinach is rich in iron and lemons are\nfull of vitamin C, tumeric is a great source of curcumin. A single root of\nturmeric typically contains about 2 to 5 percent of the curcumin compound. This\nnext question is interesting it says is cumin the same as curcumin?\nThere's no doubt that curcumin and cumin are two different spices even though\nthey have very similar names so both spices are abundantly used in\nAsian cuisines to add flavour to curry and they're also used in Ayurvedic\nmedicine both of them can stimulate digestion due to their anti-inflammatory\nand antioxidant properties and in spite of their effective substance and similar\nproperties they have a difference in flavor appearance, constituents, and\nproperties. Curcumin is a compound extracted from the roots of the turmeric\nplant while cumin is a spice that is obtained from the seeds. Next question, is curcumin a blood thinner? People have been\nusing curcumin extracted from turmeric as a golden spice for culinary and medicinal purposes Curcumin is the active ingredient in turmeric and has\nanti-inflammatory and blood thinning or anticoagulant properties and another\nquestion we have here How much curcumin to take per day? Most studies today say that the dosage of turmeric powder between 500 to 2,000 mg\nof curcumin per day is fine This dose is used in the form of an extract which contains much higher concentrations of curcumin than you would normally find in\nsay tumeric root powder or food Many clinical studies have shown that the\ndosage of curcumin up to 8 grams is considered to be non-toxic to the human\nbody but you do want to try to keep it probably a little lower than that and\nwork with your doctor on actually finding a dose that's safe yet effective\nfor you so always discuss those thing with your doctor priority the use of any\nsupplements.

pediatric patient and as always after this lecture you can go to my website register nurse orange comb and take the free quiz I will test you on this material and also check out the other videos that are part of this series I will teach you dosage and calculations so let's get started let's see what this problem says doctor orders benadryl for a child that weighs 98 pounds the safe dose for benadryl is 5 milligrams per kilogram per day what is the safe dose per day for this child anytime you're solving these safe dosage calculations so there are some things you need to know first you need to know the child's weight child weighs 98 pounds then you want to know what is the safe dose range of this particular problem has given us they have told us that for benadryl a child can have depending on how many kilograms they weigh five milligrams for every kilogram per day so we're going to have to convert our 98 pounds to kilograms and see based on five milligrams how much this child can have and you have to see what exactly your question is asking because this is where it really trips people up some problems want to know how much can they have per dose but this particular problem wants to know how many how much they can have per day so let's solve so what we're trying to solve for is milligrams per day for this child so I'd like to write this out and to remind myself where I'm going with dimensional analysis because I use dimensional analysis to solve these problems so first let's convert our 98 pounds to kilograms so 98 pounds and we know that there's 2.2 pounds in one kilogram and pounds cancels out and we're in kilograms so we're ready to plug what our safe dose range is and one kilogram equals five milligrams of benadryl per day kilograms cancels out so we're exactly where we need to go milligrams per day that's what this problem wants to know so we're going to multiply everything in the top multiply everything in bottom and then divide we have our answer so 98 times 1 times 5 is 490 and of course one times two point two times one is two point two and 490 divided by two point two is two hundred and twenty two point seven two seven two repeating and we'll round up to twenty two point what we'll just round regular twenty to two hundred twenty two point seven milligrams per day and that is our answer this problem says a child weighs 52 pounds the child has a fever and the doctor has ordered Tollan all the safe dose range is 10 to 15 milligrams per kilogram every six hours what is the maximum safe dose for this child per day so let's look at our most important information child's weight 52 pounds the safe dose of tunnel is 10 to 15 milligrams per kilogram every six hours and our problem wants to know the maximum dose per day so we've got some extra steps we've gotta take because our safe dose range is just giving us an individual dose and we've got to figure out how much this child can have throughout a whole day so let's set up a problem using dimensional analysis so we want to get two milligrams per day so I like to write where I'm going that's my goal and just going to underline 15 because it once in our maximum dose 10 we really don't care about for this problem just the max that they can have so that's what we're going to be working with this fit team and then every six hours is very important because we want to figure out how much they can have per day so first let's convert their weight okay they weigh 52 pounds we know that there's 2.2 pounds in one kilogram pounds cancels out so we're in kilograms now let's plug in our safe dose range see how much for every kilogram this child weighs how much maximum dose of tunnel can they have so one kilogram equals 15 milligrams every six hours so per dose so we're done with this part because we got to get 2 milligrams per day so let's go ahead and solve and then we'll convert whatever we get for individual dose and figure out how much we get per day so we're going to multiply everything at the top so 52 times 1 times 15 is 720 and 1 times 2 point 2 times 1 is 2 point 2 and 720 divided by 2 point 2 is three hundred and fifty four point five four point five four repeating and we'll round to three three hundred fifty four point five milligrams every six hours for every step per dose now let's figure out how much they can have per day again I like to use dimensional analysis to figure this out so what I like to do is I like to say okay there's 24 hours in one day and for this particular dose every six hours they can have 350 four point five milligrams so every six hours they can have 354 million point five milligrams and we're where we need to be we're left with milligrams per day hours cancels out so we're going to multiply 24 times 350 4.5 and that equals 8500 8 + 1 times 6 equals 6 and 808 8500 8 divided by 6 equals 1418 milligrams per day so that is our answer this problem says doctor orders 200 milligrams of ibuprofen every 8 hours the child weighs 49 pounds the safe dosage range for this medication is 5 to 10 milligrams per kilogram per dose what is the safe dose range for this particular child and is this a safe dose ordered by the doctor so right off the bat looking at this question we know we got a lot of problem-solving to do we've got to first of all see what the minimum and maximum dose is that this patient can have based on their weight of 49 pounds and we have to see if based on that what we get if 200 milligrams falls in between that so let's get started solving this first let's solve the minimum dose that they need so we're going to convert weight so 49 pounds we know that there's 2.2 pounds in one kilogram and first we're going to solve for a minimum dose and we're going to lick with smallest number and it's 5 milligrams per kilogram per dose so 1 kilogram is going to equal 5 milligrams per dose okay we're where we need to do be milligrams per dose so we're going to multiply everything of the top and everything involved and by so 49 times 1 times 5 is 245 and then of course 1 times two point two times one is two point two and 245 divided by two point two is a hundred and eleven point three six repeating and that room's to one hundred and eleven point four milligrams per dose so we got our minimum so right now the patient what the doctor ordered they're falling into it but let's see what our maximum is so again we're going to work a problem doing the maximum so we're going to convert our pounds and 2.2 pounds equals one kilogram pounds cancels out and one kilogram equals ten milligrams per dose and hands can pound kilograms cancels out so we're going to multiply everything on the top and divide so 49 times 1 times 10 equals 490 and one times two point two times one equals two point two and 490 divided by two point two equals 220 20.7 two repeating and we'll round and we'll get two hundred twenty two point seven milligrams per dose so our range is a hundred and eleven point four milligrams per dose to two hundred and twenty-seven I mean two hundred twenty two point seven milligrams per dose and the doctor ordered two hundred milligrams so yes this is a safe dose for this child problem says doctor orders digoxin 0.92 milligrams daily for a child that weighs 16 pounds the safe dosage for this medication is 8 to 12 micrograms per kilogram per day is this a safe dose order okay this is like the previous problem we worked but a little bit differently first of all it's not asking us to solve the dosage range but we have to in order to see if what the doctor ordered is safe based on what the safe dosage range is also if you look at this problem what the doctor ordered is in milligrams the safe dosage range is in micrograms so I wanted to include this problem because we're going to have to take some extra steps want you to see how to work it so what we're going to do is we're going to find our minimum dose first which we're going to be looking at the eight and then we're going to find our maximum dose we're going to be looking to the 12 and then see what that falls in between and if it falls in between what the doctor ordered and if it does it's a safe dose if it doesn't it did not it's not a safe dose so let's convert and find our minimum dose first so we look at our weight so the patient weighs 16 pounds and we know that there's 2.2 pounds and 1 kilogram pounds cancels out and we're looking at our dosage ordered and there's 1 kilogram and 8 micrograms per day now we got to get 2 milligrams per day so we're going to convert because that's what the doctor ordered so we're going to say a thousand because there's a thousand micrograms in 1 milligram and that cancel cancels our micrograms out and we're left with milligrams per day which is where we're supposed to get because that's what the doctors ordered 0.92 milligrams per day so let's see we're going to multiply everything at the top and everything at the bottom 2 by 16 times 1 times 8 times 1 is 128 and 1 times 2 point 2 times 1 times a thousand equals 2,200 in 128 divided by 2,200 equals 0.05 a 1 8 1 8 repeating and we're going to round up we're going to round to our hundredths place so it'll be 0.06 milligrams per day so we know our minimum dose okay now let's find our maximum dose which we're gonna be using the 12 for this one so again we're just going to follow the same steps up there so 16 pounds I know that there's 2.2 pounds in one kilogram palmas cancels out maximum dose 1 kilogram equals 12 micrograms per day kilograms that cancels out we've got to convert to milligrams we know that there are a thousand micrograms in one milligram so we're exactly where we needed to be we're in milligrams per day multiply everything at the top and at the bottom and divide so 16 times 1 times 12 times 1 equals 192 and 1 times 2 point 2 times 1 times a thousand equals 2,200 and 192 divided by 2,200 equals zero point zero eight seven two seven two repeating and we're going to realtor one hundredths and it's zero point zero nine milligrams per day now does that fall in between the range of what the doctor ordered cuz the doctor ordered zero point nine two milligrams and are drained for this child is zero point zero six two zero point zero nine so no this is not a safe dose for this patient okay so that is how you work safe

so many patients are going to be taking this over-the-counter and we really need to understand what it does and what we need to be teaching our patients about it so go wife Ineson it's indication is for cough suppression and expectant what is expectant well when expectant really means getting all that junk all that crud up out of our lungs and getting rid of it so the action what it really does is it decreases viscosity of and mobilizes secretions so what does that mean really what that means it means it makes our mucus less sticky so that we can then move it we can get rid of it okay it makes it less clingy so we can we can clump it together get rid of it okay I know that sounds really disgusting but that's really what it does so therapeutic class is allergy cold and cough remedy and expectorant some of the nursing considerations to keep in mind the first one I want you to keep in mind is the patient needs to maintain adequate fluid intake okay as we're decreasing the viscosity of these secretions really need to increase our fluid intake to help even move it more and to get all of it out that's the first thing you need to keep in mind that's one thing you're going to be tested on you're going to see is we need to make sure our patients that are taking these medications are taking extra fluid okay we want to assess the lung sounds of our patient we want to see you know are we getting rid is are the lungs becoming more clear and is it actually working remember with every medication that we give there's assessment right ad pi assess diagnose plan implement evaluate so the first thing with everything we do is we assess we gave the medication okay that was our plan that we implemented our plan now we need to evaluate we need to assess again we need to reassess see what's going on did it work are the lungs becoming more clear remember keep the nursing process in mind that's the first thing you always do the patient should avoid any over-the-counter cold medications if they're taking robitussin if you're giving them guaifenesin in the hospital they need to avoid all over-the-counter medications so that we know what they're taking and what's going on this can be really difficult with patients in general sometimes I have patients come in and they'll bring their purse immense and they may not tell you about it okay so for example just different from this a patient might have some xanax in their purse and you give them all these medications right everything's going fine and then and then they're popping xanax on their own to help them sleep at night right that can't really happen in the hospital we need to know what's going on because we can't evaluate and do the treatments that we need to do if we don't know exactly what's happening with our patients at all times so you really understand what patient what medications the patient has what medications does the family have that they're wanting to give the family member okay or the patient so really keep that in mind make them understand why you need to know what's going on and the main reason is we can't give them the best treatment possible if we don't know exactly what's happening so

pop", "cCzulqCnNtY": "[Music] we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are reviewing probably for the last time because they've disappointed me so many times nother bar this time they're salted all chocolate as you can see here it cost me 12 bucks at my dispensary although I believe I got a discount for 10 is it 200 milligram edible and if it really were as potent as advertised or merely cody has advertised it would be a good deal I reviewed two nutbars in the past on the boat pretty disappointing to be honest so I don't have a lot of expectations for this one I reviewed a 100 and a 200 milligram in the past and found them both to be lacking in the potency department but but pretty good in the flavor so let's go ahead and note but be salted almond one chocolate here and give it a taste I believe I picked this up at cool calm collective and Huntington Beach Orange County so here we go we've got our packaging here this fancy gold foil we've got a little bit melted somewhere along the way but you can see what it looks like they're little nutbar symbols get a bite you can see the salted almonds on the back it's okay mmm very sweet chocolate very sweet did you like almonds you're gonna like it better than okay it's good chocolate take a second place we just did let you hmm not that low liking the chocolate yet again but how am I gonna like how it makes me feel for that guys you're gonna have to wait just a couple of seconds me however I'll come back to you guys in two hours let you know our feline thanks for watching weeks two hours later alright guys it's been two hours I've got to admit that this is the best of the nug bars that I've had so far I am definitely the most high from this one which is curious that I'm certainly more high from this one that I alright perceive myself as being more high from this one than the other two hundred milligram when I had not a whole lot more but but noticeably to me so there might just be some batch issues I'm not sure there but I would say the last time I was that maybe a you know three something like that and it's what I felt no rocking about a five so you know there's you know definitely something they're still not my go-to not gonna be my first thing I like the taste of it this actually grew on me quite a bit as I ate it I like the dark chocolate I have like all of theirs in terms of taste and this one ended up being a pleasant surprise in terms of I was expecting nothing from it and a nice little high so I got to give it to nug bar on this one they they they earned some kudos so as mild as praise is that that as I have given it I'm not sure if you can call that kudos or not but you know whatever thank you so much for watching wheats guys I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on the next review peace", "28N39tBBHJM": "welcome to family product reviews if you are new here support us by subscribing today we will be reviewing the 5-htp 200 milligrams supplement 120 capsules Arizona trician very good value for the cost this is normally sold at half the dosage and 1/4 the quantity in regular stores for 5 more taking 1 plus 100 milligram capsule in the morning after breakfast or with a snack in another 100 milligrams capsule with dinner seemed to work well the contents easily blend into a smoothie but definitely mix with something more than water or you'll have to taste it more this made me feel weird in my brain like when you re in that transition period of coming down off ecstasy everyone knows how long withdrawals from sub can linger on in this product kinda heals the brain while promoting good sleep which is very very essential to come of any opioid this product has helped me to feel rested in which has given me more energy to continue with my job search the capsules are only 100 milligrams each and the serving size is 2 capsules so you only get half the amount of doses they advertise my only regret was not knowing that a magnesium supplement would be helpful for the digestive issues this can bring along after a very difficult 2018 were my life in different areas were compromised schoolwork personal life this magical supplement helped me to go trough my routine with a better clearer direction 100 recommended if you need an extra kick to when you are struggling to keep yourself and your life up and easy this product is great it has allowed me to make great strides in reducing stress and living a more well-rounded life it promotes sleep without the strong knock out other supplement other OTC products but also helps me to stress at nights waking up fresh and ready in the morning when taken regularly it really helped me with appetite suppression and definitely a mood stabilizer as well as a great help

and leave your comments below", "agLIlV_RBrU": "hey there so i wanted to do another video again i got so many messages from people interested in these cannabis drinks like i knew that that was a market i knew people are interested in that but a lot of people messaged me so i just wanted to do some more videos and content on that and last night actually i was messaging these folks that work at tonic i was just messaging them through instagram they were so nice and one of them was telling me like that they have different ratios of thc and cbd so if i wanted a more cbd focused one to be like for the daytime they have that you know all kinds of stuff different flavors so along that i wanted to post another drink from them um this one is much much stronger so this is the tonic beverage that i got at the dispensary and this one's a hundred milligrams whereas the one i had yesterday was 25 milligrams cbd 25 milligrams thc so literally five times stronger so for me like knowing this information knowing that this is a hundred milligrams i just know right off the bat that i can't drink this whole thing in one sitting or one day to be honest um so what i've got here is it's really nice that if you can see there's like little demarcations to tell you okay if you want just a little bit this is how much you should take and it's like got lines to mark it and a little see-through strip so you can see you know where you're at so that was incredibly smart because i was like all right well i can just measure out how much i do want you know so i had 25 milligrams right here and i just poured that into a cup and really really like this so this one is a mango pineapple flavor there's no cbd in it so it's a little more psychoactive and personally like i like the more light milligrams of of thc because yesterday was a really nice experience for me i had that one tonic seltzer and then the rest of the night i drank regular sparkling water like perrier bubbly you know other things so that was like my night but if i had this i would want to make sure that i hydrated a lot lot more because it's like pretty concentrated you know like like you need some water to get that feeling good one thing that can happen with cannabis beverages and i've seen this happen is people will drink only this right they think it's an actual beverage like i'll just drink this this is almost like medicine you know it's like a flavorful nice way to drink it but you need like an actual drink an actual beverage so consider that and i tell people that with gummies too like yeah it's great to have gummies but buy yourself some just regular gummies and eat those too like don't eat gummies that are infused with cannabis is like a main snack like that's not their point but that's just my opinion so again if you buy this super super good but hydrate yourself um this i believe was 25 milligrams or i'm sorry 25 at the dispensary so 100 milligrams for 25 bucks so i would definitely buy this there's no taste of cannabis it tasted like uh like mango popsicle juice if that's a good description um so i was really surprised by that like whoever makes this and formulates this it has come a long way since the ones that i had like many years ago like on our honeymoon my husband and i went to colorado and had different you know drinks there and things like that and they did taste a little cannabis but this was also back in 2017 so things have really come a long way since then but yeah if you're interested check this place out it's tonic they're made by a company pts progressive treatment solutions and this one right here is called their pure thc infused beverage all right hope you have a good day bye my youtube channel is sponsored by the wonderful folks over at

world today's topic is related to drug calculation essentials for nurses who prepare for cbd and other competitive examinations this is one of the most requested videos from my students and my friends one of the most important and critical questions in most of the competitive examinations including cbt is drug calculation not only for examinations but also in our daily nursing practice accurate drug calculation knowledge is important to avoid error before starting i would like to request you to have a pen or a pencil a notebook or a piece of paper and your concentration for effective learning metric conversion is one of the basic knowledge which is essential for accurate drug calculation so here are some metric weights arranged in size order starting with the biggest it's kilogram and then comes gram milligram and microgram each one is thousand times smaller than the one before the same rule applies for metric volumes below liter and milliliter this is a simplified diagram which will give you an idea regarding how it works if you want to convert from kilogram to gram you have to multiply by thousand and if you want to convert from gram to milligram and milligram to microgram also you have to do the same [Music] vice versa if you want to convert microgram to milligram or from milligram to gram or from gram to kilogram you have to divide by thousands if you want to convert from big to small you multiply by thousand by moving the decimal point three places to the right [Music] next we can go through some of the examples of metric conversion so i need you to take your pen and your paper and write down your answers and finally we can see what's the correct answer so first question is convert 7.5 kilogram to gram so already you know what you have to do second one is convert 7280 microgram to milligram convert 1.5 liters to milliliters fourth question is convert 55 mil to liter so answer one is 7500 gram the answer for the second question two eight milligram answer for third question is thousand five hundred milliliter answer for the fourth question is zero point zero five five liters so for the drug calculations the main thing we have to know is universal formula this is applied for most of the calculations of the uh nursing drug calculation so the universal formula is d by h into v equal to dose d is desired amount that means what doctor is prescribing for the patient h is those on hand that means what is written in the label and volume is what is the volume of the medicine if it's a tablet it will be definitely one if it is it is a syrup it will be mentioned for example 250 milligram per 5 ml so the volume will be 5. if it's an injection what amount we are using to dilute the medication or it will be given like 2 milligram per 1 ml or 2 ml so that's a volume [Music] next slide is regarding giving the correct amount of tablets here also we have to apply the universal formula and we can see an example your patient has been prescribed 400 milligram of ibuprofen the tablet available is 200 milligram how many tablets do you give to the patient it's simple so the dose prescribed is 400 milligram and the tablet what we have is 200 milligram so first we have to see whether the units are same if the units are different we have to make it same and the answer is two tablets [Music] so next is some of the practice questions so when i'm reading you can pause the video and you can calculate and write it in your piece of paper or book and then you can calculate it late you can see the answer later so the first question is a patient has been prescribed 40 milligram the stock tablet you have are 20 milligram how many tablets do you give to the patient apply the universal formula and see whether the units are same a patient has been prescribed 0.06 milligram and the stock tablets you have are 30 microgram how many tablets do you give to the patient so you can see like the units are different so you have to see which one you have to convert so if it's me i would convert milligram to microgram because it's more easier so the third question is the stock tablet you have are 600 microgram and a patient has been prescribed 1.2 milligram how many tablets do you give to the patient here also the units are different so when you are calculating just concentrate on converting one to the same units so if it's me i would prefer to convert 1.2 milligram to microgram fourth question is a patient has been prescribed 750 milligram total daily dose of tedious means three times a day the stock tablet you have is 250 milligrams so how many tablets you give to the patient a day so always read the questions correctly sometimes they will ask how many tablets you give to a patient a dose or a day so always underline the main points in the question when you are seeing the question the next one 50 question is a patient has been prescribed 200 milligram every four hours the stock tablets you have are 100 milligram how many tablets you give to the patient a day so here the patient needs a dose every four hours that means in 24 hours the patient needs six doses 24 divided by four hours so six doses a patient is getting so six into 200 is 1200 milligram and you have to apply this in the universal formula and you will get the answer [Music] so now we can see the answers check whether you got all the answers right so the first question answer is two tablets second questions answer is sec two tablets third question also two tablets fourth questions question answer is three tablets and the fifth question answer is 12 tablets if you have any doubt you can comment in the comment box or i will give the details in the description box so again the universal formula is d by x into b equal to those desired amount divided by dose of hand into volume equal to those next we are going to see the correct formula for giving the correct amount of injections so for this also you have to remember the universal formula again and whenever you are calculating the dosage in the unit or for examinations look for the units write down the value quickly once again and substitute in the formula we can see an example your patient has been prescribed 50 milligram of peptidine as injection the stock strength available is 100 milligram in one mil how many mil do you give to the patient this is a simple question [Music] so the dose which is prescribed is 50 milligram divided by the stock strength is 100 milligrams into the volume is one milligram with one mil so the dose we have to give wire injection is 0.5 ml you can see some questions the same you have to do it with your pen and paper and we can check the answers whether it's correct or not so the first question is a patient has been prescribed two milligram of pathogen the stock strength you have is 10 milligram per 1 ml how many mil you give to the patient so it's the same as the example second question is 40 units of insulin is prescribed for a patient it is dispensed that's 100 units in one mil so how much do you give so it's like what's a prescribed dose it's 40. so 40 divided by the dispensed amount is 100 so hundred into one third question is ampules of morphine contains 10 milligram in two ml so that is the stop dose what volume must be drawn up to give eight milligram so eight is the prescribed dose fourth question is the patient needs 250 microgram of drug x you have one milligram in one way so how many mil do you give so you have to see whether the units are same if it's not same you have to convert then apply in the universal formula so now we can see the answers [Music] [Laughter] so for the first question the answer is 0.2 ml second question the answer is 0.4 mil third question the answer is 1.6 ml and for the fourth question the answer is 0.25 ml [Music] next we can see regarding body weight calculations simple so if body weight calculations mainly comes when the dose is prescribed in milligram per kilogram per dose that means this many milligrams is needed for this many kilograms of weight so the dose required equal to prescribed dose into body weight the formula is simple and easy apply to universal formula if needs to know the dose to be given so we can see an example mrs b is prescribed ibuprofen 5 milligram per kilogram per dose that means 5 milligram is needed per kilogram she weighs 50 kilograms so 50 into 5 will be the dose to be given [Music] so 50 into 5 equal to 250 milligram and if the uh question continues like this is the prescribed dose and this is the uh those which is in stock you can use the universal formula so we can see a practice question for body weight calculation a patient who is five years old and weighs 20 kilogram has been prescribed five microgram per kilogram body weight of decoxin elixir that's a syrup and the preparation is available in 50 microgram per mil so the unit is same how much microgram does the patient require for a single dose and what volume will you give to the patient at each dose so the answer is 20 kilogram into 5 microgram is 100 microgram and the volume is we apply the values in the universal formula and the answer is two minutes so next we are going to see regarding the inclusion rate calculations and among them we are going to see a male per hour first so ml is volume and hour is time so we can see an example so it will be easy for you to understand a patient is to receive 2 liters of normal saline over 8 hours and what is the infusion rate in ml per hour so always think in mind ml is volume and hour is time so ml per hour means volume in milliliter divided by time in hour so first of all we have to convert four liters to milliliter that is four thousand milliliter and time is already given in hours so four thousand divided by eight equal to two thousand divided by four equal to thousand divided by two equals five hundred next we can see the basics of iv fluid administration in that if we want to calculate the drops per minute we have a formula it is amount of fluid in milliliter divided by total time of infusion minutes into administration's at drop factor drop factor will be usually given in the question itself [Music] so we can see an example a patient is to receive one meter of normal saline over the next four hours what is the inclusion rate in drops per minute if the drop factor is 15 so the answer is first of all we have to convert 1 liter to ml which is 1000 ml then convert 4 hours to minutes that is 4 into 60 and substitute in formula and we will get 62.5 and we have to round up or round down according to the answer we are getting so here 62.5 means 63 drops per minute now we can see how we are going to round up and run down so for rounding we have to find our number like look right next door 4 or less means just ignore for example it's 5.4 means you have to write 5 but 5 or more add one more if it's 5.5 write six [Music] so now we can see regarding if there is changes in the questions for example uh ml per hour is given and if they want to calculate time we can use the same formula but you have to use the principles of mathematics that is rate in ml per hour equal to volume by time in hour so if you want to calculate time time equal to volume divided by rate if you want to calculate volume you can use the formula rate in due time hope you all

particular one has 45 milligrams of THC its flavor is grapefruit here the supplement facts in case you'd like to pause it compare it to any other drink you've had are you currently having I found out about these guys from a post by the green remedy collective out here in Richmond California they were having a buy one get one free offer and as well as the actual sprig people were there so I thought I'd swing by pick this up along with the grant as you can see very clear soda it's not as thick as your regular soda it's more like a sparkling water type of beverage it's very clear very crisp refreshing drink this is a type of soda you probably would not even know there's THC in it if you were drinking it you can casually have it with your food even this drink is definitely worth trying tastes 8 out of 10 definitely up there but this is used to get medicated and as far as the 45 milligrams go it really it depends on your tolerance for me the high lasted about an hour and a half and it was very sativa based for me I thought very you for it laughed at a lot of little things and enjoyed myself immensely if you have a chance pickup spree give it a try a formula on opinion leave your

howdy folks both in the weeds the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are going to be taking a look at another product from hi-5 chocalate we've reviewed two of their products in the past and today we are taking a look at their white chocolate 200 milligram bar I picked this up for 15 bucks at my dispensary so about inline with maybe a little even a little bit cheaper than a 200 milligram a chocolate bar chocolate bars are usually a little bit more expensive but I usually find them to be the best my favorite way to get THC and usually the most effective way you know Kiva's bang's default say all those great ones I found HiFi to be not quite as good as those but to be pretty good the other two that I had reviewed this one is white chocolate white chocolate is not my favorite kind of chocolate in the world I'm not a big big fan of white chocolate but you know I thought I'd give it a review anyways I as I said I like the other to review their dark and milk chocolate so I decided to give the white chalk on a chance you know finish this sweet out here and as I said this is 200 milligrams of THC and on the back we've gotten nutrition information which I always love to see it does not look like unfortunately the lab tests anywhere or if they do they don't let us know where the lab test results are which is unfortunate so you know that's a strike against it but let's go ahead and open it up give it a taste give it a smell all that fun stuff and then of course I will be back in two hours to let you guys know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review not so much how it tastes more how it makes you feel okay so uh solvent free distill it distillate distal eight something like that who knows who cares good stuff whoops all right finally got it open here here is our white chocolate with the HiFi logo on it you can see they're divided up into four 50 milligram rectangles let's give let's give it a taste yeah just white chocolate little bit of cannabis taste there at the very end far far from overpowering if you like white chocolate we're gonna like this I think you're like you just fine again an ever so slight cannabis taste to it the chocolate is not as good as kiva or de fauna say but it's it's it's not bad it's not bad white chocolates just not my favorite if you like white chocolate give this a go but guys I'm gonna finish this off eat the last three rectangles here and then I will be back in two hours or for you guys just a couple of seconds to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeds and I will see you in just a bit besa Arnall here and I are back for the dramatic and exciting conclusion to this sweets review it has been two hours and you're all holding your breath wanting to know if I am high or not just for a second longer I can feel you you want to know so badly any interest I'm pretty high I'm pretty high uh you know I'm not outrageously high this is not a Kiva this is not this is this is about a bang this is about a bang level like one of the bang 180 s or so which is not that's not that's not bad maybe it's not quite as good as a bang Nady but it's good it's good the in the chocolate as I said is is fine and it's a fine price mumbly at like 15 bucks or cheaper I've seen it certainly seen it cheaper than that so I I have good things to say about the hi-fi line III like you duh again it's not my favorite chocolate bar out there I don't think they're trying to be the best chocolate bar on the market but you know in a pinch and they will certainly do and I don't think you're gonna hate yourself if you pick up some hi-fi I don't have anything else interesting to say about it it's good you're gonna like it if you like white chocolate get the white chocolate if you like milk chocolate get the milk chocolate if you like dark chocolate get the dark chocolate that's hi-fi in a nutshell and that is gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a later review peace that's terrible I didn't even it wasn't even close I mean it wasn't even kind of

we talk about early stage founders sometimes a little later stage founders sometimes people doing really awesome things on people just getting started we talked to investors what they're looking for in the industry what do they want to see built in the world what are they writing checks for if you're a fan of the show of you watch the show we talk about all the different ways you can you can consume cannabis right there's the oils there's the waxes there's the traditional flowers which most people have the stereotype in their head of oh I'm going to roll a joint smoke flowers but I just read a crazy fact that more than fifty percent of cannabis legal cannabis purchase is non smoker ball let me let me say this again this is crazy I'm a decade-long smoker I love flowers I'm even a little reluctant to even get into the vape pens of the world more than fifty percent of products cannabis products purchased legally are non smoker bull that means they were edible they were chocolate they were liquids they were gums you know whatever many many different ways that you can consume cannabis and today we have Tripp keber whose CEO of Dixie brands really like the godfather of this edible [ __ ] right which is awesome sub trip thanks for being here man writing a good afternoon we in the business called the infused products sector excuse me I'm sorry yeah right that is the overarching category yes an honor used product yeah thank you for having us today appreciate it you're very welcome thank you for being you've been everywhere so we are honored to have you here today first question for you is why don't people want to smoke their weed anymore well it's inserting it's a it's a fascinating phenomenon I think you're exactly right i mean the statistics show in the state of Colorado last year over forty five percent of a 700 million dollar industry according to the department of revenue was captured by the infused products sector if you look back at 2010 when i founded our company Dixie elixirs and edibles it was probably five percent maybe eight percent of a 60 70 million dollar industry so we're dealing with hyper growth when I would suggest an incall a lot of this year alone which we're going to get close to about a billion dollars in sales as an industry will certainly hit that tipping point so more than fifty percent as you point out Brandon will be consumed through the infused products sector so really exciting time for us as a company and why do you think that's so appealing to people too well I mean you answer questions to safely i think that people understand that smoking anything even if it's perceived as medicine understand that that can be dangerous and so certainly if you're talking about medical cannabis like here we have in the state of california how can you ask a patient that is suffering from say lung cancer to embrace cannabis as a medicinal product through maybe a marijuana cigarette so it's really not sustainable in my opinion but then you look at a state like colorado which is a very active healthy lifestyle community and I think you've got a great recipe for opportunity when you're in the infused products sector yeah and when did you kind of have this like ding lightbulb moment of like hey we could create a company of infused products and take advantage of this trend well it's ironic because I was really working for the evil empire was in the alcohol distribution because okay I own bars and nightclubs and and it was very consistent in 2008-2009 where people were consuming cannabis outside of the clubs the univ re frequented or owned and it's been widely reported but I had that epiphany moment when I asked an act of law enforcement officer who was at the moonlighting uh for one of our clubs to encourage people who were smoking cannabis outside of my nightclub to get back in the club generally it's widely known that people who embrace marijuana generally drink alcohol less which i think is overall a positive thing and I was informed in that very moment that we had legalized medical marijuana and really the coal memorandum was was accelerating that and from that point forward I went into a really a deep dive on and really understanding the competitive landscape and hopefully win it up with Dixon and what was that competitive landscape them well it wasn't very deep I would suggest it was broad you know there was three things that I new number one I didn't have the professional expertise to cultivate this powerful plant I mean it is called weed for a reason maybe because grows like that but to grow a good quality cannabis bran and I think it takes an incredible skill set and handling one that I did not possess secondly you know how do you market to a demographic that is that of a 23 old lift operator may be in record colorado who's maybe wearing his hat on sideways and has chronic pain which represented about 75% of the qualifying conditions under the medical marijuana registry in colorado to that of a 70 year old grandmother right who's truly suffering from my coma I just didn't have the again the professional expertise to really market to that demographic and so ultimately we determined that it was probably best suited to create a product that would allow us to medicate the masses and that's openly have Dixie elixirs the the media like to refer to as a hot soda still to the state drives me nuts but it didn't start me you know today we have why does that drive you so crazy well first why don't use the term pot I mean uh maybe in order yeah I mean I think cannabis we have to pay incredible respect to this powerful plant cannabis sativa but marijuana or cannabis my humble opinion I was taught by some instrumental people in this industry just recently I was this morning at harborside health who I would give a tremendous amount of credit but evangeline Steve really helped me understand because yeah I didn't have a very strong relationship with marijuana if you will and today like our own president I understand that marijuana is less harmful than alcohol and trying to embrace more marijuana and less alcohol I'm 47 years autumn it\u00eds sprightly as I used to be but listen there's a massive opportunity whether it be medical marijuana like you have here in the state of California or now five states including the district lumbia that offer recreational what we call it don't use yep a big big opportunity and what was your experience with cannabis when you're kind of having this epiphany them in their little to none you know and I say that Cephas Lee I mean you know I i I'm willing to admit that you know I did not get into this business Brandon initially to truly help people and I'm embarrassed by that because I just didn't have a broad knowledge and how powerful this plant was but literally in less than six months I really understood through feedback literally calls texts emails from people saying the fair minimum thank you for creating the level of wellness that we couldn't necessarily achieve alcohol or opiates or tobacco products including you know curing from a to Zed an illness all the way up to listen you know your products have subsequently saved my life I can't make this a trend I'm not a medical doctor but we're hearing that more and more these days our own dr. Sanjay Gupta who has a quite a broad audience who I would argue as done as much for marijuana reform as anybody in the last it was two specials are so compelling yeah yeah he has a third one that is a recently aired which is all about we had a third one PTSD yeah so we're really seeing that pay massive benefit to society in our humble opinion got it but you got into it for the money I did I did initially and boy was I wrong yeah I think a lot of people who are invest in the marijuana space initially think that it's that it's the Green Rush and that we're going to get rich overnight at me you know the wheels of cannabis turn very very slow brain and but when that gear kicks in like we're going to see here in the state of California it's incredibly exciting I think Dixie brain is going to be well positioned to take full advantage of that and so I think you're starting to see companies many many companies that are well deserving of it really starting to prosper and or and or profit got it yeah make sense so you're in California now or limited in California no we're fully operational we launched our brand Dixie brands and the various friends associated under the parent company with a spectacular partner in dis Holdings they own their own brand called alki just a Chinese princess that was discovered with cannabis dating back about 3,000 years so they got a meat/meat story tonight we're hosting a fabulous budtender event in the city of San Francisco so I'm honored to be here but we've built a beautiful beautiful manufacturing facility in just north of Monterey such as south of the city and its really committed to GMP good manufacturing processes so we that all we've learned in the state of Colorado through having a completely regulatory environment framework that we do embrace we're bringing to California alongside many other solid manufacturers and I think all that's going to be beneficial to the end user whether you be medical marijuana patient today potentially an adult means consumer as early as next year and what are some of the issues in expanding in California you know specifically in this state welcome to last Friday the biggest issue was there was no regulatory framework and I believe that our excuse me your governor is going to sign the bills into law as early as this Friday incredibly exciting that will be a watershed moment you've got 34 plus million people in the state of California that is the proverbial glengarry glen ross leads egyptian veteran i am and so we're really excited about what that means for us is a manufacturer but also can only for what it represents for the state because the state is going to generate hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars this year alone in the state of Colorado where likely didn't realize over just under a hundred million dollars last year we did about 76 million as a as a state if you will again direct to the coffers I mean marijuana's exists on every street corner in America and rarely has been taxed certainly not for the last 80 plus years so really excited Susan isn't what that means for and and in Colorado that's not accounting for the saved money on not enforcing illegal marijuana right i mean has anyone tried to quantify that yeah i think there's a there's a harvard economist use a macroeconomist jeffrey uh florida blind jeffrey miron mir am that has done some amazing studies a fee the state of california spent well in excess of a couple of billion dollars on the federal interdiction of marijuana marijuana alone and so uh all that savings that we potentially can put towards the bottom line all the while attributing real tax dollars and then think of the socio economic costs about incarcerating predominantly a distortion and men of color Hispanics and african-americans in these state-run prisons federal prisons even for the nonviolent drug offense of possession and so really excited what that means you know as an industry and ultimately for states of calming potentially a nation's economy i think you're starting to see a real tipping point if you will got it so you just opened up this factory in monterey is that open or it's about to be open fully operational the operating opera gratulations we visited many dispensaries including Harborside Health and its distributor products", "MM5_OeX8pVg": "od deliveries present

throw down on crazy combos and put mad smoke in there you know it's all about pushing that positivity there's enough negative [ __ ] in the world that I just try to show that there's still good people out there you know and that's what I'm all about now you got it you got a good following I mean you you you really are a cannot just a cannabis and rasa tur but a but advocate so tell people about really like where did you get your start and your passion for cannabis and you know and how did you change that into like a lifestyle and almost like a brand I would say okay it all started you know I was everybody starts off in in drugs and alcohol you know I don't know that's where I started out and cannabis helped me overcome alcohol overcome cigarettes overcome prescription pills and it's it's about wanting to you know you can't do it unless you really want to in your heart you know and that's what it's about so once you want to change then you drop all the bad habits you got to get mind over matter man exactly and and you got to get rid of the negative influences out of your life you know and that's one of the hardest things it could be family it could be friends you know but you have to get the toxic people out of your life and that's where it starts from so and then from there you know you already had a passion for cannabis how do you how do you turn that into all this positivity and that bridged the gap between people like right well I started off in YouTube and I was watching YouTube watching you know crazy hits on on YouTube just just cannabis YouTube videos and then you know I've seen a lot of people promoting positivity and it just struck something within me and I wanted to change I wanted to be in a world full of keyboard warriors talking [ __ ] in the

like all just a regular person you know just looking for southern divers say what's up and then went into say like you know I'm a schoolteacher and I was but I was like okay I'm gonna stop right now and just hear this guy and he's like you know you start my morning off like in not wanting to like hate my job or like you know want to quit my job and have a positive influence with these kids and all that you make it to where it's a better day and I I was just blown away with that immediately I knew what he does for individual your moto you're motivating people you're speaking people and you're giving back now tell people how you give back and how you're helping this next generation of up-and-coming I guess what else we say cannabis entrepreneurs right I mean what I do the way I you know I I'm trying to change the world one person at a time you know and that's that's hard to do because you know like you said there's so many negative people out there and then it I want I wanted to quit so many times but they're not going my dams and I see how how it's helped people and that's the drive that keeps me going you know seeing that seeing you know from kids you know that they're not supposed to be watching my channel but I can't stop it but I know they're gonna be on they might as well learn something no dude we got our caller board lit up we're gonna take some people they want to talk to you bad are you got over to fight seven callers so you're on the air DFC radio farm-to-table cannabis is this Dirty Bird what up Dirty Bird were you out of right on so you're on the air with Southern abre in the hydro chef and chronic elixir how you doing man cheers and much love now you wanted to talk to the diver man talk talk speak it my mom today and my mom grew up in the old school school you know what I mean and she's not okay with me smoking marijuana and I had a talk with her today and I asked her if she could find it in her heart just to love me love me for who I am it's just a plant right yeah through all the stuff I've been in a coma and seizures all that stuff from the doctor this plants never hurt me once right it hasn't hurt any one day long and not worry about overdosing I think we need to call I think some sort of stigma that needs to be lifted and the oppression of our people needs to stop this is just a plan nobody should be going to jail or being [ __ ] kicked out of their family's house for loving a plant I mean dude I think I hate I hate that like think the back when it was this bad but there but but there was a time where you know telling your parents you smoked marijuana was not a thing like you couldn't just come out and say hey I choose cannabis now people are like hey this is the route I'm going like you kicking me out or what well it's it's also crazy to think it's just like this is the medication it's been used for ever thousands of years only until the last 70 years has it been demonized and you know and so criminalized and so incarcerated and so mass-produced on a level of being able to make so much money a plant that more or less started this country I mean back in the day George Washington and then that's what our country was founded on was before Christ that is true history the history of cannabis is deep and you know when it when it comes down to all the healing and the power that with it has been you know in the last couple hundred years slowly clamped down on it it really is gonna take a region of the people to you know to really get all the medical benefits back out there into the end to the known to the known like mainframe of the you know collective mind but we appreciate you calling and dirty we're gonna take another call or two we're gonna give away this magic butter machine in a minute I appreciate you calling me appreciate you man much love TV David thank you for calling we got you on the air with the farm-to-table cannabis show we got southern dabba and the hydro chef with chronic elixir what's really good were you calling from Lafayette ville attaboy all right North cackalacky in the house what do you want to talk to what do you want to ask southern dabber what do you want to ask the southern deborah buddy all right David three two one we appreciate you listen it Zachary you're on the line with a farm-to-table cannabis show the southern dabber and hydroponic chef what's really good man what do you what you got for us you got a garden in question or a southern dabber question go ahead shoot your question out here you go ahead i'm with you man i'm happy to answer your question to try to any weeds all right I'll give you a little lesson about me or you know a little backstory me I was a joint man for pretty much 30 years of my smoking you know and then a few years ago once I started dabbing that's when I went into bongs and I never even smoke blunts until I quit smoking cigarettes and it's kind of like you know it's not good but you know it's it's better than smoking 20 or 40 40 cigarettes a day you know if I don't cure three grunts you know I'm not HAMP is a better way but it's still it's my hospital she yes yeah so I prefer smoking flour and bong rips are my go-to now just to straight get tested you know right on hey Zak we appreciate you helping us you know expose a little bit game on what he prefers so let's uh let's take it to the next one they've been waiting for a long time now cam what's good man were you calling out of cam are you there Cammie can you hear me can this sucks you've been on hold for 11 minutes and you're giving up so early cam can you hear me cam what a bummer alright second longest caller right here Kane you're in the mix with the hydroponic chef in southern dabber on farm-to-table cannabis what's really good hello hey buddy how you doing we're just out here trying to make a way out of no way how about you I'm just trying to get my feet dipped in oh you know we'll help you get your feet wet talk to Manuel got a gardening question you got a positivity you need you need to express some life goals we're here for you like a general question for everybody we think is one like oh no because there's no specific way to just get into like the weed industry but what is like some good steps that people can take to get into it you know I'm gonna jump in on this one real quick just because I've been blown away lately how many people who have never touched a [ __ ] plant in their life are out there giving speeches about cannabis just because they've educated themself on terpenes more educating themselves on gardening or educated themselves on some other source that has to do with cannabis that doesn't necessarily have to do with that technical side of it so get interested find what interests you about cannabis for me it was cooking with cannabis that's what made me you know want to be a part of the industry and from there my passion for cooking led to gardening for you for you know for these guys it could have been started in a different way you talk about eating healthy you wanted to be healthy mmm you know so you find your health aspect of it and next thing you know you're a health supplement person giving out recommendations on how to better people's endocannabinoid system without even getting high just you know just to help them feel better basically yeah and also second I would most say like networking networking is huge Devin is on point was the same like finding your passion and finding what really works for you and what you really want to do in the industry and then once you do that you know you want to start networking with individuals who are in that industry as well to start building ideas off of each other it's going to be a cutthroat industry just like any industry and if anyone says though the marijuana game is different than any other game and they've never really worked in corporate America or know anything everyone's a snake and in the whole thing commit this [ __ ] like 70% Gary vucic and Garret and [ __ ] 30% [ __ ] you know a burner you know like a [ __ ] like dude look at burner he's a huge entrepreneur right but I think a lot of it has to do with like Gary used to say [ __ ] everybody around you who doesn't have that positive energy like southern desert if they don't have that same [ __ ] [ __ ] yes you can if they're not you know if they you don't want a yes-man but you want someone that'll give it to you straight and if they're scared to tell you the truth like hey dude your [ __ ] ideas dumb is [ __ ] the core you're gonna be broke like straight up a lot of people tell your baby's ugly dude sorry it can't be I can't be a model your kid should do something else have you thought about I don't know physics to answer your question just get your hands dirty get involved in one way or another learn something and then apply it you know and I mean there's many transferable job skills and especially in this growing industry so yeah if you were just take a job trimming even or working in a garden hands being around it listening to it seeing it you'll you'll learn a lot in a short day are you in again Washington compliance that's a huge thing you learned about all the compliance it's all GA every week and you go out there and start teaching these [ __ ] who don't know how to do business they just wanted to sell weed you teach them how to be compliant and make their business successful you're you're invaluable you clear no way they could ever replace that someone because this guy I used to go to the skate shop around my town and I don't know if you guys heard of Brad Miller they call him see red knows who clone I mean he's a friend of burners yeah I think it's a genetic guy yeah he he like mentored me like hella early on and I found that out kind of later through Instagram seeing like who he was or that meeting one of my good friends he like make soil for your company and stuff well that's a good that's a good and that's a funny story because it's funny how small the world is but we're gonna keep it moving and I'm gonna hook you up for asking a good question and let me cut your story off I'm gonna give you a magic butter machine because I really do think that you help kind of expose a good side of things on how to how to try to find your way on industry so stick around for a minute if you want to give your information to the screener when I put you on hold you can otherwise just shoot me your information in my DM hydroponic chef right on Cain congratulations magic butter who's hooking you up every Wednesday night with the best Grove gear and the [ __ ] best cooking and grow knowledge it's never gonna happen to thing it's never gonna happen but we're gonna take a break real quick and then we're gonna come back we're gonna drink some we're gonna drink some sparkling [ __ ] champagne we're gonna have some CBD cocktails with chronic elixir and we're gonna talk CBD and all you can do to stay medicated and educated and healthy DMZ radio farm-to-table cannabis I'm educated [Music] [Music] check the situation to go with a little bit of part of being my cup you could tell the bartender to fill it out no that's all right baby [Music] so [Music]", "3firLiuEEjY": "hello guys we are back with another episode of wheats where today we are doing a little bit something different if you would just take a look here at the link for our previous video where we reviewed the Voodoo sours blue raspberry or blueberry or blue extreme some kind of blue flavor today we're taking a look at booty sours but the strawberry flavor but the big reason we're out here today is we're gonna take a look at eating this with back you might have wondered why you saw this big jar of Nutella in the foreground of the video and this spoon here okay so let's open up this sumbitch here smells fruity and delicious I remember from last time I was surprised by how sour these were and [Music] quick get one of these belts out okay Wow very sour wow wow very sour and I like sour things but as sour as advertised now let's make sure we give a little Nutella I'm sure this is gonna be gross going from extremely sour to extremely savory but for science savory this isn't savory sweet oh I'm talking about okay so we have a little bit of that another one of these and I'm gonna cut this off soon because you guys don't need to see all this but oh that is sour whoo I have nothing else this is good the sour taste out we're done anyways guys thanks for watching I'm gonna finish these can't say I'm looking forward to it this might need a little bit more of this and we'll check back with you in 30 6120 thanks hello guys welcome back to wheats we are reviewing the 375 milligrams who do sour strawberry award-winning and we're comparing it with and without fat and this is with fat it's been half an hour and I've got to say it feels like so far the fat might be making a difference definitely feeling more high than I was thirty minutes without that so we'll see we'll check back at the hour mark and see if that trans continuing thanks for watching hi guys welcome back to weeds we are talking about the Voodoo sellers 375 milligrams award winning edible ropes the strawberry flavor excuse me last time we were looking at the blue raspberry flavor and we were looking at those without fat again today tried these bad boys were soon atella and I gotta say I still seems to be having an effect just like it was half an hour ago it definitely seems like ticking with that is the way to go but again it could just be a more powerful batch we don't know for sure but we'll check it back with you guys in just another hour and let you know that thanks for watching hi guys welcome back it has been an hour since I last checked in and two hours since I first consumed the 375 milligram a table this time around I tried to do with that as opposed to last time and it seemed to really do the trick it's definitely made the Voodoo more potent than it was before now granted that could just be because edibles can always vary in batch to batch things can be different so all that means we'll just have to try a different gummy based edible again in the future and you'll just have to watch wheats again to see if if it pans out or not thanks for watching guys check you later", "bm4aDYKng30": "hi everybody my name is Jessie Laney and I'm Luca lista nutritionist today I'm here to talk to you all about magnesium I'm going to explain what it it covered the science of deficiencies the health benefits talk about some foods that are high in magnesium and then finally introduce you to for magnesium products by nutrient Canada so what is magnesium anyway well it's a mineral that's commonly found in our bodies and in our food and there are quite a few deficiency symptoms of magnesium for a mild deficiency you may see things like loss of appetite nausea vomiting weakness fatigue rapid heartbeat and high blood pressure if you are super deficient in magnesium or if you've been deficient for a really long time you can see insomnia or osteoporosis where your bones are really weak or you could see hypocalcemia or heichal kalenna both of these are when there's low calcium or low potassium in the blood and your body just can't find homeostasis which is that balance magnesium has a lot of health benefits but it's been clinically proven to help with constipation blood pressure and heartburn when it comes to constipation magnesium can act as a mild laxative and if you take a lot of it it can clear you right out so sometimes it's used by doctors in advance of medical procedures that need everything cleared out it can also be taken regularly you can take magnesium hydroxide for heartburn there are a lot of foods that are high in magnesium but the three top foods are fish dark leafy greens and nuts and seeds fish wise the two best sources are mackerel and halibut and the good news here is that magnesium is a mineral and it does not get destroyed when you cook with it so you do not have to do ceviche or sushi you can cook your fish and still get lots of magnesium in terms of dark leafy greens the best ones are spinach and kale I love adding spinach to my smoothies because it blends reading and you don't even taste it kale is another really great one and so is Swiss chard you can have Swiss chard raw in salads which oftentimes we don't do but it's also really nice sauteed and a little bit of olive oil maybe throw some garlic in there a little bit of soy sauce or charring it's delicious and finally a magnesium can be found in nuts and seeds the top to being pumpkin seeds and almonds these make such a good snack that are high in magnesium now there are tons of magnesium products out there on the market so sometimes they can be a little bit confusing trying to figure out which one is best for you and it really depends on the type of magnesium to know how much to take because it's gonna change the absorption of it new to Canada has magnesium bisque listening and this is one of the best sources because the magnesium is bound to collide this is amino acid that is the best way to find it because it makes sure that that magnesium is not broken down in the digestive tract or in the stomach it goes to the large intestines and small intestines and then fast-tracks into the bloodstream so you're gonna get a lot more magnesium it do need much more absorbed there's also studies studies that show that amino acid chelated minerals so when you bind a mineral like magnesium to an amino acid like glycine you're gonna get more bioavailability so you're gonna get more absorbed into your body and more bang for your buck and finally oftentimes you see the cheaper forms of magnesium which would be that magnesium oxide and the magnesium citrate these ones are really great however they can cause diarrhea so they may not be the right one for you new tune in Canada has three different magnesium business mate products that you can enjoy the first one is the pill format this is probably the easiest for a lot of us you just pop one pill a day and you're good to go from magnesium you can also do the liquid format because magnesium it dissolves really well in liquid and that's one tablespoon a day that you can just take straight up or blend into your smoothies and then the last format I say the best for last because I love powdered format that's always my favorite cuz you can have fun with it yep you can just take it dry but that wouldn't be any fun you can add it to your smoothies you can add it to your morning elixirs hot drinks it dissolves really well in liquid or you can play around with it and add it to an ice cream I have a really nice chilla very nice cream recipe that you guys are going to love and I call it an ice cream because there's no added sugar it's just very big perry's banana magnesium blend it up delicious perfect for an evening treat that's not going to keep you up all night so I hope you guys have enjoyed this video and learned lots about magnesium that it's really good for constipation heartburn and blood pressure as well there is some really great magnesium diskless make products by nutrient canada you should definitely try out if you're experiencing any of the symptoms we talked about in this video bye guys have a good day", "BvI4Dr7hvDo": "do I think therapy so basically what it IV therapy is its antioxidants it helps to kill free radicals in the body detox is your liver and your kidneys the lines higher dose buddies it's very good for your hair and your skin hydrate team you're gonna get my IV so I can't wait to hydrate my body Med Spa and I'm going to have my IV injection and I'm just will be excited it's all about getting the nutrients that you need to get in your body that you usually don't have with an IV this is amazing and I'm so excited [Applause] [Music]", "WjmWiSNZozw": "so today we're looking at chapter nine and ten chapter nine is calculation of oral liquid dosages and chapter ten is calculation of parenteral doses which is um also liquids so we usually measure these in for oral liquids we can measure them in teaspoons or milliliters milliliters is a little more accurate so we're trying to get some of our patients to use milliliters but it's difficult when they don't know what a milliliter is i'm looking on page 164 at the beginning of chapter 9 there are some keywords one is beyond use date it's also called best use date so that's the bud this used to be called the expiration date and especially with uh medications that have to be reconstituted if they're in powder form they're good for a while they could be good for a year or two but once they're in uh once they're reconstituted into a liquid form then they have a shorter shelf life some liquids that are reconstituted have to be used within a few hours or even an hour and other powders that are reconstituted are good for a few months some are good for 90 days so you just really have to read the label on it so the beyond use date is a date assigned by the pharmacy to a reconstituted or repackaged medication beyond which the preparation is no longer considered usable a diluent is an agent that dilutes a substance in pharmacy the liquid added to a powder to change the powder to a liquid or the liquid used to dilute another liquid it's also u known as the solvent so and i cannot write today i'm trying to write a solvent i've also heard it called dilutant okay so you'll hear it called all of those things an elixir is a sweetened flavored medication dissolved in a mixture of alcohol and water out of all of the liquid solutions an elixir has the most alcohol tincture has a lot of alcohol too but tincture sometimes you'll find a tincture that says it's an oral tincture but most of the time tinctures are topical and so you know you wouldn't drink it and sometimes those have quite a bit of alcohol also expiration date is the date assigned by the manufacturer of a medication beyond which is not considered usable and that expiration date is no longer valid once a medication is repackaged or reconstituted graduates are calendars calibrated in the metric system that are used to measure liquids the word lyfolyzed is the same thing as freeze-dried the meniscus is the curved line at the top of a container that you measure something in we always measure the amount of a liquid at the bottom of the meniscus so we're not going to measure it here we're going to measure it down here at the bottom um and when we uh pour liquid in it because of surface tension and gravity it forms this curved line because it's going to cling to the liquid on this the liquid is going to cling to the cylinder on the side it happens in coffee cups too but you don't notice it as much in your coffee cup and we always read at the bottom of the curve at eye level so we're going to hold that at eye level see if i can draw an eyeball that doesn't look strange at all the powder volume is the space occupied by the powdered active ingredient relative to the total volume of medication after reconstitution it's also known as displacement value this is a measurement of the amount of active substance that displaces or takes the place of some of the liquid diluent so in other words if you have a container and you have a certain amount of powder in the bottom of it and you add liquid to it you might have six ounces total but you might not have six ounces of liquid because that powder is going to take up space now some powders will dissolve almost completely into liquids and not take up any space other powders take up a lot of space and you have to account for it so this would be my diluent and this would be the powder volume reconstitution is the process of adding fluids such as distilled water to a powdered or crystalline form of medication to make a specific liquid dosage strength solution is a dosage form in which the medication is completely dissolved in the liquid the solute is the substance that's being dissolved in this chapter it's the powdered medication a suspension is a dosage form in which small particles of medication are dispersed throughout the liquid most require shaking before dispensing and administering when we get into injectable medications there are some medications that should not be shaken because they are made with a biologic or dna component and if you shake it you could actually break the bonds and you know make the the medication um you know worthless because you've broken it up so it will tell you on the container whether you shake it or not and then a syrup is an aqueous solution sweetened with sugar or a sugar substitute to disguise the taste the chapter starts on page 166 with the introduction oral liquid formulations include solutions tinctures elixir suspensions and syrups oral medication given in liquid form are absorbed more quickly than solids that have to dissolve before absorption most oral medications are absorbed in the small intestine although some are absorbed beginning in the mouth or the stomach you can actually absorb medication through the little capillaries under the tongue and that's how sublingual medications some of them work okay so on the top of page 167 you have pictures of an oral syringe now sometimes we worry that patients might try to attach a needle to an oral syringe and give it intravenously which would be a big problem because oral medications are not sterile so you never want to inject oral medications but don't worry because the um oral syringe does not have a lure lock which is a little screw adapter that you can attach a needle to and also it's larger than a needle so it can't um you can't put a needle on it it won't fit if this is too big so that's a good thing people won't mix those up and also the oral syringes usually say for oral use only so that's another way that you can tell now these oral syringes are kind of the same kind that we use at the hospital i work at these are smaller ones when we're measuring liquid we measure at the top of the black line because that's a little rubber gasket that keeps the liquid in the top so we measure at the top of the black line now you can see the white end of the plunger here has a dome shape so if we're looking at the way these things are made they have a little flange or a little tip here and then they flare out to the syringe and then they have a flange that you can hold on to and inside is that stopper and then the stopper usually has a black line i'm making it green here because of artistic license and it has markings on the side so it has a little like a dome shape here and that's because when you push when you pull the liquid down into it you're also putting liquid in this portion of it and when you push it out you're going to not push all of the liquid in that top out so it actually measures the what's in here and it doesn't count it when you administer the medication so when you squirt it into a child or an adult's mouth there's always going to be a little bit left in this tip area but we don't worry because we've measured to account for this and it doesn't count in the measured volume so when you squirt it out you're squirting out all of the medication that you measured and whatever's left in here is waste so we don't worry about that so you don't have to try and get it down to the bottom and squirt that out as well because that'll be too much okay so oral syringes needle doesn't fit it's got a little plastic snap cap that we put on top before we take it to the patient so that the liquid doesn't fall out so the first thing is a needle doesn't fit and the other thing is it's not sterile because oral medications are not sterile so you know that's fine then it shows um a medication cup with markings we also have eye droppers there's different medication droppers a little teeny skinny one on page 167 figure 9.2 a that shows a very small medicine dropper that only goes to half a milliliter actually it shows 0.3 and 0.6 and then you have the larger one that goes up to a teaspoon or 10 milliliters then figure 9.3 is a called a dosage spoon and this is found with oral liquid pediatric medications and it usually goes to 10 ml or 2 teaspoons so here's the pictures see i'm looking at this backwards okay so there's the oral syringe there's a dosage cup these are two different medication droppers look kind of like eye droppers and then down here is the medication spoon and the medication spoon a lot of little kids like because it's fairly easy for them to grasp it and take the medication themselves they feel like big kids when they do that at least my kids always did oral syringes are available in 1ml 3ml 5ml 6ml and 10ml or milliliter sizes they also make 20 milliliter syringes in for the hospital use so that goes all the way to two teaspoons a medication cup a dropper that's available in different measurements and is usually tailored by the manufacturer for a specific drug and then dose spoons now patients can also use household devices like teaspoons and tablespoons but those are not recommended because they don't measure the same and so it's a good idea if you're working in a community pharmacy to make sure that the patient gets a milliliter dropper with their liquid medications especially for little kids where doses are critical page 168 also shows a little pacifier that measures oral liquid medication for an infant a lot of doctors don't recommend using these because the medication sticks to the inside of that nipple and sometimes it's hard to get all of it out so it's probably better to give them that let them suck on it like a pacifier for a while and then add another liquid like water to it and let them and it'll kind of rinse the inside of that nipple and then they'll get more of the medication okay um now page 168 there's a tech note in green when a medication dropper is provided by the manufacturer it should be used for administration of that particular medication that's this these two brightly colored ones actually came with medication bottles that we use in the hospital this one it says for use with clobazam only it's hard to read where is that yeah for use with clobazam oral suspension only because it came with the drug clobazam however we don't use these because we don't have a cap for them and also because it's easier for us to use this type of medication oral syringes with the cap on and we can measure exact amounts with these so that's we'll measure them put the cap on label it put it in a bag with the patient information on it and it goes out every afternoon for the next day's dose this one doesn't say what medication it was but usually we throw them away because we don't use them so i was very kindly allowed to bring those home for my zoom classes okay and then in the middle of page 168 is a blue tech alert and it says household utensil utensils are sources of potential errors and are not the ideal means of measuring doses i happen to have my good silver right behind me it's not actually silver it's stainless this is a teaspoon that would that you know you could use to measure medication but i've actually measured these and this is a teaspoon um dose of medication and this is my household teaspoon and you might think that this would fit in here but it actually doesn't this teaspoon that i use to stir my coffee with actually only holds about three and a half milliliters of liquid so these are not good for medication so if you have kids or when you have kids don't use those for medication for your kids okay and not only that but if you're giving this to a parent who's not used to giving medications the teaspoon tsp and tablespoon tbsp can be easily confused which leads to errors they might think you're saying tablespoon instead of teaspoon also when people use their own flatware to measure there's too much variation patient safety is better insured if calibrated medication administration utensils are utilized okay household utensils are used in some necessary instances okay and then there's another tech note at the bottom of page 168 volume is usually the unknown value when calculating oral liquid medication doses and dosages sometimes once in a while it's not because especially on national exams they love to say things like a teaspoon of amoxicillin contains first of all it's a word problem so you have to like read it contains 250 milligrams if the patient takes two and a half teaspoons full what is the dose and you're like oh the dose is two and a half teaspoons full but no they want to know the milligrams on that one so you get your little calculator and we want to know milligrams so if there's 250 milligrams in one teaspoon we don't even have to convert this to milliliters to do this one and we're taking two and a half which is 2.5 teaspoons full teaspoons are going to cancel and that tells us to just multiply 250 times 2.5 and we get 625 milligrams okay so normally your question is something like a teaspoon of amoxicillin contains 250 milligrams how many teaspoons would the patient need to take to get 750 milligrams or something like that so then you're solving for volume and if they're asking you in teaspoons you can answer in teaspoons honestly if your answer comes out to 3.175 teaspoons it's probably better in real life to convert it to milliliters okay all right and then it gives you some examples of calculating oral liquid medication using ratio and proportion on page 169 and calculating oral liquid medications using dimensional analysis and that's in the middle of page 169 which is pretty much the same thing there's another check note on page 170. um at the top of page 170 it said an apothecary dram apothecary dram remember that's an apothec the apothecary system is approximately four to five milliliters and is not considered a teaspoon in the household measurement system neither the apothecary nor the household measurement system is extremely accurate so for the greatest accuracy you're going to use milliliters okay and i don't know how i can stress this enough it's extremely important let's circle it in orange that doesn't really show up but you get the idea milliliters greatest accuracy okay so practice problems a um calculate the following medication orders and answer the questions listed if there's a dispensing device shown mark the correct dose and show your calculations remember to use the method of calculation and conversion that's most comfortable for you okay so i can't stress this enough i like dimensional analysis and i didn't even really use it much until i was like 29 and went back to college um because i could have decided to go back to college and then i felt old but i i had an astronomy class that used dimensional analysis and calculating how many times the moon actually revolves as it goes around the sun in a year which was not 365 times which you would think but it's not um and so that was kind of interesting and then when i found dimensional analysis and when i took chemistry and all of that it just kept you know kept building on that so i thought i'd better get used to it and i did and then once i got used to it it's more comfortable for me than ratio and proportion but if you like ratio in proportion and it makes sense to you then that's what you should use you know like don't do dimensional analysis because that's what i do um and i'll try to remember to show you ratio in proportion here and there so that it makes more sense to those people comfortable with it okay so let's look at page 171 number three these are practice problems a and that trotting is my dog running by with a toy in his mouth okay so prescribed is cephalexin oral suspension 62.5 milligrams so here's how the problem is written except in much better printing and that squeaking is the dog toy okay so this reads prescribed with a colon cephalexan oral suspension 62.5 milligrams by mouth three times a day with food the little c with the line over it is with and so then you have your stock strength available so i'm going to call that supply cephalexin oral suspension 125 milligrams oh okay that was good i am learning to use this thing cephalics in oral suspension 125 milligrams per 5 ml that looks really bad okay so what volume is needed per dose so in order to figure out that volume i'm going to show both ways first of all we want to know volume so that's our a part of the problem volume per dose question mark and let's look at this we want to know volume which is milliliters so here's my supply and i'm going to put the milliliters on top 5 milliliters contains 125 milligrams and then i'm going to multiply it by my order which is 62.5 milligrams and i can make it a fraction just by putting it over one and my milligrams are going to cancel leaving me with milliliters which is what i'm looking for and on top i'm going to have 5 times 62.5 which is 312.5 and on the bottom i have a hundred and twenty five times one which is a hundred and twenty five then when i take the three twelve point five divided by one twenty five i'm gonna get two point five milliliters so if i'm doing this in ratio in proportion it doesn't matter what goes on top and what goes on the bottom as long as i have the same thing on the top and the same thing on the bottom so since i know i want 62.5 milligrams i'm going to start with that and i don't know how many milliliters 62.5 milligrams over x is going to be equal to 125 milligrams over 5 mls okay so this one i flipped the 5 ml's over 125 i flipped it over to get to that point you don't have to you can do it the other way but in this case i just want to show you that it works out the same as long as in this case you have what you're looking for on top which is milliliters in this case it doesn't matter what you have on the top or the bottom as long as you have the same things on top and the same things on the bottom okay so now i'm going to cross multiply 125 i start with x because i like x on the left 125 times x is 125 x's 62.5 times 5 is 312.5 and now if i want to know what x is by itself i'm going to divide both sides by a hundred and twenty-five and when i do that division i'm gonna get x equals 2.5 milliliters okay so either way you get the same answer i do like this one better because that's just me if you like this one better go ahead you can do that too and why is it important because either way we get the correct answer if we set it up correctly okay so if you set it up correctly you can use any kind you want in fact i could show you a third way i think i'm going to because it's important to know what we're doing here what we're doing is we're figuring out how many milligrams are in one ml okay so if there's 125 milligram no yeah 125 milligrams in 5 milliliters i can take the 125 divided by 5 and i get 25 milligrams in 1 ml now this is important because a lot of drug manufacturers make oral drugs like this in fact here's a demonstration of it's a fake amoxicillin they spell it wrong so that way they don't break any copyright laws and it says 125 milligrams per 5 ml right on top knowing this 5 ml is a teaspoon right so you have in 1 ml you have 25 50 75 100 125 so that way you know that your answer if we need 62.5 milligrams is going to be 25 50 100 your answer is going to be between two and four milliliters because it's got to be more than 50 but less than a hundred okay 25 50 75 oh look it's gonna be between two and three okay so that helps you estimate before you do the math so this is actually a good thing to do now if there's 25 milligrams in one ml we want 62.5 milligrams in xml so here's your ratio in proportion again i'm going to cross multiply 25 x equals 62.5 and when we divide both sides by 25 we get x equals 2.5 okay so again milliliters you're getting the same answer okay one thing i want to stress with you guys is when you're doing math make sure that you use the correct units okay you don't want to come on that was a highlighter you don't want to um go to all this trouble and say that your answer is 2.5 teaspoons that's absolutely not correct and it'll get marked wrong so make sure you give your answer with your units milliliters teaspoons whatever it is they're asking for okay so um practice problems going all the way to page 173 is pretty much the same thing but looking back at number three at this particular problem there is a part b to this so part a is what's the volume per dose and then part b which it doesn't say a or b but i like to do differentiate them that way what is the equivalent in the household measurement system and so if there's five mls for one teaspoon full then two and a half mls is going to be a half a teaspoon right so we can go ahead and set this up 1 teaspoon is 5 ml times 2.5 mls and we have the mls cancel and we have 2.5 divided by 5 equals one-half or 0.5 teaspoonfuls now since it's a household measurement system the accepted way to write it is with a fraction because everybody knows what half a teaspoon is and they're not used to hearing 0.5 teaspoons so this is pretty much the same thing um all the way to page 173 except it shows on question 12 it actually wants you to mark the appropriate dose on the little t the little uh medicine dropper that's shown there so and i just blocked the light so you probably couldn't see it so show the appropriate dose on the medication dropper okay now at the bottom of page 173 this is very important it's not just a technician alert it's for anybody who's giving medication to any any child or an adult if the answer to a dose calculation does not agree with an anticipated answer based on the amount of medication prescribed and the dose of medication on hand always recalculate and ask for assistance as necessary technicians we check each other's math all the time and that's fine because it just you know we're out there to help each other we're not there to say you got it wrong and i'm not going to tell you what you did wrong because you're dealing with patients lives so you know we want to help each other out a dose that seems too large or too small should always be questioned and i might have told you guys this before um i was working in the nicu which is the neonatal intensive care unit there are some babies that have been there for a few months and they're big kids but some babies most of the time when they're in the neonatal intensive care unit they're pretty tiny in fact we have a whole section called the tiny baby unit and these are babies that are under a certain weight i think it's two pounds and they're usually extremely premature okay so i'm used to seeing size syringes i'm not used to seeing a 10ml syringe with medication for these babies because two teaspoons 10 milliliters that's a lot and so i saw a medication that was drawn up to i think it's like eight and a half milliliters something like that and when i delivered it to the nurse i didn't draw it up it was drawn up in the batch in the morning we do all of the oral syringes every morning and we deliver them in the afternoon for the following day so i told the nurse is this a big kid and she said no he's pretty tiny and i said this seems like a big dose and she said yeah it does and i said well let me take it back and ask my pharmacist so i took it to my nicu pharmacist and this nicu pharmacist was not the pharmacist who had assisted the doctor in calculating the dose they had calculated the dose for an oral suspension which was pretty weak apparently because they needed that eight and a half milliliters to give that dose to the patient they should have used the injectable form and given it orally which we do a lot there which seems odd and it doesn't taste good but they usually follow it up with baby formula or the mom's breast milk or something like that because it's more concentrated and they can get a large dose in a small volume and so the nicu pharmacist said oh i'm glad you showed this to me this baby's on restricted fluid intake and if they took this four times a day apparently that was like half of the amount they were supposed to drink during the day and you don't want them to drink syrup you want them to drink nutritious either formula or breast milk you know because you don't want half of their allowed liquids to be um syrup you know that's like not good for them so they changed the dose to um the injectable form and then they only needed like one and a half milliliters so that was that was pretty good i'm glad i caught that because that wouldn't have been good for the baby it wouldn't have hurt the baby because it wasn't too much too strong a medication but it was too much volume so sometimes though when you're doing these things and you see something like take 10 tablets that's when you're more likely in an outpatient setting to say oh you don't usually give my patients directions that say take 10 tablets let me ask the pharmacist about this one okay so we always want to question something that seems weird and trust your instincts after a while you'll get to know what's normal and what's not okay page 174 shows reconstitution of powders into oral liquid medications medications that are unstable in liquid form for extended periods of time are manufactured in powdered or lifilized form that needs to be reconstitution before reconstituted before administration and so we talked about that at the beginning of the chapter a graduated cylinder looks like this in your book they have all kinds of different sizes i'm going to grab one real quick there are small graduated cylinders this one only holds two teaspoons or 10 milliliters this is the one we use most often in the hospital pharmacy it holds 100 milliliters it's hard to read with my head in the way it goes to 100 milliliters and then we have this baby right here these are plastic which are really makes a lot of sense because we do drop them occasionally this one is made of glass this goes up to 250 milliliters which is about 8 ounces and a little more and you see the plastic yellow thing on here the top of your measuring line is here don't use this to put on your measuring line first of all you can't see through it so it's not good to mark where you want your liquids to go and secondly that's not what it's for because it's glass you want to protect this little dropper end okay you want to protect that little spout so when it falls over it will hit the plastic and not the glass spout so it won't break it so that's the only reason this is on here do not use it to mark your liquid level okay okay so now we're looking at um powdered volume on page 176 example 9.5 we have erythromycin ethyl succinate for oral suspension and here's the label right there and then it's going to ask you some questions about that in fact on page 177 you're going to have one two three four five six seven eight nine questions about this so that's why your post test there's only 10 questions however some of those questions have of several parts so it's more than 10 questions okay so um on page 176 underneath the label but first of all let's look at the label itself at the top left it says to patient shake well before using keep tightly closed directions for preparation this is for us slowly add 140 milliliters that's one of these plus 40 milliliters more so one plus 40 but we're going to measure it to the 100 mark and then to the 40 mark add 140 milliliters of water to the to the bottle or pretend it's a bottle like this and shake vigorously to make 200 milliliters of suspension store in refrigerator and discard unused portion after 10 days then underneath that it says manufactured by knowledge pharmaceuticals st louis missouri 63043-usa the middle section of the label has the company name knowledge pharmaceuticals it has the name of the drug erythromycin ethyl succinate this was called the ees as a brand name and it was made by another company but they've stopped making the brand name because it's been out for so long that it's not even made in brand anymore then there's an orange line and it says 200 milligrams of erythromycin activity per 5 ml reconstituted and then underneath that it says 200 milliliters once it's mixed with water 200 milliliters when mixed up at the top right you have an ndc number 6304 331444 okay so 6304 is knowledge pharmaceuticals so that's the manufacturer this part is the drug name strength and form which is erythromycin ethyl succinate suspension once it's reconstituted 250 milligrams per 5 ml and this is the package size which is 200 milliliters once it's reconstituted and then you have a barcode that you can scan with your little barcode scanner the there's there should be numbers underneath the barcode which is the barcode sku number but um it will include that ndc number in it it usually starts with three and ends with some zero or something it gives you an expiration date and a lot number okay so if there's a recall you can go look at the expiration date and lot number and you can see if the drug's been recalled or not so underneath the label it says according to the directions for preparation the bottle of erythromycin will contain a total volume of 200 ml after reconstitution with milliliters of distilled water it must then be kept refrigerated and any unused portion discarded after 10 days the expiration date of o3 2022 must be replaced with a bud or beyond use date of 10 days from the time of reconstitution the strength will be 200 milligrams per 5 ml and then to calculate the powder volume you're going to end up with 200 ml's total so that's my total volume you're going to subtract the amount of liquid that you added to reconstitute it which was 140 milliliters oh come on now it doesn't know that that's my hand there we go 140 milliliters of diluent volume and that will give you 60 milliliters of powder volume okay so your total volume minus the diluent volume will give you the powder volume remember that the final volume of medication in the container will always always be greater than the amount of diluent added due to the powder volume i only know one drug that this is not true well two um and that's vancomycin for injection if you want a hundred milliliters you add a hundred to that bottle and i don't know why vancomycin has no powder volume maybe because it's an injectable and there's no flavoring there's no color in fact it comes out clear and maybe it has a small molecular weight i don't know i don't have enough chemistry to know that but it's still it it doesn't take up any space and so you don't have to account for powder volume when you're when you're figuring that out that and maybe the hydrocortisone injection are the only two drugs that i personally have experience with reconstituting that have no powder volume okay the total volume prepared should always be checked to ensure that there is an adequate amount for dispensing the prescription or order if not be sure the correct medication strength has been chosen and reconstituted as required to meet the order so then example 9.6 on page 177 it gives you penicillin so we're going to do the same thing here we want to know um what's the total volume of medication after reconstitution and on the bottle it says 100 milliliters in red and then it says what diluent is indicated to be added to the powder for reconstitution you might think it's always going to be water but in injectable medications there's several different things you can reconstitute with sterile water normal saline those are the two most common ones sometimes they use d5w which is five percent dextrose in water once in a while you could reconstitute with something else but most of the time it's going to be those three things so the diluent is going to be water now since this is an oral medication it doesn't say that it has to be sterile water but we usually use distilled water or water that's been filtered mainly for flavoring but also so we don't inadvertently add any bacteria to it what volume of diluent is added to the powder it says right on the bottle add 61 milliliters and then it says what's the powder volume so if you're going to end up with 100 milliliters total we're going to subtract the 61 milliliters which is the diluent volume and that's going to give us 39 milliliters for powder volume what special instructions are giving given for adding the diluent and it says to add the water in two portions and shake well after each addition okay so then i always get this question if we're measuring out 100 milliliters or in this case 61 milliliters which is right there how do we know how much to add in two volumes or into um in two parts okay it doesn't matter because you're going to end up using the whole thing but you want to add enough that you can get it wet and get get it shaking well and get it really wet then you add the rest of the water so usually that's going to be about half now the reason for that is some drugs have a lot of powder even if they don't take up a lot of volume and if you pour the whole amount in all at once it's actually going to shoot powder out the top and then when powder comes out the top you're losing drug so you don't want to do that and you want to pour it kind of slowly so i need to film um an actual reconstituting of medication i just haven't gotten around to doing that yet and i'm going to film a demo with this particular bottle sometime in the next couple weeks so you guys can see that actually happening but i think it would be more fun to do it at work or i can film someone else doing it that's always fun and then it says what is the metric strength of the solution after reconstitution and it's right there in your example it says 125 milligrams per 5 mls after reconstitution what is the medication strength in units not all drugs are measured in units but in this case penicillin is and it says that it's 200 000 units per 5 milliliters after it's reconstituted and the next one is what volume of medication is necessary to provide 125 milligrams of medication and that's five milliliters and what volume of medication would be given for 62.5 milligrams and i believe we did that one up here 125 milligrams per 5 ml and if you wanted to give the patient 62.5 milliliters you would give them [Music] two and a half milliliters or half a teaspoon okay so then it kills you in um in the example 9.6 it does it using ratio and proportion and then those are practice problems b and then it goes straight into your post test so it does ask you a lot of questions there and on your post test you'll have some questions that say indicate the volume um on this illustration of a dosage cup so you would mark the dosage cup now if you're somebody who doesn't want to write in your books just draw the dosage cup and then mark your drawing that works just fine too because i expect you to be an excellent artist and all right scoot over not that much and draw your oral syringes with as much artistic flair as i have as long as i can see where you're marking it we're good okay so that's basically chapter nine now let's look at chapter 10 chapter 10 is calculation of parental doses so um there's a couple of different things here one is the actovile system this is a two section vial divided by a seal holding a pre-measured amount of active ingredient in the lower section and a pre-measured diluent in the upper section mixing occurs uh when the two sections of the vial are combined either through puncturing the seal or moving the seal through pressure similar to mix o-vile and then it does not give you yes it does give you a picture of that on page 193. so on page 193 that is the active vial system so if you press down on the top pressure is going to force the um stopper that's in the middle down into the bottom where the powder is and the liquid that's between the two is going to follow it and then you can mix it up and there's going to be that little rubber stopper in the middle down in your liquid but that's okay you can pretty much ignore that and just keep going an ampoule is a sealed glass container that holds a single dose of medication usually for injection and a picture of an ampoule or you might hear it called ampool is on page 188 depends on what country they went to school in and then a vial is a glass or plastic container with a metal enclosed rubber seal for injectable medications may contain single or multiple doses and that's also on page 188 next to the ampoules infusion is a slow administration of fluids other than blood into a vein intradermal is into or within the dermis then that's your skin and tuberculosis test they usually do it on the forearm and they will stick the needle just in the first couple layers of skin and when they inject it a bubble will form and then when they pull the needle out over the next few minutes or a few hours that bubble will go down and then within seven between 48 and 72 hours you have to go have it looked at again and it should have nothing happen if there's any kind of a reaction like redness or swelling or something like that then it may indicate that you may have been exposed to tuberculosis at some time in your life and they usually do more testing okay so that's intradermal and there's other types of intradermal um injections but that's one that i'm familiar with intramuscular is into or within the muscle i am intravenous is into or within a vein iv large parenteral large volume parenterals are iv bags that are larger than 250 milliliters up to about three liters parenteral is administration outside the gastrointestinal tract mostly considered to be by injection or infusion and a piggyback is a small volume iv 50 to 250 milliliters with added medication administered through an established iv line that is kept patent or opened by a continuous iv solution or by flushing subcutaneous is beneath the skin medications injected into the subcutaneous tissue they also call that sq or subcute not subacute though therapeutic range is a dosage or blood concentration range that normally produces desired results too much may be toxic and too little may not achieve the desired effect and or not be therapeutic and then we talked about vial and you have a pre-test and then we're going over to introduction on page 188 and of course there's a tech alert all medications administered by injection must be in a sterile liquid form once these medications have been injected the medication cannot be retrieved you can't get a shot out of someone's muscle so special care is needed to ensure that the medication and its dose are correct before administration and that it's sterile a lot of these medications are in a hospital are going to prepare be prepared in an iv clean room so we have an iv room that is iso 7 i believe is what the designation is um and i'm not sure exactly what iso 7 might pref might refer to millions of particles per so much amount of air i don't know um i did know once upon a time but i haven't taught that course in a while so um anyway it's clean and you have to completely garb before you go in there just like if you were going to work on the space shuttle for nasa you get garbed up and that way the medications that you prepare in there are prepared in a laminar flow hood and they stay sterile that way depending on where they're made in a satellite pharmacy that has a laminar flow hood that prepares things in a sterile environment but because it's not in a clean room we mark those with 12 hour best use times so if we make it at 9am it has to be given by 9 pm or 2 100 hours okay um so this talks about um [Music] pluses and minuses of um medication given by parenteral either in or by injection either injection or infusion and then it talks about ampules and vials and then it goes over to page 189 and there's more tech notes okay um all of the injectable medications will express weight per volume okay so it's going to be weight per volume so it's either going to be micrograms per milliliter milligrams per milliliter grams per milliliter units per milliliter milli equivalents per milliliter and occasionally grains per milliliter and really nitroglycerin is the only one i know of that is measured in grains um because all parenteral medications must be prepared using sterile techniques sterile needles and syringes must be used pharmacy staff commonly used syringes ranging from 1 to 60 milliliters in size when preparing parenteral medication tuberculin syringes and they're called tb syringes have a one milliliter capacity and are calibrated in 0.01 milliliter increments and it shows you that on figure 10.2 three milliliter syringes are calibrated in point one milliliter increments five milliliter and ten milliliter syringes are calibrated in 0.2 milliliter increments so figure 10.4 shows you that and again on page 189 there's a tech note the calibration between markings on a syringe are usually found as four spaces as in increments of 0.1 milliliter on the 3ml syringe or 0.2 milliliter on the 5ml syringe always be sure to understand the markings before using the syringe for preparing medications to ensure that the correct amount of medication is being prepared okay so for instance if you have a little syringe say it's a lure lock with a screw top and it's marked like this then you're going to have four markings and i can't draw this very well but you get the idea so if there's four markings between one and one and a half then you know that each one of those markings is going to be 0.1 okay but if you see on another syringe and there's no one and a half two and a half markings and there's four lines between the one and the two then you know that each one of those lines has to be 0.2 milliliters because there's only four of them between one and two so it has to go 0.2 0.4 0.2.4.6.8 okay and then it shows you some more of these syringes on page 190 and on page 190 it says tech note large syringes are seldom used for medication administration other than an iv push but are frequently used in the preparation of intravenous fluids and i have to throw in here that that is always true in a large community hospital that doesn't have like a separate pediatric hospital okay i work in a pediatric hospital and we almost always use large syringes to send to the unit because they have syringe pumps and we know i'm never going to take a one liter bag to a nicu unit because that one liter bag weighs 2.2 pounds that's larger than some of those babies why would i take them an iv fluid that won't even fit in their body okay so in that case we're doing a lot of our deliveries in syringes that are 10 milliliters and in 60 milliliter syringes which are bigger so a 60 milliliter syringe is this long and pretend there's an opening for a needle here and this is a syringe because this is my graduated cylinder in real life so you get the idea of what those syringes look like so unless you're in a pediatric hospital it's true that you would not send syringes necessarily to the unit except for an iv push okay the accuracy of measurement of medication decreases as the syringe size increases so we want to make sure that we choose the best syringe so if i need to measure you know one milliliter i'm not going to do it in a 60 milliliter syringe it's just not going to be as accurate as if i used a smaller syringe okay so on practice problems a on page 191 you're going to look at the amount in the syringes and you're going to say how much is in each syringe so you're learning how to read the syringes and these particular problems are marked on a line so you don't have to estimate between the lines so for instance if i need to measure [Music] 3.75 milliliters on a 5 milliliter syringe the syringe is going to be marked one two three four five and then it's going to be longer look i have lines i can work with what a hoot so if i want 3.75 so here's my one here's two here's three here's four and here's five and i'm not going to be able to mark this easily okay so pretend those are evenly spaced which they're not point two point four point six point eight so i know right in between let me change my color here come on right in between the 6 and the 8 is going to be 3.7 i think my battery just died so i know my answer is going to be just past that line okay so that would be 3.75 which is going to be in between 3.7 and 3.8 but there's no 3.7 marking so you have to imagine it between the 3.6 and 3.8 okay so we are very careful with our estimations but they're not going to be absolutely perfect okay so don't think that you're expected to know exactly where on here to market but you can figure it out and you can get really really close okay ampules and vials then it talks about the actovile and it shows you the picture of the actobile on page 193. most of the time you're going to calculate the number of milliliters to draw up your medication with it's important to know the appropriate volumes for the various routes of administration you can hang a huge bag like a two liter bottle of soda and it will last the patient you know all day usually depending on how quickly they're going through it um some patients on chemotherapy will go through a one liter bag every few hours it's you know that's kind of sad um but that's in intravenous use okay so an iv can be any size up to three liters but medications to go into the intradermal inside the skin that limit is 0.1 milliliters subcutaneously are usually less than 1 ml but could go as high as 2 ml in some instances small volume intramuscular injections are less than 3ml's and im injections into larger muscles can be up to 5 ml so if you see an intramuscular injection and it says you're going to end up with 30 milliliters okay you you can't fit 30 milliliters uh intramuscularly it your muscle won't hold that much liquid so it's going to be you know it's not going to work so you need to know that if your calculations come out with an answer that doesn't make sense you need to find out what's wrong okay did you calculate it wrong calculate it again and so the rules for calculating them are the same for oral uh liquid medications so many medications for intravenous use may not be been directly from the vial but require even further dilution in intravenous fluid before administration so this is going to partly talk about how to get the active ingredient more so than what fluid to put it in and how to calculate dilution so we're going to get into dilutions um i think it's chapter 12 no no chapter 12 is age body weight and body surface area that's a fun chapter okay and there's some more tech alerts on page 195 if the answer to a dose calculation does not agree with an anticipated answer based on the amount of medication prescribed the dose of medication on hand or the intended route of administration always recalculate ask for assistance if necessary okay sometimes there are drugs that come as say a three milliliter milliliter vial of caffeine we actually draw up caffeine for infants and they can take it orally or or it can be given intravenously that's because caffeine helps their heart beat harder and it helps kind of remind them to breathe it kind of wakes them up just like it does adults um so believe it or not premature infants oftentimes are given injectable caffeine so you know it is a drug just like other drugs um so when you see that vial of caffeine it's only three milliliters so if you're preparing it for an infant you're probably going to get many doses out of one vial and you would not probably need to use four or five vials if you're asked to use more than one for an infant something's wrong you need to ask about that because the whole thing is going to be 60 milligrams which is almost a cup of coffee okay so um at least home brewed coffee maybe not starbucks but you get the idea okay so these are calculated the same way so um let's look at page 199 just looking at number 10 as an example i should mark this chapter 10. and i'm going to look at number 10 here page 199 number 10 and it shows you a label and the prescribed or what what our order is is cleoson or clindamycin 0.25 grams intramuscular stat then every eight hours so you're gonna give one dose now and then after that every eight hours so then it wants you to interpret the order and so we just said what it is 0.25 grams intramuscular stat which means now but you know as close as we can get it then every eight hours now this is an injection or it's an infusion actually and it's given in a hospital we usually mix clindamycin in uh normal saline so you're not going to have to tell the patient and you know infuse cleoson this many milliliters intramuscular now and then every eight hours so you don't really have to worry about that so much but you still need to have like the verb don't worry too much about the verb because it's going to be on your label when you get it anyway [Music] but you still need to make sure that it's going to the correct route and that the drug is correct and then you're going to have to calculate that dosage so looking at your clio sin you have a two milliliter vial and there's 300 milligrams in two milliliters and it's 150 milligrams per milliliter so the first thing is interpret the order which we just did and then what volume of medication is needed for one dose okay so we have 0.25 grams is our order and we that's what we want to give but if you look on the label it says 300 milligrams per 2 ml and the right underneath that it says 150 milligrams per milliliter which is one milliliter i want to use that because then i don't have to do a lot of dividing later so as i set this up i'm going to take the 1 ml's contains 150 milligrams now my dose here is given in grams so i need a conversion factor in between you can put it at the end but i like to put it in the in between because then i can see milligrams to grams so 1 000 milligrams is equal to 1 gram and we want to give the patient 0.25 grams and to finish up my little fraction i'm just going to put it over one the grams cancel the milligrams cancel i'm left with milliliters which is what i'm looking for so that's good so on the top i have one times a thousand times point two five and i get if i could enter this in my calculator correctly times .25 i get 250 and on the bottom i have 150 times 1 times 1 which is 150 and that gives me divided by 150 equals 1.666 milliliters and that 6 just keeps repeating but we're going to round it and looking on these syringes i could probably get to 1.6 i might be able to get to 1.7 since i told you guys at the beginning of the semester that i want to see two decimal places i'm going to do my approximately equals 1.67 milliliters and then you're going to look for that on your syringe and it says indicate the correct amount of medication on the appropriate syringe so then you're going to have to ask yourself which syringe would i use to measure this with and i have to tell you we don't use a 1 ml syringe to measure all of one milliliter usually some hospitals might but we don't we will go up to 0.99 and after that we go to a 3ml syringe and then that will measure amounts up to 3 milliliters and we could measure a whole three milliliters but i like to measure a whole three milliliters and a five ml syringe and your your pharmacist you know you can ask them what do you prefer i use or you ask your fellow technicians or ask your charge nurse or whoever's training you when you get in the field because you know they there's there i could measure 1.6 milliliters in a 10 ml syringe but it's not going to be quite as accurate so let's look at the smaller syringe which is the 3ml most of the time we're going to go with the syringe that is the next size up from the amount that we want so i can't measure 1.67 in a 1ml syringe but i can measure it in a 3ml syringe so i'm going to go to the 3mls and it gives you the markings right in your book so i'm going to go just past the 1.5 or the one and a half the next line down is 1.6 the next line down is 1.7 so i'm going to measure between 1.6 and 1.7 and it needs to be a little bit closer to 1.7 than it is to 1.6 and that's what i'm gonna mark for that problem okay i think there was something i missed a little farther back nope okay okay so i think it's on page 201 where it talks about reconstitution and in the middle of page 201 is a tech note the directions on the label should be read carefully first and followed exactly to prevent errors in the reconstitution process parenteral medications that are unstable in liquid form for extended periods of time are manufactured in a powdered form for reconstitution before use the manufacturer's label states the total quantity of drug in the container it's going to state it by weight so it'll be either in milligrams or grams the volume and type of diluent to use to attain the desired strength and they usually will say something like 8.6 milliliters of sterile water the final strength of the medication after reconstitution and the stability and storage requirements before and after reconstitution to reconstitute a medication follow the instructions on the medication label exactly before using the dry medication must be completely dissolved in the diluent you never want to use it if it has chunks of powder floating in it and then it talks about the actoviles and then it after that it says with injectable medications the manufacturer may recommend the use of either sterile water for injection or sterile normal saline some drugs will be reconstituted in d5w some drugs may require bacteriostatic water for intramuscular injections that has an added ingredient usually similar to alcohol that is used to make sure that no germs grow in that vial or even require specific diluents such as those with a small amount of anesthetic to prevent discomfort with intramuscular administration when a special diluent is necessary this diluent may be packaged separately and supplied with the medication as with some immunizations if the solution for reconstitution is not indicated consult a drug reference remember that the final volume of medication will always be greater than the amount of volume of diluent added because of powder volume again except for vancomycin once the appropriate diluent has been identified the amount of diluent for the desired dose must be verified vials of some multi-dose parenteral drugs may be diluted with different volumes to attain different concentrations for different routes of administration as shown in the pfizer pin label in figure 10.8 okay now down at page 201 at the bottom is a tech alert and this is really important because we have purchasers who just spend all day looking for medications to purchase for the hospital in fact one of my fellow instructors at valley college is a purchaser and she's also an instructor that um that i try to emulate because she's she's pretty smart and she's really good at this so this is important because it says never assume that the directions are the same as the last time that you use this medication read the directions every time the medication is reconstituted first of all they could change whether they have an added ingredient so the powder volume might be different even though the ndc number is the same or you might not be able to get the one you got before from a cord pharmacy or pfizer and you have to go with one from you know literally or some other drug company hospira okay in that case they may decide that they're going to go with something that they don't want to put a certain excipient in it which is an added ingredient that's not the main ingredient so um if they don't put those ingredients in there you might end up with a different powder volume so it's important that you read the directions every time okay um look at page 202 pfizer pin penicillin g potassium for injection now it has all the same things on the previous drug bottle labels that we looked at except it also tells you the usual dosage and right here it gives a handy dandy chart to tell you if you want different concentrations you're going to add different amounts of diluent so for if you and for instance if you added 18.2 milliliters of sterile water for injection i think that's what it says to use well it says uh look at the package insert if you add 18.2 milliliters this is page 202 and this is 10.8 then your um concentration is going to be 250 000 units per milliliter if you add 8.2 milliliters your concentration is going to be 500 000 units per milliliter and if you add 3.2 milliliters of diluent your concentration is going to be 1 million units per milliliter and then it says buffered with sodium citrate and it gives a space there on the label for you to write the patient the room number and the date that you diluted it because if it's prepared in a clean room they might be able to get multiple doses out of it and then it says labels showing the volume of diluent necessary for reconstituting to a particular strength when multiple doses are a possibility okay so that's um diluent volume and then it gives the concentration so using this we could probably figure out what the powder volume is right it doesn't tell you how much your total volume is going to be so i have a whole worksheet on this and i think i'm going to give a couple of problems out of it as homework because or as a lab because i like this particular worksheet so let's look at the 18.2 okay so this whole vial contains 5 million units 5 million units okay so we in order to know the powder volume we have to take the total volume and minus the diluent volume and that will give us the powder volume right well i don't have the total volume i have the total strength which is 5 million units so if i add 18.2 milliliters and i get a concentration of 250 units per milliliter i can solve for milliliters and that will give me the total volume so i want volume i'm looking for milliliters so i'm going to say one milliliter contains 250 000 units times 18.2 oh i'm sorry not the volume i want to know those units and the whole vial contains 5 million units because i'm solving for milliliters i'm just putting that over 1. okay so the units are going to cancel each other out and on top i have 5 million and on the bottom i have 250 000 and that's going to give me the total volume so handy dandy calculator count my zeros five comma zero zero zero zero zero zero divided by two fifty zero zero zero and that gives me 20 milliliters in the entire vial okay if i use 18.2 milliliters of diluent so now i have my total volume 20 ml minus my diluent which is 18.2 milliliters i get 1.8 milliliters of my powder volume now this is important to know how to figure out because let's say that i needed to put this amount of drug in a larger volume and we do this sometimes with cleoson we will pre um dilute these and add mix them to 12 milligrams per milliliter and when we do that it comes out to a specific volume and then we know um the most common clio sins are 300 or 600 or 900 and we can put those in 25 50 or 75 milliliters and pre-mix it and then we can if we use it within 12 hours we can get multiple doses out of it so we do that quite a bit and the psizer penicillin is at our hospital we prepare it for specific patients and they're either going to get the whole 5 million units in 100 milliliters of uh dextrose d5w they get that as a loading dose and then every eight hours they get half of that dose which is um which is the 2.5 million units and 50 milliliters and we send those for specific patients for a certain period of time okay so that's how i figure the powder volume when i don't know the total volume so that's a good thing to know this is not the book doesn't ask you to calculate this without knowing the total volume but i want to show that to you because that could be on your national exam okay so page 204 page 205 all goes into more pfizer pen in fact page 204 is a 20 million unit vial and then your post test which i think we went over everything that's on your post test and that looks good okay another thing when you're calculating millie equivalents and this is at the bottom of page 210 yes it's on your post test number 10 do a lot of number 10s in this chapter it gives you a vial of potassium chloride 20 milli equivalents and we make these bags all day long a physician orders kcl 20 meqs and one liter of iv fluids for a patient with electrolyte imbalance um this is really common in patients in the hospital it's just you're sick you're in the hospital and one of the things that gets low first for some reason is potassium so we prepare this bag for patients and you look at the vial and you want to give 20 milli equivalents you're just going to pretend that that that the calculation is the same as it would be for milligrams because it is so if there's 40 milli equivalents in 20 in 20 ml and then it tells you in parentheses two milli equivalents well not me g's and eqs in one ml so this makes perfect sense because 40 divided by 20 is 2. and then it says what is the milli equivalent strength of this vial the strength is 40 milli equivalents in the whole vial what is the total volume of medication in the vial 20 milliliters what is the total amount milli equivalents of medication in the vial um oh that's the 40 milligrams so when it's the first question is actually what is the meq per ml strength of this vial so that would be two milli equivalents in one ml total volume again 20 what's the amount of milli equivalents 40 what volume of medication should be added to the liter of iv fluids for this order you're going to use half of that you want 20 milli equivalents so um 1 ml contains 2 and again my stylist needs new batteries and i have some but i was hoping to get through this chapter and we want 40. no we don't want 40 what do we want we want 20 meqs any queues cancel 20 divided by 2 equals 10 milliliters and then you're going to indicate the amount on the following syringe so you're just going to mark the 10 milliliter mark on your syringe okay so um another thing is looking at that potassium chloride if you're looking at something that contains phosphates for instance there is a potassium acetate and sodium phosphate as well these are all electrolytes the sodium phosphate will give you the milli equivalents of sodium and then the millimoles of phosphate so again it's the same thing if you're looking at millimoles you just want to know how many millimoles in one milliliter and then you can use it to calculate how many milliliters to give a different amount of millimoles okay so um you know you don't need to worry too much about what is a melee equivalent what is a millimole millimole has to do with avogadro's number mili equivalence has to do with the valence of the electrons in this electrolyte because it's an electrolyte so they are you know they deal with the the things that keep your body going our bodies are electrical so um it has to do with the the chemical the charge of the chemical so um but no the most important thing to know about that is you can't convert millie equivalents to milligrams or to millimoles you can't they're not interchangeable you've got apples oranges and you have pomelos over there so you they don't mix okay you can't because they're going to be different for every compound so you might have one milliliter having this many millimoles and then another compound will have one milliliter having a different amount of millimoles so you can't go back and forth between milligrams milli equivalents and milli moles they're all separate okay so do you have any questions on the chapter roger uh no i'm pretty pretty good guys it's you want us to draw them if you don't want to write in the book because this book's not mine but yes yeah and i don't expect you to be an artist as long as i can see where the markings are we're good okay in fact if you want to photocopy a syringe and then cut it out and then use it as a template to draw around that would be a little too much work so don't worry about that all right so that's chapter 9 and 10 which i was supposed to cover last week but um i'm adding a little time to this because of last week not having a zoom meeting so um so we're good i'm going to stop recording here if i can figure out how oh i have to stop sharing first there we go you", "SB5e0XlV0_I": "so thanks so much for joining me here today and welcome if you're new here today I'm going to be talking about what I bought during the Black Friday sales I tried to be good I didn't go too crazy and I did try to stick with the plan so let's go ahead and jump right in to what I purchased and then at the end of the video or actually I should say the bulk of the video is what I have received lately during PR I've received some really special things some things I'm really excited about so I am really excited to talk to you guys about what I have received I know some of you may not enjoy the PR portions of these videos so that's why I'm putting it at the end and I will leave the timestamp for when the PR begins so that if you want to skip that you'll know exactly when that happens so let's go ahead and jump into what I purchase for the Black Friday sales you will not be surprised to know that I repurchase the pollak I cleansing cream I'm not too sure how many times I've purchased this but it is one of my absolute favorite cleansers of all time I love the beautiful rose scent of this cream this does have Hawaiian salt in here which is going to help balance your skin with all the minerals that you will find in the Hawaiian salt there's hibiscus in here which is a natural source of AAAS there's also seaweed extract in here and like I said the rose hydrosol which gives it that beautiful rose scent but it's not overpowering so you don't need to worry about it being too strongly scented it's got a beautiful texture it is creamy but it kind of lathers up just slightly when you emulsify it with the water beautiful I love this product so much that's why I repurchase it I also repurchased one of my favorite masks of all time the Moana mask this mask is a clarifying mask as well as a beautiful nurturing mask it gives really great hydration and moisturization while it's doing its clarifying because it has clays in here it has French green clay it also has Hawaiian honey and aloe so it's got the clarifying properties from the clay and it's going to give you hydration from the aloe and the honey there's also lahu kaki I hope I'm saying that right that is a skin healing plant used centuries in Hawaii in traditional Hawaiian medicine it's got Lehmann koa which is Hawaiian spirulina which is high in antioxidants and then it's got a beautiful scent of neroli jasmine and rose which I just really really love it's very subtle again not very overpowering and I just go back to it time and time again because it just feels so good feels so nurturing I don't feel like I'm overdoing it with my skin yet it's very efficacious in his clarifying properties and I just I love it I can't say enough good things about it in my order kapooya very generously gave me her newly how refreshing face mist and this I am absolutely in love with the scent of this is out of this world I am so in love with it it has got sandalwood hydrosol in here vetiver root oil blue tansy oil and neroli oil in here now I know I've said over and over and over again that I am NOT a big fan of blue tansy but to me I actually cannot smell the blue tansy in here very much if at all I get the blend of sandalwood and vetiver in here and it is just perfection sometimes vetiver can be a little bit on the powdery side but this is just more just like pure and green and combined with the sandalwood and I actually don't really want to spray it right now because I don't want to waste it because it is kind of a small bottle and I know this is in limited quantities at least for the time being so I really don't want to waste it and I actually have been using this not so much as a face mist but to just kind of spray around me for the aroma therapeutic benefits it calms your mind it gives you mental clarity and peace and that is what is written on the website and I could not agree more I just I get such a feeling of relaxation and just and like kapooya says on the website just that peaceful feeling so that is actually how I've been using it it also is going to for your skin it does give you hydration because there's hell uronic acid in here the witch hazel is going to help tighten and tone your skin I have so many toners going that I don't really feel the need to use this on my skin I'm gonna use my other toners for that I am going to save this for the aromatherapy benefits because the scent of this is just absolute heaven I just am in love with it and I hope that Kokua keeps making it and I hope that it comes in a much bigger size because I would definitely purchase this in the future if this was a gift like I said with my purchase but I would gladly purchase this in the future because the vetiver and the sandal and I'm assuming the vetiver I know that vetiver is grown in Hawaii so I'm assuming the vetiver is from Hawaii the sandalwood is from Hawaii and you know and I just love supporting Honua and everything that they do in terms of supporting Hawaiian farms and what they stand for so that is what I got from Honua all right so I can already tell that this is going to be a long video so press pause grab a cup of tea because we've got a lot to get through here moving on to live botanical I did get Carolyn's anointing oils I got her garden and prairie set which came in this little box here and these are what the roller balls look like just kind of this standard roller balls that you would find in an oil-based roll-on and before we start talking about the sense that are in the garden prairie set I do want to make mention that these are special limited edition for the holidays and Carolyn spent all year wild harvesting locally these beautiful flowers and she has extracted the floral essences through and flourish and maceration so these did take a lot of time and energy and effort to create and so I'm very very excited about these that Carolyn did create these let's talk about the Jasmine and honey one first this has jasmine and Clary sage and lavender and I would consider this a Jasmine Sola floor because it really is a Jasmine forward fragrance but when you put it on your skin it's a Jasmine that wears very close to the skin so it's not a Jasmine that's going to like Bowl you over it's not going to blow everybody around you away and say oh my gosh who's wearing a super strong jasmine fragrance I would say it's just very gentle I think there's vanilla here as well that gives that honey jasmine experience to it I don't really get a huge sense of the Clary sage and lavender so for me this isn't a super herbally Jasmine fragrance it's just a very soft Jasmine very wearable if you're a person who likes jasmine and you like to wear Jasmine perfume but you don't like to wear something that's super strong super heady I do highly recommend this I think on the website Carolyn does describe this as a heady fragrance but to me I don't get a super heady experience from this to me it does feel like I said very wearable and now that I have it on my skin a little bit longer I do feel like there is maybe a little hint of the Clary sage coming through I just I'm not getting a lot of the lavender in it but anyway just to sum it up I think it's a very lovely pretty Jasmine that I think a lot of people would be attracted to so I'm just gonna leave that at that I do highly recommend it if you are a Jasmine fan so let's move on to the wild Rosen meadow this is the second fragrance that is part of the garden and prairie set this is really really beautiful this to me smells like you are in a summertime meadow that is just brimming with wild roses it has chamomile in here and it has a yarrow there's also geranium in here but I actually don't get a huge hit of geranium geranium typically can overpower fragrances I really do not get a lot of geranium in here really if at all to me it really expresses the wild rose chamomile and also the yarrow and I really love the word uncultivated that Carolyn uses to describe the yarrow on the website because that just gives you that sense of just kind of like that wild meadow that I was talking about in the summertime when things are getting kind of dry and you just smell that yarrow just in the air you don't even have to start walking through the the meadow you can just like you just sense it like the bees are buzzing and you kind of like feel it in the air that's the sense I get from this perfume and it's really really lovely so if you like chamomile and you like kind of more of that Wild Rose smell I would highly recommend the wild rose and meadow perfume it's just the perfect name for it it you know the name is what the perfume smells like so if you want to bring some summertime into the winter doldrums then I highly recommend this beautiful anointing oil that Carolyn has created I think both of them are really lovely like I said with the Jasmine and honey same thing with the wild rose and meadow because it is a natural perfume based in oil it does where close to the skin so I think these are both very appropriate to wear to work to keep in your bag just anoint yourself with this beautiful fragrance that is mostly for you or somebody who's going to be close to you and not like blow other people away with your fragrance so now let's move on to Laurel skin and what I got from Laurel during the Black Friday sale I actually have not opened these up yet so these are still in there paper wrapping I got two Hydra salts from her so let's see what this one is all right this is the California rose now this one is still available on the website this is a single farm artisan distilled California damn esc' rose hydrosol pure organic and I have not sprayed this one yet so we are going to experience this together yes just very beautiful love it and super super special so Lauren what Laurel has done with this yeah this just smells amazing and what Laurel has done with this is like I said this is all coming from a farm in California so yeah this just smells amazing and I really respect what Laurel is doing getting the roses from a local farm and as I mentioned this is still available on her website feels great on the skin smells beautiful love what Laurel is doing with that and then this second one here that I'm opening unfortunately is not available anymore this sold out pretty quickly I believe this is the forest bath and this has ponderosa pine Douglas fir eucalyptus and sandalwood and I'm going to spray this on other arm yeah oh this smells amazing this is beautiful and I know she created this to feel like you are bathing in the forest and it smells incredible so I don't want to talk about this one too much since it's not available I do know that Carolyn of live botanical is creating something maybe kind of similar for the winter solstice so you'll want to keep an eye out on her website as something like this is intriguing to you because yes this is amazing and I'm super happy to have it so I ended up making a purchase from Lavina and I was enticed by Aloha Jen Thank You Jen for this enabling I saw that Lavina was doing a I think 25 percent off for Black Friday and I was really intrigued by their blue butterfly mask after I saw Jen talking about it I think it was on her best of 2019 roundup this is what the jar looks like and this is what the mask looks like it's a pretty incredible blue color and I'm pretty sure that the blue comes from blue spirulina I'm not exactly sure what creates this blue color but I'm going to assume it's the blue spirulina there's no dyes in the ingredient list that I can see and interestingly it to me it smells like vanilla frosting and again reading the ingredient list I have no idea what is causing the vanilla smell in here but to me it smells like vanilla frosting so there's deep sea minerals in here plant stem cells pre and probiotics this is going to exfoliate your skin boost collagen increase hydration I have only used it once and you just leave it on your skin for 10 minutes and then rinse it off or wipe it off with it with a cloth my skin felt great afterwards again I've only used it once so I can't really attest to you know long-term results or how I feel about using it you know many many times so I will report back after using it over a few months but my first impression is good I can't say that I noticed anything like really phenomenal after that one-time use but I'm not going to judge a product after using it just time so I really did like it but I'm going to reserve judgment after using it several times they did send me as a gift a product that has not been released yet this is their Dragon's Blood vitamin C cleansing oil now this I have really been enjoying I've used it about 5 or 6 times now and I don't know exactly what's in here except for of course the dragon's blood and the vitamin C I have never used anything that has Dragon's Blood in it so I'm not exactly sure what Dragon's Blood smells like but this smell to me it smells like a really intense tropical fruit like to me it smells like a really concentrated maybe guava or passionfruit I'm not exactly sure so I kind of think maybe there's something like that in here as well but again I'm not exactly sure what dragon's blood smells like but it has a very like pungent tropical fruit smell I love the texture of this it's very thick and kind of bouncy and it does emulsify off so I really appreciate that this is a very thick oil cleanser that does completely emulsify off but it doesn't strip your skin at all and it still leaves your skin very soft so I've really been enjoying this the one thing I would say though is I don't love the fact that it has this dropper to dispense the product though when you pump it there's just a tiny little bit that gets into the dropper so I have to dispense it maybe three or four times to get as much product as I would like out of here and then you kind of have to use you know two hands to do it I would much prefer a pump just a regular pump to get the product out so while it looks beautiful it's not super user friendly I would say so that's the only criticism I have of this product so that's the feedback that I would give to Lavina is just to change the dispensing mechanism of it otherwise I really really love this product and then they also sent me their palette this is the eye magic palette so it comes in the box like this which i think is really pretty and this is what the palette looks like just a gorgeous palette and I had been talking about how I was really interested in green eye shadows and luckily this palette actually has a couple of green shadows in here there's this one here which is kind of more of a teal color and then this one here which is more of an emerald green I'm not sure if you can see the depth of this color with the lighting going on here but I actually have it on today so I have the green on hopefully you can see what it looks like I did experience some fallout because this is actually quite glittery way more glittery than I had imagined it was going to be so the color actually the green pigment didn't fall out on to my skin but the actual glitter did so it actually looks kind of cool for a nighttime look a holiday look but this is not these kind of the the shimmery glittery colors are not ones that I would wear for daytime at all because first of all they they do reflect quite a bit so for me that's not something I would feel comfortable wearing during the daytime but for nighttime parties or whatever that it's just absolutely perfect so like I said I do have kind of like some shimmers that that did fall out here I but I do think it looks kind of fun and festive but again not something that I would wear during the daytime so just to be aware of that you might want to do that little trick where you put tape under your eyes while you're doing your eye makeup so then the the little sparklies lifts right off after you've done your eye makeups so that's it from what I actually purchased I did get a couple of gift with purchases as I mentioned but let's move into the true PR that I was sent so the first one I want to talk about is velvet and sweet pea and I'm kind of reluctant to actually call this PR because I have known Lorrie Stern who is the creator the perfumer behind velvet sweepy I've known her for about 10 years now ever since I started as scent high which was my original all-natural perfume blog I've known her for so long I've never met her in real life but I feel like this is more of just a gift of thanks that she sent me for supporting her and not so much PR it just PR kind of sounds really impersonal for the relationship that I have with Laurie so she was so lovely to send me these and the first one I want to talk about is her lilac body frosting fortunately I got a picture of this before my cat knocked this off the counter and it's kind of funny she is such a huge cat lover just animal lover she just she's also a huge activist and animal rights activist so it's kind of apropos that my it was my cat who actually knocked this off the counter but you can see that it kind of it broke the cat broke but anyway this is what it looks like just super cute just kind of like vintage design that Laurie has here what she has done is used a lilac and flourish to create this body frosting and it just smells so gorgeous she has several of these body frostings she has I think it's blood orange and she has gardenia and has gorgeous cashmere rose which is just out of this world you've got to go check out her website it is so fun and just like whimsical to go and check out her website her products are very expensive this jar of the body frosting is $40 it is worth every single penny though it's just such a gorgeous experience this one is more expensive because it is limited edition than her other body frostings but if you've never tried alors eastern velvet and sweet pea perfume her body frostings are a great introduction to what she has to offer she also sent me one of her solid perfumes and it came in this cute little velvet pouch and the name I hope I'm gonna say the name correctly its mystery dove wale I think and this little guy and like I said her products are quite expensive this little solid is $70 but it is so stunning it has sandalwood and osmanthus and as you know I love osmanthus it's just this one in particular is just super juicy with the apricot going on in here and the sandalwood is just so deep and resinous and creamy it's just it's absolutely gorgeous there's also horas butter in here which is going to have like kind of a violet aspect to it there's Italian blood orange and it's also really leathery which is just super as I said in my Instagram post it's just kind of super sexy for this time of year it's just a really gorgeous special fragrance and thank you so much Laurie for sending these to me just such an incredible package to receive and yeah just go check out her website because what she creates is really really special and unlike what anybody else is doing in natural perfumery and if you cannot afford her perfumes which are incredibly expensive not too many people can't afford what she creates and if you can afford one of her body frostings and I highly highly recommend getting one she also does have a few perfumes that aren't a part of like her luxe line that are less expensive and they are really beautiful as well so just go check out and see what Laurie does the next package that I got from PR was from land craft wellness I had never heard of them before and they are from New York and they have like a brewery and a farm and they have branched out into CBD they are farming their own hemp and their products are super impressive so they have a whole line of CBD wellness products and let's talk about the first one that I'm really enjoying and this is their cocoa butter body cream this is really amazing so this has full spectrum and let's just say all of their products are full spectrum CVD so this has full spectrum CBD cocoa butter organic arnica peppermint and just opening this up it smells really really beautiful fantastic actually for this time of year with this peppermint smell it's kind of on the thin side it's not as thick as I thought it would be it's really I don't want to say it's watery but it spreads really thinly and I actually kind of like it because then it absorbs very quickly on whatever part of your body you want to get the therapeutic benefits from the CBD this package actually came at a perfect time because I play a lot of tennis as you guys may or may not know so I have a lot of aches and pains pretty frequently and I had this weird kind of pain at the front of my hip and I put the cocoa butter all over that part of my body and I went to bed and when I woke up the next morning it was gone might have been a coincidence but I do think that this body cream actually had something to do with it and let's just talk about price for a moment the cocoa butter cream is the most expensive product this is $74.99 they also sent me their sports recovery gel which is $34.99 and this has capsicum eucalyptus peppermint cinnamon and white camper bar so this comes in a little bit different of a delivery method you know it has the pump here so this would be great to keep in your sports bag this also is on the thin side as well so it absorbs very quickly this too I have also used and I have found great relief with it as well I have put this on my elbow because I do get some tennis elbow and I have found this to be very therapeutic as well I also really have enjoyed this healthy sleep body balm so this comes in a stick form and this has let's see olive coconut shea jojoba rose hip and neem and this is $24.99 I have found this one to be super effective I really like the delivery system of this I've actually used this as a lip balm under my nose it gets really really dry and chapped during the winter it doesn't matter if I have a cold or not or if I'm blowing my nose a lot or not for whatever reason under my nose gets really irritated so I've been using this under my nose so I've just been you know taking my finger here and just putting this right under my nose and I feel like not only does it help relieve the irritation and the dryness but I get a little bit of that CBD therapeutic benefit at nighttime and they sent me their lip butter which is $11.99 has shea cocoa butter rosehip seed oil and avocado butter in it so far I've only used this one time it's a really nice lip butter I need to use it more to report back on what I think about it I'm pretty picky about my lip balms lip butters and so I will use this more and report back and then finally they also sent me their tincture and I have used tinctures in the past I have the modern medicinals that I use very frequently that is created here in Oregon this one has the same amount of milligrams of CBD it's 600 milligrams in a one ounce and what I typically do at night time if I feel like I just need a little help falling asleep I will just take a little bit and just kind of dab a few drops just like under my lip so I kind of get like that buccal delivery of the oil and if I feel like I'm getting kind of like headachy at nighttime or I just need a little bit of extra help falling asleep I will use that and I have used that maybe two or three nights and I feel like it's really helped me to fall asleep and get a good night's sleep so overall I've been very impressed with these land craft products I feel like they have a great variety of delivery systems you know ranging from this body cream to the sports gel to this balm and I'm super impressed so I highly recommend them I think the scents are really great they're not overpowering I actually do think that the price points are really reasonable as well I think the body cream is a little bit on the expensive side but I think this is gonna last me for quite a while I'm not exactly sure how long it's gonna last but I feel like if this can last me up to six months then I do think that the price point is worth it and compared to things like Lourdes Jones which in my mind is overpriced I think this is very competitive and if I'm remembering correctly is much less expensive and I'm not super drawn to those brands anyway that are trying to market CBD kind of like high-end and luxury this definitely seems to be more my jam kind of more like down-home more focused on the farming end of it all of that I this is definitely more what I am drawn to so so far I highly recommend the land craft CBD products and of course I will link all that information below so moving on to a brand that you guys have probably seen on Instagram quite a bit or you know social media quite a bit is strange bird founded by Tina Chow Rudolph she is actually first generation chinese-american and so she is really rooted in Chinese beauty traditions so that is what she is bringing to the table here when it comes to the ingredients that she is using the three ingredients that she calls her G team are goji berry ginseng and ginger and the goji berry is loaded with amino acid and is a very good hydrator the ginseng is going to help boost collagen and is anti-inflammatory and then the ginger is an antioxidant and antiseptic so it's going to help especially if you have acneic skin so those three ingredients are in every single product let's start talking about the serum and so this is $88 so the price point is pretty expensive on this line I actually really did like the serum I think it soaks in to the skin very well and it plays well with other products the one thing I will say with this line is the scent is pretty strong and I feel like I don't really jive quite that well with this scent it's kind of sweet and fruity and I think that when I was watching I think it was Andy from Andy the green queen she said that maybe it kind of had like a candy scent and I couldn't really put my finger on what my experience was or how to describe it but that I would agree with her that it kind of has like a fruity candy smell and for some reason there's just kind of a disconnect with this scent and what I kind of want the experience to be I'm just not quite sure what it is I think Andy reached out to Tina about the smell and Tina has said the scent is purely coming from that that G team trio the the goji berry the ginseng and the ginger so maybe it is just the sweetness of those three ingredients together that's causing kind of like that that creates that fruity smell but the smell unfortunately just isn't for me so even though I enjoyed the serum and how it works and everything unfortunately this scent is just at this point in time is just gonna be a no-go for me and kind of the same thing with the lotion and I'll show you what the box looks like so you can just see the packaging I mean I really love the packaging the design like the branding and everything that Tina's about I really love it and I love like her Instagram and and just everything that she's putting forth into the world I really really love so I would love it maybe if she did tinker with the scent a little bit or maybe created this same product but unscented or maybe she'll come up with more products that just has a different scent profile or something I'm just I'm curious to see what else she comes out with but the moisturizer again just beautiful packaging love it love the ingredients even though I really like this texture of the moisturizer it feels great and soaks into the skin yeah this scent I just can't jive with it I don't know if any of you guys grew up with baby aspirin or if you can remember what baby aspirin smells like it smells like baby aspirin to me or maybe even like Flintstones chewable vitamins it just kind of has that smell so I'm kind of sad about this scent but let's talk about the cleanser because the cleanser actually is a hit for me the cleanser does have the smell but because I am rinsing it off the smell doesn't bother me in the cleanser so the cleanser is actually a three-in-one it's a cleanser a mask and an exfoliator so it kind of has like a milky cleanser type experience and it lathers up just very gently so it acts as a foaming cleanser but it's very very gentle it's a beautiful experience because it has the exfoliating property to it but it leaves your skin feeling so smooth and silky it has Kalyn clay it's got almond oil and jojoba oil so it's just a very unique experience and I'm always intrigued by cleansers that have unique textures and just give you a different experience from other cleansers that you've used so while it does have the same scent as the serum and the moisturizer it does seem to be a little bit milder and it rinses off and it does not linger on my skin interestingly this is $58 which I do feel like is a little bit steep for what this is but that's just my personal opinion I don't know I've just I was just a little bit struck by the fact that this is a $58 cleanser I mean I know that they're also promoting this as a mask as well but $58 just seems a little bit high to me but having said this I do really enjoy this cleanser I just don't know if I would see myself purchasing this in the future at $58 honestly I would probably wait for some kind of a sale to happen if I were to purchase that on my own all right so moving on Coquina was so lovely to send me their new candle this was in collaboration with you Lily they also collaborated with you Lily on their first candle this is $69 and I think this would make a beautiful beautiful gift and I would have included this in my gift idea video if I had received this in time this is their taru daunt candle and I don't know if I'm saying that correctly but this was named after the Southern Moroccan City and it has notes of neroli Laurel basil and rosemary so this is what the box looks like obviously the box is beautiful and just adds to that effect of it being a wonderful gift and then this is what the candle itself looks like and the vessel that the candle comes in are all handmade and hand glazed in casablanca and you lilies founder his name is omar benji loon i don't know if i'm saying that correctly but I'm guessing it's Benji loon he uses scented memories of his childhood in Morocco as his influence for these scents and he studied perfumery at the grass Institute of perfume in France and this smells heavenly and it's interesting but not one of these notes actually just stands out and you can tell that a master perfumer created this smell because they're all blended so beautifully together and it just smells like a sunny gorgeous day at the beach I can just imagine what it's like to be in this beautiful town of tartar oh don't Tara don't again I don't know how to say that word how to say the name of that city but it smells gorgeous and just look at this I mean so beautiful it just looks beautiful and just holding it feels amazing I just I can't bring myself to light this candle quite yet because I just want to stare at how gorgeous this is and I loved the candle that Coquina sent me the first time around their first release but then unfortunately my son broke it so I'm so glad to have this candle thank you so much Coquina for sending this to me I will treasure this and I will make sure that hopefully my son or my cat doesn't knock this off the counter and break this I'm going to make sure that this is in a safe place so the next thing I'm going to talk about is the mask from flower and spice this is the beauty masquerade this is their new limited edition and flower and spice is a brand from the Netherlands and Carmen is the formulator and it comes in this beautiful apothecary bottle this is a dry mask you can mix it with whatever you want to you can mix it with water carbon also says you can mix it with kombucha you can then also once you've got it wet you can mix it with honey yogurt anything that you want too it's got Rasul and white Kalyan clay hibiscus tumeric ginseng lemongrass there's also some black pepper seed oil in here which I'm assuming is going to help with circulation I have not used this yet so I cannot speak to my experience using this mask yet but it smells delicious and I'm really looking forward to using this so I just wanted to mention that I got this thank you again to flower and spice and I will get back to you all on my experience with it in a later video so we're getting close to the end here I just have two more things to talk about I want to mention LOC OS this is actually a Portland brand which is pretty exciting again another beautiful box here this would make a lovely gift and this is what the bottle looks like so beautiful I think there's something like 15 different oils in here and I'm not gonna read all of them but my favorites are camellia Argan prickly pear seed oil evening primrose oil there's also sea buckthorn oil in here sea buckthorn co2 I believe and like I mentioned they are Portland based and they are made in micro batches here in Portland all of the oils are organic I have really been enjoying using this when I do wash ah I haven't really talked about Gua Sha and my gosh our routine I will be talking about that later I've been wanting to save that for my anti-aging quote-unquote anti-aging Update routine because I really feel like that's been making a big difference but I thought I would just mention that here that this is a beautiful oil to use for Gua Sha its oil also is really beautiful to use overtop retinols because if you do experience any dryness or irritation with your retinol use this really helps bring back moisture into your skin with all the amazing oils that are in here there is a relatively strong scent of jasmine so I'll get this scent experienced while I'm using the Gua Sha typically in the morning before I shower and then I'll end up using an oil cleanser on top of it in the shower and then it all rinses off so sometimes it can be a little bit too strong for me to leave on my skin all through the day or at night time that's why I really like using this for Gua Sha during the day I do typically end up removing that oil and I don't have it on for the rest of the day so this has been really good for that for me price-wise it is $108 so yes it is expensive i think presentation-wise you're getting a very gorgeous bottle you're paying for this lovely presentation of this gorgeous box so if that kind of thing is really important to you then you are going to be paying that premium price and it is loaded with very expensive costly oils so there is that this portion of the video is the PR portion of video so clearly this was gifted to me by the brand so I don't know if I would necessarily purchase that myself but I do think that it is a gorgeous oil and again it's up to you to decide whether or not you think it is truly worth 108 dollars so finally I want to talk about a brand called heart and soil the founders name is Katie and she reached out to me a few weeks ago and I just received her package which is basically a bag full of her mini and she's based in Pennsylvania and I just want to give a little bit of background about her she studied horticulture and landscape design but ended up finding herself in school for herbalism she is certified in organic skin care through formula botanical and she launched her brand in 2018 so she she really wants to make sure that her brand is representing her herbalism background and her whole plant philosophy she also believes that the most nutrient-dense plants live in our backyards and she's leaving the need to harvest plants from exotic ecosystems to the wayside for instance her favorite plants to use our nettle comfrey calendula alfalfa and milky oats so I'm not gonna go through every single product that she sent me because as you can see this bag is full of her minis but I will highlight a few that I was most intrigued by and a couple that I did use today so this is her saging facial serum and she's saying saging like instead of aging so saging facial serum then again this is just her little mini and this I used this morning and I really really loved it and I don't want to pump any out because there's not very much in here but this was kind of like one of those emulsion type products but a little bit more on the lotion side I really really love the texture and I'm very very intrigued by this I could definitely see myself wanting a full-size of this because it felt really great on the skin I just used a toner I think I used Carolyn's on live botanicals elixir and then I just put this on and then I used the heart and soil vitamin C facial cream on top of that and that's all that I used this morning underneath my foundation and my skin feels great really hydrated really moisturized and so so far I'm actually pretty impressed and I'm wanna dig more into the ingredients that Katie's using in her products and I'm really interested in trying all of her products here and the reason why I actually said yes to her sending me her products aside from just being super intrigued by everything she had to say on her website is I was also really interested in her rose and vetiver facial cream I've always really intrigued to see how people use vetiver and how the vetiver reads in a product and I put a little dab on my hand and the vetiver in here really smells beautiful so so far first impression of heart and soil is very very positive I'm really interested in Katy and what she's doing here and I'm really excited to try more and I could definitely see myself getting a full size of the saging and also of the vitamin C cream I'm not exactly sure where the vitamin C is derived from but I'm going to definitely be checking out her ingredient list and and delving into her brand even more one last thing I want to mention is Prisma palette send me a bunch of samples of their of their green eyeshadow so I got to figure out how best to use these how to dispense them if you have any helpful hints let me know but I have a whole bunch of green eyeshadows to play with so I'll let you know which ones turn out to be my favorites and then I might end up making that green eyeshadow quad for myself after all I didn't end up making one for myself because they sent me these samples so I'm gonna see which ones are my favorites and then I'll probably end up making myself a quad so that also did arrive so anyway thank you guys so much for watching if you made it all the way through to the end thank you so much for trooping it out I appreciate your support more than I could ever tell you if you did like the video give me that thumbs up and if

"aphfe841tZk": "what's up guys it is Sam here and I wanted to talk about the test that I just got in from my doctor of course but before I do that anything I talked about this video is just for entertainment purposes under strict supervision of my a doctor don't do anything you see me doing or just don't do stupid [ __ ] you see people doing online it's just like that [ __ ] smart just use your head and with that being said let's talk about that so I'm towards the tail end of a cut up life continue cutting in for another couple weeks before vacation but oh my God my doctors prescribed me 200 milligrams of testosterone the Sippy innate for per week at least initially and what I stack with it and why I stick with it so the we're not going to talk about SARS in this video the lots of other videos on the serums the for those of you who might be wondering thus arms ah strain okay or why K 11 MK 677 is not a sorry guy but that as well as s for those will probably still be staying where they currently are at least for this coming next week I will do an update on this on the cycle probably midweek of this coming week after that test really starts to kick kick into my system towards the end of the week more than likely so I guess test cypriot innate the half-life on that is about a week what I'm taking with that is a remedy X and clomiphene and with what I'm gonna clone penis because HCG was out of stock so clomiphene versus HCG like why would you do either one the eight then please anybody else who has a better understanding of this let me know down below in the comments but the clone theme is going to bind to the receptors in the for the male like the the chest so that the estrogen cannot be absorbed to develop breast tissue however the feedback loop of that causes the body to think that it needs to produce more testosterone so that more testosterone can be converted to estrogen through the aroma sizing enzyme so what the mechanism a cup of action that that takes place through is increasing your LH as well as your FSH LH is for the production of testosterone and FSH is for the production of sperm so there it's a long pathway roundabout way and it works as a very mild anti estrogen type of thing to do when you're worried about conversion something if you don't have a ton of conversion or you you don't your body just doesn't convert a lot clonefeed can work for that but I'm putting that with Arimidex and not every day probably at least initially I'm gonna do every other day and every other compound meaning day one day one right takes a shot 200 milligrams of sibian a two days later take I was gonna with half a pill of a remedy X but for one milligram or a half a milligram however it's in a powder and I'm not sure if I want to open up the capsules might do that might not do that war I might just push it out in three days for the rheumatics and then next time I will take clomiphene back and forth and just rotating back and forth between those now if you were going to do HCG and you just wanted your balls full and didn't care about the sperm production then each to g4 my understanding is there's going to be synthetic lah and I've used that before with some nice results so I wanted to give you guys posted on what is happening today is 6:29 2019 with the first shot today so I will continue to post the physique update videos over the next several weeks and months to see how this progresses along in combination with the psychological effects of testosterone and combining that or stacking that with SARS so if you want to

or valuable or share this video with them please", "jOQM6z2cqXc": "my you got you got both computers on plugged into yeah i'm gonna go outside there for a little bit then all right so your thing's gonna run from like two to three-ish or less um probably three maybe yeah longer whatever do what you have to do you know running take a shower hello everyone okay so if you want to uh turn off your camera you can okay so let's look at chapter six is conversions between measurement systems and we talked about um page 115 with the nitroglycerin because that's really important nitroglycerin is kind of weird it comes in three strengths so it's ntg ntgsl and the green one over 200 or one two hundredths of a grain is 0.3 milligrams and the gr 1 over 150 or 1 150th of a grain that one is 0.4 milligrams and then the grain one over 100 is equal to 0.6 milligrams okay and the way that you convert this is you want let's say you wanted to know milligrams and you're using 60 milligrams to one grain 60 milligrams over one grain times and let's do the one over two hundred one grain over two hundred okay so now the grains are going to cancel and that tells you to take the 60 and divide it by 200 and when you do that 60 divided by 200 you get 0.3 so one of the things to remember these are the three strengths and the number on the bottom gets lower from 200 to 150 to 100. but the milligrams go up from point three to point four to point five because you're multiplying or you're actually dividing by a smaller number so your answer is going to be larger okay does that make sense yeah yes okay good all right so that's the nitroglycerin [Music] um let's look at phenobarbital because phenobarbital is another weird one and phenobarbital on page 107. [Applause] this is one of the oldest anti-seizure medications around ao and it says to use 60 milligrams per grain but it also comes in straight strengths based on 64.8 milligrams per grain okay so this is the way the bottle looks so then one-half grain is 32.4 milligrams okay because that's how they used to do it a long time ago it was a grain or a half a grain or a quarter grain of phenobarbital and the quarter grade was going to be whatever 32.4 divided by 2 is which is 16.2 okay but when we're doing this type of of calculations like we do over on where is it uh 115 page 115 number 16. it says a prescription is written for phenobarbital grain one quarter the medication stock bottle measures phenobarbital 30 milligrams per unscored tablets okay so what strength in milligrams should be used for the dose and is this the correct medication stock bottle for the prescription now it's an un scored tablet what does it mean when it says it's unscored so this is what a tablet would normally look like something like this and if it's scored if i can draw that better it'll have a line down the middle okay does that make sense yes okay so if it's scored that means you can cut or break in half so when it says it's unscored that means you're not supposed to cut it or they don't recommend that you cut it now if you need to find out if it's actually enter coded so that it dissolves in the small intestine instead of the stomach if it's enteric coated then you shouldn't cut or break it because the whole thing's going to dissolve in the stomach or if it's a delay release tablet you don't want to cut or break it but in this case you know saying that it's unscored usually means you shouldn't cut or break it so what strength should be used for the dose well right here we see that the one quarter grain is usually 16.2 milligrams if we have a bottle like this from a company that doesn't use apothecary notation then they're just using 30 milligram tablets is that the one that you would use i would say no because it it deliberately says unscored tablets so you could use a half a tablet which would give you 15 milligrams because you know it says to use um 60 milligrams per grain so one quarter of a grain oh okay one quarter of a grain okay so remember we're going to do the one grain over four 60 over four is 15 milligrams okay so we would use 15 milligrams unless we're going to have the bottle from the company that uses the apothecary notation which is 16.2 i'm not going to give you a question like this and then give you two answers 1 16.2 and 1 15 milligrams because what either one is actually correct um you know and then i'm gonna make you guess which one i'm really looking for i don't do that type of problems i don't do that um so i would say no you can't use the that medication for this okay let's look at page 115 number nine it's coding gr ss with the line over it now what conversion are we using for coding if some of you guys remember i drew the clock last time or you could go to page 107 and it shows you codeine and then it tells you what conversion factor to use and it tells you go ahead 30 right yes so it tells you that to use 60 milligrams per grain for codeine so 60 milligrams in one grain and helmet how many grains do i have half one over two yes because i have a half of a grain right so now the grains cancel out and that gives me 60 divided by two which is 30 milligram 30 milligrams good okay let's look at uh number six now it wants us to go from grains to grams but how many grains do i have uh seven and a half yes seven and a half grains and does it tell me which drug that is no no so we don't know which drug it is so we can't go over to page 107 to see if it's aspirin tylenol or iron so we're going to use 60 milligrams per one grain if it's not tell us the name of the the medicine we we should use the 60 yes so most purposes we're going to use the 60 but you'll keep finding tylenol phenobarbital aspirin and iron on tests because they want you to know the exceptions so you know that's why i always make sure we go over those exceptions but if it doesn't say then use 60. okay so we have 7.5 grains i'm going to go right into decimals and we should have we could use 60 milligrams in one grain but then we're going to have to convert it to grams right yes okay so how would we want to know how many grams right one gram is we know it's a thousand milligrams right yes and we have 60 milligrams to one grain right times what the answer uh uh if in the milligram it will be uh 450 and the gram it will be 0.45 grams okay so let's see what we get on the top 60 times 7.5 and we get 450 and over 1000 okay so uh you're saying that if we were converting to milligrams we'd have 450 milligrams right yes yes exactly okay so now we have to divide that by a thousand to get our grams because we're going to convert it to grams instead of milligrams so 450 divided by a thousand on my calculator 0.425 0.45 grams so g or gm is always going to be gram but gr is going to be green so we want to be careful with that because a lot of times i'll ask you to tell me how many g's and the answer i get will be um will be grains so that's not good okay let's do a few more of these that are on your post test let's look at number 28 on page 118. and number 28 says a physician orders acetyl salicylic acid 325 milligrams what is acetylsalicylic acid i think it's thalanol maybe no no acetyl salicylic acid asa no facility yeah i always have to remember why where the the y is aspirin right yes it is okay i have such a hard time writing on this on this uh notepad because it's actually if i press too hard it's like squishy all right let me let somebody in here okay so for aspirin what are we using for a conversion factor 65 i think yeah for the crimea yes 65 million and so it says that they're ordering 325 milligrams of aspirin right yeah divided by 65 okay so we get we want to know how many milligrams 65 milligrams oh no they ordered 325 milligrams we need to know how many grains that is right okay so we're going to go uh one grain over 65 milligrams and then multiply it by 325 milligrams you can put it over one to make a decimal or a fraction out of it and that tells us to take the 325 and divide it by 65 and what do we get [Music] five yep so it says available are grv tablets what is grv five degrees yes five grains good so is that the tablet that we need for that yes yes okay let's look at number 29 on that same page and it says a child is to receive benadryl elixir do you know what an elixir is no an elixir is like a cough syrup but instead of being thick and syrupy it has more alcohol in it and it's thinner benadryl elixir is a thin syrup and it might have some alcohol in it a lot of the ones they make for kids nowadays they're taking the alcohol out but if it's thin they still call it an elixir so then it says the parent oh seven point five milliliters the parent needs to give this with a teaspoon how many teaspoons should the parent give per dose teaspoon uh five ml one five one one and a half teaspoon okay so if we want to know teaspoons our conversion factor is one teaspoon to what five ml's so the ml's are going to cancel 7.5 divided by 5 is 1.5 teaspoons okay um you guys all have your books by now right yes okay good look on page 120 and let's look at the pretest number two and this is for chapter six seven chapter seven okay now this is a situation that actually occurs so i want you guys to pay attention to this one it says it's a prescription for nitroglycerin 0.4 milligram sublingual now what does the next thing mean every five minutes every five minutes and how long are they supposed to do that uh three doses pr yeah so they're supposed to take it for three doses as needed so if they take one dose they wait five minutes take another dose wait five minutes and then take another dose that's like 10 minutes isn't it or maybe longer that they've had this chest pain so then it says if no relief call 911 because it's an emergency situation so this is this is for um chest pain and it opens up the arteries taking blood into the heart so it helps if the patient is having chest pain due to narrowed arteries so if the artery is narrow then the patient could have a heart attack because they're not getting enough blood flow so then it says in stock nitroglycerin 0.4 milligram sl tablets so what does sl mean sublingual which means what under the tongue under the tongue good so are they supposed to put it under the tongue and swallow it no no they leave it under the tongue because it's absorbs through those little capillaries under the tongue okay so what would your label direction say place we always have to have a verb with label directions so we're going to say place how many tablets um it would be one right yeah yeah one tablet under the tongue every five minutes for three doses if no relief call 911. okay so when we are typing directions for a prescription we always want to have a verb we always want to have the number or quantity of whatever we put in that bottle so it could be a teaspoon of liquid or it could be one tablet or three tablets or it could be one suppository then we want a route okay so even if they don't give the route but we know it's a tablet and they're going to be taking it by mouth then we're going to put by mouth so it could be sublingual it could be po it could be iv okay so the verb is always going to be give or take or place or instill or swish and spit okay so we want the verb we want the quantity we want the route and then we want the time factor so that could be q4 hours it could be q five minutes but we want to write it out for the patient because patients don't know what that means um and then we want um okay so if they don't put what it's for then we don't put what it's for for instance if it doesn't say um for chest pain then we're not going to put chest pain okay so we're going to look at some prescriptions um let's see where are we going here it's a very long pre-test you don't have to do the pre-test let's look at page 127 and this starts the um the prescription they're medications ordered by prescribers in outpatient settings if they're in the hospital they're called medication orders in outpatient they're called prescriptions now they can be handed to the patient on a piece of paper that's the actual prescription we sometimes call it a script we call it an rx okay so that is the outpatient one so outpatient means the patient is not in the hospital um and if it's an ambulatory pharmacy to ambulate means to walk so they're basically walking in they might be in a wheelchair but we're still considering them um ambulatory because they they don't sleep with at our pharmacy you know like in a hospital they they stay there so if they're going home as soon as they get their prescription then it's outpatient or they're ambulatory okay so um it's important that we're able to read and interpret these things accurately that's why it's important to learn those abbreviations from chapter one every order must be reduced to writing as soon as possible and the pharmacist must transcribe any verbal orders now some states allow pharmacy technicians to take prescriptions over the phone like they'll say this is dr so-and-so my patients mary smith and she needs uh lebado all 200 milligrams once a day and i want to give her a one month supply and give her 11 refills so we i can you know very easily write that prescription out but in california we're not allowed to take a verbal order whether it's by the phone or if the nurse is standing in front of us all of those go to the pharmacist so when i would get a phone call that says this is dr so-and-so with a new prescription i would say let me have you speak with my pharmacist i'll place you on a brief hold and then i'll tell them that there's a new prescription and a doctor on the line now also in california the weird thing is that from the doctor's office point of view it does not have to be a doctor that phones in that prescription in fact california state law says it doesn't even have to be a nurse so it's really weird i would hear my pharmacist like i get a phone call and the person sounded kind of young i have a new prescription okay let me get you my pharmacist i'll place you on a brief hold and then the pharmacist would get on the line and i would hear them one in particular i remember my pharmacist bruce and yes i named my dog after him um he had the person on the phone from the doctor's office and i remember him saying okay is it xanax or zantac okay neither one of those comes in 50 milligrams call me back when you find out and he hung up on them and i said who was that and he said i don't know it sounded like the doctor's 12 year old niece or something so he was very disgusted that the doctor's office would have someone phone it in that didn't know the difference between xanax and zantac and didn't know that neither one of them come in 50 milligrams so that was an interesting call so in california you do not have to be a doctor or a nurse to call from the doctor's office they can have anyone they want call in but in cases like that our pharmacist would not take the prescription because he could tell that this person wasn't somebody who knew what they were doing there yes so is it easier do they do e-script or email now something easier versus having to do everything on the phone yes um in fact um we're getting a lot more e-scripts i'm gonna write this down okay which is computer right rx entry okay so let's say that we're we're kaiser pharmacy when a kaiser and a lot of hmos when they have a doctor write a prescription they don't actually write it on a piece of paper they can if they want to and sometimes they do but most of the time they don't they enter it into the computer and then they tell whichever pharmacy you say you're going to pick it up at through in the kaiser system they'll tell them to um fill it or they tell them that there's an order in the system now they won't actually fill it until you go to the pharmacy and check in once you go to the pharmacy and check in then um they'll start filling the prescription does that make sense because they don't know if you actually want it or not right okay because a lot of people will go see their doctor and either they don't have money to get prescriptions or they just decide you know oh i don't know i'm gonna wait on that yeah well they don't know how much it actually costs because some can be expensive yes exactly and something like um prevacid um crevices when it first came out i don't even know if it's available in generic now but at the time it was like three dollars a pill so thirty tablets the cash price was ninety dollars and patients would then have a copay of like ten or twenty dollars and they'd be like twenty dollar copay that's way too much for 30 tablets that's ridiculous and they didn't want to buy it there were some medications that were upwards of six thousand dollars when the first aids medications first came out some of them were six thousand dollars for a one month supply and if the patient had a copay of like fifty dollars they would think that was a lot of money and not realize what you know that their insurance was actually paying a large portion of that um price okay also on page 127 the pharmacist is ultimately responsible for dispensing the medication as ordered as a pharmacy technician you have the training to perform most functions in the pharmacy um so we need to stay current with new indications for older medications indications is the the condition that they're taking it for for instance there's a drug called terbutaline the brand name is brethine and it's used for asthma but what they discovered in giving it to pregnant women with asthma was that it would slow down or stop their labor so then they started using turbulene off book so it's called an off book use okay so that's where the medication is used for a condition that it was not originally intended for now if the drug companies don't specifically do research for that thing they cannot tell doctors you know to use it for that they can't advertise it for that but what happens is over time you start hearing about um about these off book uses and in the case of tribunaline for a while there we weren't allowed to use it to to stop early labor um but it just kept being used for that so eventually you know it's called an off book use doctors are allowed to prescribe medications for off book uses but drug companies are not allowed to advertise it for that use unless they've done this studies to show that it works for that so we have evidence that it works because it's been used in hospitals for that for years but they're not allowed to advertise that they use it for that unless they want to go through the whole process of getting it approved for that use does that make sense yes okay so like giving children coffee for adhd because caffeine is a stimulant and in children that truly have adhd stimulants will slow down their thinking process actually and keep them on task so that's an off book treatment for adhd and i have a niece with six kids and one of her kids was severely adhd you could not get him to sit down and complete any work and so she would give him a little bit of coffee with a lot of milk and put a spoon of sugar in it which you would think why would you give sugar to a kid that's hyperactive but with the coffee it actually calmed him down and that was the only way she could get him to do homework in the afternoon and the weird thing is with some kids these stimulants act the opposite so he was able you know to sleep a couple hours later without any problem so that's some things are kind of weird that way okay so let's um let's look at the pharmacokinetics and pharmacotherapeutics knowledge of pharmacy includes pharmacokinetics so the word kinetic indicates movement so pharmacokinetics are the movement of drugs throughout the body and pharmacotherapeutics is the therapeutic uses and effects of drugs whether they're beneficial or harmful the field of toxicology studies the adverse effects of chemical substances on the human body now when we hear uh chemical substances a lot of people tend to think of drugs as chemicals and anything bad for you as a chemical and the word chemical becomes like the the bad guy to them i have a very sweet cousin who is not very science-minded and she posts on facebook all the time things like i don't clean my counter with chemicals i use vinegar and so i just couldn't take it anymore and i posted the chemical formula for vinegar and told her it's a chemical and she hasn't spoken to me since then vinegar is an acid honey i wouldn't use it on your granite if i were you okay but no it's it's this magical nature thing so it must be harmless um so toxicology our very first poisons came straight from plants okay straight from plants and you know um things like poison ivy and poison oak you shouldn't go into and touch so we want to i always want to clear up right in the very beginning that you know nature is not all good and wonderful and science is not all bad and unnatural you know nature is science okay so the toxicology studies the adverse effects of all kinds of chemical substances on the human body whether they're considered quote unquote natural or not so it's important to learn the normal dosage range for medications so you can check your calculations to see if your answers make sense and the difference between the therapeutic or desired effect and the toxic harmful effects have to be considered as well as drug drug interactions drug food interactions and drug disease state interactions so what does a prescription indicate there's one thing here okay so there's a difference between the therapeutic effects of a drug and the harmful effects of a drug so let's say that the therapeutic effect begins at 50 milligrams if the harmful effect begins at 200 milligrams then you have a pretty good window there right yeah and in and this is called the therapeutic index but in some drugs the therapeutic index is very small and instead of the difference between 50 and 200 it's more like the difference between 50 and 70 milligrams so you if you took two tablets you know you would you would be giving someone a harmful dose so this is a narrow therapeutic index okay is that making sense yes okay so let's look at the parts of a prescription right now because i know this is math but you know when we're dealing with medicine then math and um we're looking at a lot of different parts of math with um especially well no outpatient and inpatient pharmacy okay a prescription is a means for a physician or another health professional to provide the information needed by the pharmacist to dispense the desired medication for a patient in an outpatient setting it's an order written for a specific person by a medical professional licensed to prescribe for a specific condition the rules about who may prescribe vary from state to state so the statutes of the state practice determine the legalities of prescription writing as a legal document the prescription indicates the medication desired and the directions for use okay so look at your tech notes legally the physician's dea number drug informant enforcement agency number must be on a prescription if it's written for a controlled substance and also if you work through the prescriptions an understood meaning is that if a tablet or capsule is ordered the route of administration is by mouth po unless otherwise indicated okay so we want to make sure that the instructions are clear when we type a prescription we're going to begin oral prescriptions with take and always state the number of tablets capsules or millimeters as opposed to the strength for instance if the prescription is for 500 milligrams and the medication comes in 250 milligram tablets you're gonna type take two tablets not take 500 milligrams okay so let's look at this as if it were a prescription so the prescription is going to say something like okay so here is the prescription and then it's going to be signed by the doctor refills are zero because why would refills be zero on an antibiotic they're only supposed to be taking a certain amount of time okay but what if they still have the infection right there it says 10 days so i'm guessing that's all the doctor order was 10 days worth okay why can't they why should they not ask even ask for a refill your body will get immune to the to the medication you're like a super bug to it or something you're going in the right direction there definitely okay so what's happening is if they've taken this medication how many times a day is it four times a day for 10 days yeah so the qid is four times a day for 10 days and they still have that infection is this drug working no no no so in that case they need to go back to the doctor and get a new prescription maybe for something different it's kind of rare that a doctor would say well you know what let's just give it a little more time take it for 10 more days you know so that that usually doesn't happen especially if the infection is not even starting to get better they're going to switch it to a different drug so that's why you won't usually find refills on an antibiotic unless it's something that the patient gets re recurring okay so let's say that you know they they get um a bladder infection and they they take the medication for however many days and then a few months later they get another bladder infection or even two months later because the condition of their bladder is that it's constantly getting infected but if the medication works then they may say okay i'm gonna give you two refills but you know don't get them right after each other so i've seen that a few times where they'll have um a medication for a bladder infection with a refill or two because let's say they always get it in the winter and then they always get it in the summer but they don't need to see their doctor more than once a year okay so go ahead take this medication i did not like the side effect yeah i've taken medications like that where the side effect is so bad that you're like you know what i don't even care that it makes me feel better i'm just not taking this stuff right you know side effects are not worth it so you know i'm not somebody who promotes treating everything with medications definitely but i i think we need to come from knowledge rather than um you know rather than saying all drugs are bad right okay and you guys know if you're in pharmacy or nursing you know this okay so then how how would we write this on the bottle okay so we would have the patient's name the doctor's name we have to have the date and we have to have the directions which is the sig or the directions so we're going to put take um so now if we all we had if keflix only came in 250 milligram tablets we'd have to give them two tablets right but then we would also have to give them twice as many so that they could take two tablets four times a day for 10 days but in this case if we have 500 milligram capsules and catholics comes in capsules we're gonna put take one capsule by mouth four times a day or 10 days my writing is very bad okay so we're going to write that on the prescription on the the bottle that we give the patient not the prescription but on the dispensing bottle and now we're going to put we're actually we might give them cephalexan which is the generic cephalexin 500 milligram caps and then we're going to put generic for keflex and we're going to put number 40 and we're going to put zero refills now in california this um this program is automatically going to give a description of the drug and it might put d-e-s-c put oval orange yellow caps okay so let's see we've got the date we've got the patient name the doctor name the directions the name of the drug and strength whether it's a generic how many how many refills so in total with all of this and we have to have a prescription number two so it'll have a prescription number on it um and so that's the number that is stored in the computer under is by the prescription number so then this is the label for the bottle that the patient gets and it might also say wyeth or whoever the drug company is that makes the drug so in california the law says there has to be 11 things on the prescription label so i don't know if there's 11 here let's see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. okay we're good we have 12 things on this label because this the sig the directions is one thing there oh and generic if a generic was substituted now if they actually wrote the prescription for cephalexin and did not put the word keflex then we would not need to put generic for keflex on the bottle because they uh ordered cephalexin we gave cephalexin does that make sense it's only when we substitute a generic that we put generic for okay so if you go over to page 128 there are the actual parts of a prescription not a label for the patient but the prescription itself so it'll have the prescriber's name the prescriber's office address and telephone number and the date that they wrote it the patient's name the patient's address and the patient's date of birth now california says they can put their age instead of their date of birth if it has their age then we write the date of birth because the date of birth is an identifier for us especially if we have more than one kimberly lopez in our pharmacy as a patient the date of birth will tell us which one it is and then the rx is a superscription it's a symbol that means take this drug the inscription is the medication name dosage form strength and metric quantity and in california it has to be metric so they we can't tell them to to give um you know 47 grams of liquid the subscription is the instructions for the pharmacist on how to compound and and that's if needed so most prescriptions in california will not have a subscription because we don't have to compound most prescriptions and then this the subscription okay then the signature or sig is the directions for the patient how to take the medication how much when and for how long and then it will say if substitution is permitted or d-a-w d-a-w means dispense as written which usually means gene or brand name only but if they write a generic name dispense as written is generic right so this is something that i've actually had arguments with patients over like your insurance company will not pay for keflax even though the doctor put daw1 which means dispense as written because he did not write keflex okay the other one is dns which means do not substitute so again if the doctor writes keflex and there's a dns on there then we have to give brand name keflex but remember if they write the generic name and says do not substitute then we could give any generic we're not substituting okay and then the number of refills and the prescriber's signature has to be on the prescription as well if it's a controlled substance we need the doctor's dea number on that prescription and it'll usually be up at the top okay so those are the elements of a prescription and then the elements of a label now the label a lot of times won't have the doctor's phone number on it it won't have the patient's phone number on it but it has to have the pharmacy phone number on it so the name and phone number of the pharmacy the prescription number the date it was filled the prescriber's name the doctor's name the patient's name the drug name strength dose and quantity directions for use the manufacturer's name the pharmacist initials and the expiration date and then any refill information so the ismp recommends the use of numeric rather than alphabetic characters on prescription labels therefore use numbers such as one two and three on prescription labels as opposed to spelling out o and e or two and it's quest to reduce medication errors the ismp also recommends the use of numbers over ambiguous terms such as twice daily this should be written take two times a day okay so now there's a tech note if the prescription is written for a brand name and substituted with generic you must put generic for brand name with the specific brand name entered on the label so look on page 129 and the prescription interpretation is how one would read the prescription without the use of abbreviations the label directions are written for the patient in the language that is easily understood so if you look at page 129 example 7.1 we have zoloft 50 milligrams and that happens to come in a tablet um and they wrote it for number 30 and the directions are one tab p o q a m so then we would actually write this out as take one tablet by mouth every morning so if they don't put a verb and there's never a verb written on the prescription but we have to put the verb in there like take or give walgreens was very interesting because when i had a prescription for my dog you know they wanted the dog's date of birth and then it said and they realized that the dog was not 12 years old so anyone under the age of 12 their prescriptions will say give the name of the person in quotation marks give manny one tablet by mouth two times a day so if it's a child or any you know living being under the age of 12 it's going to look like that instead of this saying take if it's an adult okay and that's something that walgreens computer did automatically we didn't we didn't have to do that so i don't know if they still do that because i haven't gotten a prescription at walgreens for a child in years okay um the second one example 7.2 mycostatin oral suspension mycostatin is a brand name for nystatin which is an antifungal and it says 60 milliliters and then it says agit for the sig sig are the directions for the patient so the sig is always going to be uh usually abbreviated for us but then we have to actually spell them out so agit what do you think that means it's a shake medication yeah but what does agit stand for agitate agitate good so you're going to agitate okay so you're gonna shake it and then swish and swallow five milliliters every four to six hours um now it doesn't say by mouth because how else would you swallow it so we usually tell these types of prescriptions um this is for something called oral thrush which is a yeast infection in the mouth and it tends to accumulate real close to the gum line in the cheek area so um that's why they want you to shake it up really well take a teaspoon and swish it around the whole mouth like you're like you would use mouthwash and then because it's nice statin and it's also going to work internally against yeast um which is a form of a fungus then the patient can swallow it but i've also seen this direction as swish and spit or swish and expectorate so then this prescription should be dispensed with a measuring device appropriate for five milliliters how much is five milliliters in household measures one piece one teaspoon yep one teaspoon okay so your next several um prescriptions are similar to that but look on page 131 number four [Music] and it says prednisone 10 milligrams number 40. now prednisone is a steroid a steroid brings down inflammation but it's also a very strong drug so what they usually do is they start out with a high dose and they taper it off as the patient takes it so they're going to give 40 tablets and then the sig says one tab p-o-q-i-d x-4-d one tab potid x4d one tab pobid x4d and one tab po daily times four so what exactly does that mean take one tablet by mouth four times a day for four days take one tablet by mouth three times a day for four days take one tablet my mouth two times a day for four days take one tablet by mouth one times a day for four days yep that sounds exactly right except we're gonna put then at the end of every direction okay now will this fit on a medication label very easily uh no especially since they're making us put the route fill out tablets okay so what we can sometimes do is there's a notes area where a very long sig is automatically going to say take as directed see directions and then the paperwork that comes with it we will actually flag it to the bottle so here's the bottle of medication with this label on it and if it says see directions we're going to take this piece of paper and we're going to write all this stuff out which is probably going to be like eight lines and we're going to flag it onto the label with tape okay and we'll actually tape it on there so that it's attached to the bottle they won't lose it but it doesn't take up as much space on the label that way so this is going to say take one tablet by mouth four times a day for four days exactly what ian actually said on there so this is called a decreasing dose if i could spell a decreasing dose it's also called a tapering dose and this is so that the patient doesn't go through rebound swelling by abruptly stopping a steroid because that can sometimes happen okay so then um let's look at page 135 number 11. now this is just the opposite this is a drug called neurontin 600 milligrams number 50. neurontin has a few side effects that are not necessarily harmful but they can be very annoying for patients one of them is it can affect their sense of taste or smell so they're getting 50 tablets and the sig is 1po daily times 5 days 1po bid times 5 days then 1potid neurontin is an anti-seizure drug but they use it a lot one of its off book uses we talked about is for pain due to nerve conduction or problems with nerve conduction so they use it for pinched nerves they use it for things like fibromyalgia which is considered overactive nerves and it uh the generic name is gabapentin and it works on the gaba which is gamma-aminobutyric acid and the gaba receptors so it basically tells the brain that it's not getting these pain signals as much as it thinks it is okay so because of the side effects they start out low and then they increase the dose so it's one tablet every day for five days then one tablet twice a day for five days and then one tablet three times a day and they're going to leave it at that dose for the rest of the of their course of therapy okay so we see that quite often any questions so far no no so one of the things you'll see sometimes is as tolerated which means that if they don't have bad side effects then you know they can keep taking it some drugs cause upset stomachs some drugs cause um sleepiness so a lot of the as tolerated depends on how much the patient can handle of the side effect okay the bottom of page 135 is talking about a medication order a medication order is a way of providing the same information as is found on an outpatient prescription but it's used in an inpatient environment okay so the outpatient prescription is written for either a number of doses or the length of time of therapy so for instance here on this prescription up here let's say that they forgot to put times 40. would we still be able to fill this prescription without it yes why because you can multiply four times a day times 10 days yes exactly so it has a duration of therapy which tells us how many capsules to give the patient now if they put times 40 and they didn't put for 10 days if they take it as directed how long would it last also 10 days yes it's still going to last 40 days exactly or 10 days i mean exactly so outpatient has to have either the time limit it has to have a time limit either the quantity or the length of therapy okay if it doesn't have one of those things we have to call on it but for an inpatient it tells the health professional which drug or drug should be administered how to administer them the strength of the medication and the frequency that should be given in an inpatient setting the medication order contains the date patient name etc the signature of the professional only one although only recommended in emergency situations medication orders may be verbally communicated however for legal purposes each order should be transcribed into writing these days we have something called um an electronic health record so this includes things like an emar which is the medication administration record so i haven't worked in hospital for longer than five years so i've seen some drug orders but i haven't dealt with it myself as far as written orders we still use written orders for chemotherapy and they have to have an actual signature by the doctor but then they get put into the electronic health record so if the doctor orders it in the computer then they don't have to have a piece of paper that they sign because they're using their login and password to log in and order it for that patient so it gets listed that way okay so now having said that they don't have to put the length of time because it's only going to be given to the patient as long as they're in the hospital right but if it is an antibiotic and the patient's in there for six weeks they're not going to continue that same antibiotic for six weeks so they usually have a start date and time and an end date and time in other words if they're still here in three weeks we're going to stop this in 10 days or however you know however long they're going to put an end date and time so that they don't just keep taking it forever and ever okay so here's some of these um things now there is a tech alert even though in most inpatient pharmacies a pharmacist enters medication orders into the computer the pharmacy technician still has a responsibility to check as he or she is filling orders and report any concerns to the pharmacist we look at these things in the computer and the way that the okay so the way that the drug order works in a hospital for most hospitals because i've talked to people that worked in other hospitals is that the doctor will put an order in the computer system the pharmacist has to verify that order and in children's hospitals each order has to have two pharmacists verify so there's a verification then there's a second verification so that can take some time because my pharmacists are literally verifying orders all day long so it could be a few minutes before they get to your patients order and then they verify it in a way that it will produce a label that i the technician can read having said that there's been several times when i've looked at something and gone we don't have this in the nasal spray form you know we only have it as drops or whatever so then i'll hand it back to the pharmacist and say do we need to order this or do you want to you know see if you can change it so um i've also had orders that were written for um a drug 0.004 milliliters in um you know five milliliters of normal saline so if i'm making an iv i'm like i'm not going to be able to measure that two decimal places is the most accurately that i can measure so then what i'm going to do is like put 4 put 10 times this amount so i would put 0.04 milliliters in 50 ml of normal saline so now i'm going to dilute it and then i'm going to pull out 5 milliliters and give that to the patient because i can measure this accurately i can't measure that accurately does that make sense yeah okay yes at the very top of that right there is 0.04 milliliters can am i going to be able to divide that by 10 and dispense it no i am not so in that case that's how we would do that okay so it's called a dilution now the rest of the other um 45 milliliters are going to be thrown away into the pharmaceutical waste bin and they actually get burned up later okay so in in outpatient pharmacies technicians enter the orders into the computer so we have to be able to read them and inpatient pharmacies most hospitals in california that i know of will have the pharmacist check and verify those orders that the doctor puts into the system sometimes a nurse could put it in it depends on if the nurse is a nurse practitioner or you know something like that okay so let's um look at this medication profile on page 136. okay so this is in a hospital and it's a list of physicians orders that the doctors write so keep in mind if they write it by hand it's going to be kind of messy if they put it in the computer you'll be able to read it like this so it gives the patient's name it has their medical record number it'll have their date of birth and their weight weight is very important and it might have diagnosis a lot of times they call them hospital problems and they don't call it a diagnosis and they don't necessarily know the diagnosis right away are we for sure that this patient has multiple sclerosis no here's all of their symptoms okay so then when testing gets done then they can figure out what the patient has and give them an actual diagnosis so the date is on there the time and then it'll also have any drug allergies that they have so nda means no drug allergies or in kda which is no known drug allergies okay so sometimes they will list other allergies though like if the patient is allergic to say um strawberries or if they're allergic to um trying to think of something like b b venom okay b venom can cause an anaphylactic reaction and that can kill the patient so um hopefully they're not going to get stung by a bee while they're in the hospital but it's still important to know and have that on there so now we're going to have the date the time lasik's 80 milligrams by mouth twice a day digoxin 0.125 milligrams by mouth every day and slow k 10 milli equivalents by mouth twice a day okay so we need to talk about something here what's the difference between q6 hours versus four times a day if they do it every six hours still 24 they're still getting four doses in a day aren't they yes okay so what's the difference then i see there's no difference this is the time they started yes it has to do with time exactly so if it's every six hours and they start at nine a.m then they're going to take the next one at um three o'clock which is six four three pm so if they take it at nine a.m three pm nine pm 3 a.m wait i'm missing something here nine three nine three yes okay so 9 a.m 3 p.m 9 p.m and 3 a.m okay so their doses are going to be 0 900 1500 2100 and 0-300 so that's exactly every six hours right okay so how about the blood levels of the drug in the body if they take it four times a day they could take it at seven a.m noon 4 p.m and then maybe 8 p.m because they're in the hospital and they're probably going to get a sleeping pill and go to bed early so between 7 a.m and noon that's only five hours right between noon and 4 p.m is four hours and between 4 p.m and 8 p.m is four hours so are they getting it every six hours here no and then between 8 p.m and 7 a.m is 11 hours right so that's a long stretch overnight so the thing with every six hours is that if people want to sleep more than six hours it's really hard to follow that every six hours schedule and they end up being woken up in the hospital to take their medications right depending on when they start them okay so the every six hours is more exact and it gets blood better blood levels in the body now if the patient's on an iv a nurse can come in and switch out the iv to a why site without even really waking up the patient right if they're if they're good at it if they're ninja nurses [Laughter] they can come in and switch out the little iv bag and they don't even know that they've gotten a new iv bag so but you usually do wake up the patient and let them know what's going on right maybe if they're not if they're a baby if you have to you have to right yeah okay so then on page 139 it shows uh the stock bottle okay so the stock bottles the actual bottle of drug from the manufacturer and it has to have certain information on it here i've got my generic ibuprofen from walmart you know it's from walmart because it's got the little sunshine on the back somewhere there where is it there it is right there and then it also says equate which is their generic name right so this is over-the-counter ibuprofen the stuff is going to be the information is going to be the same either way it has an ndc number see if you can see that okay so the ndc number is the national drug code and every drug sold in the u.s has to have a national drug code on it trying to see if anybody else came in late i don't see anybody else okay so the national drug code has three sections so in this case it's 49035 604 i'm going to have to do what i do at work when i a number is too small to read i take a picture of it and then i enlarge it and there's the number eight five i couldn't tell if that said eight five or oh five at the end i have a pharmacist that's even older than me and the first thing i did first time that i took a picture of it was a teeny tiny glass ampoule of a drug it was epinephrine and we could not tell if it was expired or not and so i held it very still i took a picture of it and i enlarged it on my phone and she was amazed just oh that's so clever and i didn't tell her that i learned that from younger technicians i didn't think of that myself okay so the way this this is it's five digits and i can't even right now it's five digits four digits and two digits now this doesn't have four digits here does it so we're going to use a leading zero if we were to put it on say an insurance form or some official ordering system we would put a leading zero in any sections that don't have the correct number of digits so for instance teva is 9 3 here this is the manufacturer this is the drug name strength and form and this is the package size or the way that it's it's packaged so in this case eight five must mean 250 tablets okay but this isn't like all eight fives or it doesn't mean 250 tablets this is always the manufacturer and this manufacturer is who let me see if i can find it says distributed by walmart i don't believe it's walmart did you know that most medications that you buy over the counter have their information on the back of the label way down in the bottom here they say peel here and then you get all this information that you couldn't see before and it still doesn't tell me where who the manufacturer is or where it's manufactured so it just is distributed by and bentonville arkansas i've been to arkansas but not bentonville okay so whoever that manufacturer is they have an ndc number assigned to them by the f probably the fda of 49035 so for this manufacturer zero six zero four means ibuprofen 200 milligram tablets and eight five means 250 tablets okay so anything that they get from that same manufacturer is going to have 49035 at the first part but the rest of it will be different so if somebody else makes ibuprofen 200 milligram tablets they don't have to give it the zero six zero four designation because they're going to come up with their own number for it okay does that make sense okay so um on page 139 it says that the label on the stock medication bottle identifies the drug within the container it also indicates the important information needed in bold to dispense the drug as follows the generic name the trade or brand name if if it's a brand name drug now this one does not say advil or motrin on it however right here it says compare to advil tablets active ingredients can you see that so it's telling you that you're supposed to pick it up and compare it and try it if you want to because they're both ibuprofen 200 milligram tablets the ndc number is the 10 digit three segment number that identifies the manufacturer or labeler the product and the size of the container so it doesn't mean like how many inches this container is it means how much is measured in that container the dosage strength is the amount of active medication found in the minute in the medication such as micrograms milligrams grams grains units or milli equivalents per dosage form the total quantity the dosage form the name of the manufacturer or in this case um who it's distributed by and then i could technically call uh walmart pharmacy and find out who makes this for them if i wanted to or i could probably just google that ndc number and they might be able to tell me special instructions for mixing or compounding if indicated by the manufacturer storage requirements of the medication the lot and batch numbers or control number of the medication that can be used for identification if the medication is recalled so it's the it's used to identify a drug that's been recalled so back here right down there in the little black box i have the lot number is oae 3280a and the expiration date is 10 20 21. okay so the lot number i don't even really know what that means it could mean the man the facility that was manufactured in and the date and which stuff they use to make it like the actual ibuprofen powder that they use to turn into a tablet what is that lot number and this might tell me that information um and this is the expiration date now does that mean um that the first of october i can't take it i can't take this medication it's october 1st already no no okay so it's good till 10 31 2021 at 23 59 59. so like basically it's good until midnight on that day okay and the way that we usually print it is 23.59 which means you know 11 59 p.m now it's expired one minute after that okay and then the controlled substance indicators as appropriate as indicated by a large c with the schedule numbers in roman numerals within the c so let's say that you've got a c5 drug that's not extremely addicting then it would have something that looks like this and they do it in roman numerals so basically a c2 c1 has no legal use in the u.s it could be used for um for research purposes like they're doing one of these drugs is lsd and they're still still you know 40 50 years after they first started working with it they're still doing research on it they still think that maybe there's something they can use it for um and still marijuana is a c1 according to the federal government even though many many states have legalized it and even put it over the counter so it doesn't require a controlled substance however if a drug company takes the cannabidiol that's inside the marijuana plant and extracts it puts it in a liquid form then it becomes it's either a c4 or c5 c2 are the strongest that you can still get and you can't have any refills with a c2 medication these are things like dilaudid morphine they moved norco and vicodin up to a c2 a few years ago they used to be a c3 c3 the doctor can write for up to five refills but they have to get it within six months after six months the prescription expires c4 same thing c5 has no limit on the refills but again they have to get it within six months okay so c5 are things like um some cough syrups that have small amounts of codeine in them or it could be lomatyl which is a drug for diarrhea but it makes people it almost acts like a muscle relaxant because it slows down the motility in the gi tract called peristalsis it slows it down so that the waste product doesn't move through the lower intestines very fast but because it slows all that down it tends to slow everything else down as well and patients get very sleepy and groggy and you know for some people that's that's sort of a high so they made it a c5 all of the benzodiazepines are c4s so benzodiazepines are things like valium um klonopin there's like 20 of them and now all the sudden i'm not thinking of them cinnaquan which i always remember but nobody uses it anymore ativan xanax manny stop that he's you know how dogs will take a blanket with their paws and they'll move it around till they get it where they want it and lay down on it he's trying to do that on the couch but there's no blanket on the couch he's just scratching the couch okay okay he got down he's gonna go labor in his bed because i told him not to do that to the couch now he's mad and he's gonna go away on his bed okay so all of these are c4s and they're relaxants um there's four uses for benzodiazepines but that's not this class so okay so we've got these three pieces of information when we fill prescriptions or when we fill a drug order in the hospital we have the stock bottle we have the prescription or drug order and we have the dispensing bottle which goes to the patient and by law they all have to have different things on them it's not that important for us that we're able to read in math in this particular math class we're not going to be working a whole lot with the um with the dispensing bottle what goes to the patient we're mainly looking at um how much we're giving the patient how they take it and how long it will last them okay so we're looking at day supply we're looking at prescriptions and we want to be able to read the stock bottle so if you look on page 140 and 141 these are labels from stock bottles okay so let's go down to page 140 practice problem c we're looking at glyce glycet is miglitol and honestly i don't know what that is i don't think i've ever dispensed it to anyone so i'm going to get out my drug reference for health professions i'm going to look up miglitol mig i'm in the l's anybody have any questions on this so far while i'm looking this up no thank you okay so here it is on page 932 and it shows me miglitol which is a generic name for glycer it has a pregnancy risk category of b it's an anti-diabetic agent an alpha glucose glucosidase inhibitor so it delays the digestion of ingested carbohydrates into simple sugars such as glucose okay it's a diabetes drug that you know and it comes in 50 milligram tablets so reading this label who is the manufacturer of this medication it's up at the top of the label the mdc number no the manufacturer pfizer visor and what is the ndc number on this container in the middle on the top it's the one that starts with ndc at the top yes zero zero zero nine one three zero one good and then what is the trade name for this medication what's the brand name black bit oh it's s-e-t not c-e-t good to know and what's the generic name big little yeah make little and what is the strength of the medication 50 milligram 50 milligrams per what per tablet okay because you want to be careful that you put per tablet because sometimes um if it was a liquid it might be 50 milligrams in the whole bottle or 50 milligrams in each milliliter so in this case it says tablets 50 milligrams so when we're answering a question what's the strength we're going to put 50 milligrams per tablet and how many tablets are in the unopened container 100 tablets okay so that's how you do those problems and then when you go to your post test it's going to be very similar to all of that okay at the very end of the post test on page 148 there's some review of all of this one of the things that that it says on page 148 is the generic name for the medication should be written in lowercase letters and the trade or proprietary or brand name will begin with a capital letter so you're going to capitalize it and may be followed by the r symbol so if i look back over to that page again and look at the label it says y set with that little with a circle right yes so what does the r mean good question what does it mean yeah it means it doesn't even look like an r registered trademark okay so it's registered as a trademark with the u.s trademark office or something like that and it might also say tm which is the same thing okay does anybody have any questions on chapter seven no i think i'm good yeah when it comes to the homework do we write like the patient's name or like do we make up names or you just want to leave it blank okay um so it's asking you i want you to read those and interpret show the direction so it says on page 142 interpret the following prescriptions or medication orders and show the directions as they should appear on a prescription label if the prescription calls for the liquid form of a medication use the metric system and assume that a dispensing utensil is provided so you're going to assume that they're going to give mom or dad you know something like this so that they can measure milliliters okay it says if it says one teaspoon you're going to use the metric system and you're going to say five ml's and you're going to assume that they're going to get this one's only three but you get the idea that they're gonna get a five milliliter measuring thing right thank you okay i get it thank you yeah so they don't want the patient name the doctor name or any of that um you know you don't need to put that on there just what they're asking for look on page 145 number seven okay so this lawrence mary md on in holly georgia wrote a prescription we don't know who it's for because he didn't write the patient name it's for oculox ophthalmic solution um what kind of drug is that i mean what what is an ophthalmic solution where does it go i it goes in the eyes so these are eye drops and 5 ml means it's a teeny tiny little bottle that only has a teaspoon of drug in it and what does that sig say one drop one drop each eye four times a day for five days exactly so what is the verb we're going to use for eye and ear drops put one drop um no it's not put uh the replacer defend or okay what does it say on the board place or and still yes so you're going to put in still one drop or sometimes patients don't know what that means so more and more pharmacies are now using the word place place one drop or two drops so this is your your interpretation would be place one drop into each eye okay so place one drop into each eye four times a day for five days now when we dispense an eye drop or an ear drop on that bottle that we give the patient or it could be on the box that the bottle comes in because sometimes those bottles are super tiny we're going to also put these auxiliary labels and the auxiliary labels are going to say things like do not touch dropper to eye okay because if they touch the dropper to the eye and they have an eye infection then they're infecting the whole bottle of solution with whatever's in their eye right so it contaminates it and at the very least it makes it um it makes it degrade faster so they want to make sure that they don't touch the dropper to the eye if they're putting it in the ear that's not so much of a big deal you know you can kind of rest it on the side and drop it in the ear but not in the eyes can you use eye drops in the ear no [Music] maybe yes i mean not eye drops yes eye drops can be used in the ear if the doctor tells you to okay so i'm not saying go get some eye drops and put them in your ear they can prescribe eye drops to be used in the ear but ear drops cannot always not be placed in the eye why it might have some different type of chemical i can hurt your eye yeah thicker oilier i don't know there's okay there's those two considerations what's the other thing remember how we said you don't want to touch the dropper to your eye because it can get yeah contaminate the bottle okay eye drops have to be sterile when they're first made ear drops don't have to be sterile because they're they're okay so we have an ear drum if the eardrum is pierced technically it could follow the auditory nerve up to the brain but most of the time ear drops aren't going to get into the systemically into the body eye drops going into the eye are attached systemically i mean they not attached but they can get into the rest of the body um especially since our tear ducts drain into the back of our throat and go down our throat so you know your ears don't yeah there is a eustachian tube that goes between the ear and the mouth but usually the eardrum protects the inner ear from anything that's in there so if they have a ruptured eardrum that's a whole other story but for most cases ear drops don't have to be sterile and they may contain something like hydrocortisone which is hc or a numbing agent or some alcohol or carbamide peroxide so we don't want to put any of that in our eyes does that make sense okay good all right any other questions on chapter seven no but i want to ask about the homework of chapter six should we do all the post tests how much is the post test let me see what do you mean it's not that long not that long yeah it's scary questions yeah go ahead and do all of it in fact we did a couple of them already thank you so i already did two of them for you so or you did them with me so you really only have 28 to do okay and we will do also the process of chapter seven yes all of these chapters you're going to do the post test the only difference there's like a couple of things on chapter 17 that i'm not going to make you do and i'll tell you what those are when we get to chapter 17. i've always done chapter 17 in the front i've front loaded it because it's all basic math add subtract multiply divide but what i found out was that it scared some people away because it's business math and i understand i do not like accounting i totally get it but and thank god i married a businessman so he does all of that for me um but i i've decided this semester to put it at the end so we're gonna see what happens my students last semester found two answers wrong on examples of chapter 17. so it'll be interesting to see when we get there if you guys find those same answers wrong and i also you know i told you i emailed the author of the textbook elaine veal she didn't write um the key to the textbook so um you know she didn't she didn't realize that those answers were wrong either so she first i sent her a fan letter telling her how much i loved her book and the way that she wrote it and everything and then um she answered me back and asked if i had found any errors in her book and i said no but my students have so that's really cool and i told her where they were that i found my students last semester found three wrong answers two of them in chapter 17. so um that's interesting and she thanked me very much and she said that uh nobody had ever written her to tell her that so you know textbook writers need this information um she's a pharmacist so um she's at a community college in franklin virginia and she teaches pharmacy technicians as well as nursing she does their math classes for their nursing program as well so that's pretty cool so any more questions on chapter seven no just to verify chapter six is due next thursday correct yes technically yeah chapter six and seven or only six i put seven as due next week as well but i don't care if you turn it in a week later a week after that i'm fine with that i'm leaving it open okay okay thank you you're welcome i put due dates mainly to keep people on track i'm not gonna be like you know i already graded chapter three because you can see i sometimes when you when you send me your homework i will sometimes correct something like oh number three should be whatever but i'm not going to go through and grade them put a letter grade on them and hand it back to you okay i gave you the key what i want to see is do you know how to figure out the answer so that's what i'm looking for and that's why i ask you guys to show me your work so chapter seven isn't really going to have that kind of work anyway and i'll actually be reading chapter seven homework okay okay all right any other questions no thank you okay good so i'll see you next week then see you bye bye", "NPUgVopF0P8": "OFFERED OFFERED IN

demonstration - empty an external return bin you'll need a key to open the bin once open you must complete the procedure and reconcile all items in the bin you may need to audit a returned bin to reconcile items found in the bin against items tracked in the system as returned you need to have access to all items in the bin to complete the audit and you may need a witness to complete this transaction keep in mind that wasted items placed in the return bin cannot be audited in this demonstration we'll learn how to clear and empty the returned bin touch clear return bin this point you will unlock the return bin remember that once unlocked you must reconcile all items in the bin unlock the return bin if your facility enabled a returned bin audit you'll be required to audit all items requiring audit keep in mind that only items configured for auditing will display on this list you may see more items in the bin than what is listed on the screen if an item is displayed on the screen but is missing from the return bin adjust the quantity to zero under means that the quantity is under what is expected over means that the quantity is over what is expected if you find the item you can adjust the quantity back to the correct number the green checkmark means that you have verified the item you will see okay if the quantity found matches the quantity expected verify the next item if you find an item that is not listed on the screen touch add item find and select the item from the list you the item is added to the list with the quantity of 1 which is over what the system expects touch accept list if prompted have your witness enter their user ID and password the return bin when finished he'll return to the inventory menu screen continue with inventory tasks or touch exit to logout this concludes the demonstration you should periodically check for expired items in the cabinet and remove them follow your facility policies to remove expired items let's look at removing and finding items in a little more detail occasionally you may need to expire or recall an item in this demonstration you'll learn how to do so to begin touch expired recalled next touch find buy date enter the expiration date touch find items now you will need to access three bins to remove all expired items found in the search touch remove now follow the guiding lights and open the first flashing location enter the number of items to expire or recall note that some items in the bin may have different expiration dates and don't need to be removed remove the expired items and continue to the next item the number of items to expire or recall remove the expired items and continue to the next item continue until you remove all expired items if prompted enter the number of items in the bin prior to removal type in the number of items to expire remove the expired items and close the lid when done close the drawer when done he'll return to the expirations recall screen you can touch the inventory menus button to select other inventory tasks as needed this concludes the demonstration you can also expire or recall items as needed to do so you can either select the item you need to expire on the screen or access the items bin and then expire the item occasionally you may need to expire or recall an item in this demonstration you'll learn how to do so to begin touch expired recalled if you know the exact location of the item you wish to expire select the bin if you don't know the location touch find item find the item in the list we need to expire insulin select the item this item is located in the refrigerator left-fin enter the number of units to expire touch okay insulin is a remote item therefore the remote item selection screen appears touch inventory menus to return at this point you would either select the next item you want to expire or return to the inventory menu screen will return to inventory menus this concludes the demonstration use the assign item function for items that have not yet been assigned to the cabinet occasionally you may need to assign an item to another location you can either assign an additional location for the same item or reassign an existing item to the new location and delete the current location keep in mind that some items cannot be assigned to additional locations and/or reassigned to a different location in this demonstration you'll learn how to assign an item to a bin and then to an additional location to begin touch modify bin press the drawer button and open the drawer notice that as you open the drawer additional buttons appear touch flash unassigned open one of the flashing bins the bin is empty and available to be assigned touch assign item you can touch unassigned items to see only items that have not yet been assigned we need to assign morphine six milligrams one ml syringe search for the item enter the number of items you're placing into the bin touch ok to confirm the system informs you that the item is assigned to the designated location close the bin and continue the previous steps until all desired items have been assigned we selected another empty bin to assign additional location to morphine six milligrams one ml syringe touch assign item search for morphine six milligrams one ml syringe notice that the item is already assigned to a bin select it the system will inform you that the item is already assigned you can either reassign the item to the new location and delete the current location or keep the current location and assign an additional one to the same item will assign additional location enter the number of items you're placing into the bin touch ok to confirm the second location is assigned close the bin and your you'll return to the modify bin screen this concludes the demonstration if you need to replace an existing item with another item use the replace item function let's take a closer look at replacing items in this demonstration you'll learn how to replace an item to begin touch modify bin press the drawer button and open the drawer either select the bin you want to modify or find the item in the list of items we selected the bin now you can touch replace item the system warns you that there is an active net order for this item if you're sure that you want to replace the item touch on assign anyway if prompted for cap back count the items in the bin prior to replacing them if correct touch yes next select a replacement item from the list enter the quantity to add to this location touch ok to confirm the replacement item is now assigned to the designated location close the bin and drawer when done this concludes the demonstration if you no longer want an item to be assigned to a location simply delete the item note that some items are standard stock and cannot be deleted or unassigned for example emergency medications such as naloxone injectable must be available at the cabinet at all times in this demonstration you'll learn how to unassign an item to begin touch modify bin press the drawer button and open the drawer either select the bin with the item you want to delete or find the item in the list of items we selected the bin touch delete item if prompted for count back count the items in the bin prior to deleting them if correct touch yes the item is deleted immediately and the bin is now empty make sure that you remove all items from the bin close the bin and drawer when done this concludes the demonstration an easy way to clear the entire drawer is to unassign all bins in a drawer if prompted complete count back before you unassign all bins keep in mind that some standard stock items cannot be deleted or unassigned let's watch a demonstration in this demonstration we'll unassign all bins in a drawer to begin touch modify bin press the drawer button and open the drawer notice that as you open the drawer additional buttons appear touch on assign all bins in drawer the system will ask you if you really want to unassign all bins if so touch on assign anyway the system informs you about the number of unassigned bins when done you'll return to the modified bin screen this concludes the demonstration if necessary you may need to manually adjust the quantity of an item in the bin to do so set the bin level accordingly keep in mind that this function is configurable and may not be enabled for all items let's watch a demonstration in this demonstration you'll learn how to set a bin level to begin touch modify bin open a drawer select the bin you want to modify touch set bin level enter the adjusted bin level touch okay the adjusted quantity displays you can select the next bin and set the quantity as needed note that the ability to set the bin level is configurable and may not be available for all items when done touch exit to logout this concludes the demonstration it's very important to know what to do when discrepancies are created in the system the color touch system considers a discrepancy to be the difference between the expected amount of an item stocked in the cabinet and the actual amount when an item is accessed and the quantity in the bin differs from what the system expects it to be then a discrepancy is created this could be triggered during issue returned or a cycle count if discrepancies exist on the cabinet the resolve discrepancy button remains highlighted even when no one is logged on to the system note that when attempting to resolve a discrepancy a cycle count may be needed which in turn may create another discrepancy let's see how this is done in this demonstration you'll learn how to resolve discrepancies when there are unresolved discrepancies the resolve the script button is highlighted you can touch the button to see how many discrepancies need to be resolved we have two discrepancies that need to be resolved touch ok login to the system the patient list appears touch the main menu button on the main menu screen select the resolve to script button select control level two through five touch the result of scrap button the discrepancy resolution screen appears the discrepancy was created because the expected medication quantity in the bin was different from the quantity found enter the resolution reason or select one from the list select a reason the selected reason displays you can either select next descrip or touch the result escape button touch ok to confirm the discrepancy resolution or narcotic transactions a witness is required for all discrepancy resolutions have your witness enter their credentials touch okay resolve the next discrepancy you you you can also print a discrepancy receipt as needed Touch resolve the scrap have your witness enter their credentials touch okay the system informs you that there are no more discrepancies touch okay touch exit when done notice that the resolve descrip button is no longer highlighted and the cabinet is now free from all discrepancies this concludes the demonstration you have the option to view and print certain reports inventory reports are primarily used to find details about the cabinet's inventory the system can retain data for up to seven days and most cabinets are set for three to four days thank you for viewing this course more training is available on my ami cell calm", "Jw_nxSpDEuQ": "all right good morning welcome to the vlog of 6:30 a.m. bright and early good stuck the vlog off early and strong it's March the 10th 2018 day 375 vlog 43 good go ahead go break my fast super early go go Denny's get me some breakfast

seen it was only like a little over 12 hours on the fast it's one of what people know you don't have to follow strict guideline with Kido you just gotta make sure that you eat the right things eat the right quantity of things that best works for you intermittent fasting one meal a day I choose to do you don't have to do that I choose the stick by the book of light between 7080 percent fat ten to twenty percent protein around five percent carb but you can tweak that numbers and looks like my managers pulled up so Kito can work for you just gotta apply it and make it work got stick with it you know what you can eat you know what you can eat intermittent fest in one meal a day really OverDrive's it cutting my fat down to like 60% what really overdrive my diet more but I choose not to because I'm doing well enough as it is but anyways I'm gonna get off here see after I get up work juices okay welcome back to the vlog 3:30 p.m. just got off work little bit ago we got hammered really really late in the shift is kind of all gravy until about 1:00 1:30 and then all hell broke loose so hope they'll clean up and stock some positions that weren't manned anymore so just got home go go inside grab some [ __ ] for tonight and then I gotta meet up with a friend of my cousin's to drop off something and then I'm gonna go over to pues and we are supposedly no fights on tonight so we're probably gonna be connect bowling so you know it is go get them strikes get them marks get them high scores but anyway so I'll jump off here talk to you guys later deuces y'all all right this is game one who ended up winning I ended up getting second place and Donnie finished in a third place out of three of course but just getting things started drama is about to come and gain to the original one reset because the power box got overheated but set game to the official it's getting ready to go down as you can see here I'm about to unleash some strike perfection on everybody but unfortunately didn't quite happen spoiler here comes poo trying to get a reasonable score even though I got this game unlocked down as entering here the tenth frame of game two I have all strikes nine consecutive strikes and then this happened it's like second that pressure free throw no spirit the crowds like everybody's big ball plus have in the seven-foot Center I believe in you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] but I did end up blowing the second bowl to got personal best 260 not too shabby I must say myself plan on still getting perfection here comes Donny to finish out game - Donny the number one fan of Kido beef for a youtube channel no competition here he watches every vlog and Donny finishing up his game here with marks but this is by far one of the funnest we connect or connect Boeing Knights and a long time Donny with the personal best matching me with personal bests 214 not quite up to my par but here's the final scores a strong 260 by me Quito be frayed Pooh coming in last Donny and second victory celebration so break the Tom's I blew 300 to do tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu personal pass to do to to to to to and the end of Game three Donny ended up pulling evil of me up or Games one with a 195 I just went downhill after that blown 300 but gay Donny on the game for all right here's game for poo finishing up with the 218 to take the game total lead at 2 and on to game number 5 alright gain five results here myself coming out strong but the 239 tied up poo with two wins apiece Donny now in third place with only one victory so on to game number six people all right game number six Austin whose favorite white guy takes over for Donnie and ends up bulb it out rookie start and he gets a personal best for Donnie's profile that would haunt the hell out of me penny used to have my high school for the longest time and that worked me but you know that is what it is hey congratulations Donnie on your personal bests that Austin got for you at a 236 but rounds now 2 to 1 1 or 2 to 2 if you feel like put it in that way but I felt Austin actually won that game so he gets the tally but Donnie's animation gets the victory but on to game number 7 y'all [Music] alright Game seven scores I come up with the victory that take the total lead three poet to Donnie and Austin trailing with one apiece it's about to go down no turning back can't stop me now I'm in the rhythm I'm in the groove can't stop nothing but poo all right here comes Darion entering game eight taking over for Austin on his own profile but not finishes so strong but if he would have finished all he could have potentially got a win but he blows this tenth frame I get the fourth victory of the night what about that people yo yo yo yeah that's my higher pitch Kendrick Lamar yeah yeah yeah yeah you all right going in the game number nine same crew poo be Frey Darion I get the fifth victory of the night domination on the connect bow and by key Toby Frey party on party people yeah that's what I'm talking about but but that's the end a connect bone for the evening Quito be forever vive victories who with - Donnie and Austin with one Darion with squadoosh but he's good he could win any time but that's the end of connect bowing for the evening people back to the normally scheduled vlog ending all right welcome back to the vlog it's 11:55 p.m. just cutting in here to start starts cuts of midnight so but in the vlog it's vlog forty-three March the 10th 2018 day 375 on this wonderful ketogenic day eight super early this morning I have an eight cents drink all my water already may drink another bottle of that my electrolyte and a CB mix so Boland was fun for sure we've got to play a lot of games and new people kept becoming the third person with Donnie playing the first games and then Austin plan and Darion playing and almost 300 game oh my god I can't believe I blew that [ __ ] I blew it ma'am I can't believe that [ __ ] it was epic I was like can't believe I made always a tenth frame straight strikes perfection and I blew it on the first [ __ ] roll but to CC is a good score I mean to 60s a good score but it is what it is so thanks for watching Kito beef ray you'd be good I'll try and be good see y'all tomorrow deuces", "iSFiWWp6swQ": "hey how are you doing this is keith i'm going to be giving you a just a little bit of a kind of a random blog today this one is not going to be such a such a lecture i'm getting ready to deliver my my sort of a speech which is going to be a little more formulated on what i call supplement carrion so there's going to be a little bit of that in this one this that's why I'm in my kitchen and I think the first thing I'm going to talk about is the fact that on Sunday night I went to an awesome party of wellness people it was a going away party for Jay Denman at the from the air one tonic bar and then it turned into he went to Tokyo and did a bunch of stuff and then turned out he's not leaving LA so it was a staying in la parte nonetheless got to actually be at a party with lots of wellness people which was really fun you know I met um actually the only regular blogger I've ever physically met I met majano me he was there and aside from that just the usual sort of people that I see at the tonic bar all the time that's what I called it done party of the Jing master all-stars truth calkins and Jay Denman was there and then most of the regulars that I ran into all the time were all there anyways so an interesting thing that I'm doing right now is a lot of you asked about what I'm doing from day to day and a thing that's very interesting right now is I'm I'm really poor right now because I'm had to invest thousands of dollars into my pain my house which has been going on for a while I didn't actually get a contractor I've been having people kind of help me and stuff so I'm really poor right now so you probably a lot of my subscribers when you hear some of the things I'm doing because like at the beginning of 2010 I was experimenting with lots of stuff and probably spending I don't even know thousands of dollars not thousands but a thousand plus or a thousand dollars maybe on supplements for that that month and just experimenting with every everything basically the truth threw at me I had to try and so now i'm at my minimal which is um the basic of that and just so you all know i discovered in august i said that I eradicated the virus the HIV virus from my body which obviously I may have sent it into dormancy because I did test HIV negative at the beginning of the year when I was all excited about that um however now I'm just keeping the virus under control and I think I can eradicate it but I'm not taking meds I've not been on meds for a year and a half so the basic frontline thing for that is I do take can't Ron my take that every couple hours that's that kind of a frontline thing it's called a protocell is the generic name for it then I'm also taking on I take three or take six ray she's three times a day so I just got this in the mail right now the race you've gone on 161 so I get five of those every um by vibration to chaga every like 25 to 30 days as my checks come in I just got those now that's 123 dollars and fifty six cents for me and I get it at twenty percent above wholesale so then the other thing and I mix those up in that tea thing that I talked about earlier and so then the other thing that I do all the time is I just got a big shipment and of South America nerds I'm taking ought Oracle cat's claw I just got i think i paid a hundred and ten dollars for this shipment from mountain rose herbs i'm back into the south american air wanted to like messing around with those so cat's claw Pau d'arco we are a puma bark bark and I ketubah of Arc so those are all South American I'm not according to like David bull I think both of these are kind of considered in the sort of on occurred and these um not too sure about these so I'm only actually going to mess around with them for probably the extent of this and I'm back to using my big lobster pot because i like um i like having this big vat of tea and drinking it all the time and with some a lot of these gotta boil them down all the time as opposed to using these little tiny pots which i went over to join and i stopped using this because of the lake this is like a phone call it a pet peeve but something where I realized where it was being kind of not having a white vision on a lot of people or it been put out that boiling and stainless steel create some leaching of metals and there's this great um thing where I'm getting more benefits day to day of having this tea all the time as opposed to worrying about that and I certainly do enough detoxify enough stuff to get that so you're not worried about so I went back to this for the sake of being able to boil a large amount and and some of these you can like all of these you can just keep boiling for a long time and get a lot of benefits out of that and as I showed you in some of my other recipes you can let this stuff cool down and then you can make your raw food pates and stuff like that with this instead of water and they actually have a longer shelf life so among other things with that so the other thing that I'm doing I did get big time in to supplement Arianism over the year and I'm not so heavily doing that right now although I am one of my favorites that I do take all the time is five htp on this is one that truth turned me on to five htp is actually pretty amazing it really helps with dopamine and serotonin production and just really makes you feel good in general and it really connects I've been somebody who's skinny on all my life and I actually lost and I eat a lot I have a really high metabolism but I eat a lot and but that has never translated as being fat to me so 5-htp actually makes you feel satiated a lot more and part of the supplement arian thing and some of the stuff that I think is I think we all eat too much because we're not getting we're not getting everything that we need and so the brain keeps saying eat more eat more and so um that that eating less thing is is actually that's a pretty unified thing in all schools of wellness Health whatever is that eating less equals a longer life so you know i'm messing around with that 5-htp i also take a little bit of taurine and these are the cheaper ones i take those every day in my smoothie for bedtime before bed i make that same tea and i'm using this is a recipe the truth gave me which turned out to giving me um 10 and 11 hours sleeps when I've been for like maybe 20 years of my life actually that's for 25 years of my life I've been sleeping like for six hours and so after i started this recipe that he gave me in june i pretty much started immediately like I when I started taking it I started waking up in the morning feeling really groggy like I I maybe like smoke too much weed or something and then that was right around the time that I actually went high up here in the mountains with truth and Jay and at my house and um truth that said that's well that's because you're so young you know and you're just you're used to that waking up and just like going which I was and I think my personality went through a really drastic change with this stuff so basically the recipe is a half a teaspoon of gaba um and a hundred to two hundred milligrams of l-theanine and li zine oh man i actually just have this one because its budget i usually get this brand all the time now brand so then you mix those you put those in a warm gynostemma tea with a reishi and then uh as many squirts as you can afford of dew drops truth always talks about 10-12 words of the stuff and of course he likely has a wholesale deal with Ron tea garden dragon herbs or something like that so 12 6 12 squirts is what he says he always I can't afford that kind of stuff but this is dewdrops which is essentially a Chinese asparagus root American ginseng and a couple of others but those are the two majors there and I'll get those in Chinatown instead of getting these or get them from Sean Shack which is a really good source it's a much higher grade source than Chinatown so and then the other thing is in that recipe from outside from the dewdrops on some schizandra extraction or shezan dirty and go geez and these are all yen jing things which means that they help you store energy then the extra thing that you add to that is on this brand of mineral life i have zinc here but i'm out of the minerals in that recipe also is on magnesium three sports um calcium three squirts and potassium three squirts and now as a recipe i did for two months and that made me wind up sleeping like a teenager for for a long time and i don't know if i would go back to it but it definitely equaled a transition in my personality which a lot of people can see um so the other thing I wanted to talk about was gynostemma tea because that's a GP that's one that I'm taking all the time I got that one also from mountain rose herbs that's in that recipe that sleep recipe I talked about gynostemma tea you can get it in a box from Chinatown or online this is better the guy no stomach for mountain rose herbs they were out of it and they just got it back in its 13 bucks a pound um gynostemma is amazing and it's easy to overlook because it's very cheap and I guess we feel like if we pay a lot of money for something that it's going to be more bang for the buck so um I'm going to read out of this a little bit to go out on the gyno stem of tea this is a book you want to get for sure the ancient wisdom of the Chinese tonic herbs by wrong tea garden anybody that's interested in going beyond raw food this your first book this is what you want to do and you want to probably you can go to any page and read um you want to definitely go through the first chapter which really explains a lot of the Chinese system and then just it's fun to just open it and read like I'm going to right now talking about gynostemma and the I guess one of the big what do you call that sort of legendary sayings about gynostemma is a an herb a tatty price because it is very cheap so anyways here I'm going to read out of this guy knows demet is probably believed in Asia to be in is gynostemma is popular popularly believed in Asia to be an anti-aging longevity herb gynostemma is generally reinforcing to overall health and has a strong anti fatigue effect it is also used as a virtual cure-all gynostemma is a major adaptogenic herb in the same league in the same league as panax ginseng siberian ginseng ganoderma schizandra astragalus and if you don't know what ganoderma is that's reishi um it was reported in 1972 that guy knows demo was used in southern China to successfully treat senile chronic bronchitis this drew the attention of researchers from around the globe and Japanese researchers in particular took note Japanese investigators soon visited China to study the situation they found that the reports were accurate further investigating the giant the Japanese actually I'm going to go away from the book now the Japanese actually I think did the most what is considered scholarly research which means I basically I mean a lot of the Chinese system is kind of like legend in a way and I don't I'm sure that a lot of the stuff gets backed up scientifically but the vastness of the Chinese system it seems like like actually a lot of the gynostemma was was perfected and the knowledge in Japan so anyways um kind of stella thats like if you can afford nothing else you definitely want to get with the gynostemma and that is one that you're not going to notice the effects of until um you know like you take it a couple of times it's not going to be like reishi it's not going to get you all crazy high so it's you're going to definitely notice effects after weeks and I have known about it for a while and when I got down to the state that I'm in now where I'm like operating on a budget that's when I really started knowing some the effects of God of ghana's demo so um that's it I am going to go to my my my lecture on a supplement arianism and this is Keith sign announced and have a great day plenty more to come", "9CjmZqOK5oo": "ferrous sulfate is an iron supplement when you hear the word ferrous sulfate you should really be hearing that fair okay that fer whenever you hear that prefix that's going to really be referring to iron so we have ferritin and any any word that really begins to that Fair is going to refer to iron if you remember back to chemistry the chemical symbol for iron is Fe so every time you hear that really be thinking iron now why do we give ferrous sulfate it's really given to prevent and treat iron deficiency anemia iron is essential for haemoglobin myoglobin and enzymes and is transported to organs in our body where it becomes part of our iron stores so if you remember hemoglobin the heme portion of hemoglobin is iron and hemoglobin is what binds with red blood cells and carries oxygen delivers oxygen throughout our body so it's really important that we have iron without it we can't create hemoglobin and we can't carry oxygen to our body so it's an iron supplement and it's therapeutic classes anti anemic some things to keep in mind the first thing I want to tell you about iron is that it's incredibly important that you give iron injections via Z tract method that's where you pull the skin you pull it down give the injection and then let the skin go and that helps it from seeping out and from causing any damage or irritation to the skin it's also important that you have enough vitamin C to help with absorption of iron so in order to get iron to be absorbed we really need vitamin C for that to really occur as we're giving iron supplements is also important that we're monitoring hemoglobin hematocrit and iron levels to see if the treatment is therapeutic if it's working and if we've achieved the goal that we've been trying to do we want to assess nutritional status bowel function and it's important understand that iron may cause skin staining anaphylaxis hypotension seizure so it can cause a lot of dramatic side effects but the biggest things to keep in mind here are you know the I am injections we want to give z-trek we need vitamin C to help it be absorbed and the role that iron plays in our body so that is ferrous sulfate this has been another episode of the med master podcast by n R s ng comm to get our free cheat sheet cover the 50 most

and on the back of that research there's a new method called plasma exchange which looks like it can reverse the biomarkers of aging without requiring another person's blood let me explain so around 15 years ago reports began to emerge that taking blood from young mice and giving it to old mice it seems to dial back the clock on aging for the elderly rodents so the older mice they showed signs of regenerating brain muscle and other tissues and boosting cognitive and physical performance but these experiments used a rather macabre technique known as parabiosis which dates back to the mid-1800s so it's something like out of science fiction where parabiosis is a procedure where the researchers they suture together old mice and young mice so that they share a common circulatory system so scientists initially used parabiosis to investigate how conjoined organisms so such as conjoined twins affect each other so specifically they wanted to figure out whether molecules in the bodily fluids of one could affect the physiology or the workings of the other and parabolases really returned to the scene in 2005 where stanford university scientists decided to use the approach to answer questions about tissue regeneration in older organisms so with aging organisms struggle to repair themselves so if there's some damage to tissues so for example muscle tissues the body struggles to regenerate that tissue so researchers used parabiosis to figure out is it the cells that are the problem or is it the bodily fluids that are the problem and that brings us to the 2005 paper so overall there's a decline in muscle tissue stem cells which are called satellite cells and this results in an impaired regeneration of aged muscle but in this paper when the muscle stem cells so again the satellite cells from old mice were exposed to young blood it enhanced the expression of these satellite cells so it seemed to restore the regenerative capacity of these old muscle cells epic right it also seemed to help in liver cells and overall these results suggest that the age-related decline of these stem cells can be modulated by systemic factors that change with age so after the release of the study that seems to suggest that you can rejuvenate old mice with young blood this field exploded and people were seizing on the alluring notion of an elixir of life it got to the point where startups such as ambrosia they began selling transfusions of young blood to give to old people and they were charging around eight thousand dollars per liter the thing is though despite the excitement that this 2005 paper gave us there wasn't any clear benefits yet in humans this wasn't proven out the u.s food and drug administration issued a statement that transfusion of plasma from young donors they've got no proven therapeutic benefit and the same day after the fda released that statement ambrosia announced that it would stop its transfusions because the thing is transfusing blood it's not risk-free so you might get a reaction to that other person's blood you might get what's called transfusion related lung injury and even the two original researchers saw irena and michael conboy so these were the two researchers who published that 2005 paper they called ambrosia's plans dangerous and quote they quite likely could inflict bodily harm plus with parabiosis you're stitching together two mice so they're sharing organ systems they're sharing an immune system so you don't know for 100 certainty if it's the young blood going into the old body that's causing that rejuvenating effect or whether it's sharing those organs and that immune system so when more nuanced studies were done some interesting results came up so it looks like when you give old blood to young mice these young mice they really struggle so old blood drastically decreased neuron generation learning and agility and liver regeneration in these young mice young blood on the other hand it didn't show any significant benefits for cognition agility or the generation of neurons in old mice so what these studies were suggesting is that in old blood there are some factors that seem to stop regeneration of tissues so when you give that old blood to young mice these young mice were struggling so there was something going on in the old blood in other words the secret to stalling aging may not lie in boosting rejuvenating factors but instead blocking factors in old blood that promote aging so transfusing young blood into old people doesn't seem to be the way to go because we need to dilute these factors that are causing problems with tissue regeneration and transfusing blood doesn't look like the best way instead there's a process called plasma exchange so what these researchers did is replace half the plasma in mice with saline or a salty solution containing five percent of albumin which is a protein and the overall effect of doing this is dilating the plasma factors so let's just dial it back for a moment in blood there are many different components so i've got red blood cells white blood cells plasma platelets so with this study what they were doing is removing the old plasma and replacing it with new plasma and by doing this the researchers were removing a lot of the signaling factors in blood so they were keeping the red cells and the white cells and the platelets all they were doing is removing the plasma and replacing it with new plasma so diluting the other factors the other signaling factors in blood so i hope that makes sense but coming back to this paper there's some truly remarkable results that these researchers were getting so after a single plasma exchange it improved regeneration and reduced fibrosis in old mice to the point of no significant difference with the young so these old mice were repairing their muscle fibers just as well as young mice epic right this paper goes on to conclude that our data demonstrates that a single plasma exchange is sufficed to meet or exceed the regenerative effects of enhancing muscle repair and it also helps with reducing fatty liver and fibrosis as well as increasing neurogenesis in old mice so while that research is very exciting it is just in mice what about in humans and luckily for us there's already an fda approved process of plasma exchange that's used right now in medicine so it's where most of the plasma is replaced by a physiological solution supplemented with commercial human albumin and overall that process is called therapeutic plasma exchange so again it's fda approved and it's routinely used in clinics so what the researchers did is study human blood samples which were collected pre and post this plasma exchange from four old individuals aged between 65 and 70 years old now from previous studies we know that old human serum it strongly reduces muscle cell proliferation or growth but interestingly after a single plasma exchange procedure it removed this inhibition as in the brakes were released these older individuals their muscle stem cells they could grow they could start creating muscle again now that finding it was done on muscle cells in a culture in a lab it wasn't measuring the muscle cells within those individuals so we still need more research to make sure that this effect actually happens in humans but overall it does give us hope that this approach it may work that by diluting these plasma factors we may be able to reverse some of the biomarkers of aging and the leading researcher convoy predicts that staving off aging will require normalizing multiple factors so you cannot write or play a symphony with one instrument no one molecule will stop aging and i couldn't agree with this more there's going to be multiple factors that we need to target to truly reverse some of the signs of aging or to slam on the brakes of aging so on the back of this news am i going to approach one of my colleagues at the hospital to perform a plasma exchange on me certainly not we don't have enough long-term data yet we don't even know for 100 certainty whether this effect will happen in humans yes we've got some evidence that shows that in the lab with petri dish cells we can get some of the effects to reverse the biomarkers of aging but we need to get more research to figure out will this actually happen to the human body so only once that research is done would i consider doing a plasma exchange because we don't know whether this will actually work what the longer term effects will be how often we need to do plasma exchanges there are so many unknowns at this stage but overall there are some exciting signs that yes this may work but please let me know down in the comment section below what you thought of this video i

everyone my name is chanel and welcome to today's webinar we're pleased to have dr andrew heyman dr andrew pugliese dr sahara swedan and dr james lavalle with us today each speaker is a recognized expert within the anti-aging world and together they are kicking off the first week of our coven 19 resource hub today they will provide an overview of covid19 including the current state of affairs within the u.s the known aspects of the illness and current knowledge surrounding treatment options so stop at the end of their presentation to take any questions you may have please feel free to submit your questions in the chat box of your control panel at any time during the presentation to our panelists thank you for joining us today great thanks everyone um this is dr andrew heyman i really appreciate the support of a4m to launch our education series on such an important topic something that of course we're thinking about every day and i would imagine many of us are fielding questions by concerned patients and sometimes we have good answers sometimes we don't have good answers there's a lot that we're learning about the virus there's a lot that we still don't know and we thought it would be prudent to take a uh a longitudinal perspective on uh beginning to work through some of the more important aspects of what we do know about this virus and how we can support you as providers to get you good information on the subject and equally as importantly the dual purpose of this education series is to put some tools and resources in your hands that you can then distribute to your patients so for example we've written a letter that is patient specific it reviews the basic topics related to the virus addresses some treatment related issues we'll be distributing that to each of you this week and it's something that you can put your logo on as well you can put your name to we encourage you if you haven't sent a letter like this to your patients to please distribute it to them we found that patients are very thankful when they're getting additional support and resources in their hands that they might not be getting from just a conventional provider of course there's lots of questions about how can i better protect myself how can i increase the efficiency of my immune system and what do i do if i get sick so we'll be covering all of those issues and more throughout the course of these eight weeks and i really want to thank each of you for attending today i know this is an uncertain time and hopefully you'll get a lot out of this experience over the next two months with us so what's going to be included in this education series generally we want to raise awareness about covet 19 and it's population-based impact um and that means both for you and your patient base one of the things i would encourage you to do is to actually invite your patients to attend these webinars moving forward today really is for our practitioner base but we want to make sure that we're getting good information out not just to our community of practitioners but also to those patients uh that they treat so to that end we want to help the public understand what they can do to remain as healthy as possible during this uncertain period of time we'll also have different weeks where we look at various treatment options either methods to boosting the immune system treatment for active covet infections and then we're going to end the entire eight weeks with a patient summit so this is uh the topics that we'll be reviewing over the course of the two months today is an overview and it's meant to orient you as practitioners to the state of affairs of the virus and some key points that you can share with your patients as well uh as we sort of field questions from them moving forward week two we'll look at how do we deal with acute symptoms and of course so much of what we'll be talking about are you know non-fda approved treatments but we feel have good evidence and good science behind them to mitigate symptoms reduce viral load and ultimately hopefully prevent people from progressing to either hospitalization and or requirement for ventilator management that would always be our goal in that regard week three we'll be reviewing natural immune boosters and you have to be careful here there are a variety of compounds that actually potentially stimulate the cytokine storm so they're not all equal with respect to what's safe and potentially efficacious weeks four five and six we'll be getting into the lifestyle related issues what can patients do to remain healthy while they're quarantined or sequestered this is a very difficult time on people physically as well as emotionally there are high levels of stress and uncertainty we know many of our patients are potentially losing their jobs or their jobs are being threatened there are already reports of heightened depression in the sense of social isolation that we need to address effectively and then by week six giving them some stress management tools that we feel are effective to get them moving breathing reduce their stress levels and mitigate the social isolation week seven will focus on promising new therapies for covid this will go beyond weeks two and three and we'll take some time looking at what is the near and far future hold for exciting options for treatment and then finally we'll end week eight with a patient summit where we want to open up our faculty to the general patient population that all of you treat and field some important questions that they might have so the states of health or disease are the expressions of the success or failure experienced by the organism in its efforts to respond adaptively to environmental challenges and i think this quote really encapsulates the spirit of the a4m approach which is to say how do we strengthen the host how do we strengthen the immune system in the face of vectors and immune threats i think we're quite well positioned in that regard i can tell you i just had a important discussion on monday with the lead clinical research team at kaiser permanente they are running some large-scale randomized controlled trials for drug antivirals uh often uh uh inserted later into the course of therapy when a patient is already quite sick or even on a ventilator but they fully admitted that they just don't have a lot of treatment options for patients that might have mild symptoms but are at high risk for progression i think that's where we fit in our approach of uh increasing resiliency increasing immune immune status making sure that patients are as healthy as possible to resist progression we have a lot of answers there that uh our more conventional colleagues uh just don't really focus on in their day-to-day so what's a bit of the state of affairs right now uh covet 19 basically the 19 stands for the year that it was uh originally identified or diagnosed as a human problem uh it was um it's been caused by an acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ii it's a beta coronavirus and its original host is bats there was a early mutation in the virus that allowed it to escape the bat and enter the human population and as many of you know that can be a disaster for people this is what causes pandemics when a vector is introduced and there's no native immunity there could be some secondary hosts as well such as the pangolin and we're quite certain that it originated in wuhan china in one of their wet markets the first published case was december 31st in the literature although of course there are some reports going back earlier that than that into november and maybe even before for the first identified cases in january 7th it was confirmed in china that they identified person-to-person transmission at the time they were reporting that this virus was not moving from uh individual to individual in a very efficient way but of course uh we now know that that's not true and eventually it was declared as a pandemic on march 11th as of a couple days ago we know about 1.6 million people have been infected globally the u.s passed china and italy on march 26 to have the most cases uh now this number is much much higher it's amazing when you look away from this number of cases in the u.s and look back a day or two later how much higher it is um our death toll is now closer to 20 000 um over three percent death rate worldwide that's a number that we do pay attention to which is to say how lethal is this virus and millions and millions and millions of americans are now claiming unemployment because of the devastating impact that we all know that this is happening on our economy and of course we have to both deal with the medical related issues to slow the spread develop treatments and develop a vaccine on the public health side and also try and come up with methods to reopen the economy effectively without creating any additional risk it's a very difficult set of decisions to make and i'm sure we're all watching closely uh how that's happening we know the transmission is primarily respiratory in the initial contact phases uh we can have a relatively asymptomatic period of time uh even up to 12 days or so unfortunately the course of illness itself can be relatively mild too in terms of slight fever dry cough uh that might unfortunately for some patients progress quite quickly to a form of respiratory distress although it's not currently being classified as a typical art situation um i've spoken with a couple respiratory therapists who talk about it's almost as if patients are drowning um when they um enter the the sickest phases of of this illness uh we do think too that potentially there could be transmission through uh fecal contamination that might in fact be persistent once the patient has um moved beyond the acute phase and potentially that could be days or even weeks so there's a greater concern now growing in terms of how long a person might be spreading the virus and through wet roots overall for most people the symptoms are mild um and who uh ends up with a progression versus resolution depends mostly on age and other underlying risk factors although of course there are case reports now of younger people succumbing to the illness too unfortunately but overall most of the deaths are in age 65 or older and certainly the the statistics are even worse in the um oldest populations so i want to thank you very much uh for spending your time with us today we have a very nice lineup of experts um some of you who know you know them but we also have one of our own um dr pugliasi who is a infectious disease specialist and also a4m trained i'm delighted to have him go over some more details of the virus itself and don't forget we'll all be present at the end of this discussion to answer some questions that you might have in the last 10 minutes or so i i really strongly encourage you to help promote this series to your patients to your friends and family this is not just for you this is for the public as well we want to make sure that we get information out to as many people as possible for our perspective on ways to sort of manage the virus and stay as healthy as possible during these uncertain times so thank you so much for being here with us okay um maya yes okay hi everyone uh my name is dr andrew baglesi i'm an infectious as dr hayman said i'm an infectious disease specialist um i'm going to be just talking uh about an overview of where we are with covid19 as of today because as you can all uh understand this is evolving as we're going along um so what do we know about it from an epidemiologic point of view and who gets infected and who is going to be more symptomatic than others as of today it looks like 80 to 85 percent of the people that get infected with covid19 will have mild to moderate symptoms about 15 percent of the population will require hospitalization and then of the grand total about 5 percent will require intensive care therapy when you look at the reproductive number how this virus acts as opposed to seasonal influenza where um our the reproductive number for covid is almost double of what it is for influenza so what does that mean it means that more than likely twice as many people can be infected from covid19 as opposed to uh what you would see with uh influenza which we do see on a annual basis um these are just some of the numbers that show the uh percent of covert cases that we've seen in the united states since uh january 21st of this year as you can see there was a little bit of a spike and then it kind of decreased with time until the end of february then we saw a significant increase in the number of cases of coving now there are some caveats to this one is as testing became more available and people were recognizing more symptomatology more and more patients were being tested for the virus that as we can see now with time that the actual number of percent increases is actually decreasing with time mostly due to what we have been doing here in the united states sheltering in place mitigation um you know uh which had of course we're concerned with the economy where things are going after this but for right now it looks like we've had a really great impact on slowing down the progression of this virus uh moving along to from an immunologic point of view and what we're seeing today is that it takes about five to seven days for the host to develop antibodies to the virus uh so uh what we're seeing here is an immunofluorescence of the antibodies that develop in the saliva uh this is five days post onset and then look by stay 17 a hundred percent of the patients tested will have antibodies and that is one of the problems that we are seeing here with this virus is that there is a significant time frame involved in the development of antibodies which can neutralize the virus so the most recent data on this says about by day seven about fifty percent of the patients will develop antibodies and by day fourteen a hundred percent of the patients will develop antibodies uh just to take it a step further this is another slide showing the antibody production for uh covid19 um interestingly enough uh with other viruses there's usually a spike initially in the igm which is going to be your early um onset system uh for uh combating a virus and then the igg which is your memory type cells will increase uh later on with covid19 what we have found is basically there is a simultaneous elevation of both igm and igg uh we still haven't you know because this is so new we still don't know how long igm will last and where the igg will go uh uh months from now so again this is just evolving as we are dealing with this pandemic right now um let's talk about um how this virus affects us well the main receptor that uh covet 19 uh infects is known as the ace2 receptors angiotensin uh angiotensin converting enzyme two that is the receptor that seems kovit 19 likes to adhere to um it is predominantly found in the lungs which then explains why we see so much respiratory symptoms here however it is also found in the heart and digestive tract and also in the um olfactory uh system and uh this probably explains why we see in certain individuals um other than the what i would consider the typical presentation you would see with viruses and we'll talk about more of this later um now as far as also covid19 appears like it can affect red blood cells and in this uh appears that the glycoproteins and certain proteins of covid19 actually can uh bind to uh the um heme molecule and disrupt the iron from forming porphyrin and because of this there is less heme and this can decrease the ability for uh oxygen to be carried in uh carbon dioxide to be carried from red blood cells so that is a a bit of a concern as a secondary uh as another mechanism of how um covet 19 affects humans um we also have this malaria covid connection in association with uh uh covet 19 right now and this is one of the reasons why chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine has been effective in using um in treating covid19 i'm not going to labor this too much because i know dr sahar is going to be talking about treatments also we see some of this favorable uh with the protease inhibitors that are out there that they're doing research right now um one of the interesting things that i always find is the cytokine storm uh which can occur and this is just a severe immune reaction um and again if you do have these cytokine storms it can create a little uh significant amount of inflammation in your body and that inflammation especially if it occurs in the lungs can also inhibit oxygen exchange and this is why in some patients we are seeing uh the requirements of ventilator use uh to sit them through this insult uh what are the typical symptoms that are associated with this a cough fever tiredness difficulty breathing that is part of the problem and uh in that you can take almost any other respiratory illness out there that is a viral origin and you'll have the same symptomatology when we look at a differential diagnosis uh in association with viruses uh here are some of the other ones that can cause similar symptoms influenza rsv para influenza virus human meta pneumonia virus uh pneumovirus i should say um i actually had that five years ago it is a nasty virus uh very similar to what people have been experiencing with covent 19 and adenoviruses there are certain bacterial infections that can mimic covid19 these include strep pneumoniae age flu morexalic catarralis and then we also have to be aware of the atypical bacterial pneumonias that can present like viral pneumonias these include mycoplasma pneumoniae and legionella uh one of the problems that i've been facing here in georgia is that covid 19 has coincided with what we call pollen season today for example the pollen count is 2 000 weeks ago it was thirteen thousand uh i have a lot of patients that have been coming in lately with respiratory complaints uh low-grade fevers uh kariza ryanitis um [Music] so it is hard to distinguish whether or not this is pollen related or is this uh truly related to covid19 for many of my patients that i've been following for years it has pretty much been you know this is the time of year where they are suffering so i evaluate them differently than somebody coming in who doesn't have uh problems with pollen uh there are some atypical um uh presentations that have been associated with uh covid19 that i want to talk about that uh digestive issues apparently about three percent of people with coven 19 their presenting complaint has been uh diarrhea another one is a loss of taste and smell again in both of these you have to wonder if it is related to the ace2 receptors that may be found uh maybe in a little bit of a higher concentration in these individuals malaise confusions myalgias arthralgias headaches and dizziness yes these can be seen with other viruses now what are the populations at risk well if you have underlying lung disease such as copd pulmonary fibrosis of course asthma you're going to have to be put into a different category since this virus attacks the lungs specifically and um if you already have an inflammatory response going on in the lungs and you are now infected with covid19 it is like adding fuel to the fire uh patients that have immunologic dysfunctions um such as hiv uh also run the risk of uh being more susceptible to covid19 now there is a caveat to this uh especially if you have hiv patients that are currently on therapy well controlled and especially if they are on a protease inhibitor it is possible that they are protected against coving that is more of a theory than anything but when you look at the science that can make sense uh if you have underlying cancers of course that makes sense that you're immunocompromised here's something interesting the severe obesity uh john abel who's a colleague of mine who does a lot of work down in um south georgia uh one of the epicenters at albany um with covet 19 at uh phoebe memorial uh apparently most if not all of the patients with covid19 that are intubated are obese uh this segways into whether or not you have some underlying chronic illnesses that are not well controlled such as diabetes kidney disease or liver disease uh this can have a negative impact if you become infected with covid19 you also have to raise some questions about see some of the data that's coming out about lower socioeconomic areas uh with patients that may have a lot of these underlying diseases that are not well managed pregnancy um for those of you who were involved with the epidemic of h1n1 back in 2009 uh i know specifically uh we had a number of not only women that of child bearing years that were in the icu on ventilators because of age flu because of influenza but uh we also had several women that were pregnant and wound up delivering uh their babies in the icu um what are some of the complications again acute respiratory distress syndrome has been seen uh in these patients as dr hayman pointed out it may not be ards specifically uh but uh there is uh quite a bit of inflammation that occurs in the lungs irregular heart rates arrhythmia uh myocarditis myopathies have been seen again we have to wonder if this is in relationship to the ace2 receptors but again in general viruses have been known to cause myocarditis and myopathies uh cardiovascular collapse um again i'm always concerned whenever we have cardiovascular collapse uh if this is due to let's say a cytokine storm where there is just an overwhelming amount of inflammation occurring that is having a negative impact on the vascular system from a neurological point of view apparently we've had a couple of case studies now of guillain-barre uh and encephalitis being seen uh this again it has been seen with other viruses this is an autoimmune process uh and again there are treatments for the guillain-barre syndrome so as time goes on it will not be surprising if we see more uh neurologic manifestations associated with covin-19 abnormal blood clots um there have been some reports of abnormal uh patients with covid19 developing blood clot formation again you have to wonder how this is related to possibly um covid19 getting into red blood cells but again my more concern is whether or not the cytokine storms uh increase inflammation may be a contributing factor to creating abnormal blood clots again where do we see abnormal blood clots well patients with other autoimmune diseases like lupus and again uh this raises the question uh with these patients that we're seeing all of these uh complications is there some genetic predisposition especially uh as in uh dr hayman uh uh stated earlier that we are seeing young people now without medical histories that are uh having severe complications with this disease um just want to talk about proning um apparently proning has been uh reviewed um earlier uh uh this was an article i found from 2013 uh 2013 on it and uh based on some research that was done on arts back in 2010 um apparently it takes a pandemic to people to implement some of these things when uh your arsenal is starting to run short and um basically it's taking a patient putting them on their stomach this allows for better blood flow and oxygenation to the posterior portion of the lung which is where most of your lung is found lungs are found uh so that whatever is capable of working can work more efficiently again um proning has been shown to work with this and uh some clinicians are now upon discharge of their patients that have been in debated they're recommending to continue proning while they're home at home convalescing genetic predisposition i'm going to talk just briefly about the ace receptors hla mutations and cytokine storms and what we know so far uh apparently some people may have more um um ace uh two receptors that may be more susceptible to um the virus and that's why we're seeing some people having a more profound effect when they get infected with covid19 especially in the younger population um this was something interesting they're looking at hla uh different types and basically they have found that there are some hla types that may have a more of an immunological response to covid19 as opposed to other hl a groups uh the cytokine storm apparently uh there have been found there are beginning to look at some uh subpopulations that have a more profound cytokine storm response to covet 19 which can contribute to the severity of their symptoms and what about testing so moving on to testing pcr right now is our mainstay um and uh there have been some problems initially we were looking more at nasal swabs uh we're finding now that uh the accuracy the uh of the nasal swabs may not be as good as let's say saliva and sputum uh so we're uh looking to do more uh nasal pharyngeal testing and initially we're concerned now that there may have been a certain amount of false negatives associated with this uh testing is getting better uh the performers of the testing are more proficient now so uh it is felt that we are getting more accurate readings that being said is there is still concern that we may have some cross reactivity with other coronaviruses uh if there are present have been present in your body um serial testing is being developed there have been some uh small groups uh that are doing uh serologic testing right now uh i think going forward this is going to be an important concept because we're still trying to figure out how many people may have been infected with this virus and were not symptomatic uh the ranges that i've seen concerning the uh that population that is asymptomatic uh the range has been anywhere from 10 to 50 percent so going forward serologic testing i think will be extremely important to see not only who has it now but also who uh had had it in the past and were completely unaware of this um and so um that is what we're seeing that is it uh for me good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us i'm going to briefly review some of the treatments and with the preface as you guys know nothing has been really approved by the fda specifically for covet 19. some of the treatments though have been under the emergency use and approved and i will highlight some of those in the state of affairs of some of the treatments this is going to be a very high level overview and uh please remember that in week two we will be diving much deeper myself and dr wecker um into the various treatments um and the pros and cons and really some of the clinical trials so what do we have uh really right now um like i said we're just gonna do the 30 000 level of initial treatments review the potential mechanism of action with covet 19 and really some of the other future studies that are ongoing of course we cannot escape without talking about the most debated uh probably current drug right now is hydroxyclork when obviously as you guys know really in the media um you know touted from the initial in vitro trials that um it was shown to block the viral entry into the cells by inhibiting you know the glycosylation of the host receptors and obviously you know by doc mr trump and touted as the potential treatment for covet 19. so what is hydroxychloroquine as many of you guys know and have probably used it in many of your patients for a variety of illnesses mainly malaria and autoimmune it was shown in vitro to have good antiviral in slowing the replication of the virus in vitro of covet 19. so what is the proposed mechanism here um they think kind of similar to malaria as actually as that republic has mentioned blocking you know viral entry into the cell through this h2 receptor and then making really the host cell less hospitable to the virus so a lot of proteolytic processing endosomal acidification to kind of make the cell intracellularly more hostile for the virus and obviously stop or slow down the replication now as we also know hydroxychloroquine does have definitely immunomodulatory effects through the attenuation of certain cytokines as you know it's mainly used in a lot of autoimmunological rheumatoid arthritis lupus and others and it really thought to do this obviously by modulating this immunomodulatory cytokine production uh response and and so could it possibly early on you know if we slow down viral cell entry slow down viral replication immunomodulate can we possibly slow down the progression of these susceptible patients that are you know with higher risk factors are more susceptible to the serious um effects of covid19 now chloroquine was shown to inhibit the sars cobia ii obviously the virus that causes covet 19 illness um in vitro hydroxychloroquine which is the cousin of chloroquine has shown in vitro activity but hydroxychloroquine in general is a bit less toxic and um less adverse reactions so what is the current dose there's many that are out there that you see depending on the literature but probably based on pharmacokinetic data and some of the trials that have been available so far 400 milligrams bid for day one sometimes in patients you will see higher doses like 600 milligram um you know on day one and then followed by 200 milligrams bid for the next four days so most of the protocols that you will see in uh outpatient or you know for less severe or inpatient really it's the 400 milligrams bid for day one and 200 milligrams bid for the next four days um some other ones that you may see 200 milligrams tid for five days 200 milligrams bid for 10 days now the big concern here obviously is chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may potentially cause qt prolongation so there is the risk of that potentially so you do want to obviously be careful with that monitor that and probably you know weigh the risk versus benefits in patients that have qt prolongation syndromes or on concomit medications that prolong the qt interval hypoglycemia can potentially happen so we have to monitor patients that are on obviously anti-hypoglycemics and probably the main effect of that honestly is the anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory effect of the drug retinal warning obviously this can cause retinopathy but it mainly this is really an effect of longer term use potentially neuropsychiatric effects of the drug so we really don't have you know the typical clean trials that we look for you know randomized multi um center placebo controlled all the good stuff that we're used to but right now you know we're flying we're doing a lot of stuff on the fly because we haven't seen anything like this and we're trying you know i say we're into just save patience mode right now so as you know the two popular one that have been debated are the ones that came out of china and came out of um basically um in in france you know so in this one they looked at hydroxycorp 100 milligrams tid for 10 days and they basically was really general you know inclusion if patients were in the hospital with covid19 and then they were treated basically they had to be 12 years or older and basically their primary endpoint was to look at viral clearance um at day six and this was really typical patients you know and i think as dr him and dr piglesi mentioned you know before we used to think well this is mainly gonna affect and make really older patients comorbid conditions really sick but unfortunately we are seeing you know young healthy people succumb to this illness and and so you do see definitely younger patients so in the control group slightly younger 51 years of age on the hydroxychloroquine and they basically ranged anywhere from asymptomatic that were positive to some of the obviously more complicated and as you can see basically the time of onset of symptoms and then when they got onto the trial was roughly four days uh this was another trial um so this was the original quick one it was only in 36 patients then they followed it up with a longer um or not longer but a bigger trial 80 patients basically single center observational single arm and again these were adults with pcr confirmed sars cove 2 and they received drugs for at least three days with a six days follow-up and again and you can see this one um some of the patients had the comorbid condition so you would think they would be potentially sicker um definitely some of them had the comorbid fever that you see and again about five days from onset of symptoms till they uh were placed into the drug trial and then what they saw is um in the study about 12 ended up on oxygen therapy about 3.8 percent was transferred to icu and then the length of stay in the um infectious disease was roughly about five days and about four days um until time to discharge so the summary of of both studies really that looked at the hydroxychloroquine and then the famous question where i was asking too is is azithromycin needed right so in the first trial they also added azithromycin in about six patients in the second larger publication we really they didn't distinguish how many patients were on hydroxychloroquine alone versus hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin um and so what they showed is that really um in the second publication which had you know bigger numbers um 83 really improved the day seven and 93 at day eight uh post treatment so definitely these studies had some issues right you know so the inclusion exclusion was not clearly defined small sample size sometimes the viral loads were not measured and there's issues with testing as we mentioned also you know huge age range you know not stratified for disease and things like that and really we there is some potential issues but what what what are they telling us from the in vitro and at least initial in vivo data and also some of the case reports that we're hearing from around the country that probably treat early you know some of the hospitals use definitely these protocols some have stopped using it and i really think the problem is with this combination or with this drug hydroxychloroquine specifically we really need to use it earlier in the course of illness rather than later because look how it works it mainly slows down entry into the cell and slows down viral replication and modulates the immune the immune storm possibly and that's why i think it makes more sense that we use it earlier in treatment versus later and the hydroxychloroquine effectiveness is encouraging we definitely have more and more trials that are running across the country looking at prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine and frontline employ you know healthcare workers now and also looking at the efficacy if used earlier versus later in the day so obviously be careful of the qtc type stuff the other issue is short supply issue right this was the big issue with this because everybody started hoarding it mainly healthcare professionals when they saw the studies they started prescribing it for themselves and their families and everybody else which caused some short supply issue for patients you know for lupus and um and so on so um another larger trial came out of china looked at 400 milligrams sulfate twice daily on day one followed by the milligrams so this is an ongoing study we just have basically initial uh initial uh prelim from the state council of china that chloroquine phosphate had demonstrated marked efficacy and acceptable safety in treating coven 19 associated pneumonia in a multi-center clinical trial um so this is the one that we're waiting for the publication but this is kind of their unofficial statement uh from the study and and so again these studies are going to be trickling out you know uh le pen of your retinovir combination is a combination of antiviral so again the world health organization as you know is running trials with hydroxychloric and with the azithromycin and also with lapanevia retinovir combination um so this one is a study of 199 patients they were hospitalized adult patients and again with decreased oxygen saturation this cohort would then include mild moderate as well as severe hypoxic patients and with this study they did not see a difference in mortality at day 28 and there are some adverse reactions this is really an hiv drug that's used obviously as an antiviral but the question is again it did not show difference in immortality because again i think similar to the hydroxychloroquine story we really have to look at the mechanism of action of these drugs and study them in the appropriate cohort so this included mild moderate and severe hypoxic patients so the question is again since this is an entry viral and slows down replication does this make more sense again to test in milder cases early on to see if it's effective and again we're all waiting for many trials that are being conducted here in the united states and also around the world with the world health organization the other ones that are getting a lot of splashes in the literature is the interleukin-6 blockers so these are monoclonal antibodies so to lizzyumab um and cerlumab are being studied now many clinical trials going on in the hospital specifically to uh for you know um under clinical trials so these are interleukin six antagonists and basically the thought is that with this virus we do see high levels of interleukin uh a bunch of interleukins but specifically interleukin-6 and could block and obviously decrease the cytokine storm that we see um into these patients now we know as we mentioned the sars cova2 depends on the h2 receptor for entry um and there was debate you know initially as you know and really we still have the debate patients that are on ace inhibitors in kel in uh arp angiotensil receptor blockers because they upregulate the ac2 receptor is that bad and could that make people more prone for the penetration of the stars too now we're looking at really the genetic polymorphism and of the ac2 and what does that mean and actually now they're looking at our blockers such as losartan in patients requiring hospitalization to see if that may be a path to block entry of the virus into intracellularly some other things that are being looked at this literally just came off hot off the press yesterday i was reading it um jama april 13. um some other things that are being looked at with this obviously we'll dive more into for next week rybaveren interferon alpha and beta rim deserver obviously is getting a lot of national attention as the antiviral it's available in clinical trials and compassionate use savvy perivere um so this one has pretty good you know really it looks like efficacy it's one antiviral out of japan um immunoglobulin therapy and of course convalescent plasma therapy is also being looked at now um a lot and a lot of clinical trials are ongoing with that also so and here's all the references for you if you need them and thank you for your attention from my heart hey great sahar thank you um you know i'm going to go through in about five minutes because i know we want to leave some time for questions there's another interesting thing if all of you guys are familiar with nicotinamide riboside that's also being studied right now because as you get inflammate systemic inflammation going on whether it's metabolic inflammation or acute inflammation from a the you know the the covid19 what happens is is that the part substrates are upregulated and you basically destroy your nad uh and which ends up causing these problems in the mitochondria so you end up losing mitochondrial energy and there's actually being some studies being done at nih with nicotinamide riboside in regards to covid19 so uh just an off track off topic piece and i know we're going to go through things for immune support uh next week i think i'm on or the week after so uh you know we'll get through that hey the big thing guys is is that we all know people are flipping out they're anxious they have worries about their their uh you know what's going on and that means that they're having trouble either managing their daytime anxiety or it's causing them to have sleep problems and they're and obviously the issues with that are when you start to be anxious and you start to lose sleep that's going to create problems in terms of immunity in terms of cellular repair and in terms of triggering a baseline of metabolic inflammation known as metaformation where we're up regulating things like interleukin 6 and quad and 2 and tgf beta so so i want to go right to this piece just because of the time uh and and this is the issue guys daytime hyper arousal via emotional and physiologic consequences triggers the sympathetic nervous system to become hyper aroused so i can't i mean i'm still seeing 15 20 people on my my heavy days all virtual every person that i talk to almost to a fault uh they're they're anxious they're nervous they're concerned on many levels and this triggers that central nervous system uh hyper arousal so they're going through internalization of the emotions maybe they've got their kids at home and they're having a home school while they're healthcare professionals probably people on our call right now are experiencing this remember not used to having your three kids around you all the time and uh and and so this anxiety and internalization can trigger that cns hyper arousal which based on obviously genetic variability or vulnerability um changes in sleep where's their hormone balance at with cortisol uh that if you're menopausal or andropausal and then people start to rely on things like caffeine nicotine to get them through that their day but even more importantly people are drinking record levels of alcohol apparently so uh so all of this ends up creating a a cycle of uh sleep disturbance and and you know this is one of the key things we can try to do to help people is can we get them to breathe deep can we get them to to uh calm their stress down during the course of their day can we get them to then re you know initiate a circadian rhythm to get them to sleep at night and so what i want to do for you i've only got to i want to i want to make sure we get questions it's so important obviously when your cortisol's up you block slow wave sleep and you and what happens is you increase corticotropin releasing hormone which ends up triggering you know mast cell activation histamine leukotrienes all these things start to happen as your peripheral crh goes up as well as as your cortisol goes up and then has a direct effect on the gut i just put together a couple i've got some supplements here you should think of real quick first guys this is uh better known as rilora nice for improving cortisol balance restores the circadian rhythm of cortisol 250 milligrams three times a day i'll leave these uh to you to re to review i use holy basil when people have their when they have issues with irritable bowel syndrome and they're stressed out so people are saying yeah my ibs is kicking up i'm really stressed out you want to include holy basil in that it actually has some very nice studies on it for regulation of the hpa axis and it's an immunomodulator i know i'll go through some peptides and things that you can use with the immune supplement support and the next the following talks but this is one that's a great immunomodulator as well as something that reduces stress um i'm like i said i'm gonna go through this pretty quick so we have time for call for questions theanine this is for the person that perseverates i give 200 to 400 milligrams three times a day especially in these times and and it really helps people because it helps them to re-establish their sacrament rhythm and get their alpha wave sleep back it helps to reduce phenylethylamine production in the brain which means we're going to perseverate less they don't get drowsy on it i use kava especially in women because it helps to slow down the stress response in the amygdala uh and so i'll add kava into this as well and i'll do this during the day and or at night and i've got some great studies here that were double-blinded in the corcoran database showing that it was effective but typically it's 250 milligrams of a 30 percent cover loctone extract three times a day now you can do it twice a day you can do it just at bedtime if you want i play with all these with people and see what's the effective mix for them when they're having issues obviously you can reach in the prescription pad and go for things like gabapentin or tracidone if you want but i i really like to try to get people to be as functional as possible uh and and therefore utilize these agents first mag three and eight a big one to help people calm their brain and uh the other one jujube seed which a lot of people don't realize this office extract helps with hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroprotection uh typically around 250 to 280 milligrams at bedtime is going to work for that uh and and so it's just important to realize i know i only had a few minutes um help people to manage their daytime stress encourage them to do deep breathing get them to do something that'll get their mind off the stress they're under try to get them to initiate their circadian rhythm for sleep and i'm gonna let it go with that so at least we can answer a question or two thank you to our panelists for giving us tremendous insight into this topic now it's time to take a few questions that have come in can antihistamines help with coronavirus um if that's for me i would say no because it may dry out the mucosa too much um so i would try and avoid antihistamines at this time um for copic 19. now that being said again if there's concern that you may have allergic rhinitis associated with it and you do take antihistamine and improve uh you pretty much uh are on the right track some of the newer preparations might be of an assistance because it does have a tendency to reduce inflammation but that uh that's pretty minimal so if you do have covid19 i would try and avoid antihistamines at this time um i just want to add one quick thing to that so you know corsetin is an interesting one and i'm sure um dr lavelle will cover in a couple weeks but you know that one is interesting they're looking at it as being a zinc ionophore kind of similar to the hydroxychloroquine two and then quercetin has a little bit of a mast cell stabilizing action also we use a muscle activation syndrome so that one might be interesting to use really for the zinc ionophore and the mass still stables that kind of tubers with one stone in this set next question what is the better treatment for chronovirus an immunomodulator or an immunostimulator i i would i would say to be safe and aiming a modulator [Music] the concern i think we all have even in the um the natural compound category is uh the exacerbation of a cytokine storm and certainly uh botanicals like elderberry or echinacea even vitamin d uh might exacerbate a cytokine storm and so while those things might be fine for you know sort of more benign infections like the common cold or even the flu i would suggest against them in covid because of this known phenomenon and so you have other options like a plant sterolin uh plant sterolins help to modulate uh the immune response um we also know just building glutathione levels helps to modulate the immune response so taking n-acetyl cysteine for example so you have other choices that are a bit more nuanced you will find in the letter that we send out this week that you can send on to your patients it includes both recommendations for immune support mostly immunomodulators but also a recommendation to avoid uh immune boosters that we're a bit concerned about yeah and i think to add to that you know some of the medicinal mushrooms and other immune stimulators in addition to the one andy mentioned so i think definitely you have to be careful especially in the sicker population because they're more prone to the cytokine storm so that's another group that a lot of people are using that are immune stimulants that may potentially cause problems what i mean one of the biggest things you can do you know pre-treatment is just try to get people eating healthier i mean one of the biggest things that triggers inflammatory cytokines is you know diets that you know influence metabolic syndrome and and obesity right so you don't want to forget about that and obviously things like thymus and alpha 1 or thymus extracts actually can help just to kind of reinforce immunomodulation um and and then obviously the sterols and steroids i mean what andy was right on i mean you want to go for more things like you know iv extract for the lungs and those kind of things on the on the early onset side versus doing the strong you know echinacea goldenseal type of things which trigger the uh you know strong immune defenses and sadly we have a lot of questions but we are out of time so we must end the discussion here i want to thank you again to our panel of experts and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us today be sure to tune in next week for week two of this series taking place next wednesday april 22nd at 12 pm eastern standard time have a wonderful afternoon and be safe thank you see you everybody stay safe bye take care you", "QjAcg9DHF2I": "how do you brand a medical

from subculture to pop culture go astray your calling", "n-QhM-XGNq8": "I got some bad news we've got to go to science class in this video okay but the good news is I'm not Professor mouth-breather that smells like coffee because of his deviated septum I'm actually here to give you some fun information that you can put into a practical application and hopefully get some good results from what I'm going to talk about today is how to improve energy at three different levels of the ATP process okay it's a very complex thing but I'm gonna do my best to put it into a very condensed in somewhat analogy form so that it all makes sense because when we look at the body's ability to create energy it all comes down to ATP adenosine triphosphate and we're gonna find out a lot about ATP today and we're gonna understand exactly how we create energy and how this whole process works so let's go ahead and let's dive in to some not so nerdy but fun science hey you were tuned into the Internet's of leading performance nutrition and fat loss channel new videos every single Tuesday Friday and Sunday at 7 a.m. Pacific time in a bunch of other videos peppered in throughout the week as well so make sure you hit that little Bell button so you can turn on notifications and know whenever I go live or post a new video let's go ahead and let's dive in so we have to start with an ATP overview a lot of you might know what ATP is but a lot of you may not see ATP is simply adenosine triphosphate the simplest way to put it is it is exactly what gives us energy every blink of the eye every breath you take every single movement micro movement nano movement involves ATP it involves it didn't seem triphosphate okay so for this to occur we need mitochondria now you see a lot of my videos I talk about mitochondrial efficiency mitochondrial machinery and all this in that basically all mitochondria is is a factory in which ATP is created or synthesized so we want to have efficient factories so when we look at the entire efficiency process of creating energy and oxidative phosphorylation it can be broken down into three very simple phases of ATP flux and phosphorylation so the first phase is what's called the electron transport chain I'm not even going to begin to go down that rabbit hole because the electron transport chain in my opinion is fairly complex and it's never described super super well but the electron transport chain sets the pace for oxidation so the electron transport chain or phase one is all about getting more mitochondria or improving mitochondrial density to put into analogy it's about building a better Factory building a bigger Factory the bigger the factory the better the output then we go ahead and we talk about phase 2 which is known as the ATP coupling phase it's where we have the whole ATP interaction with oxygen and all that it's the efficiency process okay so now we've built a big factory first but now we want that factory to be efficient okay more so we want to dive deeper into that we want does that factor we have happy employees are they rested are they performing well it's every operation of the factory inside that monic Andreea right so phase one is building the factory how much factory space do we have phase two are step two is about the efficiency and how that factory operates so then we go into space three or Step three which is actual energy production or ATP synthesis itself this is very very important because this is the actual production factory size happiness of the factory and the overall output what are you actually creating and this involves of course the ADP to ATP synthesis that whole process which I'll explain a little bit more detail here in a second so I'm gonna give you tangible ways to improve each and every one of these steps because they are inflection points and if we improve one step we can change the direction and the magnitude of energy because they're so malleable so if we improve step one then step two dramatically improves and we improve step to then improve step three just by default now I know it sounds a lot of craziness but trust me it will start to make some sense so step one the electron transport chain and exercise creating the bigger mitochondrial house creating the bigger factory so one thing that we know is that our respiratory capacity improves with exercise so the more that we do cardio the more that we improve our respiratory rate the more that we have oxygen uptake and we have just the ability to kind of cope with that so basically our uptake rate of oxygen is closely related to our maximum energy output it really is so the Journal of applied physiology actually published a study it was pretty interesting they took eight weeks of endurance training and what they found is that after eight weeks they had a pretty darn big increase in mitochondrial density but also power so here's what's interesting is most people think that when you just do cardio you're only improving your endurance work well that may be true because you improve your vo2 max but you actually have a secondary improvement in terms of ATP production because you actually improve your might Andreea you get more blood flow so you get bigger better mitochondria so what this study found is that with just a 14% increase in vo2 max there was a subsequent 40% increase in overall mitochondrial density so just by doing a little extra cardio and pushing the limits a little bit and getting that cardio burn and doing your hit training and things like that you actually improve the ability to be stronger and better and faster in other facets of your training so a little bit of extra cardio that you may normally skip on is actually going to make your bench better it's gonna make your squat better and it's gonna make you perform better and sprint faster literally not just any kind of weird nonsense okay so add your cardio don't skip it don't be afraid of it okay then we go into step 2 step 2 is the coupling process so this is the whole process of efficiency right so you have the factory build you did your cardio you had your bigger factory now we want good workers in there we want a lot of workers that are happy to be there it's cram packed producing a lot of energy and it's the whole process of association with oxygen so one of the best ways that you can improve that is simply by getting dietary nitrates in now one of the ways that you can do that is through like concentrated beet juice things like that I know a lot of you are probably on a low-carb diet so you may not want to totally consume a ton of beet juice but you can get beet juice concentrate you can find it online things like that pretty easy but the dietary nitrate is gonna do is it's gonna increase oxygen availability which improves phosphocreatine synthesis so this whole process means you're improving the amount of oxygen that's getting in there the amount of basically new energy flow or new employee flow for this factory right so you're getting more and more employees coming in that are doing more and more good work and therefore increasing the output so that's a simple one to fix there then we go into step three how can you actually improve the ATV production itself what is coming out of the factory in the way of energy we built the big factory we have the workers and now we actually want to see the fruits of our labor we want to see that energy production so this whole process is known as oxidative phosphorylation let me break it down very simply you have ATP adenosine triphosphate there's three phosphate molecules when you start to produce energy you cleave off one of the phosphate molecules and you're left with a DP adenosine diphosphate well in order to get energy back you have to have phosphorylation the addition of a phosphate molecule back to the ADP so the ADP or the ATP turns into ADP then we turn it back into ATP in that process is very very small but very important and what happens is we have a specific feedback mechanism within our bodies every time ATP turns into ADP we have a system that tells our brain or tells our body hey this just occurred we need to add that phosphate molecule now we're talking about efficiency down to the nanosecond so we want sensitivity we want our body to know the nanosecond the nano nano nano nanosecond that that energy is being used so that it can replace it well one of the best ways that you can do that is of course by training but also by adding the right Omega threes in see here's where I think it's interesting the Journal of physiology actually found that just supplementing 2 grams of EPA eicosapentaenoic acid in one gram of Doukas a hexanoic acid DHI symbol Omega threes made a huge difference up to 450 percent in the overall omega-3 content within that mitochondria so what that means is that you ended up having more ability to have that ADP ATP sensitivity super super critical so simply by adding Omega threes you made it less inflammatory made in a more sensitive process of the body could create more energy faster so now to put it all together we have a big factory with lots of happy employees that do a really good job they have all the tools necessary to do their job efficiently so they produce a lot of power now the interesting thing is of course you can add your Omega is there when you look at the big picture of things there's some other things that you can do one of my favorite ways just a sort of bio hack and this really comes down to the brain a lot because they brain uses ATP to is utilizing cordyceps so cordyceps is a specific kind of mushroom and you see it in a lot of coffees and the elixirs and things like that cool thing is cordyceps has been shown and actually published in a study by the Journal Life Sciences to improve ATP production by 32% and a lot of it works within that electron transport chain ecosystem so remember how I was talking about doing extra cardio to improve the factory size while cordyceps are shown to do that they improve that mitochondrial density that's why you actually get fired up and you feel so smart when you take quarter steps because it's very efficient you feel in the brain more than anything but long-term you can feel in the body too now those of you that know my know that I'm a huge fan of for stigmatic they offered these things they have quarter steps they have lion's mane they all have them an awesome coffee elixirs and things like that that you can taste super super awesome so go ahead and click on the link down in the description you can give them a shot special discounts for all my fans all my subscribers so just make sure you check them out they're also a huge sponsor of this channel and make everything like that's possible so between all these things you've got cordyceps again down in the link in the description you've got omega threes I don't even care what brand you use at this point it's just a matter of using them okay little bits of nitrates okay so we're talking about like beet juice things like that possibly even in an o2 supplement and then adding your cardio don't skimp on your cardio this alone is going to have a huge effect and sort of a butterfly effect on your overall energy your overall metabolism and your ability to ultimately burn fat long term - so I apologize for the sciency video I know some of you out there really got the grasp of this and I know some of you it might have just been a little bit too crazy I promise I'll break it down better in other videos as we go along but until then thank you for tuning in I'll see you in the next video", "7z5M6a-4hqE": "good afternoon students here again we will see the another session of doses regimen pattern those therapy account to pharaoh kinetic and disease patterns so in which we will discuss the dosage designing how we will give the dose how will decide the dose according to the disease and disease patterns so this is the second lecture of the topic in this topic we will start with the design of doses regimen and multiple dosing here dosage recipient is the manner in which a drug is taken it is selection of drug doses root and frequency of administration in an informed manner to achieve therapeutic objective what is our goal our goal is to attain the therapeutic concentration to produce the effect means that drug must produce the efficacy and by producing that effect our disease will be our disease symptoms will be overcome that will be our goal so here we have to define or have to decide the dose or root of administration or frequency in such a meth in such a way that it should not increase the dose or it should not decrease the tools and it should maintain the dosing parameter or concentration of the drug in such a way that it is it will produce the positive therapeutic effect the duration of most illness is longer than a single dose therefore to prolong the therapeutic effect multiple dosing doses regimen is preferred because during the prolonged or longer treatment just like in case of tuberculosis or leprosy or fungal infections skin infections or in case of cancers we prefer the longer therapy we require longer therapy for that disease or that conditions so in that a single dose is not sufficient so far you have to take the drug for longer period for more frequency of those will you require so before taking that drug for longer frequency we must evaluate their effects we must evaluate their kinetic property we must evaluate their dosing that how much dose we have to give at how much frequency that we had to ascertain before giving that therapy so here we are doing that same thing we are doing by monitoring way we are controlling our therapy we are controlling their effects we are checking their effects we are controlling the doses also and also we are check out the doses forms as well as root of administration to identify the correct dose to correct doses regimen correct root of administration and correct frequency of those that four things we are going to be find out here now here the students which you can see here this is the graph of a drug ex it is an example of any truck if you are taking any truck how it will produce the crap now if you'll see the graph has been plotted the concentration against the time this is the time and it is the concentrations now at which at this point we are giving the drugs our patient is receiving the drug once he received the truck immediately the concentration will start to rise slowly slowly it's start to rise and here at this point what is this this is the minimum effective concentration means from this concentration and from this time we will get the effect of that drug suppose this time will be near about 10 minutes so from 10 minutes we will start to get the effects and at this concentration we will start to get its effects now again it will start to rise the graph will increase its concentration into your blood slowly slowly slowly and at this point it is the maximum concentration of the drug into our blood and it is also called as c max c max so it is a maximum concentrations now once it attains that maximum concentration from that point it will start to decline its concentration slowly slowly it will decline its concentration into our blood and after few period it will again attain the minimum effective concentration so from the point at which we are start to get the effect of that drug and up to the point at which we have caught or the reflect the effects have been reflected so in between this period it is called as duration of action means after this point as the time will progress suppose 10 minutes it required to start the action again another another 15 minutes required to got the c-max so another half an hour or happiness suppose one hour one hour is required to complete or to have a duration of action and after that it will start to decline the concentration as the concentration declines the effect also will decline the truck won't show any effects and finally here it will slow down it will come to the polar position come to normal zero cut position so here means up to this after this point we we got the effective effect to concentration or we got the response of that and between this minimum effective concentration it is the and maximum therapeutic concentration means above this concentration we can't get its effects so between these two between these two points it is nothing but the therapeutic range means whatever drugs we are receiving that must be given in this therapeutic range if you are giving and the drug descent is therapeutic range different different drugs are having their different own therapeutic range some drugs are having high margin of therapy cranes some drugs are having very narrow therapeutic range so in case of narrow therapeutic range we had to give the drug very very cautiously because if you will give the drug more than maximum therapeutic concentration it will start to produce a toxic effects and if you give the drug below than minimum effective concentration it won't show its effects so that's why in that condition we have to do that very smartly try to do the drug very very smartly and optimum dosage regimen is one in which the drug is administered in the suitable dose that's why by considering all these parameters we must give the suitable dose of that drug with sufficient frequency that ensures maintenance of the plasma concentrations within the therapeutic window we must cue the drug and its frequency in such a way that it should not increase the concentration more than maximum therapeutic effects now within the therapeutic window without excess fluctuation and drug accumulation means there should not be more fluctuation like when you are drying any vehicle suppose we are driving a bike so how we will release the clutch and how we will increase our speed so here that decides so slowly we have to release the clutch and slowly again we have to increase the to increase the speed like that the same thing is here suddenly the no fruction should be there certainly we are increasing the dose and suddenly decrease the dose it should not happen you should maintain the steady state concentration means you are your your doses or your concentration of the drug in the blood should be revolved into this margin into this interval it should not low down here you should not go ahead than this so it is called the perfect dosage designing that we should do and for the longer period we should design our therapy in this manner now here we will discuss the approaches to design the dosage regimen how we will design the doses regimen now the first way is empirical dosage regimen when we are working on large number of populations so by our experience we are start to calculate the dose and we are deciding that this dose is sufficient or perfect one for these peoples for example we can follow pain as a painkiller paracetamol 500 mg is perfect dose so by our experience by working on the lots of populations we can do this it is an empirical process regimen same thing in case of antibiotics like cipizzi or superoxide or in case of macular antibiotics or quinoa loans so by our experience we can decide when we are working on large number of populations so it is a common formula or common planning we are deciding for any sort of disease condition or any comorbidity now here individualize the doses regimen it is a process regimen which we are designing or defining for the specific individual for specific person because percent of person variation will occur the dose which we are giving to the a will not produce the same effect the dose which we will give to the patient p that difference may be there so that's why we have to individualize the regimen according to the patient's health status his body weight his age sex his physical health this is status according by considering all things according to all these things we have to plan where to design the process regimen and it is called as individualized process resume now doses regimen on population average so here there are two parameters one is fixed model and another is adaptive model what is fixed model it means we are giving the same formula same frequency for all the populations for example quinolones in the disease of malaria in plasmidium 5x so we are giving the fixed doses means we are giving the 500 mg doses into multiplication of six so for first day we are giving the two doses next day we are giving the one and after again two days we are giving the one dose so in divided doses we are planning so same therapy or in case of uh the infection bacterial infection of e coli suppose so in case in that we are giving the cp exit so we are giving the dose of 200 mg divided multiplication by six means two times a day for three days means total 200 mg multiplied by six means three ground those we are giving so it is fixed model for any therapy it is a fixed model so by either by fixed model we are treating the patients or adaptive model sometimes we have to do the adaptation according to the conditions environments according to the disease status health status age sex we are doing the adaptation into the model of our therapy and our frequency so we are doing some modification we are doing some amendment into our therapy it is called adaptive model now here does it mean it can be divided into two types one is those size so what set of dose we are giving suppose parasitomole what we are giving 500 mg or 100 mg or one gram or in case of antibiotic like macrolides or tetracyclines so we are the dose varies so it may be 10 mg or 100 mg or 1 gram so that decides so those size next is dose frequency means we are giving once once in a day or in two day once a time or once in a week or twice in a month or two times in a day or three times in a day or four times in a day so or hourly so that defines that decides your conditions those frequency sometimes you have to cue the drug in case of some antibiotics in case of critical conditions three hours three after three hours you have to give that drugs that injections or that intra venously we have to put that drug into the tree like that that conditions decides so those frequency so that decides so in case of eye drops you are giving two times a day or one times a day or only at night so that the drug and the dosage forms that and this is condition that decide this those frequency population averages calculations are based on the compartment open model what are all the calculations we are doing that depends on the open model compartments and thermokinetic parameters remain constants during the course of the therapy because the admi will be the constants so the whatever drug frustration you are giving to our body so whatever times it require to absorb it is a constant for distribution it also constant and also for metabolism as well as for excretion so it will be the constant one here both sides now how will you decide the dose how you will plan the dose for any new drug which has been end which is going to be enter into the market before that we are doing the clinical trial and it is a part of clinical trial thermokinetic department is the part of clinical trial it is a primary part of clinical trial so here we have to decide the dose any clinical trial if you want to run first you have to plant the rose and here the pharma kinetic plays a major role the magnitude of the both therapeutic and toxic responses therapeutic response means at which those we are getting the effect it is called throptic response and toxic response at which typical dose at which specific dose we got the toxic systems so we have to check out for both the responses and both the concentrations adverse constitution we got therapeutic and at first question we got the toxic responses depends on the dose size so if those will increase will get thousand crisprs the dog those who will give the therapeutic dose you will get the effect of that typical drug and if you give the less than therapeutic dose you will you won't get any therapeutic effects the dose size calculations requires the knowledge of amount of drug absorbed after the administration of each drug yes we must know the absorption of that drug how much time it required to absorption by which way it will absorb and how fastly are by which root or by which organ it will absorb that we have to identify and find out so that decides our dose size as well as our frequency of those because once the drug will absorb into your body it will go to your your bloodstream it will go into your accessibility circulation and from that point it will start to rise into your system builder circulations and once it will attain one point from which it will start to show its effects and at one point it will start to show its toxic effects so that two points we have to find out now factors to be considered so these factors to be considered when you are deciding any dose when you are formulating any dose of any drug so here first parameter is pharmaceutical parameters pharmaceutical factors so in the pharmaceutical factor one is type of doses forms so what type of boosters form we are preparing either it is tablet means single dose tablet capsule or we are preparing any elixir means we are keeping any liquid propagations or we are producing any parenterals either it is iv or intramuscular or intradermal or saputanese or we are going for the in topical preparations for example it may be cream or ointments or any body spray or any external use preparations like uh ear drop or eye drops so like that any formulations what formulations we are giving according to we have to decide the dose size suppose we are giving an error by intravenous root it require very less dose suppose if you are giving an interrupt by intrarectal root it require somewhat more drug and again if you will give the drug by intra nasal root again it could require somewhat motor and if you are giving the drug by single dose like tablets or capsules you have to give the large dose so like that that defines our doses forms same thing happens in case of over root of administrations now as we are discussed uh from the oral root we will start oral root because in oral route we have to go through the process like bypass first pass method so it is a first pass method which will take or consume more drug because the number of or percentage of drug is also going to bound to our plasma bind so there will be less depth for its activity for its should show its effects so that's why in case of oral root we require more drug after an oral route if you'll go for the nasal root it requires somewhat less stress after nasal root if you go for the intrarectal root again it require somewhat less stroke again from the intrarectal root if you'll go for the parental root so in case of parental root it require very very less duck as compared with the oral and intranasal and intrarectal root and for topical root obviously it requires larger those because it won't go directly into our systemic circulation or it require more drug to go into our systems regulations so in this fashion the root of administration also decides our dose and size of our those the patients will get factors now patients factors or patients conditions will decide the dose of that drug any drug first is individual patients tolerance of the drug just wait okay so here individual patients tolerance of the drug means how much quantity of drug can be tolerated by the patients if patients tolerance is high in that condition we have to decide the dose high if intolerance is there in that condition we have to do the drug very very cautiously by thinking for a number of times we have to decide those so that decides on your tolerability of your patients if tolerance is good you can give the sufficient amount of the drug next is genetic predisposition nowadays it becomes very very critical genetic predisposition it is a condition when the person's genes the person's genes are becoming vulnerable for it becomes the genes phenotype becomes vulnerable they are affected by the environment as well as drugs means for specific peoples who having specific genetic genetic characters they are more vulnerable for typical dcs now for example if you will see there are certain peoples whose who are more prone to cancer some genetic groups are there who may suffer from the blood pressure means hypertension some are some may suffer from the obesity means from the genes it is called genetic predisposition predisposition means here some typical genetic vulnerability is there genetic phenotype will be affected by the environment as well as some few or few drugs just specific drugs so it can affect on your health there are certain people's or i will give some example for example the people who are having o positive or positive they are more prone to have acidity is the fact i saw lots of patients who are having o positive blood group they are having more prone to the acidity sometimes they may develop ulceration also now concurrent administration of other drugs so when we are simultaneously we are adding another drug also so at that time we must check the drug interaction of that another drug with our current so that is also also very very important things because if you won't consider it will produce a drug interaction and it will take the life of patient also so we cannot sacrifice in this manner so here the concrete administration also is very important what drug we are giving with this drugs so if it will produce some toxic effects or any address effects we should give this dose very very less or we'll try to avoid the dose with that drug or we'll avoid that another drug with this now patience is yes obviously it always uh correlates with the patient is in case of mostly in case of kids or the oldest people who are above 60 years old so they are they will require less dose as compared with the alternatives next body weight the persons who are having less body weight below 50 kg so they will require they will require less tools and the persons who are having more body weight or heavy weight so they require models as compared with the low body weight results so that decides your body weight and gender obviously in case of female we can we can't give the drugs very friendly and in case of males the males are uh as compared to the females they are more strong so more dose can also be tolerated by this male so like this gender and also in general another condition like pregnancy or lactation so in that condition also the dose plays a great role in that next is length of illness for how much spirit we have to give that drug that illness will prolong for homosphere for example cancer or hiv or tuberculosis or leprosy or skin disease or in case of hypertension or arrhythmia or diabetes so in this this disease requires longer treatment another is in case of epilepsy it also requires longer treatments or migraine so these are the dcs which require too much longer treatments so in that we can decide the dose of the drug that how much dose we are to give how much safe dose we can give because it will give higher dose for longer grade definitely it will produce the transit effects so we cannot do that too much easily so we have to decide the dose according to the length of the illness general physical health yes whatever general physical health if it is good our physics is good we are not having any allergens we are not having any intolerance because lots of patients are people surviving glucose intolerance so in that case they have take the drug very cautiously or some peoples are having energy of some drugs or some conditions some environmental condition also some fruits also so general physical health it should be normal if you are having low immunity in that case we have to think the dose of the drug next is liver and kidney functions in the patients if your liver and kidney are not in code conditions if they are disease if they are not functioning well in that condition also we have to think twice or thrice before deciding any dose because a small increase in your dose or small addition of the dose of your drug it can increase the problem it can take life also of your patients in case of kidney renal failure where occurs in case of liver your filler will occur and to tackle with this condition it will be very difficult multi it will lead into the multi-organ failure and this is very very critical conditions so these parameters these physical health parameters of patients that also is very very important when you are deciding or when you are preparing any dose size so here again we have discussed the another lecture on these dosing parameters because dosing parameters we must understand how we are designed deciding the dose how we are designing the dosing parameter how we are deciding the dose of any drug because we are going blindly in the clinical trial we don't know what drug or what those of that drug we should start with so that's why we are doing this this biokinetic study before starting our clinical trial once you fix to your dose after that we will start the clinical trial in large number of doses so this is the primary stage of our clinical trial in phase one it is very very important so here we are primarily we are more concerned about the our safety of our drug that's why safety means if your dose is normal if it is good if it is not non-toxic means your trial will be safe so students i hope you understood these points so remaining we will consider will start in next lecture so it is sufficient for today i hope you understood the whole concepts thanks a lot for hearing me", "VJF5UFPhpyQ": "hello welcome all so my title was broad and I've given it a subtitle what's going to talk about osteoarthritis through the medium of something old something new something borrowed something blue and this is what we're going to cover obviously a lot of people have a particular interest in Paget's disease but we're going to see how that can link into my subject topic talk about treatments and evolving understanding of how they work and might work and how that might lead us to novel therapies is that okay so firstly and I include the whole audience in this how many people identify as having osteoarthritis interesting so it's as you expect from the age range it's a little over half hour received wisdom probably Dogma is that osteoarthritis is more common in Paget's disease and I'll talk about why that may be true but actually the evidence for it isn't very strong and like a lot of things we take for granted now that our research methodologies are better we probably need to ask that question again and embed that within newer well-designed studies so when we look at the population as I say over half of the right age will have it it's communist in the hand the knee the hip and of those wanted to have disability less have symptoms so when you look at x-ray changes you get one rate of occurrence when you look at people who have pain and x-ray changes it's less common but the lifetime risk is still very high and here's here's a really key number that's the number of joint replacements done last year collected by the National joint registry that's over a billion pounds worth of activity that's one of the biggest costs biggest single cost there is for the NHS if we had treatment which could slow down and prevent the need for that joint replacement activity that would be a great thing it would save a lot of money it would save a lot of pain and disability that's what we should be aiming for so here I'm going to bring together what we know about osteoarthritis hopefully in an understandable way and please do ask if there's anything that's unclear if we take a joint which is starting to that osteoarthritis and a lot of how many people have heard this wear and tear yeah yeah it's wrong okay this is the old way of looking at it and for many reasons it's actually flawed if it was wear and tear then everybody would get it once they've done a certain amount and and you know Ann's last session on exercise might have caused you harm but there's very clear evidence it doesn't cause you harm and therefore you know we need to understand that that should be God all got rid of it's just a it's a wrong and negative way of thinking about the disease just because your GP says it doesn't necessarily mean it's true what we should replace it with is a more refined understanding that this is a disease of tear a flare and of repair and I'm going to take you through each of those points so when we look at ligament damage the people who have rupture of their cruciate ligaments or a collateral ligament around the knee who will have you know malformed hips so that they have a shallow cup and that leads to instability once you've got pain that then accentuates the muscle weakness and there's two main reasons for that firstly you do less so when you're not doing that type of exercises and we're showing us your muscles atrophy because it's it's important to exercise use-it-or-lose-it as they say and then the second thing is there's a direct reflex inhibition of muscle contraction at a spinal level when you've got pain so both of those things lead to the muscle wasting and that accentuates the instability now if you then have more load on one side of the joint than the other and we can show that in experimental models but we can also see damage which is attributed to that instability accumulating you st. using sensitive takes techniques like magnetic resonance imaging that then is very likely to be leading to micro trauma and there is lots of indirect evidence showing that that is recruiting pro-inflammatory cells to the region in an joint and these cells have actions directly and indirectly they elaborate in pro-inflammatory cytokines these are little molecules that active in and around the joint which make vessels leaky they can activate pain fibers and although there's no pain fibers in the joints in the cartilage itself in normal cartilage as the disease progresses there is inflammation both underneath the bone and also in the lining of the joint so I never understood a medical school why if the if it wasn't an inflammation arthritis why did we get near fusions when you have osteoarthritis of the knee we now know that when you're looking with a telescope you can see the information you can biopsy it you can look under a microscope and you can see that changes are very very similar to other types of inflammatory arthritis so there is inflammation and that's where the flare comes in we've talked about the tear but this is a dynamic process so very often the body is able to repair itself and you don't necessarily get progressive problems that's a really positive and important message because if you first develop the pain in your hands or your knee or your hip and you know it's not inevitable that you're going to go on and eat a joint replacement then that's a positive message and if you also know what the good things are to do and you can take control yourself then that's also a very positive message over time elaboration of active enzymes like matrix metalloproteinases breaks down the cartilage layer and that means that you've then got bone rubbing on bone and once you've lost all that cartilage area and once the underlying abnormal bone is very inflamed there's increased blood flow there's thickening that's where you always get the pain and that's a very consistent relationship okay how it's different in Paget's is there's more load on the joints and there's more metabolic activity okay and both of those processes are contributing both here and enhancing the information we also know that people who carry too much weight have too much fatty tissue that they're really directly releases CRP into the circulation very strong evidence of that and that is adding to the inflammatory burden that drive leading to progression and also the indirect effects which include an increased risk of heart attack since groans everybody happy with that any big questions or was that have we gone through that at the right pace CRP CRP is one of the infantry blood tests that your doctor does it's is c-reactive protein it's released from these pro inflammatory cells and it's a mark of how much active inflammation there is in the body it's a more specific a more sensitive marker than the other tests the ESR where you just take a tube of blood put some anticoagulant in and see how quickly it settles so those are the two tests we use in clinical practice okay so here's the nice guidance so I was on the nice guideline committee we've lost the reference but it but it is referenced and this shows us what the core treatment is everybody should have education every should have strengthening and aerobic exercise so a very grateful for an session and everybody who's overweight should think about weight loss those core things are well evidenced in the next ring the evidence is less secure and at the moment there is still a recommendation for using paracetamol but I'll show you some data which shows that we should reconsider that how many people have taken paracetamol in the last month okay well hopefully that's going to change and then there's lots of treatments where where there is evidence but if you notice because steroids work it's likely it's an inflammatory process and we did do a trial which showed in severe hip osteoarthritis steroid injection is both an effective therapy and you can predict the response from the presence of information on the ultrasound so let's think about price suitable because actually we think it's an analgesic but there is now compelling evidence and that it is a weak non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug much like I boof and naproxen diclofenac these other drugs in terms of the meta-analyses the effect on pain and osteoarthritis is little to none if you look at the good studies the effect is none if you look at all studies then there's a very small effect size but probably not clinically important okay so that's the first thing we usually take things because they work and the evidence that proceeds well does that is now rather weak to knowledge and then there is significant toxicity and all of this data is mainly aggregated data from observational studies because when you've got rare effects you need to look at a lot of people and you need to gather data but trouble with that kind of data is its susceptible to by us because it's possible that people can go onto a tablet because they're bad and are susceptible to more problems anyway but when you look at that data it does show that a dose response so meaning the more paracetamol you take the higher risk of dying the higher the risk you have it being admitted to hospital with a GI bleed the higher the rate of heart attacks and strokes the higher the rate of kidney problems are progressing and new onset kidney problems so that's exactly the profile would expect from an anti-inflammatory and all the scientists here will be saying yeah whether that's channeling by assets it's not a real effect and I will tell them why they're wrong so when we look at a clinical trial we don't normally expect that to tell us about toxicity because normally they're too small and they're too short but if you do a big trial then you can see these effects so here's a trial which was done by Mike Daugherty and Chris hawky those are the two people who you'd really want to do this kind of trial big osteoarthritis expert good expert on on bleeding from anti-inflammatories and this was a big trial it had almost 900 people and they were followed over 13 weeks they were divided into four groups paracetamol at gram three times a day so that's three grams not the full dose but it's a decent dose ibuprofen 400 three times a day that's probably the most you'd be recommended to take over-the-counter half and half and the full dose of each okay and it was a 13 week study so they were followed without comes at day ten week seven week thirteen the key thing is it didn't work okay didn't work didn't help the pain so that's a shame to start with there wasn't a placebo here very often this kind of trial you would include an arm where there's a tree mall Shino is a dummy but in effect the paracetamol has become the dummy arm because it didn't work and you might argue have been a stronger if that included that but but I don't believe in crying over spilt milk I think it's really important we interpret what we have and this is a definitive study when we look at safety and we divide them into those four groups I'm just going to show you the data for for blood count which shows how much blood loss they've got we we have about eight pints of blood and if you lose about ten percent of it then your hemoglobin level will go from around 11 to 13 to 1 gram less okay so it's about 10% drop and that's a clinically important loss if we look at those groups oops if we go through very quickly so you can't see the data and we see that there was 20% of people in the paracetamol group that lost 20% of the blood so one in five same with ibuprofen slightly more with logos remember it was half in half so you wouldn't expect it to be more it expected to be the same or less and when you add had the two together high dose then there was a suggestion of additive blood loss for that level of blood loss but when we look at two grams of blood loss that's about 20% of your blood volume over the three months of the trial it was one percent one percent two percent for the low dose combination and seven percent so the toxicity in terms of major GI bleed and let's say you had a hemoglobin of around 10 once you get down to 8 you might need a transfusion if you lose 3 grams or 4 grams you start to have a significant risk of dying ok so these are important values and there is evidence here of what we call synergistic toxicity which means it's not just adding up it's actually multiplying so it's a bit of a worry and yes because it's in a randomized control trial and the only difference between these groups is the flip of a coin and what they were taking a blinded way and that nobody knew what they were taking this isn't absolutely robust finding which is not susceptible and of the bias that all the observational studies have already shown ok so that means and that's just a pictorial version these numbers seem low but if you if you think about it when people take a inflammatory we know there's a 1% chance one in a hundred per year of a major bleed which could be life-threatening and it seems like the paracetamol particularly when you combine it with others could well be the cause of many of those bleeds because at the moment the standard advice has been to use personal with other nonsteroidals we've misclassified it and that's creating dangers yet if that had only be found once by one meta-analysis doctors shouldn't believe it and the guideline shouldn't change but that's not the case it will look at all the major medical journals including the BMJ including the annals of internal medicine including The Lancet they found the same thing they found the same problems with all the observational study once you triangulate that with this controlled trial which excludes the possibility of bias this means we need to change our practice so moving on to the association between pain and osteoarthritis I'm going back to some really seminal work which was done in and around Manchester in the 1960s by Calgary and Lawrence and their collaborators and Bremen and beer they had a big truck that drove out to places like Lee and Wensleydale and x-rayed people and interviewed people many of whom were doing heavy jobs in the mills and surrounding industries at the time but it was an important study because they looked at the prevalence of x-ray change and this is for rheumatoid arthritis and they associated it with pain but they didn't have any fancy computer so they didn't do the detailed analyses you'd look but but we don't need that because what we can see is in rheumatoid arthritis where it's well accepted there's an association between the inflammation and structural change and symptoms you can see that relationship okay so this is the lowest group who have almost no x-ray change middle group most severe group and obviously it's a little bit cliched isn't it the pink ones are the women and the blue ones should have changed that for me but you can see it's a consistent association whatever the gender and whatever the grade you look at let's now look at osteo arthritis where there's been controversy about whether structure and symptoms are linked and whether there's an association and look actually the the line the line is steeper so there's a stronger Association okay and this was obvious here all this time ago so we've spent a lot of time talking about how there isn't a relationship and that's misleading okay same for the hip we've got smaller numbers in the middle group but you see an even stronger Association and this this work was confirmed when when we looked more recently when I was doing my PhD in Manchester obviously this was a different population within closer to central Manchester but we showed the same Tiny's once you had very severe disease you always had osteoarthritis so we need to throw away this idea that there isn't a link because actually it's the strongest possible link and if we look at the changes you can compare a relatively normal hip where we see that space that space isn't fresh air that spaces the cartilage that's stopping the bone surfaces rubbing together with progressive loss you get narrowing in the space you get more bony Spurs you get thickening of the bone and the inflammatory changes we've discussed which aren't shown well on x-ray but you can see they're progressive and the final stage is claps of the head and you can see there's some start to losing the the shape of the head there so the most advanced change and when we use MRI we can see that subcontrol inflammation so you use the right technique you can see the inflammation and we need to be informed by that and we need to change our treatments to reflect that some work was done by Tim Karsten in the lab where they took bits of cartilage in a tube and they showed that actually when you put in a drug called sulfasalazine we often use for rheumatoid arthritis that it reduced activity reduced breakdown of the cartilage in the test tube now I'm not all that interested in what happens in a test tube unless it reflects what happens in real life okay are you the same so the key thing is whether it works in patients and when you look at a small number of patients you do see it when they start actually you've missed it here this person was on the waiting list for a joint replacement and because the pain was so improved had disappeared they didn't have it how much to delay it by two years so we believe that kind of delay is possible and what we've done last week is to put in a grant where we're trying to look at a very comprehensive set of markers 2,000 of them for a very stable molecules called micro rna's which allows us to check on a simple blood test to see what changes happen when you take a drug or don't take a drug or whether you have osteoarthritis sodon't has to osteo arthritis and the data we have from the thousand families study suggests that this is the strongest marker that we have of aging and probably the best marker of osteoarthritis although we're still going through the full analysis which has been funded by our biomedical research center here and then we're going to if it's successful getting this grant we're going to look and see whether those findings are robust in other areas an American population where they've just had the most detailed investigations you've ever seen this is a whole set of people who've had cereal magnetic resonance images of their knees every biomarker you could think of and every possible conceivable tool to measure how much pain and functional loss they've got so it's the ideal setting to make a comparison and then we've got a set of people who were born sorry born a long time ago but at the age of 85 we started following them almost a thousand people and so we've got a set of people who survived for a long time to 1895 and a set of people who died earlier and we can look and see whether these markers actually predict survival and I don't know I I hesitate to talk about it but because these these molecules are present within the cells and it's quite easy to then put in things to change the activity because it's a it's a very predictable sequence and that means there's a target all we need is the anti sequence to interfere with that pathway so in cancer and in HIV there are already drugs based on this and we expect there to be drugs potentially to modify aging itself you can say yes dr. bill was talking about the elixir of life potentially not to overstate it we don't know whether we will develop treatments but this has the promise for identifying the targets and and our ability to interfere with those pathways and we don't have great treatments for slowing down osteoarthritis at the moment we're also looking in the MRC hip study which lets us look at osteoporosis and survival in that cohort and also drugs which some of you may be taking donata map select phonetic and to see what the effect is of those drugs it's a new window and into how drugs work and allows us to look at that pattern of very detailed expression of my Khamenei's to see how they're working so when when you go to the doctor or you go to the practice you see the nurse don't you or you see the GP or you go to the hospital and you see one person in one room don't you yeah for 15 minutes how does that work for you do you do wait outside for long than you seen for yeah do you get all your questions answered or do you ever come out and think oh god I wish I'd asked them that wish I'd had time to do that well here's here's an answer to that what we've been doing for thus 10 years now in in little community hospitals in our can break and we're now spreading it nationally it has general practices and two other hospitals is we've been seeing people in a room so actually last week I had two group clinics in in Burak I had 28 people I think it was more than people in the room today and in a two hour session where you had another professional giving them education and I was doing micro consoles because it's really important you know way where you're getting to what your outcomes are and that you're achieving your treatment targets so we can we can embed all that in a two-hour session measure the best possible outcomes and achieve better outcomes because my colleagues are doing this for early arthritis in morpeth and the the remission rates are off the scale 50% of people reached remission at 6 months who have implant your tinnitus an 89% get low disease activity remission which compares favorably to every other intervention there is the only difference is this doesn't cost very much because the power is harnessing the education and the peer support and it's very empowering so we we aren't doing this yet for osteoarthritis as such but the escape knee prone program look at a group context so provides evidence that we already know this kind of thing will work and it might be led by the physio prescribing physio might be the perfect person because as we get drugs which work you do want somebody who can prescribe too then in hospitals you might have people and when you look at fast-track surgery which has transformed the rate of complications for joint replacement when you speak to Henry Hudson in Copenhagen it's a great big kind of six foot five tennis playing off the board and when they went from having a week in hospital to two days in hospital what they did would they held a great big group clinic and they got the physio and the nurses and the waterpot immunise just to talk to their patients and say this is what's going to happen it's a step change and what do you know it worked no great no increase in complications saves on clots infections it's just a no-brainer so actually you can do effective care in groups and if you get the right people seen quickly and treated and you've got a strategy to look at the other people and can reduce preferably their progression to disease then you can make a big difference to outcome so what is it it's loads of people in a room together it might be 1620 minutes it creates the time to answer all the questions and yeah your peers are asking questions so there are a few ground rules you need to work on and in particular you know shared confidentiality but once you see this in action you will understand how it works and the patients who have experience of it in general prefer it but it doesn't need everybody to do it to have a big effect on on care because 40% of our follow-up workload in Annakin barrack is done through the groups and it takes the pressure off so everybody else is seen sooner so everybody gets better care I think it's a no-brainer so in conclusion we've talked about the old wear and tear we need to throw away its outmoded it's inaccurate it's negative the new is tear flare and repair and there are opportunities for us and we're doing as much work as we can to identify new treatment targets and transform the treatment of osteoarthritis that's going to help people with Paget's - were borrowed sulfasalazine from inflammatory arthritis and hope to repurpose it for osteoarthritis and it makes me a bit sad that paracetamol is not the same an effective drug that we thought I haven't shown you the date on liver function test those were also worse than ibuprofen and we already know it's the major drug of suicide so it's not like we think it's a safe drug but we probably need to move away from using it and definitely not use it whether other anti-inflammatories and this is what I was going to cover thank you very much [Applause]", "gPADpHcXfis": "different effects actually I mean it's gonna affect the health system apart for anything else isn't it so that's yeah access to drugs and follow-up and and just general good medical care will be very much harder it's gonna have a big impact and you see it already in countries even you know in Europe and the UK the the death rate from other things it's actually much higher than usual right so what is update rate in Vietnam sorry what was the death rate in Vietnam from Kovac we haven't had a single death here Oh fantastic so you're really done a very good job I think yeah the government of Tom well I mean we've we've had 268 patients only and most of them have been in young people so it's not surprising we haven't had that a death but nonetheless is still impressive okay and what's happening in India then does anyone know India India be across 20,000 I think the deaths at our own 700 yeah that is there much testing going on I think they're testing as many as possible of course there's an issue is whether we are doing an optimal test or whether we had partially but the test has been ongoing so at least I mean the the intensive care units filling up or how does it feel in this do they have been filling up they have been filling off in my city we have about I think six or seven hundred plus patients Moomba we have about 4,000 patients Wow so numbers are big in this part of India for sure yeah and and it's there is the country on the lockdown as well yeah it is being locked down officially till third of me which will be about one and a half months yeah then we don't know what happens on photo third of me and is it very strict it's fairly strict if I have to go to hospital I'll be stopped by police at least twice and I had to show my identity saying that I am going to hospital as a doctor so it's reasonably well you it works it seems to work yeah so I think dr. Mohammad is dr. Carter jointness make sure I'm sir can you hear us I mean Strom is facing some difficulty he's trying to relogin and dr. Patrick [Music] we don't see him so how do you deal with questions from this to the people raised the people will ask questions here in the Q&A session maybe if there are large number of question I'll prepare a small PowerPoint but why I can show the PowerPoint and you can answer the questions today answer that today ask him by writing on the chat chat line yeah because some of them will write in the chat and there is a Q&A also you can see at the bottom chat is not available for us I mean we've not kept it open for the only Q&A so they will ask you a name and then we'll answer the questions how does the Q and I work I don't have yeast number four they will ask questions to do through a Q&A which will be see you develop all of us panelists and then probably what I'll do is when you presentation on going L prepare a small PowerPoint on which the questions will be and I can display it so whenever the question I mean just in case if you want to refer to any questions on the Q&A section okay I'll wait for them hello yeah I think you are on both phone as well as distinct laptop one of the thing you are you need to mute it probably because design yeah yeah hello very well thank you sir device on it that's all you know you completely wonderful against our apply for one doing a charge okay I'm thinking the killer so we start in either two three minutes you might say patched I don't mind there's only certain people or I can say some of them will go to the YouTube so to play line my comp alive on YouTube they'll come later no they'll start like it's you can see that on the right side there is it is been mentioned that live on YouTube oh okay it will go on like live on YouTube and many people nowadays actually like to see on YouTube yes because there was this issue about some issues about zoom some of the security issues yeah that's right all right so we're at 2:30 ist so do we want to begin yeah view can begin I think okay I will open it of them yes now it is open to all the attendees yeah we can see that Lanier appearing now okay dr. Twitter we start whenever you like the numbers are still going up so it is cross 100 it's cross hundred now yeah I'm happy to give it another minutes if you want the numbers okay we'll wait for a couple of minutes I'm fine yeah wife who's Louise she's very well unfortunately is in the u.k at the moment she's stuck in the UK so where we're apart but she's very well thank you very much yeah two minutes I think we can start okay some chicken so good afternoon everyone this is going to be a fantastic talk on a topic of interest for many of us tubercular meningitis has not been an uncommon DC in India at all and we have a very eminent speaker in the form of the guides face was going to talk on this topic with our renowned authority on this topic we all know dr. guy rates who is a director of Oxford University and clinicals it's a research unit currently at present in Vietnam and he's presently talking to us from Vietnam we all have heard and listened to lots of papers written by dr. graduates and we all know his work in the field we are going to hear something new about this so what do you dr. guy thank you very much well it's a great pleasure to be able to give this talk it's a sad one in some ways because I would love to have been visiting India because I very much enjoyed this thing and I've given a number of talks there and always enjoyed your company so at least I'm happy to be able to join you by zoom and by YouTube if you're watching by this but I'm also lashes very much looking forward to talking for about five minutes on anything other than kovat it seems as though our lives are completely dominated by it at the moment and it's quite nice to talk about something else but I like you and I'm locked down and in Ho Chi Minh City at the moment and we're not allowed to really do anything very much so it's nice to be able to join you by zoom so I'm going to talk about improving outcomes from tuberculous meningitis and as it's been said this is a very common and difficult infectious disease to treat in India and and also in Southeast Asia where where I work and I just like to share with you some of the research that we've done and and but really made this very clinical I'm interested in in clinical medicine and trying to improve outcomes from from this fatal infection so just to gonna advance the slide if I can let me there we go so just to give you a little bit of orientation you're not so far away from me I'm in Ho Chi Minh City which yeah I'm hoping that you can see the arrow and we work in a large program funded by the Wellcome Trust predominantly and it's part of the University of Oxford and it has full research units one Min Ho Chi Minh City one in Hanoi one in in Nepal in Kathmandu and one in Jakarta down the bottom in Indonesia we're about 450 people in total and our remit is to do research on infectious diseases that ultimately improves the outcome from the serious and life-threatening infectious diseases that occur in this region and TB is obviously one of my my loves and interests particularly brain TB but we do a lot of other research and other infectious diseases such as dengue and malaria and influenza and obviously most recently coded so we run the program across across these four units and essentially we approach our research in this way we we take an important clinical problem it may be tuberculous meningitis it may be thank your malaria or some other infectious diseases and we we carefully clinically characterized them and we define what the problem is and in general that we like to do and we like to conduct randomized control trials of generally of therapeutic interventions but sometimes diagnostic that aim to improve the outcome from those life-threatening infectious diseases but we use these trials as a mechanism for doing other types of research so we we collect the bacteria for example if it's a bacterial infection and look to see why how how and why variation in the bacteria might influence pres presentation and outcome we also look at the genetics of the people because that may to influence presentation and outcome from the disease we look at the pathology and we also look at the pharmacology and in that way we not only answer we hope simple clinical questions such as why or how does a drug improve outcome from an infectious disease but we also gain mechanistic understanding scientific understanding and in doing so and this is the model very much we take in for tuberculous meningitis but these and it's a model that we've we've used to address the treatment of very many infectious diseases and I include the list down there that we're actively working on at the moment are the ones particularly you may be interested in a tetanus we do a lot of work on tetanus we see more than 300 cases a year in our Hospital and and we've just finished a trial of intrathecal immunoglobulin for for that condition and and I hope that we'll be able to let you know the results and sometime in the next six months so things to look out for we've also just started a trial of chloroquine for cove in nineteen and again i hope that those results were available soon so but t back to TB meningitis and the subject of this talk but you will all know that TB meningitis is a has two stages to its pathogenesis and this was discovered if you like by Rick and Mac or doc in the 1920s and 30s working in the USA Johns Hopkins and when they did a series of pathological experiments in rabbits but also some post-mortem dissections in children and they found that there was always a small focus within the brain called they called the refocus which which preceded the the onset of the meningitis so a bacteremia spread the bacteria spreads the bacteria to the brain a riff focused is formed and then when those refocus introduce bacteria into the subarachnoid space so you get a meningitis and the consequences of that you land there well but the inflammatory consequences can be fatal and are fatal in in twenty to thirty percent of people and it's trying to control that inflammation and control the replication of the bacteria causing the infection that has been a focus of our work for many years just to summarize the the pathology of the disease in the center here is a typical necrotizing granuloma associated with tuberculosis and this is the the currency of pathology for all forms of TB but particularly brain TB it conventionally is a basal meningitis you can see here postmortem sample of the brain with the pale exudates of tuberculous meningitis and you can see that radiologically here in enhancing material here in the basal systems of on scanning but it also causes a number of other complications which which can cause catastrophic clinical effects it can cause hydrocephalus more commonly in children but also in adults perhaps enough so 30 or 40 percent of adults it can cause infarct and tuberculosis and also and that can cause a number of different neurological consequences and from cranial nerve science I've given you examples here of sixth and third nerve causes but obviously also long tracks ions and hemiplegia and paraplegia though the manifestations are diverse pathological complications are diverse too and as I've said it's the extremely serious disease and when it causes deep coma as you can see in the picture down here in the bottom the mortality is $0.18 so why should we study TV meningitis why are we interested at all it miss infection well conservative estimates place the disease to cause around at least a hundred thousand cases each year that's probably quite a significant underestimate and you can see from these survival curves why it's important really and so these are survival curves from a study that we did about a decade ago now in Vietnam which included HIV infected and uninfected patients and you can see the differences in survival but but know two things firstly that the majority of the deaths occur relatively early in the first sixty to eighty days of treatment and also that in hiv-positive patients there is much higher death rate but also mortality continues on through treatment now this is probably because of other opportunistic infections these this group didn't would work largely untreated with antiretroviral drugs but it just shows you the importance of this infection to survival and also the the catastrophic outcomes really and in HIV infected patients in between in particular so it's an important infection as a common infection and it kills large numbers of people and I think if there's one thing one message that I'd like to to get over and this is particularly perhaps for more junior colleagues you haven't seen so much of this disease but but TBM really is an emergency the temptation with TB meningitis is to sit on it clinically and not start treatment because you're not certain about the diagnosis and but the problem is is that the greatest benefit that physicians can have is to start treatment early and because that's is associated with a far better outcome and so thinking about the disease and starting treatment often empirically and we'll discuss the diagnosis in a minute is one of the greatest benefits of Accession can give the patient with PDL and just taking that and let that message seriously and will save people's lives so the problem with saying that sand and the more experienced of ammonia ammonia will recognize this immediately is that actually making the diagnosis is extremely difficult there are unfortunately at the moment no really good microbiological tests um there are different approaches that you can take to the diagnosis of TB meningitis first of all you can use clinical algorithms and we were responsible for developing one of these nearly 20 years ago here in Vietnam but so these just take simple clinical features and use them to be able to discriminate TB meningitis from other for other forms of meningitis other causes of meningitis and these were reasonably well and they're rather dependent on the setting that you're in and the particularly prevalence of HIV which completely alters the the differential diagnosis as you as you would recognize and but nonetheless they are good at identifying those people at the highest risk of TB meningitis in perhaps you should use either more advanced diagnostic tests or spend particular care doing a standard MicroBot mohkumat microbiology so the zero nuisance stain is i will talk about in a minute but has been the long-standing diagnostic procedure for t v-- for upwards of one hundred and twenty years there are severe problems with its use in in t v-- meningitis which I'll come to in a minute but nonetheless it remains the cornerstone along with culture of diagnosis we'll talk about gene experts and other molecular techniques in a minute but they have certainly made a big impact on the diagnosis of TB meningitis but or not at the moment sensitive enough and what we really want to get to is what we have for cryptococcal meningitis for example is where we have lateral flow assays that rapidly and sensitively and specifically identified my patients with the disease and can be done at patients bedside but unfortunately at the moment we don't have this fatigue but we definitely need it and i thought i'd to spend a little bit of time talking about Zedd insane and culture of the CSF and because there is a there's a widespread belief from amongst clinicians that this really generally isn't useful but if you go back into the literature and this is a paper published in 1953 in the journal of clinical pathology by sheila stewart in the UK actually so she did meticulous microscopy and culture on or 90 or 100 consecutive cases of TB meningitis and was able to see the bacteria in the CSF in ninety one of those hundred cases now this was just around some of these were actually before chemotherapy so these were untreated and therefore you might expect more bacteria to be present and and the disease to be more severe but nonetheless she was able to show that if you took the large volumes of CSF and he spun the CSF at high speeds and he looked very carefully for bacteria actually this test worked rather well and what I'd like to show you is just um some confirmation but we we did some time ago this was about 15 years ago when I was first working on TB meningitis I looked at Sheila's jurors paper and and asked the question well can we repeat this can we actually demonstrate and similar performance in our own practice because before and before I was rather skeptical that we could so this just shows you a prospective study where we assessed the volumes of CSF we aim to take as much as we could usually greater than 6 mils sometimes up to 10 or 12 this was all done in adults 132 of them and what we were able to do was with meticulous microscopy show that we could find a so fast Brazilian 58% and see your culture it in in 71 cells and when we looked at the predictors of doing so so of the predictors of being able to see your culture CSF and the strongest predictor actually was the volume of CSF so the message is very simple um if you're a clinician and you've got a lab that can help you and take a large volume of CSF spin it hard and look carefully back for bacteria and you can improve the diagnostic yield of this simple and cheap technique it won't be perfect but it will help you in say and circumstances the other data that's arrived more recently is around a gene expert and gene expert altra now many of you would have heard of gene expert this has been around for perhaps five or seven years it's a cartridge based assay based on real-time PCR and is really revolutionized in many ways that the diagnosis of all forms of TB across the world and it has helped with TB meningitis and previous studies have suggested that it has a sensitivity of around 50% which is approximately what all of the nucleic acid amplification techniques have none of them are perfect but most of them actually are better than microscopy especially when microscopy is done by less experienced people anyway this was the first study very small study that was published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases in 2018 by agreed from Uganda that suggested that ultra may be a bit better than standard expert so they've adapted the cartridge in a number of ways to enhance the sensitivity enhanced the ability of the of the cartridge to detect bacteria and this was a small study as I say this was retrospectively tested as well and stored CSF but is suggested and you can see the sensitivity here that ultra sensitivity was around 70% the standard expert about 43% which was equivalent to culture of 43 percent so this was the first data only a couple of years agos to suggest that ultra could improve the diagnosis of TB meningitis but subsequently in early this year in in January in Larson faced diseases who papers were published and one was by the same group that published the first paper and the others by our own group in Vietnam that assessed on a much larger scale the diagnostic performance of of gene expert ultra compared with the standard gene experts of TB meningitis and I just like to run you through the high level and results from these two studies because they're interesting and I think they have relevance to your practice in India but what does the question is what does that gene expert ultra add to the diagnosis of TB meningitis well these two day these two studies suggest it adds something that is not revolutionary so the Uganda study included 204 participants 42 of whom had TB meningitis and 96% of whom all of the participants were infected with HIV and the sensitivity of ultra in this study was 77 percent you can see the confidence intervals there beside the the value and the sensitivity of the standard expert was 56 percent so the Vietnamese study had 205 participants a very similar size study 99 of whom had TB meningitis and only 15% of those had HIV so this was probably a population that is much more like yours in India the sensitivity of ultra in in our hands was 58 percent and sensitivity of expert was 48 percent there was really just a modest increase in sensitivity actually those differences were not statistically significant and so I think the conclusion that can be drawn from these two much larger studies is that our expert altra is probably a little bit more sensitive particularly so in HIV uninfected patients who tend to have lower bacterial loads but the test cannot rule out an T V meningitis so you cannot rule you cannot use expert either ultra or standard expert to rule out TB meningitis so that's that's an incredibly important point that I'd like to not forget so I'd like to then move on to treatment and and ways in which we can improve outcome from treatment and I would say before I start this section on treatment but again the best way of improving outcomes from TB meningitis is to treat early and so make the diagnosis early and treat before the onset of coma nonetheless there are two different ways broadly in which you can approach improving outcomes from from TB meningitis therapy the first is to enhance bacterial killing and second is to control intra cerebral inflammation there is a third which I will deal with at the end of the talk and that's good critical care because I think that's actually incredibly important when dealing with these very sick individuals but in terms of biology I think that the two main approaches to increasing outcome are killing and inflammation control so if we consider drugs first you'll all be very aware that the brain is a special place it is separated from the rest of the body by the blood-brain barrier and that has advantages to the brain but also disadvantages in that it impedes the passage of drugs into the brain tissue and that can have direct implications for therapy and different drugs have different properties particularly their ability to pass into the brain and what I show you here is just a schematic of the blood-brain barrier and that the various different properties that drugs have to pass into the brain so if it is considered to the top left you've got levofloxacin and flora and moxifloxacin the fluoroquinolones they actually passed quite freely into the brain and they achieve concentrations around about 80 percent of the concentrations achieved in plasma after oral administration and isoniazid likewise achieves very good concentrations in the brain or at least it doesn't the CSF we assume it does in the brain - but it's difficult to take those measurements there is in a mind likewise actually even higher concentrations than isoniazid so ice is very freely enter into the cerebral spinal fluid but unfortunately many of the other agents used in treatment do not achieve good concentrations and perhaps the most important is rifampicin so as you'll know rifampicin is a critical drug in TB treatment it's one of the agents that not only kills bacteria quite freely early on in treatment that is also is is very capable of sterilizing lesions that can be quite difficult but other drugs too to act upon the rifampicin actually probably only achieves concentrations in the region of ten or fifteen percent of that which it has in plasma and this has been a long-standing problem potentially with the therapy of TB meningitis which we'll come to in a minute if a butyl is is another particularly active drug in terms of its killing effect on bacteria and also doesn't really penetrate the CSF at all well though it's its role in that in treatment of to human advantage is very uncertain but it's often used as the fourth drug victimizing to we unfortunately still use it occasionally in Vietnam I don't thing is at all useful at anything it passes achieves concentrations within the CSF at least if it's given intramuscularly and that are useful well and as you'll now know it has a particular toxicity particularly vestibular toxicity that make it unpleasant to use and we try and avoid it whenever possible the newer agents OSHA's but act will inter laminate and we really don't have enough we don't have any data yet and to know whether or not they're going to be useful for the treatment of this condition so but back to rifampicin well there's there's been a long-standing hypothesis that and that the the concentrations of of rifampicin in the brain are likely to be too low in when given at standard pulmonary treatment t v-- doses and the higher doses might achieve higher exposures of the drug within within the brain and therefore improve alcohol and this hypothesis was given much excitement by this study that was published in The Lancet vests this is around seven years ago this was Rhino from crevasse group and others in Indonesia very small trial only 60 Indonesian adults and they compared all or a fabless in at 450 milligrams per kilograms about the standard dose as you'll know around 10 milligrams per kilogram with a higher dose of IV administered and rifampicin given at 600 milligrams which worked out at about 13 or 14 milligrams per kilogram for the Indonesian patients who entered this trial and what we saw here what you see here in this survival curve is really rather staggering and that there's a very ethic and survival benefit in those who had given the higher doses intravenous drip fountain now this is a small trial and it wasn't powered or intended to actually show difference in survival but it did and this caused a lot of excitement so actually as this trial was being reported this trial was ongoing this is a trial that we published about three or four years ago and which started in around 2010 and this was a much larger trial 817 Vietnamese adults that looked at adding rifampicin 15 milligrams per kilogram orally plus levofloxacin to the standard regimen of TB treatment for the first two months of that 12-month treatment and and see the survival curve here this is the the overall results in the trial and unfortunately the you can see that there is almost no no difference at all between the standard any intensified regiments and certainly nothing's it's significant and in fact there was no evidence that increasing the dose of ref a person with the addition of levofloxacin had any impact on any outcome whatsoever which was which was hugely disappointing but we went on and these data have only just been published about a month or so ago and to look at the the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the patients who went into this trial this was a a subset of about 250 patients and in this 820 patient trial and what we wanted to do is we wanted to assess the concentrations of rifampicin both in the plasma in the CSF and all the other drugs and relate them to outcome we wanted to look and to see for example whether there was any signal at all with higher concentrations of rifampicin and improved outcome so what you can see here in the top table is rifampicin concentrations at day 14 this is when we measured them in our patients and assessments of the c-max there to the curve in both plasma and CSF and what you can see immediately is that here is the standard therapy here is the intensified therapy that actually increasing the dose quite modestly was able to increase the exposure really quite substantially so nearly double the exposures of rifampicin when giving 15 mins per kick as opposed to 10 so that was good in that we seem to have increased exposure but unfortunately we were unable to show any relationship no relationship whatsoever between exposure and an outcome but what we did show and this was enormously surprising to us was a very strong and independent relationship between isoniazid exposure and survival and when I show you here in this figure so these are the the top is HIV infant uninfected I think and the bottom is infected you've got the various different Glasgow Coma scores are entries at 8 10 and 14 here and the red are the red green and the blue lines are those four different isoniazid seam axes where you have the red being low green being middle and blue in high esteem axes and these are survival probabilities here and what you have here is very very clear demonstration that if you have low concentrations of isoniazid in your CSF yeah you did much worse and then if you have higher concentrations and that I was independent of a disease severity of the start of treatment and school at the start of treatment and that was a surprising finding to us and you'll also be aware that isoniazid and is metabolized in different ways and different people according to their genetic background there are fast intermediate and slow metabolizers and what we found was that the deaths that occurred in this trial at least in this subset of patients and almost all of them were in the fast metabolizers who have lower concentrations so I think this shows us a way forward that means further investigation we need to look at analyzing in the talent and the metabolism of isoniazid and we may need to use much higher doses particularly those who are fast metabolizers so that going to be and some work for the future for us all I think though I'd like to move on now to controlling interests arable inflammation you'll all be aware that often when one starts treatment for tuberculosis of any forms particularly TB meningitis bird often all they often lymph node TB for example you get a deterioration in symptoms often associated with inflammation before you get an improvement and that tends to occur in the first couple of months of therapy and there's been a hypothesis and ever since and TB drugs were developed in the late 1940s that if you control that inflammation whilst you kill the bacteria with the antibiotic you improve outcome and the first trials in TB meningitis were actually published in nineteen in the early 1950s 1953 1954 very small and case series essentially rather than trials but suggested benefit but the large trials that to demonstrate and definitively that there was benefit were not conducted for quite well for about fifty years later and this was a trial that we conducted and between 2000 and 2004 published in 2004 they clearly demonstrated the dexamethasone improved survival particularly in HIV uninfected patients with an TB meningitis there was only ninety nine patients with HIV and in this in this trial and it was uncertain whether or not dexamethasone improved their outcome and I would just tell you that we're about 300-400 patients now into a five hundred and twenty patient trial of dexamethasone for HIV infected patients we hope to be able to record this trial probably in about eighteen months time so look out for that anyway we we've shown that dexamethasone improves outcome but how does it improve outcome well we really are still very unclear how it does this how it has this effect upon survival it could as I've I'm using a CT scan here to demonstrate what it could do it kids reduce the amount of of exudate around the basal systems it could reduce the instance in fact and it could reduce the incidence and and complications arising from I drew Koffler but actually we don't know whether it really does it all and we weren't able to demonstrate that from any of the studies that we did and after the trial and the question now I think is that is whether more directed and more intelligent host directed outcome data and there are a number of different possibilities that are available and have been considered in the literature and also clinically and I'm going to particularly focus on one and that's aspirin and give you a little bit more data on aspirin but there are others too thalidomide has received quite some attention over the last twenty years and there's quite good data from South Africa non-randomized data and the suggest is particularly good in in a steroid resistant tuberculosis particularly those that involve the optic chiasm and then more targeted anti TNF therapies the elixir map for example have been used in case series again predominantly for intractable and difficult to treat tuberculosis interferon gamma as there's a couple of case reports and there's a developing list of more rational candidates that are based upon better knowledge of the pathophysiology of the disease but I am got time really to go into detail now it'll really like to talk about and just checking how long I've been going but another 10 minutes or so is is aspirin now aspirin is an ancient drug as you all know and this huge amount of evidence particularly in cardiovascular stroke and myocardial infarction thromboembolic disease essentially and for its benefit and but but some of the first bits of work to be done to suggest it might be of benefit in TB meningitis we're done in India by usual Mishra and published a randomized control trial in the Journal of neurological sciences in 2010 and a relatively small phase two trial 120 patients total and you can see just the summary data here though these are patients who were also some of them also received corticosteroids some uh some some didn't it was a bit difficult to work out who got what but if you got both aspirin and corticosteroids you clear you seem to do very much better so this was mortality this is aspirin and those who didn't receive aspirin this is new stroke and you can see other other endpoints there now this really did suggest that aspirin might be of benefit but it was too small a trial to be definitive and there was also some less convincing evidence from your hands commence group in Cape Town in South Africa that suggested also in children it may have an effect and there wasn't very much clinical effect that you can discern here but there was a suggestion that those children with the most severe disease may have done a little bit better with aspirin but again it wasn't definitive enough to train to change practice and to change treatment guidelines but the nonetheless that there exists some really attractive hypotheses around the use of aspirin fatigue you meningitis therapy um and that a lot of it depends on the differential activity of aspirin at different doses so that when you give when you give aspirin a low dose and by that I'm leaning less than 200 milligrams a day and so this is more of a sort of stroke prevention dose you get them inhibition of platelet aggregation by inhibition of from boxing a - um and that's potentially could have an impact in TB meningitis because it might reduce and thrombosis associated with with TB meningitis and therefore might reduce infox but at a higher dose there are other ways in which aspirin may improve outcomes from TB so once you achieve doses above 600 milligrams a day you also get um and independent anti-inflammatory effects and also and this is more recently discovered you get up regulation of molecules that help the resolution of of inflammation so called pro resolving molecules and so this combined effect may decrease inflammation in brain and may also help improve outcomes from from from TB meningitis so in order to address these hypotheses particularly the ones that relate to dos we did a phase two randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of aspirin at 81 milligrams for a thousand milligrams for TB meningitis and that was using treatment for the first two months of TB meningitis treatment and was in addition to the use of dexamethasone so everybody got dexamethasone and so you can see the trial schemer there and randomizing one two one two one two basically standard therapy with TB drugs and dexamethasone and with the addition of 60 days of 81 milligrams or a thousand milligrams and we followed these patients up for eight months and our endpoints were safety so GI bleeding many of you might be concerned that the addition of both corticosteroids and aspirin might increase your risk of GI bleeding and also we did serial MRIs we did MRIs at baseline and at 860 because one of our endpoints was MRI proven brain new brain infarction now we obviously had a number of clinical endpoints that included death and another important endpoints like that so this trial was completed I think in 2017 and published in 2018 here in Elife and I'm just gonna show you the the main results that have prompted quite a lot of interest and essentially aspirin or a thousand milligrams seems to be more active and than at 81 and was equally safe there wasn't really any signal to suggest that the addition of a thousand milligrams over 60 days and was unsafe in this group there was no excess of severe bleeds for example and in those patients who had definite TB meningitis so this is microbiologically confirmed TB meningitis there seemed to be a significant reduction in death and new in facts however this is a subgroup analysis it's it's not definitive and it needs replication in much larger phase three studies but I think there is sufficient evidence now with the misra data and also these data aspirin could actually have a significant benefit to patients with with TV meningitis and a large base retrial is warranted and as I'll show you later there are number being considered and conducted at the moment so there we go with aspirin I think what's really interesting however is what its mechanism of action might be so this is looking at the CSF from the patients in our trial we were able to do measurements very fine measurements of an array of different molecules lipid mediators and within the CSF and demonstrated that there is as you'd expect a dose-dependent inhibition of from boxing this is b2 a2 is unstable it passes directly to B - so you can only measure B - that is a proxy for a2 and what you see is that there's dose dependent inhibition of from boxing a - which is exactly as it's expected but only really maximally at that highest dose you've got reduction in prostaglandins but really fascinatingly you've got this regulation here of these prayer resolving molecules the my raisins and the protections that may signify a completely new mechanism by which aspirin can improve outcomes from TD meningitis and that's something that we're exploring now and in turn in future studies so I just like to spend a minute now talking about the importance of neurocritical care for for TBM I'm sure many of you work closely with intensive care units around India and will recognize the value that they have for supporting patients who are critically unwell and I think TB meningitis has particular challenges we summarized them here in is a very recent review published in Lancet neurology just last year and I think the major areas of uncertainty for which really there are very very few data to help us the management of hydrocephalus and selecting those patients who require shunts is difficult and there's clearly a group that benefit but it's not quite clear at least in my mind exactly who they are third ventricle ostomies are becoming more widely available and again selecting patients for that procedure and to me to my mind is uncertain but again there's clearly a group that do well with that procedure and then beyond the nearest surgical approaches which are extremely important to get right and much research needs to be done in that area there are also really difficult areas like the management of hyponatremia Lucia misra and colleagues in in Lucknow have done a lot of work in trying to define the mechanisms hypernatremia and they did a recent trial looking at the addition of fludrocortisone to treatment which may help but the management of hyponatremia particularly when the sodium drops below 120 120 324 when it's often associated with with worsening coma we certainly find to be extremely difficult and I think it's an area that needs much much more research than it has at the moment paradoxical reactions will be commonly known to many of you particularly the the problems with expanding tuberculoma s' after the start of treatment I think at the moment there is no where there's no randomized controlled trial evidence to define what to do and our approach is generally to increase the dose of of corticosteroids first and that often works but in cases when it doesn't we will often try different agents such as thalidomide and but there are often problems with that's the access to that drug can be difficult given its history and an alternatives such as infliximab and may not be readily available so that again is an extremely difficult area and I suspect I'll get questions on it because it's it's a very difficult clinical problem to manage on occasions and generally I think providing the best supportive care and controlling temperature trying to trying to manage and control raised on intracranial pressure is is critically important and and and I don't think we as physicians certainly and I speak for myself particularly I don't think we do this well and I think it's something that we should improve I just like to spend the last few moments just talking about some of the work that we do internationally and the work that is starting and ongoing across the world concerning TV meningitis so around about 12 years ago now we own colleagues in India and South Africa and Vietnam and Indonesia set up and the TV international research consortium we had our last meeting last year in Lucknow March I think it was which was a great pleasure to visit we've had previous meetings in in in Vietnam and South Africa and we are hoping to have another meeting in Indonesia at the end of the year but this is a fantastic group of people who are committed to TB meningitis research they're all active actively doing research in TBM and we recently published a collection of reviews and papers and opinion pieces on TB meningitis and I give you the link down the bottom there this is in welcome open research the Wellcome Trust under Journal and these are all completely open access available for everyone to go to there's about 12 articles here describing the various different aspects of TB meningitis diagnosis and management and I strongly encourage you to visit them and and use them as resources in your in your clinical management and perhaps in your in the planning of your future research the advantage of getting together as a group has been that there's now a lot more research globally going on and what I thought I'd just do here quickly is summarized the various ongoing trials and planned trials in TB meningitis just so that you're aware of what people are doing and what people are thinking of to try and improve outcomes from this condition so there are two trials going on in Vietnam at the moment this is the trial as I've described of dexamethasone in HIV infected patients we're about 400 patients into that there is another trial which we're doing an HIV uninfected patients which is stratifying patients based on on their genotypes or particular gene that seems to confer inflammatory response to TB we're about 400 and over 400 patients in that trial now sadly both these trials have had to be suspended for the moment because of kovat but that's the case for all trials across all the world I suspect there's a trial which we which is going on in India and alawi using high-dose rifampicin and levofloxacin in children called EVM kids I think that's still going on there's another trial of high-dose rifampicin in fact there's a number of different trials now of high-dose rifampicin which reflects again the interest in in trying to improve outcomes through through increasing bacterial killing at least those there there is interestingly a child in trial in Beijing this is started and this was started before our data came out looking at higher doses of isoniazid and faster settle eaters and I'd be fascinated to see the results from that trial a number of planned trials which is fantastic the better is better the improving for us clinicians there's a trial which we're going to do in Vietnam but also in India in Africa but higher doses in short course so six months versus 12 whether with our aspirin and children another trial of higher dose rifampicin in Indonesia Vietnam and Gander and likewise a trial of aspirin and the nez Lydon hiatus rifampicin in in South Africa and so there is lots of activity so there's going to be lots of really interesting results coming out over the next two or three years which I hope will help us all manage this difficult infection and with that I'm going to stop I'm going to thank all of the many colleagues who I work with in Vietnam but also around the world including those in India and I'm very very happy to take any questions that you might have for me concerning the management and improving the outcome from is very difficult and fatal infection so thank you thank you very much for listening you thank you thank you optical and the fantastic talk optimation um do you want to say anything do we take the question answers you will you take the question answers now in Turkish room is still muted I wasn't able to hear what he said yes we can hear now hello hello yes hello yeah yes we can yeah yeah you mentioned about she lost t worth showing 91 out of hundred patients I think positivity and the compliments to you and I it means yes if slides I'm sorry I missed I missed the last part of your question yes artificial intelligence could it take yes yeah I yeah it's it's it's a good thought and I it would be fascinating to see whether we could use that to detect detect the bacteria I yeah it's it's a very good thought no one's no one's done is as yet and we would be in a good place to do it because we see so many people with me a positive disease so yes very good thought so they had their mo about 60 or questions I'll do it I'll show some of the questions which I'd made a PowerPoint throughout the talk certain questions of course will take up later depending on the time that we have okay sure yeah yeah quite a few people want to know about use of agents like tyldum I'd call this in or even though I spin that you troll and would okay well thalidomide I mentioned I think the role is still uncertain I think the best evidence comes from South Africa in children for the treatment of optic asthmatic tuberculosis and certainly that's in my anecdotal experiences where it's useful but there are no control trials colchicine I've not seen any data I may have missed it but I've not seen any data at all to suggest it's useful and I and I I haven't I can't comment the duration all right should we move on if there are 60 questions I've got to be quite clear all right some patients with TB M there wasn't there was an on with all of steroids and not required maybe long-term steroids so yeah yeah yes very it's a relatively common scenario actually you have to treat sometimes for many months and why this happens if I'm a pathologist pathophysiological standpoint I don't think anybody knows and I think from the perspective clinical perspective I think the key thing is that this is a inflammatory reaction it's not a reflection of failure to kill bacteria and and I think that's that that's common I would I mean that pups is too strong to say mistake but I think it's a common mistake that people often make clinically is that these tuberculosis will develop and what they need is robust anti-inflammatory treatment what they don't need and I don't think in my experience is further anti TB treatment and and often people put people on very large big you know lots of different drugs which I think increase toxicity how do we manage drug-induced hepatitis yeah that's a very good question because it's incredibly important and and I'm very strong believer in not managing it in the same way that you manage it in pulmonary TB in pulmonary TB you can stop the TB drugs and for a few days or even though for a week or two and generally people won't do badly as a consequence they won't die as a consequence but but as in TB meningitis people who die as a consequence and we showed that actually rather surprisingly with our very first trial the dexamethasone trial one of the predictors for death from TB meningitis was interruption jitter and adverse events how we manage it is not clear we at the moment in all of our trials we're randomizing people to three different approaches so I'll be able to tell you well we'll be able to give you evidence-based recommendations about 18 months time and the options we use are firstly we just stop IRA's in a mine alone and that tends to work actually at least no one's failed it yet the other option is that we actually we wait until the ast and alt rise to ten times normal we changed the threshold now people raise their eyebrows of this but actually again we've had no cons we've had no safety concerns with this yet and it's worked with everybody and the last thing we do because it's the standard thing to do is to change once every once and ast and alt right arrives about five times normal or three times with symptoms we stop there at autocracy drugs and we replace them with Eva's boxes in and FMB toll and occasionally in a minor glycoside but there are no evidence-based recommendations essentially so that's where we are at the moment manaman excellency yeah yeah the problem is there are so few bacteria that is actually incredibly hard to guess signal and acquire sufficient bacterial DNA to do this now we tried it and haven't succeeded now that's not to say that it might not work in the future if there was particularly clever enrichment techniques and to pull bacteria out and and be able to obtain the DNA so I think the jury is out on this at the moment we've not been successful integument means successful in a number of other different in fact brain infections using this particularly viral infections but not after TB meningitis and I haven't yet seen a group that's been able to do this consistently and reliably but the future may may be more that it may be possible into the future I will genex but help in the diagnosis of sorry as my of non-resistance well I think I answered that in the talk I hope yeah yeah we talk on this where's your bridge - resistant TB and ice - resistant TB it depends what the resistance is if it's isoniazid resistance then the ten that we tend to use the addition of levofloxacin sometimes using iodine acid depending on the severity of the disease but not often so um and if it's multi-drug resistance well you're you're just picking what you can from the list of treatments that are generally used but is very very difficult in multi drug-resistant TB but leave a flop and fluoroquinolones are incredibly important and probably at Lyndhurst the data or not not good next question yeah any difference in drug penetration especially in FEM sin' yeah there there doesn't seem to be at the moment and between over time but I don't think there's the loss of data for for after kind of two or three months worth of treatment the CSF tends to be quite abnormal with high proteins and evidence of blood brain barrier dysfunction well beyond 1-2 months of treatment so it may not be of relevance and there's one study which suggests that corticosteroids don't impact the pharmacokinetics it anywhere eventually collapsing no I don't think they're I mean it's I mean it's theoretical possibility isn't it because you can't get high concentrations by giving it orally but I think the the the complications that may arise from doing that outweigh any potential benefit so at the moment I wouldn't I wouldn't next question and patiently TV Emma cystic lesions in the brain yeah it's very hard I well what I would say for the that there's no role for further antibacterial treatment there may be role you know the inflammatory complications can go on for for even longer than two years in some cases I've seen people with with symptomatic tuberculoma is for longer so I don't it's very very hard but not antibacterial coke analysis change steroids or you can go back rifampicin monotherapy cause MDR yes it can certainly if you've got active disease and the risk and time duration of exposure will be dependent upon the number of bacteria that at that so in general it is just isolated brain TB the risks are very much lower just because of the chance of developing mutation of course resistance will be lower among smaller numbers of bacteria in multi bacillary disease millimeter sees for example or big cavities then the risk will be much quicker than the time duration much slower much much faster so don't do it generally next question what stealers steroid improve mobility and mortality your take on this yeah I think it I think it improves mortality I'm much less certain about morbidity and I think actually if you look at the individual trials very few of them demonstrated their effect so I that swear I'm interested in drugs like aspirin because I think they may improve mobility as well as mortality by producing in fast like a few people are also asked about the the duration of steroids as well as your take on prednisolone was said dexamethasone the a duration where we just follow the what was used in trials so so Ouiser a six week regimen for those in grade one and an eight week regimen for this in grade two and so we just we just follow the evidence on that and and some people with tuberculoma means that occur after that those time points you have to go back up so you know going four point five milligrams per kilowatt x we generally use dexamethasone just because again that's where the evidence from trials are and i haven't got any evidence to to counter the argument that you could use prednisolone equally as long as you're giving the equivalent [Music] corticosteroid dose and I think is perfectly reasonable to use prednisolone the children trials use prednisolone and showed an effect so I don't I don't have a problem with using Pradesh law few more questions about steroids which have been us number one in children do you use higher dose of steroids number two your take on IB versus oral dexamethasone and third whether there is in the role of IV methylprednisolone all uncertain attainment I don't read a lot of children so generally I follow the guidelines on on dosing in kids so I don't use particularly higher doses IV versus or oh what I think in sick people that the evidence is for it if evidence is using an IV regimen for the first three or four weeks that's what's associated with improved outcome that's what that's what I used what was the last question myth our bread well that one small trial which suggests that it's equivalent and it's very small again I don't see why it shouldn't be equivalent particularly I think as long as you've got approximately equivalent corticosteroids and active gotta steroid dose to the dexamethasone point four milligrams per kilogram then I think it doesn't probably matter what corticosteroid you use how do you treat MDR next yard yeah with difficulty with with I mean even if you manage to treat it early enough which you only do if you've got a gene X but positive that that identifies rifampicin resistance even I mean are in our hands only about 10 percent survive if teen and those that do and so what we use we tend to use and we always use fewer quinolones always use an ejaculation a mnemonic like science and tend to also hugely desolate and well and then Prothean amides at the moment when we can because that's good inter cerebral concentrations and then probably the addition of you know depending on what we find the sensitivity at that boot all there is in the might if we're not sure about the resistance it's very difficult there's no guidelines and you you do the best you can actually do almost impossible but Lunas lids going to be the mainstay of treatment I'm psycho serene and then and again proteome I'd and other agents I'm really really hard into giving each other so didn't we've had anyone survived and typically in mdro next year please Jim how many drugs will be there number of drugs least five beginning okay what is the present role of step to mind it well I would keep this short I'd say there is no role it might be controversial questions yesterday yeah yeah common question I don't think it's sensitive or specific enough I think the it's unclear what thresholds to use and I don't think it adds anything beyond and PC on will that's expert in house PCOS fine but you've got to be aware that they might barium performance where we should worse prognosis hydrocephalus or in fact I was very difficult to tease those apart and I would say it depends I mean most in Fox a she's so clinical and don't even don't really seem to impact prognosis so I would say a Hydra catalyst on the whole the info can be absolutely devastating as urologist any more questions yeah there are there are almost 90 questions so you need to tell me when to stop the questions are increase up to 90 now yeah I can see this we've done okay where's the time I've got another couple of minutes then I need to go okay duration treatments good question um y-yeah we tend to use twelve months that's the double-a guidelines I suspect six months is probably adequate in most people actually but may some people use nine as a kind of interim and but no one really knows and we're just doing this trial in the kids have six months we don't have the data yet do you repeat the CSF for MRI even at the patient yes we do actually MRI not so often just because it's expensive but we always repeat CSF a day 30 and I always find it helpful nearly always so we do a duration of astronauts toe as well this is two months but mate sometimes you need no longer and you can combine both I think we've shown that both the misra data and and our data suggest that it's safe to combine both in fact it may be important to come next no no idea at the moment really may I don't think anything's great I think the problem is with molecular detection techniques and until there's some way of enriching and for bacterial bacterial DNA you're not going to achieve adequate sensitivities so interesting but no role in certain clinical medicine yet for that is there something similar to cytokine storm no that there isn't we've looked at this very hard it doesn't I mean there isn't something similar to this I think it's more targeted law specific mechanisms than that that's more likely wrist yes and I think iris and in HIV and paradoxical reactions in HIV uninfected patients have very very similar pathogenesis yeah next role of ideally the folks in the first line there no no trials our trial suggested didn't have anything may have something in in those who have drug-resistant TB I can I can believe that ice and I as a resistance possibly but certainly multi-drug resistance if you're uncertain about their ability to absorb drugs but but no no good data 15 to 18 months I think that's too long generally then it you need that long in drug sensitive disease I think twelve months is is more than adequate and probably shorter last couple then I have to go last couple of questions yeah I've seen a couple of case reports around cyclophosphamide possibly beneficial but no I've no experience never used in myself okay yeah that's a good question good one to end on when we consider shunting is when we've got someone who's deteriorating with Hydra Jefferson scan or they say a baseline if they pick up and they've got hydrocephalus and they've got depressed conscious level we will always engaged neurosurgeon quickly and then if and if someone's deteriorating and and they've got hydrocephalus people always ask their opinion it's always difficult as I'm sure you know is how many of your neurosurgeons but those of you have clinicians will know that you don't always get what you asked for and so but we but we engage with our nearest surgical colleagues and and shunt an increasing number actually now probably about 10 percent of people with hydrocephalus in our hands get shunted it's probably lower than in other centers but that's just being on of them okay thank you thanks a lot dr. guy there are now almost hundred questions but I know that time is always an issue so thanks a lot your talk was very nice and I think most of us have helped with the talk and I hope that that we'll see you again some times later thank you very much pleasure to be here stressin hey just what everybody okay yeah take care bye you you", "cvrSPrTrphY": "hello this is Jeff from neural growth CA and we're here today to talk about the different dosages when we are micro dosing a psilocybin containing mushrooms and of course there are many different varieties of magic mushrooms but today I'm just going to talk about the ones that I've used in my own experience and the ones that in my opinion weren't the best and of course those are the teacher variety of mushrooms okay let's get into the dosages it's pretty simple the first one the first dose that I think every beginner should start on even if you're a smaller person or a very large person you're gonna want to start off on a hundred milligrams so of course that's just point one glance a very small amount and the other dosage when you get a little bit more experienced or when you feel like you need a little more is the 200 milligram dose 0.2 of a gram so just to put this into perspective you know back in the 60s when people are really partying with the magic mushrooms they're taking anywhere from two to four maybe even six grams of the mushroom whereas we're talking about taking point one maybe point two of one single ground it's very minut dose and I think it's just an excellent way to many healing benefits and of course we have many videos about the different benefits of a psilocybin but we're just talking about the dosage today so that first one that hundred milligram dose this is an excellent starting point and of course you don't want to work this into your your ultimate schedule whether you're doing five days on two days off for days on three days off I know some people are doing one day on one day off that part is it's very personal that's something you have to experiment with but no matter where you start there we should be starting with a hundred milligram dosage and you want to be using that for in my opinion at least two or three months before moving up to the larger doses and of course when you have the hundred milligram dose say you've been doing it for a month you feel like you need a little more power then you can just experiment with taking two caps in the day so you know keep it simple and keep it small and now the other very important thing with dosages is stacking and what I mean by stacking is stacking the benefits of Mia psilocybin with other mushrooms mushrooms like lion's mane mushroom this is one of the most ultimate ultimate mushrooms on the planet of course lion's mane is all about brain health it is truly about neural growth it's one of the only substances on the planet that promotes the production of nerve growth factor in the brain so this is very rare as you know used to get told as children you only have X number of brain cells so you better not balk too many soccer balls or play too many sports because when they're gone they're gone but of course that is not the case in neuroscience modern neuroscience is showing today that things like lion's mane and other dietary factors can help you produce more neurons and protect the ones you have and now what's super crazy is all these amazing benefits of lion's mane are potentiated tenfold when mixed with the psilocybin so lion's mane is one of the most amazing things you could be taking alongside your psilocybin it can help with depression anxiety and on the other end of that spectrum if you're someone who suffers from multiple sclerosis lion's mane can help you save and repair the neurons that are being attacked by that disease so many different benefits and another excellent product to be stacking your psilocybin with in my opinion is mucuna otherwise known as the velvet bean and that's what mikuni is all about it's all about giving your body all the precursors with this way of saying giving your body all the ingredients it needs to make dopamine so with the psilocybin psilocybin mimics serotonin in the body and now with the mucuna you're gonna be getting everything you need to make dopamine and serotonin and dopamine are some of your most important neurotransmitters there is serotonin has to do with being relaxed being thoughtful having higher IQs so many different things it's one of the most ancient neurotransmitters in the world every single mammal has serotonin now dopamine is all about being happy being super happy you know it was said that you know the world could be burning completely on fire but if your dopamine levels are high enough you just be walking through it no problems and vice versa you could be in sunshine and rainbows but if you have no dopamine it's over you just feel like life is over so these are when you have these two neurotransmitters in their proper balance and you have a very very potent combination for feeling good feeling concentrated and just having an overall very balanced mood and if you

this we will move on to the next topic uh the second topic which is scheduled for the day is on uh ibu incompatible transplantations and today for that we have two very eminent moderators uh dr kishore babusir from manipal hospitals and with that i will hand over the session to both our moderators to introduce our speaker for the day over to you sir anil is my very good friend and he's a transplant physician and consultant nephrologist at global hospitals since last one and half decades and he is very much interested in transplantation including incompatible transplants and highly sensitized testing and hand over to anil to deliver his talk good evening uh thank you for dr kishore and uh dr ravi shankar sir uh thanks thank you for having this platform for us to share our views on increasing the donor pool  incompatible [Music] yeah this is my overview of my top we all know that incompatible transplantation could change the immunological barrier which was considered initially as an absolute contraindication for transplantation one such barrier is the blood grouping compatibility and kidney transplant across the blood group barrier has the potential to expand the pool of donors and increase the availability of transplant organs and decrease the prolonging time for patients who will be on the waiting list for a kidney so this is uh karl landsteiner is a nobel laureate in 1900 he introduced different blood groups so this is uh this is a study from cmc velour they showed that in south india the common blood group is a whole blood group which consists about 38 percent the next common is 32 percent is the b bar group then is the a blood group in a blood group we have two uh subcategories a1 and non-a1 or a2 a2 compromise around the nine percent a2 blood group they have less antigenic and in fact they can be transplanted with less risk to non a blood group the least common is the ab blood group which is compromises around six percent the likelihood that two unrelated individuals are identical is about thirty seven point five percent uh compatible is around twenty six point seven percent and uh and incompatible is around thirty five so what we want to say is around one third of the population we are incompatible so what happens is in a scenario where we are in the nuclear families and we have to wait at least for around three to four years for getting a diseased donor we are left with many of the patients are left with no incompatible uh donors in the family and they are not able to get a transplant patient done so what happens when we transplant a patient with an incomparable donor whether it is kidney liver or heart so the pre-formed anti-donor  antibodies in the recipient will act on these antigens which are not only present on the rbcs but also on the platelets epithelial and endothelial cells and there is an hyper acute rejection so the mechanism of hyperacute rejection is in the endothelial cells of the graft the antigens which are present are recognized by the recipient b cells produce anti-a and anti-b antibodies so these uh subsequently there is a complement activation and there is endothelial injury and bleeding happens there is also uh because of the increased th1 immune response from the cd4 helper cells there is increased activation of the pro inflammatory cytokines and subsequently uh endothelial cell activation because stimulates the tissue factor pathway uh with the factor seven and the coagulation cascade is activated there is formation of thrombin and which in turn converts fibrinogen to fibrin and there is a thrombosis and this is how there is a severe hyper acute rejection so what to do to prevent this is one is we can uh the plasma cells which are produced by this b cells rituximab can be acted earlier these two spinectomy was done another method is removing this anti-a and antibodies by doing various ephesus procedures like plasmophoresis immunoabsorption or double filtration plasmophoresis and also recently botisma which will also have plasma cell acts on the plasma cells and also the final complement pathway can be tackled by epileusimab so going to the history of abu incompatible transplantation after the blood group was introduced in 1901 by landsteiner the first uh in 1952 humatal they started the eighth incompetable transplant all of them uh graft rejected and subsequently the outcome was very poor so what they concluded was gabio incompatibility is an absolute contraindication and these graphs never tend to function after the transplant that was the conclusion given so but what happened after 1981 was lepak at all they introduced by doing plasma exchange the grafter's survival was there and it was effective and 1985 alexander at all who is also considered father of abu incompatible transplantation so he did a pre-transplant plasma exchange with spinectomy and the graft came up to 74 days and so and subsequently the japanese people especially the tanabe group and all they have performed more than like several thousands of transplants because in japan there is a disease donor transplant doesn't happen so it's mainly they rely on the living donor pool so their 30 percent of their transplants will be of abu incomparable transplants so what alexander did at all in the initial periods was so they gave donor specific plant platelet transfusion plasmapheresis they did splenectomy and with the triple immunosuppressive origin that time it was cyclosporine so they gave polyclonal antibodies and that time they give substance a or b this is substance a is a one it is similar like what we give ffb just prior to the transplant which contains correlation factors mainly to prevent the bleeding those they did where the recipients were they who splinter me was not done they rejected acute rejection was there so over time what has happened there is several evolution of the protocols so initially in the 1989 when electrocentric started it was initially it was splenectomy and from 2005 onwards rituximab came in to replace splenectomy and several efferences procedures uh uh were done both initially both pre and post transplant were done now this is the necessity to do post transplant efficiencies has reduced and even iv immunoglobulins initially uh was there now the people are it's a questionable whether it is uh useful or not so a lot of evolution so the basics of desensitizes desensitization in in comfortable transplant is one is rituximab which is given pre-transplant nepheresis procedure triple immunosuppressive regime prior to transplantation and on-demand antibody depletion post-transplantation and induction therapy this is the basics what in general the lot of modification of the and different protocols there is no fixed protocol anywhere in the world so these are the dilemmas which i want to address one by one so what are the different methods and what should be the target pre-transplant titles what are the different procedures which should be preferred do we need to monitor post transplant titers if at all and do what do you do if it is increased what is the dose of retoximab when to use it what is the role of ivig if at all we use it when to start maintenance immunosuppression what is the ideal induction agent so there are three different methods for measuring the iso glutamine titers the gold standard is flow cytometry uh out of uh until recently we were doing tube methods that is a tube glass method so now uh most of the centers do the column metal intonation method or the gel card method uh which is uh more uh reliable uh what happens in the tube method is uh we used to like if at all the title is one is to uh 32 so it can be either between one is to 16 or one is to 64. so intra hospital variation and inter hospital variations were very high so nowadays we do column agglutination better flow cytometer is done mainly in japan we don't do in our country because it is very expensive this is how gelcard method the reports are interpreted so this is 0 to 4 plus so it is categorized and reported so what the target pre-transplant titles the higher pre-transplant titles there is a poor outcome this is shown in many studies majority of the centers all around the world they target around titus between one is to eight and lower in japan nowadays they are doing the titus pre-transplantators are one is to 32 and one is to 64. they have gone up to one is to 128 also in many of the their studies uh however the one is to 64 is the one that the minimal titres they prefer what the indian working group recommends is pre-transplant igg ab titus of less than one is to 16 should be taken as a cut off to go ahead for  in comfortable kitchen transplantation the outcome of a b in computable transparent depends on many factors and therefore patient and caregiver need to be counseled that titles are not the sole factors in determining the outcome these are the different of emphasis procedures the this is the plasma exchange where the plasma is separated so what is the flip side of is this large amount of substitution fluid is required when we give plasma there is lot of protein allergy patients there is a high risk of infection from the substituting fluid and also there is a bleeding risk so initially uh philosophers is what we do is the replacement fluid is used as albumin so when we are the pre-transplant the last plasma process procedure we use either the ab plasma or the donor specific ffp is being given mainly to reduce the bleeding rates some of the centers they do a fibrinogen level prior to the transplantation so and estimate and if there is a low then you replace with cryo prospects dfvp is a modified form of plasmapheresis after the initial plasma separation the blood separated plasma goes through another filter called as a plasma fractionator so where uh what basically what happens is you have the the plasma which contains the iv immunoglobulins and also the albumin so this is the cascade filter or the plasma fractionator so the immunoglobulins which are pathogenic are separated and albumin returns back to the patient so what happens is it is a more selective than plasma chain it returns the purified plasma to the patient minimal loss of patients own desirable non-pathogenic substances like albumin and also we need minimal substitution probably a liter of albumin five percent album is more than enough and there is no need to give ffp the most ideal one would be the immunoabsorption method so here the separated plasma goes through an uh mno absorption column there are specific columns say for example you need a patient b blood group or one to a is a donor you need a column so likewise there is a b and a b columns so the main advantage is here is so you don't need any replacement fluid a large volumes of plasma can be missing at the same time from four to almost up to eight to nine plasma volumes can be at a time can be processed and there is no need to substitute a patient withstands the procedure very well but the main drawback of this is the cost actually it is quite expensive so which pro effects this procedure is preferable it depends on the center's choice it depends on the financial status of the recipient so for example you want to use an immunoabsorption filter and do a at least two cycles in a corporate hospital probably the cost may be another six to seven lakhs extra for the recipient so it's quite expensive uh it depends on the anti-ab or tighter the higher the titers uh probably if there is a need for if the titus are more than one is to 256 probably you need of  column and depends on the center's infrastructure and the technical expertise of the staff however there is no differences in the outcome whichever method you use for the antibody removal so probably this diagram shows a simple tailored decency strategy if the titles are less is the eight you can just go ahead with the induction uh and maintenance therapy uh if it is eight alone or retoximab alone is enough with immunosuppression uh maintenance and suppression 16 to 64 probably rituximab bfop and induction therapy would suffice and more than 64 probably even may need an immunoadoption do we need to monitor post transplants isolated titus routine measurement of the titles after transplantation is not recommended it is of clinical significance only if the rising titus are associated with graft dysfunction post post-transplant plasma phrases may be necessary if there is graph dysfunction with increasing titers like for example it suddenly jumps four fold high in the baseline and and no need to monitor after once we cross the two weeks mine that is the time where the patient develops accommodation and what is the dose of rituximab and when to use it b cell depletion by rituximab has facilitated the expansion of abu and comfortable transplantation by obviously the need for splenectomy the drug is given anywhere minus one day to minus 30 days pre-transplantation as per several protocols but it should be given at least a week before starting plasmophoresis because whatever you give may be washed off cross match it is better you do the cross match test before do giving redux map because when you do a cross match after you give ritux map at times you may get a false positive cross match test even if have low cytometry cross match also will be a false positive so it's better to do a cross match uh prior to by uh giving redux and dosages instead of the three of the standard dose of 375 milligram per meter square so many of the studies are shown 200 milligram is more than enough actually in the the people from calcutta they have used even 100 milligram so this is study shows the cd19 cells the drop or the fall in cd19 was equivalent even with both 200 and the standard of 375 milligram per meter square dosage and you can see here in the slide the graft survival and the patient survival did not matter whatever those we use either 200 mg or 500 mg and what we see here the infection risk especially when you give rituximab 500 milligram of 375 milligram per meter square with an atg induction the infection risks are very very high and if at all the patient develops rejection and gives steroid pulses the the incidence of infection is more than 60 that is very high what is the role of ivig in abu and comfortable transplantation prevention of anti-a b antibody rebound in the early phase after transplantation would be prevented by using ivig it may also reduce the infectious complications because after plasmapheresis lot of iv the flow the protective globulins are removed from the body so probably by giving ivig the infectious complications may be reduced these are by several mechanism how ivg acts and its by preventing this anti-ab rebound but the drawback of this this thing is it is also these ivig preparations contain some anti-abo antibodies so these may give a rebound rise in the titus ed but and also it has shown that in some cases case studies it has caused rejection amr as well because of these antibodies present in the ivig so what is the indian working group recommendation is ivig use is not routinely recommended ivig contains anti-ab antibodies that can lead to increase in titus when needed it should be used in low dosage the two after plasmapheresis cycles and also with the batch having low a b titles that is difficult to find out lastly accommodation is the resistance of an allograft to amr despite the presence of significant level of anti-abo antibodies and c4d deposition recommendation differs from tolerance where in tolerance you don't have any dsas or anti-ib antibodies and they do well whereas accommodation in even though they have dsa and they still do well so these are the proposed mechanisms how accommodation happens mainly because we are removing all these antibodies their affinity towards the antigens are decreased and also because of the inhibition of the complement uh complement pathway the endothelial cells have a phenotypic they take means the stage where they are the further complement activation and the thrombin formation are reduced this is because many of the protective genes are activated like this anti-apoptic factors like heme oxygenase and also there are some complement regulatory proteins like cd45 55 and 59 so they prevent this activation of the complement pathway and subsequent rejection so last question is is it worth doing it abu incompetable transplantation when compared to uh because in the west actually uh the paired exchange as dr girish told it is more preferred than abu incompatible transplantation so but the eastern people they especially the japanese people don't think so because their 10 year survival is as comparable to the compatible transplantation so here we see some differences but in the recent studies this is the tana based group of study where from 2005 to 2030 here we see the patient's survival and the graft surgery in fact it is better in the avian compatible transplantation when we compare to the compatible transplantation uh and their protocols are very simple so they use a retraction of minus five to seven days 200 milligram then the triple immunosuppression uh they meant in a very top very low tax levels around between six to eight in the first month they their average use of dfpp is only one is one to three and uh basil eximab induction and induction of 500 milligram methyl penicillin this is the german experience what we see here in the first month this is the same in indian scenario also the first month we have lot the patient's survival is affected because the because of infectious related deaths and then after the the graft does not dip down it is almost same compared to compatible uh the same thing is there is a initial dichotomy in the graft survival in the first three years post transplantation then after the three years almost it is the graph survival is equivalent compared to the incompatible transplantation this is in a meta analysis of 26 single centers this was published in jason in 2018 where around 4943 comfortable patients were compared with the 1346 incompatible recipients so what we see here at the end of one year the grad survival is almost equal but the there was the the infections the death related to infections were almost 49 percent when compared to 13 percent incompatible the rejection rates were higher and also deaths due to non-viral infection like sepsis were also higher in the ebon compatible transplant the conclusion of these metallans is was abu incompatible kidney transplantations although they have a good outcomes albeit they are inferior to the center-matched compatible control patients so but when we compare the uh the incompatible to the other situations like disease donor transplant and the disease donor hla incompetable transplants and the living hla incompatible the best survival is in the living non-sensitized patients then is the living sensitized patients then living patient incompatible living kidney transplant patients so then only is disease so when we compare probably a patient who can uh if at all he's got an incompatible profession an option of uh going for an incompatible labor transplantation versus a disease waiting on a waiting list for a disease donor transplant people would feel that uh to go ahead with the av  incompatible living donor transplant would be a better choice provided he doesn't have a fair chance for a period exchange transplantation so i would present this about a small dot of what we did transplants in our hospital we from two uh sorry uh from 2016 to 20 we had around 24 behavior uncomfortable transplants majority were males and seven were our diabetics in our study and the donor recipient pair was so majority was b2a and we had one a two to o uh one patient and others from a one to o also was a significant so what we find is the more recipients have got a very higher antibody titles and also the risk of rejection also is high in war recipients antibody removal procedures in four of them we didn't do any antibody removal procedures because their answer antibiotics were less than one is to four and fifteen of them we did just a plasma exchange only one of them we did double filtration plasmapheresis why uh only one was because we felt getting uh eva flux filter with the plasma filter and doing this thing the cost almost is equivalent to that using uh immunoads absorption column so we we had only one dfpp and four of them we did the immunoads option so though initially we did a lot of plasma procedures for plasmapheresis even for titus up to 256 but later on we felt that the risk of infections were higher uh when the when there is a requirement more for more than four plasmapheresis that's when we changed our protocol so what we do is less than one is to 64 we do plasma exchange and more than one is 264 we go for immunoabsorption so what the indian working group recommends is immunoabsorption becomes more efficient in reducing antibody titers if more than four plasmapheresis sessions are needed hence it makes sense to use this method if the initial antibody types are more than one is to 128 so coming to the graft outcomes of pair two we lost two patients and two grafts fail so around and we had six rejections that contributes around 16 percent of the rejections uh majority were antibody meditated rejections uh one thing what we found those who had rejections uh in the the first month post transplant so when we followed them so later onwards their graft function was slowly increased worsening and these patients also had a chronic rejection in the form of transplant glomerulopathy infections we had all types of infections especially the initial transplants so we had tuberculosis we had in two patients one had malaria tuberculosis one had a fungal fungal infection so he improved uh however and we had three covet 19 in the last year we had three patients who are though they were all mild to moderate respiratory failure all of them improved we had one herpes jostler infection rates are high when we compare to compatible recipients so the lesson learned in our study was uh in our 24 patients is lutix map when we use 500 milligram with atg that's what we use in the initial transplant the risk of infections are very high so if there is a need for more than four sessions of plasmophoresis the risk of bleeding increases and also as well risk of infections infection risks are higher in patients with pre-existing diabetes and also in an odium rituximab and early start of triple immunosuppression decreases the risk of rejection high baseline igg titus doesn't mean poor outcomes and also low igj titles also doesn't mean that the outcomes are very good if sensitized it is ideal to look for a dsa preferably by a single antigen be before transplantation because so we have seen that those patients who develop rejection we don't know what is the cause they would have got a pre uh transplantation of one is to four or one is to two still they develop a rejection probably if you look in detail if they're sensitized it's worth doing a single antigen bead and see for any [Music] donor anti-donor antibodies so he was happy to share with you that i was part of this indian working group recommendations so when i sat in 2018 uh along with other senior faculties uh the conclusions uh as abn comparable transitions which was once considered absolute contraindication is no longer the same long-term outcomes with the avion comparable renal transplant using current protocols are comparable to the compatible renal transplants so especially the the outcomes what we see in the japanese group we are much reassuring incompatible transplants have expanded the living donor pool significantly and transplantation in the presence of major abu incompatibility however place the patients at somewhat a higher risk of early rejection uh infection and also infection associated death and still i would think that period exchange transplantation would be more preferable than avion compatible transplantation provided we improve the logistics of paired exchange transplantation thank you now that's a good talk anil it was very uh lucid and then very useful talk and then i'm sure that most of us will be following similar protocols what you have done in your center but i have few questions like if you have like siblings or parents  incompatible transplant what is your are you using atg in all patients or only the initial six to seven patients we use the atg and after that we stopped using atg we are using only this elixir map so what we observed was initial uh patients we used both 500 mg rituximab and atg so at least four out of the those six patients we had a very severe infections uh i think dr deepak was there with us at that time we had a very horrendous time uh in fact one patient had a meningoencephalitis infection toxicities tuberculosis all sorts of infections we had so we were scared and we our interest towards the ibm control transplantation was lost we thought it is not worth doing a b and comparable transplantation but we change the protocol that has given us some hopes so no i mean better not to use a yes you just use atg in almost all patients way bo compatible if they're hla matched also that is what the question is because the cost and the infections are much higher when you use atg in addition to the cumulative minus operation is high that's what i personally able to hear uh yes sir no i'm hearing okay the other thing he said japan they said that you know they abused only two dfpp isn't it their average uses one is to three dfpp and they go if it is one is to 64 they go ahead with the transplantation yeah that's what that's what they're taking the higher cutoffs but in indian scenario we go at least one is to 16 then below we accept so do you think that even the people from uh calcutta uh they are doing one is to uh 64 of lately especially in the tagore's group of in that hospital they are they are doing one is to 64. but i sometimes feel that i don't know what others say whether the eastern group of population when we compared to the west is there any differences in their antigenicity immunogenicity compared to the western people and we are we indians are different compared to them because we see there whatever the outcomes they project they are much much better when we compare to the other part of the world yeah that's what our observation is or even the column we've struggled sometimes the titles one is to 64 one is to 120 to bring down to one is to eight times [Music] can you switch off your video and can speak the voice will be clear so once you switch on a switch off your video that fine hello yes sir yeah that's what we struggled in some patients after using the column yes sir do you think that we should do a dfp or plasma exchange if one column is used and then cost is uh i'm almost like four lakhs so nowadays we are doing this hybrid uh we are sometimes to save cost we are doing both the plasmapheresis and immunoabsorption probably if you have a tightest of more than one is to 128 or so so you can use a uh for you can start with the plasmapheresis then you followed by immunoabsorption say the company says we have to use only single use we have been using two at least one reuse has been done but more than two reuses what happens is that their efficacies is significantly reduced so it is not worth and there is also a risk of infections so probably one plasma virus is followed by immunoadsorption would help actually especially in situations you have higher titus but more is more than one is to 128 or 256 and above okay kishore any other question and others yeah i think from the from the i had i had a question on a lighter note that was an excellent presentation on it thank you very much i've got a difficult task to follow but i had a very uh a question on the lighter note any studies done to look at the mental and cardiovascular health of transplant physicians doing hebrew incompatible voices those who are not doing it yeah i i i told actually after the first 3-4 transplant i thought it is not worth doing and for at least next six months we didn't do any in computable transplants because it was very stressful [Music] so especially the titus are high one is to 128 and above then the cost will be definitely you will be high man because if you use two columns then you are gone almost like 16 to 20 lakhs it is coming so we have to look at that fact and there is no certainty even if one is to eight tighter you can't tell the patient that you are absolutely safe one is to one because i had a patient one is to eight it rejected on the fifth day that's what is the question so it is very difficult to convince the patients that you know after doing everything you are reasonably safe we can't tell even the title one is to four ravichandran had rejections in chennai so that's what he said that this title is not really going to tell anything so we don't know which patient will reject yeah as you said that probably you should do a dsa and then see that whether they have any single antigen b antigens like no you can do that that also might uh cause or some anti endothelin and antibodies i'm not very sure so those are the areas the gray areas we don't know what exactly is uh causing rejection in some of these patients though the titus is one means to eight below even one is to four what there [Music] there was a question from ganesh prasad can transplants done with the titer of one is to 32 without any desensition you can do it he's asking yeah that's what the japanese people have been doing they are doing up to one is to 64. but in india only the the group from kolkata they are doing with the titus of one is to 64 and they are uh they're they're they have got a good outcomes so but when you are starting when we and we we are still all of us majority in india are doing up to one is to eight probably we can go to the next level of one is to 16 if we get a confidence level there's another similar question if the title is less than one is to 16 what part of desensition can you avoid or not perform can you it is still uh worth to do uh give rituximab uh give it do at least one or two plasmapheresis prior to the transplantation because uh it has we in fact we had one patient whom we uh which was as dr ravishankar told it was one is to eight and we just gave rituximab we invented there was still a rejection so we it is worth doing one plasmapheresis at least before you go ahead with the transplantation okay because you are not only taking care of ntab antibodies if at all because if you are not doing it uh strict sense or a single antigen b and seeing for some unknown dsas so some of these are care of by doing a plasma so another question is use of antibac therapy to reduce admr any antibiotic therapy so these are the questions from the audience anil uh i have a quick question i had one coveted positive uh recipient and donor who underwent transplant after becoming covet negative of course it was about incompatible uh mother to son tighter was only one is to four but uh i was really scared to do without doing any philosophies or desensitization though it was one is to four and mother two son more than one fifty percent match so to be on safer side i did one dfpp and did transplant so what do you think that the this the fear will make us to uh correct yeah number of transplants this is at least but uh i we feel that at least up to oneness to eight uh we can give rituximab probably start immunosuppression much earlier [Music] thank you yeah i think what vishwanath is telling is when the titles are below one is to eight or something so anyhow our standard immunosuppression is two weeks is there etixmap is there in addition to that what we should do i think as you said the plasma exchange would be fine because to cut down the cost and then bring down the tightest below one is to force something like that and go ahead with the transplant explaining the risk but there is no tighter we can say that guarantee saying that you will not have rejection so that is the crux here so it's very very difficult to convince the patient that you will not have any problem even with the titles of one is to four so we have to always tell them that yeah the chances of rejection always will be there even with the titus of one is to there are other factors maybe anti-endothelial antibodies maybe they might have earlier we are not having ds dsc a single antigen bead but now we have dsca single antigen b probably we should do that and then probably what anil said atg and all is overusing i think some of these patients we simply use atg just like that hundred to two hundred milligrams the risk of infections are pretty high when there is hla matched incompatible probably we can avoid atg if at all like dr sunders protocol one dose of apg something like that we should use rather than giving heavy doses of atg it will cause a lot of infections so i don't know the japanese because they do large numbers they are more confident to get over with one is to 64. if you do more and more transplants in india yes probably we also will come to stage that one is to 16 one is 34 like calcutta people are doing so we can go ahead with stanford so probably sundar and chaco sir give some points so my experience is very limited or why i be compatible so i request my guru bellavue guru dr chakosar too [Music] no i think the administrator can unmute the server will only have to do it from his end uh yeah he has to do so her has to unmute there is one uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yes i really don't have much experience with the abu incompatible except that we did one very long ago in uh below when i was there and i was we were all very ignorant and even with a high title of 1 and 256 we went ahead and did just four or five plus my exchange gave some iv cyclophosphate and did the transplant fortunately it was fortunately it was a mother to son and i think he's doing well even now but apart from that i think since we have been sunder and i have been given elderly donors i think it's a very useful thing and i think it's quite safe in good hands if you stick to the recommendations and i think the results actually published published results certainly show that it is as as safe as  compatible so i would encourage the youngsters to go ahead and do it i think if the cost is covered by government or insurance then the impact is less you know something happens rejection or whatever i think that is the key in this process of uh compatibility of this transplant i think if somebody is paying like nhs or insurance then the something happens there's no problem yeah i agree especially in the private sector if the writer is more than one is to 256 then you are mandate to use columns if at all maybe two columns then the cost would be nearly 16 to 18 lakhs so the tighter matters here because we can't get away from the titus also and then when the titer will come down to what level uh with two columns of one column we don't know so the higher the tighter then the cost will be definitely because you are going to use the column plasma exchange is cheaper column is definitely the expense if you are using two columns then uh the cost would be almost like five to six like then after that if the patient asks can you give a guarantee transplant where they are releasing around 600 flags you know that is not enough to cover for the plastic classics [Music] that is the reason i switched over to other expanded programs like old age donors because the patients have to do well the cost is less and here more than anything it is uncertainty where we think the problem will not happen there the problem happens and where we feel the problem will not happen there you know it's mixed up still i think we are not sure how to handle debuting the magic of transplantation you need astrology i also feel that we should like go for little elderly donors up to 70 and all probably if the gfr is good we can take and then some of them fathers and our parents are coming forward but they're early diabetics so i have accepted one or two early diabetics because there is no other donor in the family they can't afford avo incompetence the time is getting a lot of things to discuss so we'll go to the next session yeah i thank dr anil kumar for this wonderful talk of abu and comfortable transplant and all the panelists and the faculty member that we had a wonderful discussion", "DzNP4UE2UVM": "(upbeat music) -

out the reasons causing ill health and you'll be able to learn to manage their diet as per the requirement and you will be able to learn to manage their emotional imbalances and you will be able to learn to cope up with various therapies and methods to be fit and healthy and learn water therapy for better metabolism and learn ideal diet plan not only all these things and you are going to learn

what are the things are available for you all to improve work different uh you know to cure yourself and to improve lifestyle the first thing is meditation for managing the stress meditation for managing the stress the second concept is anchoring technique for lifetime happiness and the third thing is water therapy for better metabolism and then the fourth thing is estimation of calorie born and then the fifth thing is calculation of bmi bmi is nothing but body mass index and for understanding b of v so brp is nothing but body fat percentage and calculating the insulin intensity on mhr amateur is nothing but maximum heart rate and methods of measuring thr thr is nothing but target heart rate see if you practice to maintain or if you practice to set your own target for your heart rate that's also can be possible if you if you learn this course if you attend this course automatically you also can be able to dictate your heart to give you the correct results and concepts of reduce to produce and ideal diet plan for indian community so here we are going to provide you an ideal diet plan for indian community and the last point but not the least point ideal eight week exercises for a healthy life so these are the course contents we are going to discuss this is nothing but the course more view about the course this is the what the courses we are going to learn and we are going to practice all right so let me talk about point one uh one by one in detail so meditation for managing the stress so most of the people whenever you get any kind of illness or whenever you get any kind of ailment so generally rather than the effects of the illness rather than the effects of the ill health you know the feeling of fear the feeling of fear to the disease the feeling of the fear of that kind of ailments create a lot of damage to your health a lot of damage to your total body so before before you are going to treat your health before you are going to treat your ill health you should know how to treat yourself in the form of mental how to manage your mental uh imbalances so we need to be able to manage our imbalances mentally once you are able to manage your imbalances then automatically you will be able to cope up with all the diseases that is why we are offering the program called meditation for managing the stress so there are a lot of different styles there are a lot of different approaches to manage the stress and all so we are going to discuss all those things to live a happy life and the second concept is anchoring technique see if you absorb your life now you are facing some difficulty now you're facing some elements that's why you are feeling a little bit distracted a little bit disturbed a little bit uh you know you are dragging or you are pulling down so these kind of feelings generally will be there when a person is suffering from any ailment but let me tell you before this incident or before this ailment or before this disease definitely you might have a wonderful life correct so what we are going to do in this anchoring technique is you are going to decide your life how you should be now adwords so whatever the happy life whatever the past happy life you had the same or the similar happiness you are going to bring back to your life that is what the concept we are going to learn under anchoring techniques for lifetime happiness and then the third step water therapy for better metabolism this is the very important key aspect to be fit and healthy see most of the people who doesn't know how to use the water therapy who doesn't know how to drink water who doesn't know how to use the water as a medicine those people only get infected those people only get affected by a lot of diseases so let me tell you a one simple thing you know uh according to the vedas according to any mythologies old mythologies water is elixir of life if you if you refer the meaning of elixir the word elixir it gives you complete meaning that is it's a nectar all right it's a nectar it is the key source for your life so what we supposed to do is we supposed to understand the water therapy techniques and how to use the water for our concept so this is what we are going to practice all right and not only these things we are going to learn estimation of calorie burn so do you have any idea about how much calorie you are burning every day how many how much calories you're burning every day so this is a huge and big question most of the people doesn't know this concept once you know how much calories you are burning every day then automatically you will have a clear idea about how much calorie you are intaking how much calories you are taking in once you know these two concepts like how much qualities you are burning every day and how many calories you are in taking so this is a wonderful concept where you can understand the whole life you can easily understand that the metabolism of your lifestyle once you understood this concept once you understood this concept of estimation of your calories then automatically you can stay fit once you stay freed no doubt no disease is dead enough to attack you because your immune system is powerful enough most of the people while they are falling sick every now and then it's just because of one reason that is nothing but the way they are in taking the calories they are not aware of the calories once you use more calories once you intake more calories then automatically that energy is going to be that's going that energy is going to be stored in your body in the form of fat once you know your calories then automatically you will be able to identify bmi so here you can see what exactly does it mean by bmi body mass index you should be able to understand what exactly does it mean by body mass index that is nothing but your weight and your height most of the people they are not maintaining proper body right so according to the human body there are three types of body structures one is ectomorph and the second one is mesomorph and the third one is endomorph all right so the ectomorph means very lean very thin they are like you know uh they're already infected with a lot of diseases they they looks like they are already infected with uh uh infected with very ill men a lot of ailments and we can you know most of the people they used to comment on them because of their skeletal body right it looks very skinny and the second type is mesomorph mesomorph is the normal body shape where you can find the broader shoulders and narrower waist and the third one is ectomorph this is the most of the people have been in settling themselves into the ectomorph sorry endowment so the end of structure is like it's a oval shape all right so huge tummy fatty body you know if you absorb these kind of people the fat has been stored not only in their belly and it's been stored in their arms and it's been stored even in their legs like thighs all right so this is a very huge problem nowadays most of the people are facing a huge problem nearly 60 to 70 percent of people are facing only problem is high excessive weight excessive weight or obesity we can assembly because of that obesity we are getting a lot of diseases among the diseases the more and the more dangerous diseases are diabetes and hiv these are the two diseases generally affected are these are the two diseases generally happen to a common person when they are obese are of course there are some other certain reasons we are going to discuss them all in detail little later right now we are going to identify your bmi when you know your bmi then automatically you will be able to understand the concept of body fat percentage if you know the body fat percentage every human being according to their age according to their height according to their weight they supposed to maintain certain levels of body fat if it increases it creates a lot of ill health so how we are going to estimate body fat and how we are going to reduce the body fat these are the concepts we are going to discuss under the fifth point and that's the sixth point calculating the intensity and amateur first of all let me talk about intensity so the intensity means intake the capacity of intake of oxygen simply let me tell you in general words intensity is the capacity of your lungs the capacity of your lungs so how much oxygen your lungs are using how much oxygen your lungs are gathering and circulating to your body cells this is what called intense intensity right and we are going to learn and achar so mhr is nothing but maximum heart rate all right so most of the people who are suffering from high bp that is just because of the maximum heart rate based on this maximum heart rate we are going to decide whether you are high maybe or no people are a normal person right so this is what the concept you are going to learn so you yourself are going to learn all these techniques let me tell you one wonderful thing about all this course that is after attending this program you don't need to consult any doctors you don't need to consult any technicians to know about your body of course if you get any ill health we supposed to consult the doctors but in these cases if you if you have clear idea so if you ask me in the registration link already mentioned that prerequisite some free requisites so what are the prerequisites i mentioned let me recite it for you all the prerequisites are you should have a clear idea about your body and you should have a clear idea about your ill health and you should have a clear idea about how much percentage and what is the rate or what is the ratio you have been suffering from which means you should have or we should diagnosed by the doctors at least a couple of months ago or at least before a month so this is what the concept i mentioned in that registration form i don't know how many of you have clear idea about your body and i don't know how many of you are a clear idea about your diagnosis all right so if you know all these techniques you can diagnose yourself so what is your drawback and what are your expectations how to reach them a complete pathway you are going to learn in this program and methods of measuring the tr this is a wonderful technique i love this topic dhr target heart rate see if you talk about nlp or if you talk about cbt most of the people they focus on their brains and you know they used to say all the nlp master trainers are nlp trainers are cbt trainers or simply we can say psychologies they used to say one wonderful statement that how to change your mind how to get control over your mind similarly here we are going to get complete control over your heart how to train your heart to function well this is what the concept we are going to learn under methods of measuring the thr and concepts to concepts of reduce to produce so this is a key component for all these points reduced to produce if you reduce a lot of things then automatically you'll be produced a lot of different concepts we are going to learn this reduce to produce a little later just in a fraction of minutes we are going to learn that and now the next point is ninth point is ideal diet plan for indian community so if you browse the internet or if you browse any internet sources or youtubes mostly you will get a lot of diet plans but here you are going to learn complete one week diet plan don't ask me sir after one week what should we eat all right so whatever the diet plan we are going to provide you with that diet plan you can modify little but it should not be beyond the quality limit and it should not be the foods with what foods whichever you are going to be restricted so the foods whatever we are going to suggest you those foods only you supposed to take which means you should have a complete control over on your food let me tell you a wonderful statement given by a great dietitian the person said about the food all right so every human being eat to live we are eating for the survival correct so but he used to say one statement you can eat for living but don't eat more to die if you eat more then automatically you will get a lot of diseases right it doesn't mean that you should not become a fool you can eat tummy full you can trench your all the desires all right but what we supposed

results wonderful results which you can be your you can be believe yourself the tremendous change which is going to happen in your life all right so now let's come to the topic first of all let me talk about it what exactly does it mean by diabetes so most of the people are suffering from diabetes we all know that right so what exactly does it mean by diabetes so if you go to the doctor they'll do some tests they'll diagnose your blood right they're diagnosed you then they'll say that you are affected diabetes type 1 or type to your choice right so according to uh the infection or according to your ailment they are going to give you the type 1 or type 2 diabetes all right so first we should have a clear idea about diabetes what exactly does it mean by diabetes diabetes is a disease that occurs when the blood glucose or blood sugar is too high when your blood glucose increases when the blood glucose is very high or too high that situation that scenario can be called as diabetes and you know the blood sugar level less than 140 mg by gl is the normal way if you have 140 by 140 mz for dl then it is normal if the reading exceeds if you have more than 200 mg for dl then that is nothing but high diabetes high blood sugar in your body okay so a reading between 140 to 199 mg for deer it is indicates pre-diabetes sometimes if when you check your blood sugar levels if you get 140 to 199 so don't decide on based on one test sample try to take two or three random samples like before uh eating food after eating food all right so after one day like that so if you take two or three samples together if you get the similar results between 140 to 199 that indicates you are about to attack diabetes okay so it is the situation can be known as pre-diabetes all right and blood glucose so we have been talking about the increase of glucose levels in your body so what is glucose first we should understand this so the glucose is the main source of energy and comes from the food we eat so this is a main energy source in our body which can give you a lot of strength to perform all our actual daily chores so if you want to perform lot of activities if you want to do any work you should have you should have some energy in your body that body generally comes from the food whatever you are eating all right let me uh let me give you the clear idea just now i said that the energy is coming from the food you are eating correct the food whatever you are going to eat that food is going to give you the energy that is what called sugar blood sugar right so if the blood sugar increases that that process that thing called as diabetes so you can easily understand that diabetes is the actually happening just because of the food intake the unhealthy food habits are the food intake whatever we are putting inside that is going to give you a lot of sugar once the food produces a lot of sugar that is going to be gathered into your body once that blood sugars gathered into your body or in the blood that process that phenomenon is called as diabetes so we should understand what exactly diabetes see everything has a relationship the way you are eating the way you are living everything decides your lifestyle that's what i said just now whatever you want to eat you can eat whatever you want to do you can do it but remember that whatever you are going to eat that is going to decide your lifestyle so be cautious about what you are eating whatever you are eating that is going to create the glucose that glucose is a main cause for diabetes if the glucose levels increases in your body that is called diabetes all right and insulin a hormone made by the pancreas helps glucose from food get into the cells to be used for energy so whatever the glucose is whatever the glucose is there in your body that glucose has to be distributed to the whole body that glucose has to be distributed to your all cells right if the glucose distributed to the whole body then automatically you can be able to do any work happily but what happens there is a hormone called insulin right all the diabetes people no doubt about it all the diabetes people are pretty aware of insulin right because some you know unfortunately some people every day they used to take diabetes i mean diabetes injections like simply insulin insulin injections every day this is the thing where the life creates little difficulty and where the life creates little boring and embarrassing all right but no need to worry we have a wonderful solution we are going to solve all those problems in fractions of it's a in days of our weeks of time we are going to practice all the things together and we are going to see the results wonderful reasons right so this is the insulin which can absorb the all glucose in your blood and it can distribute the glucose to your cells but the problem here is whatever the glucose has to be distributed if it is that done if it is doesn't distributed to all the body cells or whole body parts then that is called diabetes now so sometimes sometimes but it doesn't make enough are any or insulin right sometimes a human body could not be able to produce enough insulin all right so for example in your body there are 100 sugar cells 100 sugar cells right or 100 sugar molecules in your body if there is sufficient insulin in your body what happens then automatically it will gather the sugar cells and sugar particles and it will distribute to the body but there is no sufficient insulin then automatically what happens for example one insulin atom acting as a uh transporter right it's been transporting one sugar cell from one place from blood to the body from blood to your cells right it transported you have 50 insulin molecules in your body but there are 100 molecules of sugar in your body what happens the 50 insulin molecules capture are catch all the 50 molecules of sugar and it is going to distribute the rest of the 50 gathered coagulate in a place they'll be floating simply in your blood that process causes diabetes so glucose then stays in the blood and doesn't reach cells over time after few days if the same phenomena 50 50 cells of sugar 50's molecules of sugar gathering gathering gathering one day no problem two days no problem one week no problem one month maybe the problem all right so if the sugar has been gathering into your blood over time it is going to create a lot of diseases a lot of health issues and although the diabetes has nuclear so don't afraid while looking at this statement diabetes has no cure you should understand that diabetes has no cure there is no hundred percent permanent solution you can't cure it you can't take out the sugar from your body you can't take the diabetes from your body but but you can take steps to manage your diabetes and stay healthy you don't need to take out the diabetes from your body but you can manage yourself to stay fit and healthy without any complaint right so that is what the concept you are going to learn right sometimes people call diabetes a touch of sugar or borderline of diabetes these terms suggest that someone doesn't really have the diabetes or has a less serious case but remember every diabetes case every case of diabetes is very serious it should be it should be treated on time if you don't free diabetes on time you can be able to control the state circumstances like once you infected diabetes you are more vulnerable than the children see if you uh if you talk about the small kids right so they are more vulnerable they are more sensitive right because the newly entered into the world and they are new to this atmosphere they are new to the germs they are new to the lot of bacterias and virals and fungus all right so the baby is vulnerable but the person who is suffering from diabetes is more vulnerable than the baby because if uh if a person infected with diabetes then automatically what happens that is going to reduce your immunity power that is going to spoil your actual strength so there you're supposed to boost your immunity once you boost your immunity then the diabetes also can be do anything it will be stabilized it can do anything and it will be normal position all right so this is what the best thing what we can do and the most common types of diabetes there are two common types there are two most common types of diabetes are type 1 and type 2 so let me uh know how many of you are infected with diabetes one how many of you are suffering from diabetes too you please uh mention in the chat box please mention in the chat box how many of you are suffering from type 1 and type 2 if any rare conditions if anyone facing type 1 and type 2 that also can be mentioned okay okay right so let me give you the clear idea about what exactly does it mean by type one what exactly does it mean by tied to once you come to know that then it will be easy for you to solve the problem see whenever you want to solve any problem whenever if you want to find a solution for problem the first step to solve the problem is to find out the problem once you have the clear idea about the problem then automatically you will be able to solve the problem without any hesitation without any stoppings all right so now let me let me give you the types first type type one what exactly does it mean by type one the body doesn't meet insulin the type 1 diabetes is they are not able to produce the insulin actually it is an enzyme has to be produced in our body but unfortunately maybe there are there are a lot of reasons for that problem we are going to come to that part a little later right so because of various reasons the person who is not able to produce the insulin sometimes they produce the insulin but it's not sufficient it's not enough to survive it's not enough to utilize for the whole body this phenomenon this situation called type 1 diabetes so these people the immune system attacks and destroys the cell so the people who are suffering from diabetes type 1 their immune system attack on their own body cells because immune system is like a soldier right immune system is like a soldier of your body if it doesn't have any what what happens whatever comes in front of them whether they'll become completely passive or they'll become aggressive we can be able to decide with the immune system so it is going to attack our own body cells this is what the problem with type 1 people and the type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults it doesn't mean that only the children and young adults has to show this problem anyone can be affected with type one all right and people with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to stay alive this is the this is the situation this is the statement i don't want to be there in anyone's life right so if you want to live happy life if you want to stay fit you should decide what to do what not to do but here unfortunately the medicine the insulin has been deciding his feeling deciding your lifestyle so this is where i felt really distracted with this statement right so if you're really suffering from type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes or high bp or whatever the problems all right so try to practice the methods whatever we are going to learn in this training once you practice all these concepts then automatically you will be able to lead your life happily all right so all the great old good days will return to you they're all waiting for you right so try to work hard little now type 2 so the type 2 is the body does not make or use insulin well so the type 1 is they can't be able to produce but here it is can be able to use that insulin it can be able to produce or whatever the amount is producing it's not being used this is the process of type 2 people right they can't be able to use the insulin whatever they're in their body and when we uh we can develop type 2 diabetes at any age even during childhood all right and however the type two diabetes occur most often in middle aged and elderly people all right so this is type 2 diabetes is generally it's a common phenomenon in middle aged people all right so i'll tell you the people uh what kind of people they'll get and you know uh what are the types of problems they are going to face everything we are going to learn here all right and type 2 is the most common diabetes it is a most common diabetes type nowadays most of the people who are suffering from diabetes they are showing type 2 diabetes all right and there is another type of diabetes that is called gestational diabetes this is the digestive diabetes only for the pregnant women all right so this is the diabetes generally happens with pregnant ladies pregnant women all right so just stressful diabetes is a condition in which a woman without diabetes again i'm saying it's not complete diabetes without diabetes they develop high blood sugar levels during pregnancy they are not diabetic patients but the blood sugar increases all right and distraction diabetes is caused by not enough insulin if you observe the whole story of diabetes it's just only one factor that is only one deciding factor that is nothing but insulin all right so insulin generally produced by the pancreas of your body it is a small argon in your body all right so the pancreas could be able to produce insulin enough for every human being but why it is not able to produce you should be able to be aware of that i have given the pancreas but i'm not able to produce right so i'm not able to produce the insulin enough why we are going to practice that we are going to learn this is what i said right so i'm going to give you a wonderful concept how to reduce how to produce all these things right the usual onset is most common last three months of pregnancy first trimester this problem is going to be solved for pregnant woman but not type 1 and type 2 so the type 1 and type 2 can last forever sometimes it's you know we can't be able to control it again i'm telling you if you're not able to control your diabetes in the sense you are not controlling yourself on food not only on food you're not able to control yourself and your movements so these are the general reasons why we couldn't be able to produce insulin enough in our body all right so now so far we have been talking about diabetes now let's focus on a little bit focus on high bp also all right so diabetes and high bps are you know they are like cousins they mostly uh you know some people infected both unfortunately all right so a couple of days ago i was told by a man you know when i given this advertisement he asked his wife has been infected with diabetes and ibp but you know at that point of time without knowing the situation i just uh you know i just i just made a statement i felt really bad about that statement you know i just made a statement like it's a double damage but when i came to know that his wife is in ico i felt really bad about that statement because see the small things if you change the small things it just such small things any parts of your life if you change those small parts if you just change small things of your life then you can see a huge difference a wonderful tremendous difference in your life all right so now let me talk about high bp a condition in which the force of the blood against the artery wires is too high all right we all know that our blood has been pumping through the vessels right so the nerves whatever the uh well we whatever the nerves we are we have been the blood has been flowing in your body if the blood vessels are facing any high pressure any pressure see for example uh there is a small uh water pipe all right so you just turn down your motor there is a small watch pipe the water is uh for example if the water is a little low then automatically the flow of the water is also simply normal but what happens for the people who are suffering from hiv that blood flow will be the pressure will be very high all right so that pressure if it is huge uh i mean a little big vessels are uh big weights then it will be somewhat fine but you know in our body there are certain blood vessels very small very small in the size if it falsely the blood firstly goes and attack that vessels then automatically what happens those veils are going to be ruptured those wings are going to be uh you know torn to right they're going to rupture or they're going to turn into small pieces it leads to huge damage to the human life right so generally the people who are uh facing high bp they are also more vulnerable and these people generally if the rate of ibp increases more and more then automatically they are going to uh you know unfortunately they are going to uh coma also so this is a huge problem which can be solved again i'm saying whatever the problem there is no problem without any solution but the thing what we need to do is we need to find out that solution all right so if you are ready to find out the solution with me definitely i'll show you a wonderful path all right and usually hypertension is defined as blood pressure if a person has been in a hypertension hypertension excessive tension that person that situation that feeling can be called as blood pressure all right so generally the measurement is 140 by 90 is considered silver if the pressure is above 180 to 120 okay so the blood pressure is if you are suffering from high vp that scenario is you should have at least a maximum you should have 140 by 90. if it reaches 180 by 120 then it is going to be dangerous and high blood pressure often has no symptoms but the diabetes people they may show some symptoms like feeling dizziness right feeling weak exhausted tired but these kind of general symptoms we can find in diabetes but in high bp we can be able to predict whether they are suffering from hiv or not because it has no symptoms it doesn't so more symptoms and over time if it is untreated it can cause health conditions such as heart disease and stroke also all right and eating a healthier diet eating a healthier diet with less so don't tell this less salt this is the thing where most of the people feeling bad about their food all right but the truth is whatever the food item you are eating it has it's sown enough or sufficient salts but without knowing that concept what we are doing is we are adding extra salt all right so if you absorb any cooking process right when they are talking about the salt first when they are talking about the salt they are saying simply salt to taste all right so whatever the salt you need it's already there in your body whatever the salt you need that's already there in your food items but we are just habituated to add more salt add more salt add more salt now let me ask you a simple thing how many of you love to eat packed food packed food it's the food items whatever the food items you are eating from the packages like cans right so those are all nothing but completely heavily sold touched food we should avoid such things all right so we should have a clear idea about our life once you know about your lifestyle and automatically you will be able to find out wonderful solution for all the problems all right so this is a right time to decide what to do what not to do right next what is high bp according to guidelines provided by the centers of disease control and prevention trusted culture normal blood pressure is less than 120 by 80 mmh if a person showing 120 by 80 mm that indicates normal blood pressure if it increases to 140 by 90 150 by 90 then it shows that high blood pressure if a person showing 90 by 60 that is low blood pressure high blood pressure or low blood pressure both are not safe for human life and it is normal for systolic blood pressure to rise to between 160 to 160 and 220 during exercises while you are doing exercises it is quite common to a man to reach his blood pressure from 160 to 220 but if your blood pressure is going beyond 220 while doing the exercises it's not advisable to continue your exercises it's a good idea to consult your cardiologist if you consult your doctor then they'll suggest you what kind of things you need to change all right but it can be happen with the other ladies it can be happened with athletes to reach even 250 hours but they are practiced on the time basis every now and then they practice just give me a second all right now so now i would like to talk about the problems with diabetes and hiv all right so don't worry i'm not going to talk about the problem because you people already pretty aware of all the problems because you know better than anyone else in the world about the problems which you are facing all right so i'm not going to talk about the problems but i'm here to talk about the solutions okay so here i have a wonderful solution for you all the solution is reduce and produce so this is the wonderful solution i have i want to share with you all so this solution is reduce and reduce so in the beginning i asked you all to stay in a calm and quiet room so i hope you all there in this calm and quiet environment so if you are okay with that then i would like to connect a small practical thing now all of you close your eyes just think about

open your eyes you", "sUuap8dP_Nk": "Well, oh, oh my gosh. I'm sorry thing to do is off. I need to stay awake Fortunately I've got a nifty energy drink here. This is supposed to keep me awake according to the Manufacturers it it gives me some kind of wings Monstrous wings and look at all the great stuff. It's got in it. Let's hold this up here. It's got vitamins. It's got L-carnitine It's got taurine Those are really really cool chemical names and well because they're so prominently listed on the can these things Absolutely must give you energy or else. They wouldn't list them, right? Right well let's look at that shall we Just because these things are listed on the label People automatically assume that Since they're mentioned these must be the things that give you the energy, but that's not really the truth Remember that fella that made his fortune selling head on head on - apply directly to the forehead head on - apply directly to the forehead Head on apply directly to the forehead apply directly to the forehead It didn't do anything. He never claimed that it did anything all he did was breathlessly tell you to apply it to your forehead and people Imagined that it had all sorts of health benefits. Oh some people said it cures headaches. It's good for migraines It'll cure impotency. It'll cure the crop the dropsy It'll cure leprosy who knows but just because you're supposed to apply it directly to your forehead it Was good for you or else they wouldn't mentioned it would they Well, that's the same sort of marketing tactic that the makers of energy drinks use when they list all these Immensely interesting chemical names here. Oh, they're long in there. They're chemically sounding Let's go through the list shall we well the first thing on here is b. Vitamins it says B. Vitamins oak Hey, well, there are four b. Vitamins that are listed riboflavin. That's Vitamin B2 niacin that's Vitamin B3 Vitamin B6 and Vitamin B12 Let's look at these guys. I happen to have gotten some numbers off the National institutes of health website they have all sorts of Tables and other sciency things there that they list the u.s. rda that is recommended Daily allowance and the tolerable upper intake The upper Limit before they start harming you of a lot of different things Well according to monster. It gives you 100 percent per serving of these things Well, let's see the u.s. RDA of riboflavin. That's one point three milligrams. I see and it doesn't have and Tolerable upper Limit nobody has ever studied it because it's never been a problem Vitamin B12 the u.s. RDa is two point four milligrams Also doesn't have a tolerable upper limit because as far as we know there isn't one these are b vitamins by the way They're water-soluble chances are any excess is just gonna get washed out of your body Vitamin B6 now that one does have a tolerable upper limit It's us RDA is one point three milligrams The tolerable upper limit though is one hundred milligrams Now let's get to one of my favorites Vitamin B3 niacin the u.s. RDA of Niacin is 16 Milligrams, and that's per serving oh, but look at this servings per container 2 so I don't know anybody who's going to drink half the can and then put the rest in the Refrigerator and drink it the next day You grab this thing you down the whole thing so you actually are getting two servings So you're getting 32 milligrams of Niacin? Well guess what the tolerable upper intake? level for Niacin is 35 milligrams for the average adult male it goes up and down depending on your age and your gender but Basically with one 16 ounce can of monster energy that I have here You are getting very very close to what your body can safely tolerate for Niacin if you have too much niacin they can have interesting effects according to the mayo clinic and overdose of Niacin can cause skin flushing that's the big one it can cause Rapid Heartbeat And it can possibly cause liver damage, so you don't want to get too terribly much of that however again, it's a B vitamin Primarily small excesses are going to be flushed out of your body Now let's go into these Interesting chemically sounding names up here We've got the L-carnitine and the taurine let's start with the taurine . Here's taurine It's a fairly little molecule that according to myth is extracted from Bull Semen well this story is bull. It is actually extracted from Bull Bile It's found in very high concentrations in heart and muscle cells in the human body So it naturally exists in ourselves. It's synthesized in the liver your body is loaded with it there were studies that were done that tried to test the effect of a combination of taurine and caffeine on performance and sleepiness They had various results, but Primarily what they discovered was that Taurine plus caffeine had pretty close to the same effect as caffeine by itself So the taurine really isn't doing an awful Lot the one study that I found that concluded that taurine has a positive effect on Alertness and wakefulness was sponsored by these people you guessed it the ones who want to give you wings? speaking of bull bile No There is no solid evidence that taurine does anything yes it occurs naturally in our bodies Eating more of it doesn't really appear to do terribly much Okay, how about this one? This is l-Carnitine? L-Carnitine also exists Naturally in our muscles there are some reports that L-Carnitine Is very very low in patients who exhibit fatigue? And it's extremely low in patients who exhibit what we call chronic fatigue syndrome The thought then is if you swallow a bunch of it you won't be fatigue Actually that is true. That is one of the therapies they have for chronic fatigue syndrome You have to take a gram of it twice a day That's a thousand milligrams For four to eight weeks before you start seeing an effect and even then all the literature says there is some effect so Swallowing however much they're going to put in this Over an hour is not going to have any real effect on you You're just going to have a stomach full of carnitine which will go away on its own after some time there was a study done at the university of Maryland medical center to see if it had any effect on athletic performance and the Results of that study can be summarized in one word so apparently the taurine the b vitamins and the L carnitine which are so prominently labeled on this can here Really have no effect on your energy levels. They're not going to give you wings They're not going to allow you to lift a car or whatever the commercials say you can do and they're not going to increase athletic performance But there's something in here. That's not listed on the label except it's buried way down in the ingredients list That might be having an effect on your body, and that is this little molecule here That's right. That's your friend and mine caffeine Now caffeine is a molecule that all of us are familiar with we've seen it all over the place. It's in coffee It's in chocolate It's in a lot of cola products your average cup of coffee about 8 ounces worth is going to Contain Roughly 100 milligrams of caffeine the us food and Drug administration Has stated that 400 milligrams of caffeine per Day is about as much as you want to get why is that? Caffeine is a stimulant. It makes your Central nervous system Perk up you start to release adrenaline your heart starts to beat faster You become more alert the more caffeine you get the more your body starts to get Energized in a very very similar chemical cascade to what we call the fight-or-flight response now if you want to keep pumping caffeine into your body you're going to energize your body more and your body is an Engine what happens when you rev an engine harder and harder relentlessly? You keep pushing up the RPMs without stopping. What's that engine going to do? Exactly now our pan of energy drink here contains about 160 Milligrams of caffeine At one of those tiny little shots of 5-hour energy those little guys that actually contains 200 Milligrams of Caffeine I did a little searching online and looked up some numbers that had been published by the nih on caffeine levels found in various food products I was sort of surprised to find that Starbucks blonde roast coffee Big 20 ounce Starbucks Blonde Roast Puffy contains 475 Milligrams of caffeine you're already above the recommended daily intake of caffeine just with your morning blonde roast now Is this really a problem? Well it can be because if that's the only caffeine you get during the day well alright But there's caffeine and a lot of foods there's caffeine hidden in many places And you may not realize that you're getting an overdose Let's look at this poor young fellow This is Davis Allen Cripe late of South Carolina Young Mr.. Crepe according to his friends Drank a McDonald's McCafe latte which has 178 milligrams of caffeine a large Mountain Dew diet at 91 Milligrams And an energy drink they didn't specify which if we assume as one of these that was 160 Milligrams which he chugged now that's total of 429 Milligrams About a third of which he got all at once in a single Bolus at the end of his two-hour stint of drinking these things the poor kid fell over dead He was feeling light-headed he passed out according to the coroner his cause of death was cardiac arrest Likely related to Heart arrhythmia. He had no heart condition So it's a fairly good guess that all this excess caffeine Basically drove his engine to wear out This is not the only case I've got a whole list of them down here They've been documented and you can find them if you do a search of the news We have a youngster named Dustin hood who drank three 24 ounce monsters that is 720 milligrams of caffeine almost twice the U.S Safe recommended level then went to play some basketball His heart was racing. He engaged in a physical activity that made his heart race even more and He simply keeled over dead right there on the court in Ireland in limerick there was youngster named Ross Cooney just 18 years old He was said to have consumed four red bulls. That's a total of 450 milligrams of caffeine and then he also went out to shoot some hoops and He also fell over dead now people can Take all sorts of meaning from this basketball is deadly no admittedly this is a small sample size, but it is a Brief illustration of the sort of thing that can happen when you charge your body too far so We now know that What's probably giving you a lot of energy is not even listed on the label up here? But there's one thing that is In this can that is probably giving you the bulk of the jolt that you're supposed to get the bulk of the energy comes from this dear old friend sugar This stuff is loaded with sugar. It says here on the label that one serving is 27 grams of Sugar well, let's see here. We have 27 grams of Sugar I measured this out for you. Every good chemist has a sensitive scale in his kitchen And as you can see that's that's about two good heaping tablespoons of sugar And that's just in one serving Oh, but wait, remember I said that this can contains two servings well This is the contents of this can in terms of sugar We've got a pretty hefty glob of sugar here right now and When you consider that sugar is? energy it gets broken down into your body into basically sparks of electricity you can see how much of that you're starting to get Let's say you you didn't want to stop it at just one of these cans suppose You drank one, and then a little while later. You said, I need more energy So you drank a second one well in two cans of Monster energy 16-ounce This is the amount of sugar you are dealing with 108 Grams Can you imagine somebody handing this to you and saying here? Here's some sugar? It'll give you energy drink up. Oh I don't think so That's 16 ounce monster. What about the big? 24 ounce Monster monsters you want to drink two of those here is the volume of sugar you're gonna wind up consuming well If you're a very active person and you're going to go out and run an Olympic decathlon Well, maybe this isn't a problem for you, but most people out. There are not really all that active Let's look back at this 108 grams that we have here That's the prop 420 calories if you wanted to burn off that 420 calories, you would have to jog Constantly for Roughly 4 and 1/2 miles if you don't Your body is going to take that energy and store it, and how is it going to store it? It's going to store it as fat the volume of sugar in Two of your 24 ounce monsters this is going to be the equivalent of about 1/4 pound of fat so What's happening when you drink your monster? Yes? You're getting sugar. Yes, you're getting caffeine You're getting a lot of both. It's giving you energy, but There's really safer ways to get that energy Take a cup of coffee. That's a hundred milligrams of caffeine there just put a couple of sugar packs in enough to make it sweet that is going to be enough to keep you awake, or consider this Why is it? You're so tired Could it be that your body is trying to tell you it needs rest Maybe you're not getting enough sleep Yes, perhaps, you work a particular shift. You've got to be up you're an emergency responder, and you need that energy all right For a quick burst of energy when it's really needed this material can be effective But if you're going to start relying on it if you're going to start downing one or more of these Every day or every other day All it's going to do is make you think you've got lots of energy you're going to run your body ragged and eventually your body will simply give out and quite frankly I don't want to be reading your name in that long list of people whose deaths have been attributed to possible overdoses on Energy drinks", "ChfxOHdny9U": "what's up everybody watching try the sweet TV and on today's episode we're joined by Andrew and Jason we're gonna be trying out chronic elixir we started about nine months ago I have silly accent Crohn's disease so unfortunately that means I'm not able to eat dairy gluten but still love to medicate and with edibles and I'll spent many months and months doing a lot of research and came together with a completely water-soluble concentrated hash oil drink that is amazing to mix into whatever beverage you may choose and medicate you and along with takes away all the ailments I had with my stomach and no longer arm the medications I was taking you can find chronic licks are online on instagram at chronic elixir wwr Annika liquor calm and hashtag stay chronic thank you guys for coming on the show it was really cool to showcase your product and if you guys are interested in carrying or showing your product it please the Emma's thank you for watching", "-0I4K_7_adY": "[Laughter] hey yo man welcome back and look i got another review for you before we get into that let me get a too sweet hey man look i got a thing called the cannabis quencher you feel me i was using my um my little local dispensary i just saw some new [ __ ] they had in the little drink section so i was like [ __ ] it let me pick it up and see what they're talking about so i just picked up one eye random cannabis question it says it makes 20 mocktails i'm not about to make any mocktails up with this [ __ ] i'm about to drink it straight out of the bottle just like i know you gonna do at home too you feel me and let's see i got the flavor strawberry lemonade strawberry lemonade so hopefully it's busting because usually you can't go wrong with strawberry lemonade you [ __ ] that up then i ain't trying no other flavor from you you couldn't even get the strawberry lemonade right you feel me oh yeah you don't need to make any mocktail you don't need to mix this with [ __ ] if you mix this with something else you [ __ ] up just drink this [ __ ] straight out of the bottle 100 um 100 milligrams in the bottle you filming so look if you if you're chilling with a whole bunch of alcoholic homies they they got the you know they got the bottles they doing shots and [ __ ] you ain't trying to be on that vibe you just pull out one of these bad boys the hell yeah 100 milligrams in this [ __ ] the flavor is pretty good it's not too sweet not too heavy on the lemon or the um strawberry flavor it's really just whatever you filming there's a slight hint of thc flavoring into this you feel me you gonna know that you drinking something that's medicated it's not gonna taste like straight up juice so be prepared for that but other than that's a pretty good drink man i really can't complain i will buy it again when you feel me there's a two thumbs up so far but i might like push pause on this and check back in a little bit and let y'all know how it hit so look man about approximately 30 minutes have went by i have drank the whole bottle and i'm feeling very nice you feel me i'm in a good mood it really hit the hundred milligrams you feeling all hundred of that [ __ ] so beware you feel me if you have plans afterwards i hope you're not gonna drive [ __ ] but yo get in the comment section right now and let me know the best medicated drink that you ever had let me know right now in the comments section because i might want to check that [ __ ] out and while you're down there hit the like button and bam hit the little bell come part of the naughty gang anything else you need to know is in the description below peace", "dtXmaXTVVxI": "What are the Best Natural Anti-Inflammatories\nand Pain Relievers By Dr. James Meschino, DC, MS, ND What are the best natural anti-inflammatories\nand pain relievers? Patients ask me this all the time. The most proven, natural anti-inflammatories\nand pain relievers are natural agents like curcumin \u2013 which comes from the spice, turmeric\n\u2013 as well as white willow bark extract, ginger and boswellia. But how do these natural anti-inflammatories\nwork? They work very much the same way as aspirin\nand ibuprofen work; they block the conversion of certain fats into what are called prostaglandins\nand hormones. Prostaglandins are very inflammatory hormones\nthat are made by our own tissues, and when their synthesis is blocked, your body can\nreduce inflammation. This is how aspirin and ibuprofen work; they\nblock enzymes known as cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase. There are natural compounds that can do this\nsame thing. Although medicinal anti-inflammatories like\naspirin, ibuprofen, indomethacin and Voltaren (diclofenac) block inflammatory prostaglandins,\nthere are some side-effects \u2013 erosion to the intestinal tract (leading to ulcerations\nand internal bleeding, which is not uncommon); liver and kidney damage; heart failure and\ncardiovascular death and even high blood pressure can result when taking these drugs. I am not overstating this when I say that\nlong-term use of these anti-inflammatory drugs has been known to have side-effects like this\nand that it\u2019s becoming a major concern across the healthcare community. Drugs like acetaminophen are strongly related\nto liver and kidney failure when taken even at normal doses after a prolonged period of\ntime. The issue isn\u2019t that these drugs don\u2019t\nbelong \u2013 they do \u2013 however, you should try and lower and even reduce your reliance\non these synthetic anti-inflammatory pain relievers. In addition, narcotics to include codeine,\nPercodan, Percocet and even the stronger drugs, like Oxycodone, should be lowered and reduced\nwhenever possible. When using natural herbal and accessory nutrients\nfor anti-inflammation purposes \u2013 supplements that are much less toxic \u2013 you will want\nto follow the proper dosage. Here are some guidelines to follow:\nCurcumin \u2013 You want a supplement that also contains turmeric which is a 95 percent standardized\ngrade of curcumin. You\u2019ll need about 600 to 1200 ml. per dosage\nto really get the anti-inflammatory effect over the course of the day. Boswellia \u2013 You need a standardized grade\nof 70 percent boswellic acid. And again, you\u2019ll need about 600 to 1200\nml. over the course of the day to really get an anti-inflammatory effect. White Willow Bark Extract \u2013 You need a standardized\ngrade of 15 percent salicin, or salicylic acid. And you\u2019ll need about 100 to 200 mg. a day\nfrom that source. Ginger \u2013 Even though we know that eating\nginger is great, to get an anti-inflammatory effect it has to be a standardized grade of\n5 percent ginerols, and you\u2019re going to need 150 to 300 mg. a day to make that happen. I like to use a supplement where all these\nthings have been combined into one capsule. You might take say, 3 to 6 capsules a day\nto get the curcumin, boswellia, white willow bark extract and ginger all in one. Together, they can block the cyclooxygenase\nand the lipoxygenase enzymes that lead to inflammation and you\u2019ll get a sort of nice,\nnatural anti-inflammatory effect. Are there other anti-inflammatories? Yes, the flavionoid quercetin works very well,\nand bromelain enzymes work very well, too. Those anti-inflammatories are really good\nfor certain conditions, like tendonitis and bursitis, when you have a muscle strain or\nmuscle inflammatory problem. Even for spinal disc herniations they can\nreduce the inflammation significantly. They helped me personally at one point. For lower back strains or whiplash injuries,\nthey can be used in place of anti-inflammatory drugs to decrease your reliance or how much\nof the anti-inflammatory drugs you\u2019re going to need. Why am I brining this to your attention? I\u2019m bringing it to your attention because\nmany family doctors, rheumatologists and orthopedic surgeons fail to mention to patients the importance\nof diet, exercise and supplements in the management of these cases. It\u2019s very unfortunate and disappointing,\nbecause these natural remedies can make a really big difference in your care, and you\ncan decrease your reliance on drugs that could lead to significant side-effects and toxins,\nand sometimes even dependency. The best way to understand all of this is\nto download the eBook that I have created called, Proven Natural Remedies for Joint\nPain, Arthritis and Inflammation. Do that right now. The booklet shows an exact lifestyle plan\nhelping you better manage any inflammatory or arthritic condition and it can be used\nalong with any medical treatments that you may be undergoing at the present time.

this time we are taking a look at their 350 milligram IV notations chocolate chip cookie this is our third in their 350 milligram line of the new packaged enjoyable edibles we have taken a look at their fruity crispy and at their peanut butter brownie found the peanut butter brownie we pretty good and they're pretty crispy to be pretty disappointing that's usually the case when it comes to the sort of rice krispie treats or the fruity crispy treats I've often find them to be a little disappointing and this one was certainly no exception these do claim to be lab tested by SC labs but I am doubt I do doubt they are 350 milligrams they do seem a little bit less potent to me but we'll give them the benefit of the doubt on this one here and hopefully that it's hopefully they are being honest about the milligram egde on this one so this is the plain chocolate chip cookie hopefully it tastes good chocolate chip cookies can certainly go either way terms of edibles so it's a big flat boring looking cookie they're very dry it's like cannabis odor to it but not too bad incredibly dry looking cookie let's go ahead and give it a bite here it's like taking a bite out of the Sahara and there is a cannabis aftertaste well I put it right about in the middle in terms of taste of edible chocolate chip cookies they've certainly had better and I've certainly had worse it's very dry there is a little bit of a cannabis aftertaste but it's not horrible terrible there's an edible edible well the first half of the review is done don't worry I'm going to finish off this cookie here and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know the most important part of the edible review notice whether or not I got higher or not and this time I really have no clue how it's gonna go down I hope to come back to you guys in two hours wasted as [ __ ] but I am skeptical so we shall certainly see be sure to stick around yourselves guys and we will find out in just a bit peace welcome back to weeds guys much like it's peanut butter bar predecessor the chocolate chip cookie is pretty good it's not the best edible I've ever had I don't a hundred percent believe it's three hundred and fifty milligrams it feels like more like a hundred and fifty milligrams somewhere in there they could be totally wrong I would love to see their lab tested results they claim to be lab tested by SC labs I'm gonna take a look at their website enjoyable edibles calm I see something different if I see something I'll be sure to I'm making an addendum to this video to let you know but otherwise yeah I still like it for 15 bucks it was still a pretty good value I still feel pretty high and much like the peanut butter bar it is a different kind of high it's a more but of a body high I feel kind of buzzy it's it's Pleasant though I like it but it's different than some of the other highs that I've had so yeah whatever they're using produces a different kind of high end me that has a more of a body buzzy kind of high so if you're looking for that maybe give this a try yeah it's kind of uh it's worth it's worth mentioning because it is different for me so I still think I'm gonna recommend this I'm not gonna recommend the fruity pebbles fruity whatever it's called but the chocolate chip cookie and the peanut butter bar I think I'm gonna recommend go ahead and pick them up I don't think they're as potent as recommended but if they're as cheap or cheaper wherever you grab them I think you'll be pretty pleased with them so that's gonna yeah yeah that's gonna do it for I think for our enjoy series don't get the crispys stick with the baked goods like these something that has a lot of fat and all that good stuff in it so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always thank you so much and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "vyLpdUTlMng": "[Music] what's up guys welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on this review guys we are rolling those dice and that looked more like a jerk-off motion and I apologize that was definitely just dice being rolled and thrown we're rolling those dice we're clicking them clacks because I am taking a big old gamble this week I have picked up something that I can't even tell you what the name of it necessarily is the packaging looks shitty it's actually got some like dab wax on it somewhere and I don't really know much about it it's got a dumb name beverage enhancer along with this see there see beverage enhancer Callie Punk Callie punch Ken elixir so it's the SI beverage enhancer Callie punch can elixir I guess it's C beverage enhancer and the flavor is Callie punch directions shake well add a splash or add the whole bottle to your favorite beverage I'm gonna be a rebel without a cause here or a caught maybe with a cause and that cause is laziness and I'm not gonna mix this with my favorite beverage because I think that's a stupid direction there anything could be your favorite beverage and this thing could certainly ruin so many drinks out there that if they just gonna give you that sort of blanket advice just mixed with your favorite beverage I'm just gonna take it straight because whatever it could be whatever substance could be mixed with any beverage and still be okay can be taken just straight and be fine too and because I don't really want to drink a whole drink with whatever this is it's only one point zero one fluid ounces so I'll be out and out in no time it's a little like 5-hour energy not that I've ever had a 5-hour energy drink but it reminds me that same kind of bottle it's a little metal bottle a little little on the top oh it's 250 milligrams of THC I think I'm not sure if I said that or not and I don't even sure if you can see that and it cost $15 at the dispensary picked it up from which if this really is 250 milligrams of THC in this like liquid form like this that is a hell of a good deal if I get as high off of it as I should for a 250 milligram and boy I'll be quite quite pleased with it but I've got a feeling that this mean this is the gamble I was talking about that this might not be what it's as advertised let's find out let's go ahead and open it up let's give him the benefit the doubt for now and then you know two hours from now if it's not what we hope it to be then we'll excoriate them but again let's hope for diamond in the rough okay so we've opened it up here they've got a little seal on the top there pull that seal back there's a little bit of red liquid in there you can see it as well there let's give it a sniff it smells very strong but not anything like cannabis but mostly just like fruit syrup basically all right uh let's give it a taste well that's not bad really not straight from there it's very fruity it just tastes like the strongest bucking it tastes like if you went to a goddamn slushie machine and instead of and just held down on the syrup button and never put me in the ice the chip Dyson it just tastes like intense intense syrup I mean it's not that it's actually a very little cannabis taste it just tastes like a snowcone syrup basically and sort of has that consistency too well I'm gonna finish this off I'm a little pleasantly surprised with how it tastes and how it mixes in everything well I didn't actually mix it with anything but I assume it would mix fine with like a sprite to him you know some kind of citrus beverage just fine so I'm going to finish it off and then I will see you guys in two hours or for you just a couple of seconds and let you know how it's actually feeling for me thanks for watching wheats peace [Music] I think I hope beverage see whatever you however you say this whatever their name is I do not know their marketing department apologies but I might owe the product an apology because I think I'm pretty I uh I'd say I'm at a good six and a half right now I mean not outrageously high but higher than I was expecting to be from a product this shitty higher than I've been from some other things it's not as good as like a cannabis syrup like the 200 milligram cannabis syrup I think got me higher but this tasted better its tasted a lot better it went down smoother so it's kind of a mixed bag it's also more expensive than that at $15 well I guess it's actually it's cheaper than the 200 milligram cannabis syrup so I had 15 bucks so if you're looking for a syrup or a beverage enhancer for not a lot of money and if you see the sea beverage enhancer brand at your dispensary oh go ahead and give them a shot if that's what you're looking for I don't think you'll be too disappointed I'm certainly not alright guys well that's gonna do it for this review here on weeks I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a future review peace", "zyzzto61r1M": "hello in this video we're going to talk about non-opioid otherwise known as non narcotic analgesics these drugs are used to treat pain and there's a couple of different families we'll talk about salicylates non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs acetaminophen and at the end we'll talk about drugs used to treat gout increased anxiety or lack of sleep could make a patient's pain feel worse so getting enough rest and having sympathetic people supporting them can raise their pain threshold pain control is of great importance as pain is often the issue that brings a patient into the office oddly enough pain mate might be what keeps a patient from seeking care a healthcare provider must be able to recognize and evaluate a patient's need for medication so here's an example of a tool that you can use to assess a patient's pain so classifications of analgesics right now we're talking about non opioids and they act primarily at the peripheral nerve endings and they work by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis that's debatable not effective for severe pain sometimes non-opioid analgesics are exactly what a patient needs and then later on we'll discuss opioid or narcotic analgesics in another chapter so quick question pain relief by non-opioid analgesics is mediated via action I'll let you read through those and pick what you think is the right answer and the answer is B at the peripheral nervous system so let's talk about aspirin acetylsalicylic acid it is a cyclooxygenase inhibitor and it and as we've said before inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and what does that mean okay so prostaglandins basically sensitize your self to pain it causes inflammation and fever and it also causes permeability which causes vascular swelling aspirin is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the stomach and the small intestine it is widely distributed into most bodily tissues aspirin is known to displace a number of drugs from protein binding sites in the blood it's half-life for a small dose is about two to three hours but at higher doses the half-life can be as long as 15 to 30 hours as at a higher dose aspirin has zero order kinetics because a higher dose only a constant amount can be metabolized per hour aspirin relieves mild to moderate pain such as arthritis headache or toothache it can reduce a fever it has anti-inflammatory effects because it stops prostaglandin synthesis aspirin irreversibly binds to platelets which makes it effective for prevention of an MI or even in the treatment of an ischemic event so if you suspect that somebody's having a heart attack you can have them chew on one full strength tablet and then of course get to the emergency room as soon as possible large doses of aspirin have a Yuriko Sharik effect which means it can increase the elimination of uric acid and this is something that's too high in patients that have gout so uses of aspirin pain fever inflammation and clotting aspirins most frequent side effects are stomach upset nausea vomiting even a gastric bleed at usual therapeutic doses aspirin irreversibly interferes with clotting by reducing the platelet stickiness the time it takes to form a clot is prolonged and each platelet is affected until a new platelet is formed and that's about four to seven days in children with either chickenpox or flu aspirin is associated with Reye's syndrome Reye's syndrome comes with liver and brain toxicity and it could be fatal so we don't usually recommend aspirin use in children the incidence of a true out allergy to aspirin is less than 1% the patients with asthma are more likely to be allergic that could be 5 to 15 percent so an overdose of aspirin can produce harmful effects and even death a patient can have ringing in the ears headache nausea vomiting dizziness dimness of vision hyperthermia meaning they're too hot or an electrolyte imbalance can occur patients our children are actually the primary victims of an accidental poisoning and education of parents regarding potential poisoning and proper storage and chattin using childproof containers has reduced the accidental poisoning and children treatment of aspirin poisoning includes getting rid of the drug in the stomach by inducing vomiting or administering activating charcoaled and and then other symptoms were treated symptomatically with drug interactions between aspirin and warfarin can result in bleeding we're furan we've talked about a little bit is an oral anticoagulant that is highly protein bound to plasma proteins if aspirin is given to a patient taking warfarin it can bump the warfarin from that binding site that increases the anticoagulant effect remember it's the unbound or free drug that has action in addition aspirin affects platelets and makes them less sticky bleeding and hemorrhaging may result from these interactions aspirin can lower the antihypertensive effect of many blood pressure medicines including ACE inhibitors beta blockers thiazide and loop diuretics aspirin has an effect on renal function resulting in water and sodium retention which could also raise blood pressure so usual dose for aspirin 325 milligrams just six hundred and fifty milligrams every four hours for an adult more commonly used for prevention of MI is 81 milligrams of aspirin once daily aspirin can be combined with buffers and that is said to reduce gastrointestinal effects it can also be combined with oxycodone which is a narcotic that product is called Percodan and ideally you're using less narcotic and less aspirin and getting better effectiveness than either what alone other examples of combinations is furin all and that consists of aspirin you tablet all and caffeine sometimes it's with or without codeine and again you get more analgesia from the combinations than you would any of those products alone with hopefully fewer side effects so quick question the incidence of a true aspirin allergy is C less than 1% so let's switch gears and talk about non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs a lot of times we just say NSAIDs and said so are a large group that are used frequently over the counter and by prescription their mechanism of action and many of their pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions are similar to aspirin they are analgesics antipyretics and anti-inflammatories the kinetics most of them peak within an hour or two hours food might reduce the rate of absorption but we oftentimes will suggest that patients take them with food to reduce stomach upset they can also take them without acids if they are already having stomach trouble and seds are metabolized in the liver and excreted in the kidneys gastric irritation pain bleeding problems can occur with all NSAIDs they interfere with the normal protective mechanisms in the stomach and this results in these GI symptoms they can even cause an ulcer the central nervous system side effects are dose dependent and they can include sedation dizziness confusion and sense interfere with clotting but not as long as aspirin and they are harmful to the kidneys in high doses these agents are not addicting tolerance does not develop and patients don't develop any kind of withdrawal symptoms if they stop taking them NSAIDs like aspirin have been shown to reduce the effects of agents used for high blood pressure they can also interact with lithium remember sometimes patients take lithium for bipolar disorders and SEDs may increase the effect of digoxin digoxin is used for congestive heart failure it's a drug that has a fairly narrow therapeutic window and there are other drug drug interactions with NSAIDs so before patients are given an NSAID we should check and make sure that we're not creating a problem for them instead should be given cautiously to patients with asthma cardiovascular or renal diseases especially if they have fluid retention also patients with coagulation problems or peptic ulcers or ulcerative colitis we really need to think about if NSAIDs are an appropriate medicine all NSAIDs can increase the risk of a serious cardiovascular clotting event like an MI or a stroke and all NSAIDs may increase the risk of a serious GI event including bleeding so NSAIDs are useful in treating pain but it's always a good idea to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time here are some common and said so these are the ones that I want you to be able to recognize brand and generic name ibuprofen is known as motrin or Advil naproxen is Naprosyn a leave would be the over-the-counter name in de Matheson is indocin diclofenac is voltaren a total ACK is loading Nambu tone is relevant meloxicam is mobic and oxytocin is de pro there's a lot more NSAIDs that are on the market these aren't as we used so I don't know that you should spend as much time memorizing these brand and generic names so let's start with talking about ibuprofen it's the oldest member of the NSAID family and we have the most clinical experience with this product usual dose 200 to 800 milligrams every four to six hours as needed generally NSAIDs are not used in pregnancy especially after 30 weeks of gestation naproxen known as Naprosyn or a leaf these have a slightly longer half-life than ibuprofen so these can be administered on an 8 to 12 hour schedule which can be more convenient for a patient the pharmacologic effects the adverse reactions are all similar to to ibuprofen so quick question which of the following statements is true the answer is d and seds have caused renal failure so let's talk about cox-2 inhibitors and says action is on the cox-1 receptor and it's the cause of many of their side-effects but not their therapeutic effects so companies developed a more specific agents that target that talk the cox-2 receptor cox-2 inhibitors work as well as NSAIDs but they have fewer side-effects celebrex is touted to be easier on the stomach it's usually dosed 200 milligrams once or twice daily there's mixed evidence that links celebrex or celecoxib with an increased likelihood of a heart attack compared to placebo but other drugs in that class like Vioxx and Bextra were pulled from the market because they were shown to cause an increased risk of cardiovascular death so quick question and said stands for B non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs so let's switch gears and talk about acetaminophen or generic Tylenol acetaminophen has used this in analgesic and antipyretic in children and in adults its potency is about the same as aspirin and it's about equally efficacious it is however not an anti-inflammatory and it does not bind to plate mints platelets and doesn't cause bleeding liyan completely absorbed from the GI tract it gets to a peak plasma levels in about an hour one to three hours it's metabolized in the liver and excreted and the kidneys and it's half-life is about one to four hours with large doses there's a metabolite that's thought to be hepatotoxic adverse reactions a single injection of 12 grams of acetaminophen is considered to be a toxic dose and can pose a high risk for liver damage alcoholics are patients who ingest three or more alcoholic beverages should avoid taking acetaminophen drug interactions the cool thing about a sentiment ofin is it's remarkably free of drug interactions at usual doses and again it's used as an analgesic and antipyretic it's available in all sorts of products that's the difficulty sometimes as people don't recognize that them sentiment ofin can be given in lots of different ways so quick question which of the following choices has anti-inflammatory antipyretic analgesic and antipyretic ssin the answer would be C aspirin another question which of the following choices is the best to use in pediatric patients for both its analgesic and antipyretic action that would be B acetaminophen an acute overdose of a sentiment ofin may damage the B liver let's have a brief discussion about gout gout usually occurs in men and it usually involves pain in a joint oftentimes it's the big toe or knee it's caused by an excessive level of uric acid and it might be related to a person's diet or it could just be their got bad genetics so we treat gout generally with colchicine a new way of treating gout now is that we give them to 0.6 milligram tablets followed by one one hour later we used to dose it more aggressively until a patient had diarrhea or bad side effects and we're finding that that's just causing too much toxicity the acute attacks also are treated with NSAIDs and are commonly used and said to treat gout is indomethacin the brand name was innocent if a patient is put on a medicine to prevent a gout flare up they could be put on Provenza SCID or allopurinol so just as a background things you can do to reduce your chances of getting gelt exercises is obviously and good for lots of things eating a healthy diet and keeping yourself well hydrated last quick question which of the following agents is used to treat an acute attack of gout and that would be indocin and colchicine thank you for listening and we'll see each other soon", "NrxuY5hXyvo": "hello guys welcome back to pharmacy made easy today we are going through some calculations related to our pharmacy field this will be helpful for both theory exams as well as for various competitive exams like DHA a moistu exit ramp because for my DHA exam about 20 to 25 percentage of the questions were from this calculation part so when we are going through a calculation or problem we should handle it very carefully because in some cases the question may looks like very long like a paragraph a long paragraph but we can reach the end so very easily so it is very important to go through the question or read the full question carefully not only the question but also the options we have to consider the option because in case of multiple choice questions there will be four or five options will be provided in some cases we can choose the correct answer from that options by using some probabilities and I think it is very easy to score the marks from calculation part if we study and practice properly in today's video we can go through some pharmaceutical calculations and we can learn together so here we start now let's see the first question 5 ml of injection hair concentration point for person dish calculate the amount of drug option 8.2 million option B 2 milligram option C 200 milligram option Dame 2,000 milligram an option e 20 milligram when we are seeing such a question we have to about the unit like if the questions may be in gram and we're out of the fine we have to find out the answer in milligram so there are some conversions so we have to consider that thing when we are answering such questions other ways by some points or in conversion if just one mistake can cause the loss of your marks okay so please remember the conversion of kilogram milligram into gram like that so here we can see the and so so before that once again I'm reading the question 5 ml of injection he'll concentration point 4 percentage calculate the amount of drug so here the percentage is point 5 percentage concentration so point five percentage concentration means point 5 4 in for gram in 100 ml so point 4 percentage means 0.4 gram 100 ml of solution so in 100 ml solution in hundred ml solution there is point 4 gram so we have to find out in 5 ml of the solution how much drug is present so point 4 gram thread will be present in 100 ml solution and we can assume X gram of drug will be the in 5 ml of solution so the value of x can be found out by cross multiplication X will be equal to 5 into 0.4 divided by 100 and the answer is point zero 2 gram but if we see the options the options are all in milligram so as I said earlier we have to convert graph into milligram for that we have to multiply the and so which is in Graham with thousand so point zero to Graham in two thousand so that will be equal to 20 milligram so that's why I cert you have to very conscious about the units that's given in the question and also in the option if it is not the same you have to convert here the answer is 20 milligram so 100 ml solution contain point 4 gram drug so 5 ml solution contain 20 milligram of drug so 5 ml of the injection that concentration point for percentage so calculate the amount of drug and the option is option correct option is option e that is 20 milligram now let's see the second question drug amina filling which contain 80 percentage t of filling in 500 ml solution he'll half-life of six hours find out the concentration of theophylline outer one day option a five person dish option B 10 person dish option C 2.5 percentage option D 12.5 person dish so from the question we can find out main points like Amina fill in contain 80% HT of filling and it's constant it's half-life is six hours so we have to find out the concentration of T or feeling after one day so one day means 24 hours okay so half-life is 6 hours we have to find out the concentration after 24 hours so T half of Amina Fellini's 6 hours so as I said earlier one day means 24 hours so that will be equal to 4 half lives of T or filling okay so the first the o'phelan concentration is 80 percentage so half-life means it's the time taken for reducing its concentration to half of its initial concentration so after one day there will be 4 half lives so after first half life 80 percentage will be convert or reduce into 40 percentage and after second half-life 40 percentage will be reduced to 20 percentage after third half-life this 20 person dish will be reduced to it's half that is 10 person dish and after four half-life that means after 24 hours that's after one day that theophylline concentration will reduce to 5 person dish that is half of 10 percentage that is 5 percentage so after 1 day that is 24 hours or for half-life the concentration of your filling will be 5 percentage so here the question drug amina filling which contain 80% HT orphanage in 500 ml solution half-life of 6 hours what is the concentration of the or feeling after one day so the option is option correct option option a 5 percentage I hope this first this was clear for you and if you have any doubts please come and it below it's all about the second question so now let's move to our third calculation direct air taken IV and hundred be taken orally the AUC area under curve of direct air is equal to 300 and a you see of B is equal to 225 what is the bioavailability of the dress option 885 person dish option beam 90 percentage option see 75 percentage and option D 80 percentage so from the question it's clear that drag air taken ie and it's ad area under car or a UC is 300 and drug be taken orally and it is and it's a UC is 225 so we have to find out the bioavailability so there is an equation to find out the bioavailability bioavailability is equal to UC oral divided by AUC IV in 200 here the AUC oral that is of drug B is 225 and a UC of drug abuse taken by IV that is equal to 300 so a UC oral by AUC IV in 200 that is equal to 225 divided by 300 in 200 and the answer is seventy-five percentage so here you have to remember the equation bioavailability 's equal to a UC or L divided by AUC IV in 200 so here the correct answer is option C 75 percentage so that's about third question now let's see the fourth question a patient takes leave of locks are seen to 50 milligram per ml the pharmacist helped levofloxacin injection 500 milligram per 20 ml the concentration needs to be dilated for patient which of the following concentration is more accurate option a 10 ml option beam 15 ml option C 7.5 ml and option D 5 ml so patient have to take levofloxacin to a 50 milligram ml and pharmacists have the injection of liver fluxes in which contain 500 milligram per 20 ml injection so we have to find out the concentration which is more accurate for dilution okay so from the question 500 milligram present in 20 ml of injection so we need or the patient need to 50 milligram Drake so the pharmacist to have 500 milligram in 20 ml injection so the patient need to 50 milligram so that will be present in X ml of injection so like the first question here also we can apply the principle of cross multiplication the value of x can be find out by cross multiplying 250 into 20 divided by 500 which is C equal to 10 ml so here the correct option is option a 10 ml now let's see the fifth question patient takes those 20 milligram per kilogram per day what is the dose if patient waits 60-pound option a 675 milligram per day option B 545 milligram per day option C 120 milligram per day and option D for 80 milligram per day so here the patient takes his dose is 20 milligram per kilogram per day so the question is if the patient base 60-pound so then what will be the dose so here the dose first it is given per kilogram but we have to find found out 460 pounds so he we have to convert pound and kilogram okay so 1 kilogram is equal to 2 point 2 pound Oh Elvie so this point you should remember that one kilogram is equal to two point two pound so 20 milligram drag is present in one kilogram okay so that is present in 2.2 pounds because one kilogram is equal to two point two pound so 20 milligram dragon 2.2 pound weight pill weight pill in a patient so X milligram drug will be present in 60 pounds so 20 milligram drug in 2.2 pound and X milligram dragon 60 lb and the answer can be found out by simple cross multiplication X will be equal to 60 into 20 divided by 2 point 2 and the answer will be five forty five point four five milligram per day and the options are all milligram and the question was also in milligram so much more conversion is not required only one conversion is we have to convert the kilogram into pound and for that one kilogram is equal to two point two pound you have to memorize that point okay so here the option is correct option is option B 545 milligram per day now coming to the sixth question how many gram of water add her to five percentage potassium chlorate solution to make 180 gram of solution in weight in weight option a 170 gram 171 gram option B 180 gram option C 185 gram and option name 250 gram so we have to find out the quantity of water to be added to this kcl solution that is 5 percentage kcl solution to make 180 gram of solution okay so five percentage kcl solution that means fire ground ceylon hundred gram mortar so X gram KCl will be present in 180 gram because we have to find out how much quantity is present in 180 gram solution so Fight Club KC Ellen hundred gram water so X gram KCl in 180 gram bottom so X will be equal to 5 into 180 divided by hundred here also simple cross multiplication so the answer will be 9 gram but the heat but here the question is how many gram of water to be added to make 180 gram so here this nyan gram means Niagara KCl in but us or Niagara port Asim chloride in 180 gram water we have to found out how many water to be added for that we have to subtract this nan from the total quantity that is 180 so the answer will be 180 minus snail that will be equal to 170 one gram water to be added to make 180 gram solution so as I said before we have to read the question very thoroughly because it's very important otherwise you will make a lot of mistakes and if we understood the question very easily it's very easy to score so here the option correct option is option a 170 1 gram of solution or water is required to make 180 gram of solution now let's see the seventh question prescription for a child contain omeprazole syrup 10 milligram per ml twice daily for awake you have omeprazole capsule 20 milligram in your pharmacy how many capsules are needed to prepare solution with concentration 2 milligram per ml option 8 and gap suit option b12 capsule of option C 7 capsule and option D 20 capsule so the child will curl or the prescription can be no me soeul syrup with nose 10 milligram per ml twice daily for a week so in a week the child have to take twice daily 10 milligram per ml okay so one day the dose will be 10 into 2 times that's equal to 20 milligram per daily so this has to be continued for a week so in a week there are seven days so one day 20 milligram for one week 20 into seven that's equal to 140 milligram drug required for one week and in the pharmacy there is Oh me Prasad capsule 20 milligram is available okay so in one capsule 20 milligram drug is present so what we require is 140 milligram dreck so for 140 milligram drug we can assume X capsule is required so like earlier problems here also we can apply the basic symbol principle of cross multiplication so X will be equal to 140 into 1 divided by 20 that is equal to 7 capsules okay so as I said before this question is little bit big but the answer is very easy to find out because we have to calculate the total dose required for a week and then we have to calculate how much capsule is required to fulfill that dose so if 1 capsule conduct 20 milligram we need X capsule for 140 milligram of drug so X will be equal to 140 divided by 20 that's equal to 7 capsule that is why I cert you have to go through the questions very thoroughly so here the option or correct answer is option C seven capsules now question number eight man with 40 years of age and 80 kilogram mate help serum creatinine level of 0.5 milligram per deciliter find out creatinine clearance in milligram per ml option 8 to 22 option B to 32 option C 189 and option name 214 so we have to find out the creatinine clearance level so there is an equation for finding out the clear creatinine clearance and the equation is different for male and female so here the question is about a man with 40 years of age with 80 kilogram weight and Sarat increase Arum creatinine level 0.5 milligram per deciliter okay so the creatinine clearance of male can be calculated by using the equation 140 minus H into weight divided by 7g to induce serum creatinine level so once again I'll sing the equation creatinine clearance for male is equal to 140 minus H into weight divided by 72 into serum creatinine level so here the age is 40 years wait 80 kilogram and surround creatinine level point five so creatinine clearance will be equal to we can substitute the values 140 minus 14 do 80 divided by 72 into point five so the answer will be 222 okay and if the question here the question is about a male patient but in case of female patient the creatinine clearance values can be calculated by the same equation which is multiplied with a specific value point eight five so equation for female in case of female the creatinine clearance is equal to 140 minus a Jindo weight divided by 72 window serum creatinine into 0.85 so in this case the creatinine clearance for male is 222 so if the question were about female we have to multiply it with 0.85 so 222 in the point 8 5 that is equal to 180 eight point seven that would be the answer in case of a female so we have to check the questions whether it is regarding male or female and we have to substitute the values of age weight and serum creatine in the equation so you you have to study or memorize the equations thoroughly okay so here the correct answer is option name 222 and now nine question 15 gram of drug is added in 150 gram of a solvent then what is the total concentration of drag in the final mixture option a six point zero one person dish option B nine point one zero percentage option C ten percentage and option D 15 percentage so here we are adding 15 gram of drag into 150 gram of solvent so the final mixture will contain 15 gram dreck plus 150 gram solvent so the total quantity will be 165 gram okay so 15 gram drug will be present in total 165 gram so X gram drug will be present in hundred gram mixture because we have to find out that in or the answer in person - so here we can see 15 gram in 165 gram so the percentage of the drug will be 15 divided by 165 and in order to convert into percentage in 200 so the answer will be 15 divided by 165 in 200 that's equal to nine point one zero person dish so here the correct option is option B Nan's point one zero personage now let's see the last question how Graham of substance X must be added to two thousand gram of ten personal substance X Ellucian in order to prepare 25 percentage of substance X solution option 8,000 gram 10,000 gram option B 400 gram option C 40 gram option D 10 gram and option e point 4 gram ok so we have to find out the quantity of X which should be added to 2000 gram of 10 percentage of substance X in order to obtain 25 percentage of substance X so here we have to use one equation so here we are using the equation y m1 v1 plus m2 v2 is equal to M into V so m1 it is the quantity of dragon first solution we even quality of dragon even the person dish of drag or the volume of dragon over volume of them that total compound for example X substance so that will be 100 percentage pure so 100 percentage of X and that must be added to m2 that is 2000 gram of 10 percentage substance so here m2 is 2000 and v2 is 10 percentage in order to make 25 percentage of substance 6 solution so the final mixture means here we are using X gram of substance X so that X plus we are adding that to 2000 gram so the final total mass of the final mixture will be X plus 2000 into 25 percentage so once again v1 plus m2 v2 is equal to M min do beam so here the first mixture that is thought of the pure dress so we don't know the quantity we have to find out the quantity of substance X and so the young one will be we can assume it as a term like X and the v1 the volume of the percentages it's pure so it's a hundred percentage so X in two hundred percent a X gram in two hundred percentage plus two thousand gram of 10 percentage that is the second mixture so two thousand graph in do 10 percentage that will be equal to 25 percentage of total solution so that total solution content direct + solvent okay so X plus two thousand gram into 25 percentage so here 100x plus two thousand into 10 that's equal to 20 thousand so 100x plus twenty thousand is equal to 25 into mm that is 50 thousand plus 25 into X that is equal to 25 X once again 100 X plus twenty thousand is equal to 50 thousand + 25 X so we can just change the teams that means we can take together the terms containing X into one side so 100 X minus 25 X is equal to 50 thousand minus twenty thousand 75 X is equal to 30 thousand and the value of x is equal to 30 thousand divided by 75 that is equal to 400 gram so in this kind of questions we have to use the equation y m1 v1 plus m2 v2 is equal to Y M into C okay so here the basic principle is that final mixture it is a add or addition of two mixtures okay so the adding the pure drug +10 percentage of the drug solution so both this together make 25 percentage of substance X solution so we had to add the equation y m1 v1 plus m2 v2 is equal to young Reid okay in some cases the equations may be like M 1 C 1 plus M 2 C 2 is equal to e MC here also the terms are equally similar so by substituting the terms we can find out the concentration of drug ok so this is an easy question by substituting we can find out the answer here the option is correct option is option B 400 gram ok so one thing I want to say you have to study this question repeat early again and again in order to understand it thoroughly so you have to practice very well or study very well ok so this is all about today's presentation and I think it was an easy session for you and this calculation part is a major part in both theory and as well as some objective types of examinations mainly like this DHN Prometric kind of examinations and also in G Patterson and this calculations are very simple if you practice well if you practice the previous questions that will make you easy to answer all questions very easily and this will help you to score much much much more walk marks than your theory of theory topics so I hope it was an easy session and if you have any doubts or suggestion you can come and it below now this is the revision time so there are some questions for you please go through these questions and answer the correct questions in the comment box given below ok so we let see the questions one by one first question an elixir content point 1 milligram of breath X per ml how many microgram are there in one teaspoon of the elixir option a point zero zero zero five microgram option beam 0.5 microgram option C 500 microgram option B Phi microgram and option e thousand five hundred microgram so I cert in first question itself that you have to conscious or aware about the unit that's given in the question and also in answer accordingly you have to find out the answer the second question patient with prescription of captopril 50 lick milligram per tap with a dose of 100 milligram daily for four days and you only have the 25 milligram tab how many tablets you will dispense option a 16 tab option B to Anita option C 8 tab an option it can tab so we have seen a similar question before so accordingly you have to answer this question so this question also so this is a revision portion and you have to answer it and comment the answer in the comment box okay and if there is any doubt you can comment it and we can discuss it in detail now the third question ten gram of drug was dissolved in 150 gram of solvent what is the final concentration option fi person dish option B 9.1 percentage option C twelve point six five percentage and option D six point two five percentage okay so this is what about or this is all about the revision questions I gave only three questions please go through this question and if there is any doubt please give or please comment it in the comment box and if there is any suggestions also you can discuss it with me okay so let's see with another video in pharmacy made easy and thank you so much for watching my channel and if you like this channel do like shy and subscribe thank you", "HLSejK469YU": "[Music] you show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking our third look at a tincture product today and our second one from the folks at yummy karma today we are taking a look at their mood magic 240 milligrams tincture here and as you can see I picked this up at my dispensary for 25 bones which is a really good price for a 240 ml of gram a tincture although it is a little bit more expensive than their drift away tincture their 300 milligram er which I've seen as low as twenty dollars now this one here is designed for as it says on their website and is designed for menstrual cramps and menstrual pain which it is my time of the month I'm feeling a little bloated a little sore a little cramped so I'm really hoping that this mood magic relieves my menstrual pain and cramping I'll be sure to let you know for sure so uh what we're gonna do here what we've done for our previous tinctures is I'm gonna do about the same amount that I did with the original tinker the drift away I'm gonna try to do about a hundred milligrams and they say that one full dropper is about eight milligrams of THC so I'm going to try to do about 12 ish in total I'll do a couple here on camera just to kind of let you know how it tastes how it feels all that good stuff and then I'll come back to you guys two hours later to let you know how this mood magic is landing so if you hadn't tuned in to my first yummy karma review where we did the drift away the one that helps you fall asleep I was surprised by several things from the yummy karma folks whoops oh the dropper is not in there to start with oh it's a different kind of bottle than the other one so there were a couple things that I was surprised by one was how affordable it was tincture is usually quite expensive and this is quite affordable in two I was by how inoffensive it tasted this one does say I as I had assumed that it is a coconut oil base I assumed the last one was as well tasted vaguely of coconut so I was very surprised at how awful it tasted so if we can figure out how to get this little wrapper off we'd be in business and we would start the review proper let's see what we have to do here with the teeth that looks like that was the trick okay childproof lid mood magic package genes nice packaging is fine like it like the bottle everything's it's got all the directions that you need on there this one is actually packaged a little bit better the other one the other one was just a pure bottle there was no stunning wrapper on the outside it was much harder to read I think it was printed right on the bottle as opposed to in a wrapper so this is a lot easier to read a lot easier to get the information from and I like it quite a bit so let's open this childproof lid here smells fruity and coconutty and let's get ourselves a dropper so here is the liquid it looks cutter Li putrid it's green gross vile looking stuff but it really doesn't taste that bad if it tastes like the drift away so the way we take our tincture is sublingually which means under the tongue we leave it there for about 30 seconds I do a couple of drops at a time leave it there for about 30 seconds and then come back to you guys and I'll let you know how it tastes and all that fun stuff so here we go all right accusing our Brewer air yeah Bob not bad that is even a more neutral taste than the other one even a less coconut base it almost tastes like nothing at all I don't feel like I've done a gag or nothing nothing I it's it's it's really it's really quite wonderful I mean it doesn't taste wonderful but it's just it's kind of magic how moon magic even how I'm neutral that tastes well guys I have about three I have to do another two of those and buy two of those I mean to not just droppers but another two mouthfuls and then I will not gonna do that all on camera because it'll just be boring but I will do another eight drops and then I will come back to you guys in two ish hours or so let you know how long it's been and give you my thoughts once I'm nice and high so guys I'll see you in just a bit thanks for watching wheats see you soon all my menstrual cramps pains and discomforts disappeared thanks mood magic well guys I can't really speak to that aspect of the mood magic product I can speak to the aspect of does it still get you high and the answer is yes this guy is high um I'm probably at like six and a half and climbing it's actually a little bit early coming into you guys I'm coming at you guys really only about an hour and 15 minutes in but I have some things to do and I can feel it escalating and that's with about the same amount of tincture that I took roughly equivalent to the drift away I might not feel as high just yet but I am taking a little bit earlier and this is 50 milligrams less than the drift away but I'm still gonna recommend it I still think this is a great product I still think as far as tinctures go this is the best how Hugh bar in a way that's out there for tinctures except looking at you house brand tincture that is the worst value and tincture even though it should be the best its advertises at the best but it's the worst value see rambling usually pretty good sign that I'm high so yes I really like this an another winner from Yummie Carmen they're really starting to grow on me have like their popcorn and I've liked their tinctures I'm starting to really root for these guys the yummy karma mood magic 240 milligram THC tincture another winner from them and guys before I balance here on this review I want to share with you a little cherry on top something that's not necessarily weed relator something that could be enjoyed with or without weed but just something that I love that I want to share with you guys so in another life and this is a great for possible cherry on top of it cherry on top sin the future and another life I was an avid avid board gamer I had hundreds of board games and a collection loved it played them every weekend obsessed over them I I have not played board games in a very long time well in several years I've kind of quit that hobby cold turkey but there are some games that I would love to recommend to you guys the first one I'm going to recommend is so simple you can learn this game in literally I think the the rules come on like less than an index card sized piece of paper you can learn it in 30 seconds but I have probably played this card game called no thanks exclamation mark sorry a little indigestion there so again the name is no thanks it is a very quick card game played with some poker chips cards numbered by fate 3 to 35 or something like that and a bunch of poker chips and it is a super fun game that you can play with 3 to 7 players takes about 15 minutes to play and as I said about 30 seconds to explain I'm not even gonna bother to explain it here you can pick it up for $11 on Amazon that is a perfect game to play you know when you've got friends over when you got family over when you're going on vacation wherever the case may be it plays great with 3 it plays great with 7 and as I said it's 11 bucks on Amazon you have no excuse for picking it up if you have any inclination towards playing board or card games or anything like again that is no thanks exclamation mark on Amazon 11 bucks pick it up you'll thank me later and that guy's is gonna do it for this cherry on top and for this review here on weeds I appreciate you guys watching as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "Oh6ZjJti7d0": "all right hey guys today I'm making a video on how to get up to 625 energy with upcoming fetch it will be 631 right now I'm at 571 but these numbers are very attainable so I'm

each one costs five energy world chat server chat not will chat well yeah yeah every time you type in there you spend energy to talk you can reset boss knowledge and caffeine on that costs energy came running home over there with which energy energy pots do this yeah you can get combat buff from the black spirit its cost energy faint bargaining you know when you go to the training manager when you're ready to turn things in you can yeah keep spending energy to bargain with them and getting even even better price for your items you can use the in to find a player looking for on this very specific server pull the server there on is the one in every giant town pretty much this is the one for velia you spend energy five energy required altered blood new mechanic in the game pass each each level we have to spend like and then 50 so on her level and night vendor that fits the energy for this guy not very viable at the moment but considering the prices of like some items like a very balanced of Indian cheese and how that peeler so much the only ones are that are selling the really expensive tats and pens and stuff like that this is very viable happens a pop said he's available to do the night vendor 8-10 p.m. up to 7 a.m. I think well yeah fit the energy each you can park all your alts wherever you live next to the night vendor do that nice hope you get lucky and stuff like that but yeah those are pretty much the main uses of energy so I'm gonna go ahead and start explaining how to get more ecology and energy cuz ecology ties into ecology ties into energy so um oh I forgot to mention you also get special Fame so it helps your daily income so the first thing I'm gonna be explaining is your ecology right here you can see I have eight thousand nine hundred and eighty to eight thousand you can stop but I decided to keep going in case that is more just because I was bored but let's see what I wrote here yeah drop rates important because you like most people in this game if you do lot of grinding you want to get the most out of your grind before using item drop schools comment blessing but you get this permanent effect from having more ecology that's the item drop rate and you increase this by killing monsters and grinding area or just beats you find out wild and getting a stirring some you can get C ranks on them but you don't want to do that notice you get ten points for great s here and one point for Big C so plus S rank gives their drop chance increased compared to all the other rings like C I think that just allows you to see health they'll keep that in mind alright so I'm now going to show you how I go about getting us drinks and like what I think about what I think about when I enter a spot but before I get to that area I'm gonna tell you all the items you need before you get started keep in mind there's two sections of items one section is for the whole grinding and getting a straight process the second section will be more revolving around discovery nose and enmity so let's just jump into it I already have some the items ready for me as you can see I didn't really want to get fully prepared and empty out my inventory because I got too much [ __ ] and I just don't feel like a movie in it so I'm gonna just go over the list I got one of the big ones already have in here I don't think I have it let's see if I do yep it's right here so I move it all right here energies in chrono meal this gives chance to gain knowledge and a chance to gain arcane knowledge I'll just explain those right now so let's say you start a new game they kind of introduce it to you you go in I think you kill weasel you get C rank on it or something higher if you're lucky so pretty much what this what the difference is between gauge and all this chance and gain higher knowledge the chance is if you don't have a knowledge see up to us right on a monster and your chances of killing it in the game I mean your chances of getting a knowledge rank on it there are far easier than it is too high already having a knowledge rank and leveling that up so in this case it would be far easier for me to kill a weasel and get C rank instead of me going up to the weasel already have C rank on killing it to get beavering far more easy so just always keep that on your back in the back of your mind and I'll explain this more later when it comes to like the BD knowledge bias on the client and then stuff so yeah i'ma continue going over the items you need so that the first one energizing c'mon meal so that gives +10 knowledge gain and chance for higher grade knowledge 5% the next items we got I think I got on my storage yeah yeah I do my enter back and again so you got the surging weenie clicksor this one gives an all this chance +10 for eight minutes so you're gonna want to pack a lot of these oh you got reliable loon elixir chance to gain higher gain knowledge +5 eyes again last eight minutes you're gonna pack a lot of these you also don't have to use the blue ones but I suggest you do silver embroider to close uh yeah um when it comes to some of the monsters in this game not all the mobs can be gathered I'm sure you know that you're more adept in the game let's see where died where is it that's right but some of the I'm gonna just use beasts of us as an example some of these mobs can be gathered like stone back a perfect example oh if you don't happen to get the knowledge when you kill it there's still hope if you the monster or whatever the holidays can be gathered monster a beast I don't care there's a lot of them you can use for example on stove bat crab you can use a pickaxe so or you can use blue collectors you can use you can't use stern items on all the moms just keep in mind like stone bat crap can't be used you can use a pickaxe but other ones like a like a fox you can only use like a butcher's keep that in mind so let's keep going on so yeah them I have right here listed a fluid collector and pickaxe but I'm not a hundred percent sure on all the like equipment you mean like the side equipment so I suggest just buying like like I can tell you there's no [ __ ] cheesy out to get but feel free to get a food collector you can get a cheap one you can get a butcher knife pickaxe I'm not sure if you need a hole you can get a tan knife so I suggest getting like all these except the lumber and acts pretty sure you don't need a whole but yeah in this case Oh grab I just grabbed one of all these I'll gladly just subscribe these magics for the sake of the video since Manos came out these are all just pretty sure you don't need it all right so we got all what is it Wow how could I not see that all right all right so after that um match luck yeah there's some mobs in this game you only can get knowledge from so I suggested throwing them at my knowledge using a matchlock so up like I suggest bringing it along with you along on the ride this there's one and let me find the match lock okay I'm just gonna set that all the way at the bottom um there is a mob over here in late kya it's the jellyfish and the water Strider there's also another mob up here in Canada is the throw you only can use match locks on these features and I'm not too sure about the throw but yeah just keep in mind some mobs you if you're having no luck at all you probably have to use a match flock but keep in mind it's not a lot of them it's just like kya and maybe the CRO of all the others I don't remember there might be some Muncie mobs but from what I remember the ones in common Silvia you can kill anyways with your weapon and lose some karma but you eventually get though all right let's go back to what was there so right now I must um I forgot to mention I'm explaining all the games the items you can get for free in game so this one's also in the list cuz if you played long enough you got this item for free so I'm talking about the event glasses box I don't know how many hours you need it but you can pretty much get a free pair of glasses oops a lot keep that in mind other things I can help you do in this is the guild buff this I don't have it yet and my guild but it is considered free where is it right I saw the scholar the ambition is +10 gain knowledge since last for 60 minutes that's pretty good Nestle you have to talk to GM or if your gym like me just go out and use it and knowledge books there's a bookshelves I'm not gonna get into it too much because I heard they're like kind of glitchy yeah like these will help you get knowledge people have orders on them but yeah if you get lucky you might get one of these you can go watch another video on these things but pretty much you just Park it all on it and come back a later a day later and they have a knowledge game I haven't tested it out to see if it fills out like what I don't have left and a certain region I don't plan to but keep that in mind so I'm gonna explain three more items earrings you can buy these on the pearl shop these are probably the most important items all these three and by the list the first one evenings up you can find it under a pillow so accessory notice if I go to all the earrings duh like this ear cuff gain a chance to gain higher grade knowledge plus five percent five percent might not seem like a big deal it is it is trust me and then you got the earrings and then we get the glasses chance to gain knowledge plus a 10% that's probably the biggest thing on any knowledge so yeah that's huge so if you can afford that both these are like what 10 bucks yeah yeah but the most expensive one I was most apparent and as well are the pets I suggest new players whenever they start to get the knowledge pets because it will help them the most later down the road and they it will stack I suggest getting all the birds as you can see here in Multan majority of them except like some of them like the griffon give knowledge like the caring in carmell done al you got the scarlet macaw you got the crow you got the rose Finch you got the sky Hawk the brown this one Brown got at home like all those you want to make sure you get these two number ones at the bottom once they cost around thousand and one hundred on this video but all these give knowledge let me just show you like how good they are so small thing I do too is like how I separate my tears usually people have the first ones set for the highest here on pets I just have it on my knowledge illness because I usually don't grind and I have my life skill set to two so if you have one specific for grinding like if you ready have some tea for so you can set them all to the first flag you can have all your knowledge pets set to the number two and then all your life skill pets sets of the number three so I just put this as you can see I've gained knowledge knowledge gained chance plus seventy and higher grade knowledge chance plus 14 all my knowledge pets are tier drinks at micro but as you can see this is this is insane amount of knowledge I'll gain chance it's awesome alright so upgrading them I suggest even though pets are expensive I if you really want to speed this process up i really suggest getting this whispered gossipy and like mashing it with your own you're one of your birds and getting them all two to three if you want to go up to your 4 that is completely up to you wanna cheer for knowledge pets that's completely up to you I got plus eight thousand ecology and almost cap energy by without to your force but yeah just keep that in mind you can also buy the same pet like to scarlet and cause and mastering thereafter the level-10 I'm not sure if having them level 10 pieces or chances and pretty sure it does but I think just to give you a higher chance to get to t3 which I think this pet does I suggest just doing that so that's pretty much it so now we can explain I mean I can explain how to go about killing beasts mobs in certain areas but for an example I'm absolutely gonna delete one of my s drinks dear dad I hope it doesn't take too long to get us back but I'm probably gonna delete my board and Bella knows but for a good example I'm already showing you how to delete something here so this is good so as you can see I have one of my alts parked and coffee on the library to delete knowledge at is over here at the bottom right so I just right-click this woman right here in the ELISA Rosie I'm here so another stocks were so to delete something you go knowledge management open up ecology ecology of Eastern balance I have s rank on all these moms but I'm gonna delete the bore knowledge delete it so as you can see my knowledge went down my energy went down oh well doesn't show on this character but what kind of does but all my alts have energy boots that's why I went up to five ninety all right so we're gonna run into the ballast force and we're gonna find this board we gotta get s rank on it hopefully I get like a plus or a to show you how to go about getting a higher gate knowledge I'm also gonna show you one more thing before I jump into it so FK riding there I'm gonna show you video codecs so before I go into explain this whole thing I might just let you know if you have a great knowledge game chance and stuff when you're going into area you don't really want to worry about deleting any type of knowledge Asst while you're there until you have like a majority of it build up a majority is up to you to decide for how much is a majority or not I usually grind out the whole [ __ ] thing sorry I'm not chopping up I usually grind out the whole thing until everything's a a plus or s3 like that's fine with me if I have some C's like 1 C 2 B's or something and the area's not dense there's a lot of things you can think about it it just all depends on you yeah it just all depends on how you want to go about it puts just keep in mind you want to be efficient you don't want to be deleting a lot of knowledge --is where you could have described it like another minute and got it got an a-plus or that's rank really easily because there is dense so keep that in mind uh let's see let's see what is all rights over here usually what I do before I start grinding I go to be do codex this is at least what I did before I got on that energy all right so that's one one so we're doing ecology ecology Eastern balanus and beasts so what I do I just open a tab if I have nothing at all regardless if I have whatever energy any I open all the tabs obviously if you don't have a good computer this isn't gonna really work for you well it will but it might be slows oh I don't know but what I do is I zoomed in like four times it all depends on what you're looking at and as you can see I aligned I'm about to align everything so for this one I'm gonna have black desert that little logo at the top left we got to zoom out a bit so what I'm pretty much doing here I'm aligning all the web pages to match each other so if I flip between them I can just come back no no if I flip between them they'll all be perfectly aligned to the point where you know which area you have to go to and you can make like one for like one full rotation and you don't have to be running back and forth across the whole map all right so you don't have to do this I personally think it helped me a lot at being sane when I was doing all the ice rinks because I felt like our giving example when I'm doing this one you'd have to zoom in on our four but we're just gonna leave it at that so I'm like I didn't one I was afraid if I was like new to the game and I was running through like let's saying I'm in this area I've won and complete this whole area first and go to hydel after Sara India so I didn't want to finish this whole place and end up up here when I'm done grinding all the mobs I'm gonna end up around down here so I kind of organized all the tabs to how I want to start where I want to end so I started north but west he's then south or I started East go north west then go south I probably didn't have to do all these but [ __ ] you all right I'm just gonna pretend like these are all because it's taking a while so as you can see I have all these filled out let's say this is all of Eastern let's just say this is all the beasts of Eastern Domino's and you have all filled out you have them all lines so we're starting over here which ones are closer to these let's just go between them all so it looks like they're all in the forest wolf is actually little here to the east a lot of foxes in the East I'm gonna move that over there a lot of weasels in the east and I forgot about the grass needle loose and we got some grass peals in these so after you can move them quite a bit you find out where do you want to go first looks like there's a lot more foxes and grass beetles there's a lot of easels so I can just like figure out like a small rotation over there and then I'll go over to the yeah I'll do weasels in this general area grass beetles and then I'll do Wolf's and then over here is the forest actually things like this happen stone bat crap very famous in this area so I'm gonna put it over here next to a wolf because after wolf is done I've run over stone bat crap and then I'll head over to the forest and I'll be done with the eastern bank on everything goes south another thing is Esther inks on the easier mobs are very important because you don't want to have like sea ranks here and once c-s ranks and kama sylvia dragon or the let's see cuz those get a lot of a lot harder and you need more gear for that and if you're play you're gonna struggle you you want us ranks on the easier moms because they're easy so yeah you kind of understand like how I go about editing my tabs to like so I can just flip between them so let's say I finished weasel close that out look at this one run over there finish that close that up I'm on grass beetle run over there close that out to all the wolves close that out ice tranq on all those mobs I mentioned over to the stone back grab close that out now I'm on baby boar close that out battles bear I killed all those pulls that out and keep in mind you don't always have to do one at a time if there's some mobs in your rotation just kill all those if your rotation consists or grinding area consists of all the mobs jam-packed into it like the bauhaus force over here don't even look at all the top just kill everything and then get ice rinks eight pluses and then go to the tab over here and just open up which ones you're missing that'll save you a lot of time so yeah we're on the balance board so right here where I'm standing there's one right in front of me if I just move up a little into the woods over here so what I want to do I want to put these down in you might have to gather soon I can butcher him so he found out if you first wore this ring no okay so you can gather it so since we really have it see rank let's go and start gathering it what a perfect example oh my god and my energy went up by +1 so yo you learn that oh now we can move on that was so amazing all right let's all right so now I'm gonna go back to town I'm gonna be explaining the other things but first part going to that I just understand and I already mentioned it the copy on library but it's not always gonna be that easy the easier areas they're easier actually easier to gain knowledge with like that probably was a lot easier than it appears I didn't probably didn't get that lucky because what that area is very easy some of the mobs might be like lay in I don't even have a shrank on that because it takes way too damn long for me and the knowledge gained chance is very low so that's why you want your knowledge very high but there's some areas that are completely dense like and very hard to navigate like one of the mobs out here is some of the Valencia mobs let's say I always go back to this one this No was it this one yeah the demo this mod if you look if you search up the demo look at it spawn locations if you've been to the desert yet this is annoying there's a lot of mobs in this game not too many I'd say like five percent of moms in this game that more like three four that are like this and it's a Navi I think we did a rotation for this it was literally just a camp here with water and start II run up here follow the desert kill this thing over here kill this thing switch servers yeah just keep keep in mind things like that exist and they're tougher there in the desert is even more tougher mom's probably not that hard to navigate with but keep that in mind so i mewn i forgot to say yeah like some on its a very beneficial to switch the copy on and delete their knowledge like the mole if I got C rank I want to keep that I would rather keep deleting the knowledge and attempt to get an A+ or so just think about that um so the next part of this section it made no sense uh I'm gonna be be explaining Amity and getting a compass parts for a free compass you could get to explain the notes on something lovely doing a mini games on and game piece NPCs and look doing quests on the same website where your codex so hmm some of the free items you can get let me go through my story Jovie all right so the first one are a MIDI suit but I use the caffeine on an oval suit let's move that over here oh look serve a MIDI I think actually I think I have those mandatory know what else what else five green chicken porridge I don't have that because I don't need it comp\u00e1s parts little above Pro Causton all right I'll just buy it I'll just show you the I by the compass parts to show even I won't pop it'll already have a compass on me I'll keep these in order started doing all this what am i doing iPod Lou this'll be there we go all right so emiti movie starting off on that so another part of getting we're done but with ecology by the way so you should basically understand how to get that strength so we're moving on to the other three major parts of getting knowledge one of them discovering nodes look at that later ohms Amity so you talk to NPCs and the last ones questing will do enemy since we're ready here so to do Amity you wanna put on your a many clothes you don't really have to put on the enemy clothes but if you run into like a difficult emphasis again any gain Amity on yeah you're gonna want to put them on because yeah that [ __ ] stuff so these em Amity elixirs also don't last long eight minutes keep that in mind there's other items you can use like the pearl costumes and tailored outfits yeah this costume gives the I don't think mine gives him a neat but I guess there are some Thank You Amity yeah keep that in mind so we're gonna have conversation in this guy so when it comes to a midi notice this little knowledge thing I already got it cuz I got him to 500 and I did it a long time ago and I got his knowledge this knowledge age was training its somewhere probably in academics here maybe new if I got lucky maybe in here if I'm lucky I found it so this one age of trading not all of these are done by M and keep that in mind these are probably in the next sections to that I'm not explained but one of them was agent trade only way to get it but is Viking is enmity to 500 so let's say where I I could do that if I get this one [ __ ] if I get cut alright so I decreased a nice I don't have the knowledge Nina but the guards chasing that's just exactly run back so as you can see you have lost a hundred amity but we're gonna get it back to get the knowledge so so as this goes oh I don't really I'm not 100% sure on how this works but all I know is what has been working for me so far is I always look at the sparking interest 70 57 percent this one for example but you always want them at a hundred so you never fail but I'm gonna explain to you why that probably isn't the best idea all the times once it all I had a hundred I look at their favor look at which ones are the highest and which ones the lowest so this one's the lowest up here's a favor it's at 3 out of 10 this guy has a 5 out of 10 so I'm gonna just take her off one thing I do is I memorize everything you could also use the little arrow keys on your keyboard or ad to move so I memorize how what did I what icons that I click before I click them all like was the ideal any log for this character so I go especially they're difficult it's best to memorize which ones you did if they're more difficult so I remember four or five to four whoops this morning sorry so 2 3 2 3 2 3 5 then I like in my head I just think almost the last one so 2 3 2 3 again five almost last one so before you start this you have to there's one big thing you have to focus on - it's up here the requirement usually the requirements just say oh I want you to get a whole bunch and accumulated favor or make sure you have successful sports parking interests go off you'll see how that looks like soon but sometimes there's consecutive failures or I want you to fail this many times those are pretty dumb because you don't get any enmity out of it but if you continue going through the enmity chain those are very important to follow if you want to keep going so hopefully we get something like that so yeah let's just click this see it's good considered that's four good consecutive six good ones that's seven as you see it was like fifty four we reached state 134 so the thing is now you can keep going or you can just take what you got I always keep going to the end I don't care how much energy I'm losing but that could be different if your character you're talking to is way more difficult to do Oh sometimes I stop in the middle or stop on the first one because they're just that difficult so to keep going doesn't cost Center any energy as it mentions right here something keep going so a requirement minimum of 31 so what did I say earlier I said 2 3 2 3 5 and then almost last one notice how I did that helps a lot so the favors going through the favors going through I'm gonna pass now we can keep going you want to take it or do you want to keep going let's keep going and look at that fail the spark interest of Bihar three times so we're not getting a MIDI only maybe for lucky like three times so this is probably gonna suck because I don't have a lot of low ones but this guy has 24% I have a chick with 57 so this I'm probably gonna not pass this but this is like good Oh 19 so I might bet but keep in mind whenever I see fail ones sometimes these go through that 25 that 24% might go through you just want to slam all the bad ones in there it's just you don't so you don't lose that 45 and you work hard on already so I just throw in all the ones that aren't 100% and take out all the ones that like just try to replace and get the lowest roster of em the icons as I possibly can't get so let's see if we get lucky nope good good bad that good oh oh we felt it see if you know meet it you lose all the Amity you work for it but that was a good display of showing you how it works if you don't follow the requirement you don't get the enmity and yeah that happens but if it's really really difficult or you're like a shy away like just a little bit away from what you need you don't want to play the enemy or you just yeah there's uh there's this office option agree huh and I didn't even show you how much you had for 14 so let's screed them again sup man so it should be at 417 now well okay 418 I think out of this yeah I don't know I think it's the Amity thing wow I didn't know the Amity boosted that but yeah you can wave them down some one of the ones I do this a lot for is if you're getting as drinks on sea monsters if you run a saline dailies group or something are you join on or you go to Rossi teleport with no cargo on your boat to room your book if you have four rat discovered uh or any way any way you managed to get out here I usually have all out here there's the marketplace you keep that in mind to drop energy bus and I just waved down all the characters all that pcs here because the majority of them I'd say like 80% are very difficult so to run some anything so I just wave them down like this and then I get the knowledge from them so I've explained a MIDI there's two last things I have to do that's the nodes discovering the node or a new town gives you knowledge and yeah we'll talk about that so if you're traveling the ocean or going in the desert this item is very important parts Rick's forest compass they're probably a little more expensive than all the other items listed to you but if you're in the ocean like traveling out here and you get a got to get a port right you got get these islands there compass will help a lot and if you're in a desert which is probably more important here getting all these notes yeah they're all in the desert so keep that in mind another website I use this is probably the most two websites for this games and video codecs and City London so if I'm in the middle of the desert standing right here with the compass I can see where I am and I look around what's east to me what's west what's north to itself five a compass I know I'm standing I'm like and I still need this a note I'm like okay if I'm standing right here let's just look south I mean oh my god let's look west and go that way that's pretty much it that's pretty much what the compass can do for you another way to help you is you can't afford a compass if you forgot if you have a pet that the text resources like this one you can walk up to like a tumbleweed or pack of bones and sometimes they drop this giant red marker that looks like this and you can use that to navigate in the desert just keep that in mind where you can have a friend party up with you you've got a compass fall there or it could do a lot of things or you can run into Oasis and find out where you are like like this one over here if you walk into this area well that's it you will see your icon then it's funny all right so getting knowledge from all the notes it's very important like you if you discover all notes that's easily 200 energy I think probably more so that includes the ocean note student month Oh last thing we will be talking about are the quests so let's just pick a random question journal so well the adventure journal Goblin let's just pick one that actually that's so let's go to goblin worker on Eastern balanus Journal so you go here adventure journals the eastern bonus journal velia journal oh my god that's terrible what uh all right let's go again let's try again that's much better Goblin worker so so I need this knowledge and I'm on video codecs it's always click obtained from Oh get the hell out of here either look at the prerequisite right now you're looking at the knowledge piece you're not looking at the quest so you open in a new tab why did the goblins run away you probably have us already it's from the start of the game oh this is terrible well I did have to go down to this place so just keep in mind you want to look at the quest complete conditions you wanna the start MP if you look at the full chain and by the way if it's a giant chain like this that pretty much means you can start anywhere or start like one step above it if the chains like let's say half a dozen or a dozen then you probably have to start from the start and then go to the start open and link tab go there and look at the if that quest needs any prequel breakfast is pretty much what be do Kodak's is for what I'm trying to explain it is want to keep going all the way to the start of all these questions to begin because obviously you can't start if you go to a quest you want to do it you don't see it because you haven't gone to that point yet so yeah for this one why did the goblins run away quest complete log you let's just say you can start right here because there's no question this is just listening all the questions oh yeah I think you just go to Santa Ma's knee you talk to them you start the quest and you complete it sometimes there's prerequisites there all this is right here this one's probably this is there's probably like 0.5 percent or 1 percent request have some weird-ass per requisite like this like game time like this is probably perfect example but I'm not gonna get too much into it there's some known ones in Calculon like this or like the powder and bowel nose with the goblins and stuff [ __ ] it's dumb but yeah like don't don't don't look at this I think this is outdated I think you have to be on yeah you just have to do it at in-game time 22 24 so when it's night time in the game around 8 p.m. to 12 p.m. and you have to do within that time yeah yep I have 10 M&E with Santos who's just begin it to accept a quest oh one thing I forgot to mention is to see all your quests check that you're able to see all the bus alright so let's find let's find a better one if I don't find one relatively quick I'll just move on this is fine yeah Treena nights and the baby dragon on cough you know let's see if we get lucky here so always find the piece of knowledge accepted quest baby ever go there so like I said earlier this this isn't a quest line you'll find them when you start doing it this way you'll find one with like a quest line of five and stuff but this quest you just go to the soldier find them right here on the map you do a quest you go to this soldier to finish it I'm pretty sure it's the same guy no it's actually different soldier you can see the other soldiers of little notes at the left you do the quest completion you deliver yeah and you get this knowledge so that's pretty much how you get it yeah so that's pretty much it on video codecs let's see if there's any last things have to do to gain regain energy or gain it all back in a wave some items this website has some good tips oh yeah logging staying logging every three minutes you get one energy if you're laying down on your bed get two weights are you get three logged out and get one energy per hour I think that's on your alts as you can see here I have all my alts they're slowly giving energy just like another one I showed you in Cal feeling kama Sylvie a blessing of karma Sylvie you get more drop rate that's cool you get the energy recovery it's even higher too so keep that in mind stacks with laying down in bed and stuff you can finish some of your daily quests right here reoccurring these gift three energy you can just do this for contribution and gain energy back you could also do that battlefield right here if you enter on velia four go in before the 10-minute marks up before remaining ten minutes I usually enter around 15 or like 16 because people start filling up if there's 60 participants you can't join well if you win one game you have to accept the quest when I'm PC there I'm not gonna get into it up but pretty much you go in the NPC the only one you can talk and that gets you a quest pretty much saying if you win one red battle feel if your team win wins one you get two hundred energy keep in mind at the end of the fight you wanna die so you go to the NPC spawn there's ready to fight go back and even the fights over to accept the quest and get two hundred energy and obviously you don't want to have cap energy to do this because you won't gain you want to have almost none or just two hundred depleted from your main energy pool if you lose five if you don't win at all you can lose five red battlefields and get the same benefit 200 mg so keep that in mind they might have had it on ya know doesn't Marketplace energy yeah you can buy pots high quality wine purchase from cook one or two ana.k internet from nearby for three energy yeah it might be worth sometimes it's the energy pots keep skyrocketing oh you also want plus why movement moving around yeah that's just know just so you do things bastard but to get the extra plus work forty energy on your alts I'd suggest 20 if you don't spend a lot of time on them but if you want to do 40 yeah this is a lot of thing for the video too where is it where there's these boots there's these crystals you can put some herb Q boots or whatever type of gear you want they give 10 energy so you get over to her heels boots right give these boots slap all those crystals in half like 15 of them if you want to do that put them on to your alts if you don't use them or whatever your ones you don't use there's also another one there's a type of food I think I can find it zooming bulls food I think it's all the way at the bottom let me if I don't find it eventually right oh this one frankly poor Skitch [ __ ] Oh or there's another one there's another one that one gives 20 energy I only last for an hour - or how much whatever it tells you it was that one and another one but bug find it I'm probably gonna give up here in a second [Music] yeah gaben there's another one I don't know what's called I forgot what that one gives +20 energy to I think that one's better because it lasts longer well yeah if you have the buff running on your just like item scroll and you're not spending time on it or any type of buff in-game it won't deplete as long as you're not on that character so you're just roaming around like for a couple seconds on that character and you're just standing over here and like I brought up at the start the video in your Alchemist you can turn it in real fast just switch out you can you spent like ten seconds on that character it's really cool and by the way it does if your characters are maxed out like let's say there are 571 if you log in to them they're actually at 591 that makes sense they just don't display how much total energy they have in mind so then the video is done arm screams playing one small thing yeah yeah if you're a sailor oh I forgot to mention that getting any type of no no sorry but yeah if you're a sailor you're gonna want to get your port rat know to level ten because in the sailing community people say that getting it to level ten and average increases the average amount of need in zucchini the ocean as well as I don't keep that in mind but yeah that's a video on how to get up to get capitis just yet I forgot one thing there's also this where's the razor blades where are my toes sit right here titles probably the most annoying thing to do in game to get your energy up I have plus why the cap is +8 energy so I'm missing three off titles keep that in mind self to get but that's pretty much my video on how to get 625 energy how much is the cap right now na as of the 26th of September as eventually it'd be 631 on longer alts with the boots and crystals uh eventually I'll get there one day with my main well yeah if you got this bar hopefully you guys put something from this or learning something and I'll see you at 500 plus energy maybe more than anything else but yeah that's it have a nice one", "S_aReu1aItg": "are you frustrated with skin

WWWE", "-LocmaRLi5M": "I ever wanna hurt you well welcome back to the channel I wanted to do a very quick vlog for you today on making your own and caffeinated hair products this kind of goes alongside an article that I've done on the blog so it might make a bit more sense if you just quickly skip over to the website and have a read but in a nutshell there's trials to show that caffeine increases the speed of hair growth and quality of the hair so on the market actually you've all seen these caffeinated hair products the reason I did this is because during the summer I find my hair grows much quicker and better and then these kind of tails off as we go into autumn and winter what I wanted to do this year is I want to start using caffeinated hair product to see if I can just maintain that growth and thickness of my hair when I looked at these half dated hair products though they've all got really harsh ingredients in there mostly Michelle who is full of sulfates and I'm just not willing to put that on my hair so I thought well why don't I make my own caffeinated hair product that way you have much more control over what you'll put it on your hair and also it's a lot cheaper because a lot of these techniques have what it's all really really expensive so basically that's what I've done it was difficult to find the exact concentration of caffeine in most of the shampoos because I think they're companies obviously keep it quite close to their chest but for researching on the internet I found out that it's only about 2% now you need enough obviously to stimulate the follicles but you don't want to put too much caffeine on your hair because apparently you can get something called follicle insomnia which sounds horrendous but from research I find it was about 2% so that's the whole situation that I'm gonna make another thing to bear in mind when you do this is that for this to work it has to be in contact with your scalp not your actual hair shaft and it has to be in contact with your scalp for about two minutes so this obviously has a influence on what product you're gonna use so some people could use the caffeine a solution in us go out a bottle and then just spread it onto their scalps and leave it for the two minutes some people might want to put it in their deep treatment and leave that one for two minutes personally I chose to use a co-wash to make my definitive product because when I co wash I tend to put that on my scalp but I tend to give it a really good rubbing for at least a couple of minutes my condition I might leave on for longer but it's mainly on the ends of natural hair itself rather on my scalp before September I'm going to be doing this I'm going to be using caffeinated cone wash during the month and I'm going to see if it makes any difference I'd love it if you guys did it as well and let me see your results all you need to buy is the co wash of your choice or the conditioner of your choice or even just a squirt II spray to fill it with the caffeine solution micro wash I chose the super drug conditioner I read online that the super drugs extracts conditioner is curly girl friendly and there I've been like 90 pH or something really cheap so I got this one this one is the green apple and tea tree vishna it smells quite nice actually very fresh now you need a full bottle of product because you need to be able to work out what 2 percent of this is so this is any 400 ml bottle and it's not been used yet so I know that's what's in there second of all you need your caffeine I wouldn't go brewing your own coffee or tea or anything because you don't know exactly how much is in it and generally speaking the amount is immaterial coffee is not enough and you need enough directly on follicles to really get them going hyperactive of crazy and you'll have massive hair caffeine why some people use Pro Plus but Pro Plus tablets are quite a small dose so I managed to find these caffeine tablets online now first of all I don't know who these monsters are who eat 200 milligrams of caffeine and feel the need to supplement their diet with these hardcore caffeine tablets but wherever you are I hope that your palpitations and your excessive sweating in your tremors and doing awesome I'll put all the links to everything in the description please have this for 200 million records each so again you need to make sure you're aware of those we're gonna workout two percent in a minute so I need to work out what two percent of that conditioner is to be able to get the equivalent of caffeine in here two percent for 400 mils is eight grams of caffeine you're going to have to trust me on that if you're not head over to the block and look at the calculation so what I'm going to do I'm going to take that back with it and I'm just going to add it to the conditioner and that's when it's made it into my actual key pace so I'm going to put that in it with the conditioner and then give it a really really good shape I'm sure there's many more magical way to do this but this will do I always need to give this a really good shake okay so that looks like it's all dissolved down there it is your own who may need a caffeinated hair product the concentrations in this bottle is fine to be used every day because all the other shampoos are two percent saying that you can use them daily to use it daily but you might get better results if you do person I probably wouldn't use it more than once a days I'd be scared - follicle insomnia very quick dis camera I want to hairdresser I have got to scientist I do not work for any hair from a company and I'm not a caffeine expert this is just what I've seen online and I'm interested to try the interested if you tried it as well and let me see results I hope this video has helped if you are going to do this as well for September then let me see no results definitely but I'm really interested to see if this works as always if you like this video give it a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe so you don't miss anything your future and until next time take care of yourselves thanks for watching bye", "eVt7uAwezbY": "life is crazy life is absolutely insane these days can be so difficult to get a leg up and to really get our emotions and get certain things under control so I'm here to give you one of my number one tools for dealing with this crazy life we live in and that is micro dosing a psilocybin mushrooms yes these are the magic mushrooms so what do I mean when I say micro dosing okay so a normal dose like what we used to do back in the 60s when we were partying you know that's anywhere from two and a half to five grams of dried mushroom whereas when we're talking microdose we're saying 0.12 maybe point two grams depending on your size and your weight so the idea here is you can take this you can still go to work you can still function and in fact it will be functioning at a very high state so how how is this possible well our mind thinks very living in a linear fashion point A to point B you know when I get cut off in traffic that means I get angry when Johnny does this that means I need to think this way we get real caught up in these thought patterns so what micro dosing can do is get you into what's called the flow state it's more of a circular thought pattern so it really helps you break your thought patterns your emotional patterns these holes these ruts we get stuck in that's what my producing is all about get you into that flow state which is going to give you enhanced creativity you're gonna have more productivity at work you're gonna be in a better mood and maybe your goal isn't to be at your best you're not a professional athlete you're not under a ton of stress maybe you're just depressed just anxious don't worry about it so many of us aren't these days and the psilocybin is one of the top things you can do to start helping you with that it mimics serotonin in the brain which is one of the most important neurotransmitters but we don't want to get too technical today but just keep that in mind better focus more creativity really gonna help you curb your emotional thought patterns so you can experience life like you've never experienced before so it sounds pretty awesome so how do I do it so the biggest thing in my opinion now some say you don't need to be so precise others really want to be precise I'm a fan of knowing what I'm taking how much I'm taking so if I want to scale it up or scale it down you have a benchmark so I think it's extremely important to be working with a powdered mushroom but you can powder yourself if you have a nice grinder or if you know someone that is selling it in a powder form and one of the main reasons this is so important when it comes to a psilocybin mushrooms you've got the stems and you've got the caps and the amount of psilocybin and the caps versus the stem can be very different so let's say one day you're doing point 1 gram but it was the cow and you go ok that was ok but the next day you do point 1 ground and it was the stem and you don't feel anything at all because it's the stem so you think okay I'm gonna go point 2 this time but it's the cap and then all of a sudden you're seeing colors or something at work you know this is not what you want you do have to take it quite seriously and it is about you know finding what works best for you but if you powder your product that it's going to be much easier to get consistent with it so I love doing it in a powder I love mixing it with other herbs there's some studies coming out showing that when we mix a psilocybin with different types of mushrooms different herbs we can really potentiate the neural growth of our brains so mushrooms like lion's mane one of the only products in the world that have been shown to produce nerve growth factor which is the little protein in your brain that's responsible for making brain cells repairing old ones and protecting the ones you have so that's amazing all on its own but if you mix it with the oscilloscope you can potentiate East tenfold plus you're getting all these creativity all these other benefits of getting in the flow State so that's basically what you're doing you're taking a small amount you want to measure it fairly precisely you don't have to be perfect it depends on the person but you do want to know what you're working with and why you're working with it it helps to have strong intent well I've had major breakthroughs in my life sitting down going Jeff what are the issues I'm facing in terms of my personal issues what barriers do I put up with the thought patterns do I get stuck in and I'll write those down I'll go on a 30-day micro dosing adventure five days on two days off we'll get into the schedule in another video but the idea here was I took it every day and I went back to those intents in my journal and nano man I just have insane breakthroughs for example I always have this black and white difference between this is play and this is work and sometimes when there's lots of work to do you get depressed because you're like man we're never gonna have fun so that was my intent it was how can I bridge working with play and one of the breakthroughs I had about halfway through the 30 days Jeff you're always having a good time you know how to smile and have fun so get down when it comes to working and this sounds so simple but as you know if you've done any sort of self development work it can be very difficult to have these breakthroughs it's so easy to logic it out but to actually experience it and feel it and to be able to tell yourself it it's a whole nother story so that's why I might produce mushrooms and that's why I think you could benefit big-time from doing the same so if you liked this video and you want to do more you want to know more like this video subscribe to our right now and somewhere down below in the comments we're gonna have the complete beginners guide to micro dosing with the schedules with access to someone who can walk you through it help you get started and we'll definitely do our best to assist you in any way I can and please if you found this information valuable also share it to you and your friends anyone who can benefit from these amazing amazing actual grown products [Music]", "nq344D7IgOo": "[Music] welcome to y'all the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and today we are taking a look at another edible we are taking our first look at chill just keep it nice and chill chill medical cannabis cherry chunk dark chocolate hundred and eighty milligram THC each batch is triple lab tested who doesn't love seeing that I love seeing lab tested results on my edibles let's read there are little flavor texts on the package here at chill we offer the highest experience from our cocoa to our cannabis we are dedicated to quality safety and social responsibility we work daily to give our consumers a consistent safe and delicious product our chocolate bars are handmade with ethically sourced ingredients of the highest quality this is truly the highest chocolate that's the second time they made that joke and then on the back we've got nutrition advice we've got ingredients love seeing those as well so a couple of points there for having lab tested results which you can see right there on the back having ingredients and nutrition information I always love to see that for my edibles so as I said this is chill a kind of nice packaging here 180 milligrams of THC and this is the chocolate-covered cherries flavored Wow okay so it is packaged and exactly like Bane bars if you've ever seen the bang bars it's both the same exact milligram \u00e4j-- and pretty much identical packaging so chill and bang very similar uh and this says keep out of the reach of children on it in case you're wondering what it says and do do keepo the reach of children and it looks to be exactly the same way designed as bang bars to a couple of rectangular shaped his nurse if I could get this whole thing open excuse me everyone I'm incompetent okay it's not exactly the same way as Bing I believe bang is for vertical rectangles this is ten half split in half rectangles well let's give this chill a taste I was gonna try to come up with something clever to say but I couldn't so that's why I just went let's get this chill uh taste let's give this Joe a taste [ __ ] you perforations okay in terms of chocolate I put it about the bang level of taste it's pretty good it's not the best this this ain't of all say this ain't Kiva in terms of taste it's right about the bang level so good good not meant in any way derogatory eyes and complain good solid chocolate no complaints about the taste don't really taste any of the cover are the big chunks of cherry as they promised but I'll say them not bad at all um so taste test is fine but now for the most important test is this chill gonna get me chillax in and for that guys you guys are gonna have to wait just a couple of seconds me however I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know for sure exactly how this chill is lying in thanks for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit peace chill the highest chocolate cherry chunk dark chocolate and guys this is pretty much bang every nice thing I have to say about bang and every the few not glowing things I had to say about bang apply to this as well this is good chocolate not great chocolate this is potent stuff but not the most potent stuff but it's available for a pretty decent price I picked this up at my dispensary for 25 bucks for a 180 milligrams that might sound like a lot but here where I am in Long Beach that's actually and at this dispensary is a pretty good deal I picked up a more expensive less potent two chocolate one that I'm actually more excited for because it's a default city but overall I really liked the chill this is something I have no problem recommending to folks again tasting pretty good got me quite high got me up to the eighth level easily and in on all it was pretty reasonable price to so as far as chill goes I am quite pleased with my first experiment with them that is the chill the highest chocolate a pun I don't think is that good cherry chunk dark chocolate if you see in the dispensary near you and they got it for a reasonable price give it a shot especially if they don't have Kiva or DuPont say or any of those you know premium premium brands I think Jill's gonna do the job for you guys and that is gonna do it for this review here on weights I appreciate you guys watching as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "Qqp-13Kadjw": "all right Joseph Rogers here with you with the kids at podcast and we have a special guest today you want to give your real name Patrick Patrick okay you going with stage name I like it all right Patrick so Patrick has actually brought to my attention the juicy joint yes yes looks very good 90 percent THC Wow that's crazy distillate and Keef 100% flour 90 percent THC so it's like THC and paper basically yeah the distal it's 90 percent the overall I think is around 40 it says it on the back on the stick you got you and you've had one of these before right I had three left three level issues oh man that smells like great smells like smells like grape cough syrup for sure smokes like alright so great ethanol extraction you can follow them at juicy joints rock on Instagram no pesticides used in the growing of this product wow that smells delicious holy [ __ ] wow that's got some flavor to it holy [ __ ] you me not we may not have flavored baits right now but you got flavored joint still so [ __ ] yeah Oh Chester normally find them like five or six bucks apiece okay reasonable we don't usually talk about price on here but I can edit that out another few see what a lot yeah for an infused joint that's a good price [ __ ] cheap cheap smoker bro so where did you get this the reef huh man I don't know why went negative one hit I started smoking joints like cigarettes very just daily every 25 minutes damn maybe it's cuz we're hot boxes the [ __ ] I think that last hit [ __ ] me up the same amount is the first six cents I took so I just took 12 hits yeah well when it cooks down the oils and everything like a really does have you bought any of the ones that like roll the tip of it and shatter yeah the thing is that I bought those I love it just got the oil on the tip but then you kind of light it and stand outside cuz it drips oil gets hot it drips off the joint you don't want to get on your clothes so it was a two pack so on the second Johnny I just cut off the tip put it in my bowl smoked it with a torch oh my god was [ __ ] delicious so now I was like [ __ ] it I'll just buy my flour get my oil separate and infuse my flour with my oil dude it makes it so much better because it's just the right amount of high if you're a smoker yeah if you do a dab of that oil it's too much man that's what these I feel like smoking a regular joint like you gets you iron stuff with the oil he kicks it to the next level yeah please you only get so high on weed you can get there with one yeah and done and that's a nice perk yeah exactly and I like that oils have good flavours to them you know for a concentrate it's important there's some shitty oils out there with a idiot it's like booty you know but that high quality oil man that's some good [ __ ] confuse your bowl with where it just looks like you're infusing it with like salmon eggs or some [ __ ] you know could such high-quality I got a yo can that I use to with stuff that's really nice it stores it down at the bottom you unscrew it and it's like as close as you can get to dabbing with a portable unit you don't need two torches yeah see if this is in the coke we'll see oh yeah banana lately yeah yeah one time I lost my man any time I lost 12 match buddies in a row holy [ __ ] and you know what the crazy thing about that was hmm right after that I won 13 match plays in a row that was a crazy thing right after that not even later in the year right after that so crazy just it's a good reminder of the balance of the universe sometimes it works out right away sometimes it doesn't sometimes it takes a little bit time though but in the end no work so you know I'll work that it's all no hooking double double the hard 17 the other day and got a [ __ ] four nice yeah [ __ ] look at that there goes all the smoke that's right alright well that concludes this episode of the kids at podcast my name is Joe Patrick thanks for the juicy joint man the", "9byEOvA8-0w": "hello everyone we are back yet again with another week's review it is time for a week's mini review where we help you make sense of your dispensary and in these mini reviews we take smaller size edibles this is a 200 milligram edible and review them in a smaller format than traditional instead of our 30 6120 I just come back with you guys at two hours later and let you know how we're feeling so today we are reviewing something that we have never reviewed before a new brand this is from mcclenney confections quality you can taste and feel we shall see as you said this is a 200 milligram edible handcrafted cannabis nougat and caramel dark Belgian chocolate and it's the dark sneakers I guess kind of like Snickers except dum sounding all-natural ingredients whatever that means 1 to 8 servings we're just gonna have one serving and it says at the top the portions of a portion of donations go to animal shelters in need which is great ok it's got kind of this fancy plastic packaging just sort of unique I've never seen packaging like this for an edible nicely sort of floral rounders just got this odd plastic packaging let's open it up see how difficult is this it's not so bad inside maybe the slightest slightest hint of marijuana smell but nothing that's gonna get you busted that's for sure more of a dark chocolate aroma as it says but let's go to try okay and it's pretty good you can see the nougat and caramel inside there wow that is pretty tasty it tastes kind of like a dark chocolate Snickers bar without peanuts it's good it's very good um I'm eating it refrigerated so it's a little cruel but I like it that way I could get it and suggest you try it that way so in terms of taste Wow those consumed excuse me this gets high marks for taste but the proof is in how high this is gonna give me this this family at 200 milligrams only cost me I believe seven bucks is pretty affordable but we will check back with you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling thanks for watching Leakes hi guys I'm back it has been two hours since I had the dark sneakers chocolate bar from mcclenney confections I've really enjoyed it this bad boy only costs me six bucks maybe seven bucks can't remember exactly which but it's a hell of a value good tasting really enjoy the taste no discernible marijuana taste whatsoever I'm pretty quality chocolate I think and over two hours later I'm still feeling pretty stoned so if you see a dark sneakers at a dispensary near you go ahead and grab one you're not going to be disappointed thanks so much for watching wheats we'll check you guys out on the next review", "aEnVcrCHL24": "today we spoke about energy drinks what every pediatrician needs to know because we are aware that gee drinks are being marketed to use and our patients and parent population are unaware as well as our pediatricians about what is going on in this market the first thing that they should know is that sports drinks and energy drinks are not the same sports drinks tend to be for rehydration purposes include a lot of carbohydrates and other water but energy drinks are meant as a pick me up and have caffeine and some other hidden ingredients that act as stimulants and can be harmful to our patients unfortunately the labels are vague because energy drinks are marketed as dietary supplements instead of beverages or drugs that are regulated by the FDA so these unregulated products are out there in the community they list caffeine sometimes and if they do we encourage you to limit your adolescence use of caffeine to 100 milligrams a day maximum a typical soda might have 35 to 50 milligrams may be as high as 71 in addition we want you to focus on serving sizes so for example drinks that come in very large cans such as Monster Energy or rock star are often 24 to 36 ounces and that may be as many as five servings and if patients or youth don't know about this then they may be under estimating exactly how much caffeine they're getting and drinking the whole can in one shot in addition there are energy shots energy gomes and other products that look like candy or crystal light that we need to be aware of can be problematic", "R50H1ilS8FA": "[Music] [Music]

engineering it has his uses from basic to advanced level the full form denotes the reinforced cement concrete reinforced are the rebars while cement concrete in concrete it's a mixture of cement sand aggregates coarse aggregates fine aggregates and water so in today's class we'll go we'll going to learn detail about concrete technology and today we will learn detail about the properties of concrete classification of cements specification of portland cement specification of aggregates measurement of materials admixtures so let's start it so this is our topic this is our subject topic we will cover this in almost six to seven lectures so let's start it so our today's first chapter is concrete technology in this concrete technology as i said before what we are going to learn so let's start with the properties of concrete it is the construction material which is obtained by hardening of mixture of cement sand gravel and water in a predetermined proportions this mixture is used by pouring it into stable moulds and allowed to harden and then cured so let's move forward to the characteristics of concrete in the characteristics of concrete it has good compressive strength but it is weak for taking tensile loads it shows resistance to corrosion and fire the process of hardening of concrete is time varying and it gains strength with time the concrete structures are much more economical than steel concrete can form hard surface and thus resist the abrasion its strength depends upon quality of material and handling conditions it shows the tendency of sinking initially because of loss of water it also springs as the process of hardening goes on it can be placed with steel bars to form rcc let's study about the concrete and its setting time there are three stages first is initial setting time it is usually 30 to 60 minutes this is the time phase in which mixed proportion attains the pronounced resistance to flow and plasticity is decreased as per the is code it should be more than 30 minutes so that the duration this phase concrete can be mixed transported and used at required place so the second setting time is the final setting time of concrete usually it takes about five to six hours this is the second time phase during which concrete remains relatively soft solid with no surface hardness in this time concrete starts gaining the strength as per its scores it should not be more than 10 hours and the third stage is progressive hardening and increasing strength this is the third time phase during which concrete almost attends most of its strength during initial stage this process is quite rapid it is generally one month after mixing a small quantity of gypsum as added in the cement the initial setting time is controlled by the quantity of gypsum added more the quantity of gypsum more will be the initial setting time so let's move forward to the classification of cements the cements are classified into five portland cement high aluminum cement and super sulphated cement natural cement and masonry cement so we're going to learn detail about portland cement first the main constituents of portland cement are lime also known as calcium oxide has around 60 to 67 percent the other constituents of spotlight cement are silica aluminium calcium sulfate iron oxide magnesia sulfur trioxide and alkalis and you can see the proportion on the screen so let's move forward the aggregatious material in the form of clay and shale and calcareous materials in the form of limestone chalk are used in around 1 ish to 2 ratio when raw materials containing above constituents undergo burning and fusion the chemical reaction takes place and following compounds are formed called as bogeys compound so these are the four bugis compound first is tricalcium silicate c3s dicalcium silicate c2s tricalcium aluminate c3a tetracalcium aluminum ferrite c4af i am going to tell a shot about these c3s and c2s contribute to the most of eventual strength however initial setting is due to c3s c3s quickly hydrates and contributes initial strength contribution of c2s is after seven days of mixing and extends up to one year the strength of first 24 hours is imparted by c3s all the four compounds lose heat when mixed with water c2s generate minimum heat whereas c3h generate maximum therefore c3a is responsible for undesirable properties of concrete cement having lower c3a content will have higher ultimate strength less generation of heat and less cracking so now we'll move forward to the types of portland cement there are generally eight types of protein cement we'll discuss each type in brief the first is ordinary portland cement it is the manufactured generally in large quantities than others it is generally suitable in concrete construction where it is no exposure to sulphates in soil or groundwater this is the most important part of this cement and the second part the second type is rapid hardening portland cement it is also known as high early strength cement it is ground finer contains lesser c2s and c3s as compared to ordinary portland cement strength developed in three days in rapid hardening portland cement is nearly equal to the strength developed in seven days in ordinary portland instrument but shuttering may be removed earlier thus saving time and expenses the third is extra rapid hardening cement it is obtained by inner grinding of calcium chloride with rapid hardening cement it imparts quick setting properties also the fourth is low heat portland cement this is used where the rate at which heat can be lodged at surface in lower than the rate which heat is being generally initiated the examples where it is used is abutments in bridges retaining walls and dams etc the fifth cement is portland blast one instrument the proportions of slag vary from 25 to 65 percent by the bait of cement in portland blast furnace cement it is manufactured by inter grinding of portland cement clinker in blast furnace lag it is com it has comparatively low heat of hydration and can be used in the replacement of ordinary portland cement gypsum is added to regulate the setting time of cement the next cement is portland frozolona cement it is manufactured in the inner grinding of portland cement clinker and procedure burnt clay shale or fry lash it's the blending instead of in organic 10 to 25 percent of barcelona can be added uh or used in practical means this cement has more resistance to chemical and sea water attack it also has low heat of evaluation the next is sulphate resistant cement in this cement the quality quantity of c3a is strictly limited and there are normally ground finer than opc resistance can form through carbonation by action of atmospheric carbon dioxide this cement should be allowed to harden in the air for as long as possible the next is white and colored portland cement the color is obtained by adding pigments in ordinary portland cement or white cement pigment should be permanent or chemically inert the percentage of iron oxide is limited to one percent sodium aluminate fluoride is added to act the flux in absence of ferrous oxide so we're going to learn about the next four types the first is portland cement and the next is high aluminum stimulant in high indominus cement the raw materials is manufactured and are extremely high alumina content it has dark color high early strength even then rapid hardening cement high heat of hydration and more existence to chemical attack manufacture is more expensive than ordinary portland cement the next part is super sulfated cement according to is 1990 it is manufactured from well granulated blast furnace lag about 80 to 85 percent calcium sulphate about 10 to 15 percent and portland cement about one to two percent it is the ground finer than opc it has strength resistance to chemical attack concrete derived from the cement expands if cured in water and shrinks in if cured in air so the next event is natural cement these are manufactured from naturally occurring cement rocks with compositions similar to mix of aggregates and calcareous materials natural cement rocks are burned at comparatively lower temperature the properties of these cement depends upon the composition of cement rock masonry cement is the last type of cement this is manufactured from binding the portland cement drinker limestone gypsum and air and training agent these are ground finer than the high early strength portland cement this is used in for motor in brick machinery limestone and air and training agents impact plasticity and workability shrinkage in fairly low so next we are going to learn the specifications of coatland cement the specifications mainly are the chemical compositions in chemical composition it is depend upon the ratio of the percentage of lime that should not be greater than 1.02 but not less than 0.66 um it is calculated from the formula and the second is the ratio of percentage of alumina to that of ferrous oxide it should not be less than 0.6 is the weight of absolute residue should not be more than two percent weight of magnesium not be more than six percent and the total sulphuric and hydrate uh should not be more than 2.7 percent and total loss of ignition should not be more than four percent this is the most important in chemical composition the second is fineness the fineness um this is done by grinding uh if the cement has low heat there are three times three types of cement used in five minute fineness is uh the first is low heat then the specific surface should not be more than three thousand two hundred and the in rapid heightening cement the specific surface should not be more than 3250 and ordinary cement the surface specific should not be more than 2 250. the second the third is the soundness by lee chatlier method according to is 1968 rapid hardening and low heat portland cement should have expansion less than 10 mm the fourth is setting time by the cat apparatus the initial setting time of ordinary portland cement and the rapid hardening and low heat portland cement should not be around 30 or 30 to 60 minutes uh okay and the final setting time of these cements should be around um 60 to 600 minutes okay so next specification of portland cement is its compressive strength it is found out with the cube test in is 1968 4031. the compressive strength at the end of three days should be not more than 11.3 newton per mm square and that at the end of seven days should not less than 17.2 to newton per mm square the sixth point is the heat of hydration uh the only heat of hydration only for the low heat cement of hydration after seven days should be not more than 65 calories per gram and after 28 days should not be more than 75 calories per gram by finding out the tensile strength there are certain formulas we have to take out tensile strength upon 5 plus 2.5 at three days should be not lesser than two and ten strength upon five plus two point five at seven days should not be lesser than two point five newton per mm square where now we are going to learn the aggregates there are two types of aggregates first is coarse second is fine the coarse aggregates which are retained on 4.75 mm sieve the maximum size of coarse aggregate is limited to one third of the thickness of concrete section for thin slabs and balls the fine aggregates are which that are passed through 4.75 sieve usually natural river sand is used and angular grain sand produces good concrete because of interlocking so we are going to learn the specifications of aggregates now there are different specifications like crossing strength increasing strength that should be normally 80 newton per mm square minimum it's accepted and in aggregate crushing value it has the given formula um where 100 w2 by w1 w2 is the weight of surface of dry sample for aggregate passing through 12.5 mmc when w1 is the weight of material passing from 2.36 mmc isc um depending on the specific load the third is the aggregate impact value it lies between 30 to 45 for good quality concrete higher aggregate impact value is education of weak aggregates and the last is fineness modulus it is also known as the grading of aggregates it is the index number which is roughly proportional to the average size of the particles in aggregates coarse aggregates higher will be the finest um it is obtained by adding the percentage of weight of material retained on isc 80 mm 40 mm 20 mm and 10 mm 4.75 mm 2.36 mm 1.18 mm 600 micron 300 micron and 150 micron these are the total 10 sieves and the last part is the water a water is a lubricant for aggregates and chemically adds with cement also used in curing potable water is satisfactory for mixing and curing purpose tannic acid or iron should be present in water uh ph values should not be more than six in organic solids the water should be um 200 milligram per liter uh in organic solids 300 sulfates is 400 chlorides is 200 mg per liter for concrete not containing embedded steel and 500 for rcc work suspended matter it has permissible limits for solid for 2000 mg per liter according to is 456 2000 when suitability of water is doubled regarding the development of strength then compressive strength and initial strength time tests are done so we're going to learn how the materials are measured firstly the stimming preferably measured in the terms of weight but not in the terms of volume each cement bag contains 50 kg under normal conditions and the volume of cement bag is nearly equal to 34.5 liters the second is fine aggregates uh the five uh the fine aggregates are measured in weight for accuracy works and by volume for ordinary works and the volume is increased due to water absorption by sand called as buckling of sand sand particles are pulled apart from the surface tensions caused by water increased in the volume depends on gradation but may be taken to the maximum at the moisture content of about four percent of dry sands but increases with the finest and maybe around 25 percent of volume we can calculate it by percentage of buckling is going to increase in volume and original volume okay so next part is the coarse aggregate now there is no problem of buckling it is measured in volume of weight either for accuracy or large scale work this should be measured by weight and water finally water we know that it's measured in volumes the liters of water the next topic is water cement ratio more water increases the workability but decreases the strength whereas water content increases strength moreover use of excessive amount of water also increases shrinkage and decrease density and durability so what is durability of concrete is the property by virtue of which concrete is able to resist its disintegration and decay reasons behind disintegration and decay of concrete may be use of unsound cement less durable aggregates entry of harmful salts and gases through pores of cracks freezing and thawing off water sucked through cracks and expansion of contraction due to temperature variation the next important topic in our syllabus is admixtures for the quality improvement purpose some ingredients are added in concrete which results in changing different properties in its fresh hardening stages the properties improved maybe strength hardness workability water resistance power etc commonly used at mixtures are calcium chloride alum coal ash common salt bitumen iron oxide lime mineral oil organic oils volcanic ashes and many more there are different types of admixtures used some of them are accelerators alien training admixtures super plasticizers plasticizers retarders they have different advantages some of the advantages are adjusting final setting time gain higher early and ultimate strength higher slump and self-training concrete self-traveling concrete uh increasing durability and workability lesser water cement ratio reducing quantity of cement reducing permeability of concrete so our next most important is proportioning of concrete the process of selection of the proportion of cement sand coarse aggregate and water as learned above so that the concrete of desired quality can be obtained the proportion should be such that resulting concrete have following properties the one is the fresh concrete should have enough workability so that it can be placed in form work economically the second is the cost of materials and labors needed to form concrete should be minimum the concrete should process maximum density so that it will be watertight and stronger the last but not the least topic of today is workability of concrete workability is the ease with which concrete can be mixed handled transported placed in position and compacted as per is 1959 workability of concrete is the property which determines the amount of internal work necessary to produce full compaction workable concrete should not show any bleeding or segregation to determine the workability of concrete following tests have been developed the one is slum cone taste compacting factor test vb taste and vibro verticality test we'll learn in detail about these tests in further lecture before that we'll going to learn the vertical settlement is measured in slum in millimeters and i'm going to tell you the different types of work and its slum results like if you test for concrete for road work the slum results might be 20 to 30 mm for vibrated concrete it is 12 to 25 mm for mass concrete it is 25 to 50 mm and for column retaining walls in 10 vertical sections it may go for 75 to 100 mm also the greatest factor affecting workability of concrete is a mixed amount of water as water increases workability also increases with strength but the strength decreases other factors are maximum size of particles ratio of coarse and fine aggregates particle interlocking particle interface and elixirs

edibles Rob you show where we help you make sense of you our dispensary if this is the first time you are joining us here on wheats our goal is to help you make sense of your dispensary helped you understand that giant wall of edibles at your dispensary lets you know which of those products are worth your hard-earned dollars today we are looking at another drink from habit habit based out of San Diego California this is their sparkling grape drink 200 or 100 milligrams of THC promises rapid onset which I like faster apparently then your typical edibles it's got some real fruit in there or so it says 71 calories 2 servings it's a fancy looking bottle serve cold lay open slowly let's follow those directions and give her a taste so on weights the way it works guys if you've never seen this before is I'm gonna sample this product I might finish it depending how long it takes but I will finish the whole thing before before too much longer and I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how this edible or in this case this drinkable is doing so without further ado let's open her up open slowly I can see why fizzy fizzy fizzy slow slow slow slow it down still fizzy still too fizzy of this sparkling grape there we go it smells like grape juice no discernible weed out or whatsoever it smells a little bit like wine I suppose that's not too unexpected being sparkling grape juice let's give her a taste YUM no we taste space like sparkling grape juice and pretty good sparkling grape juice at that well I would drink this now again this is a little bit on the expensive site at $12 but I really like the habit I had before I really found that the rapid onset to be true and I found that uh the high lasted quite a while but that was the Kiwi flavour so we'll see if the sparkling grape is just as potent as the Kiwi YUM I gotta say on taste especially in comparison to dozers which I've had before this wins hands down let's taste legitimately good well guys I'm gonna finish off this habit sparkling grape here and I will see you in two hours to let you know how we're feeling thank you so much for watching weeks guys we'll see you soon peace it's been about two hours since I had the there we go the habit sparkling grape 100 milligrams beverage here and I like it quite a bit and I believe their claim that it does have rapid onset I was feeling it uh probably about five to 10 minutes in maybe I don't know maybe a little maybe a little more and then it was a pretty consistent hi there uh I do I I feel like starting to come down already it's maybe peaked at around the 90 minute mark but for a hundred milligram consumable it was pretty potent it still was a little bit on the expensive side at $12 but this is a drink that I have no problem recommending as you are comfortable with the expense and don't mind uh trying something a little unorthodox again that's the habit sparkling grape made there in San Diego California if you see it a dispensary near you feel free to give it a shot thank you so much for watching wheat skies and we will check you out on the next review beasts I guess I can't throw this one at you because that would be dangerous just buddy hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in

"[Music] Bob's only welcome to weights the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review if I seem a little giddy er than normal that's because we are doing another edible review and not just any other edible review we are doing another the folks a review de Paul say chocolate tears my favorite edibles in existence these guys are amazing there are chocolate these uh well these guys in Kanaka are my two favorites here the chocolate I have tried their mint chocolate and their white chocolate and both were incredible tasted delicious and as potent as any edible I have ever put into my body this is only a 90 milligram edible but it hits three times as hard easily and if it tastes like any of the others it is the best tasting chocolate I've ever had as well so uh default say chocolatier there's no way to say it without sending like an [ __ ] unfortunately they are distinctively different as you can see here on the back let's read their stupid text here captivate your senses with the exquisite bliss of the false a hand crafted from the finest cacao and a premium collection of California cannabis our artisanal chocolates redefine the world of edible confections they kind of do actually to be honest I you guys know me you know my favorite way of eating edible this is actually chocolates I think chocolates is just plain chocolates is the best way to go for edibles and if I'll say is my favorite of those um it's better than Kiva it's better than bang it's better than 420 bars it's better than it's better than what else what other chocolate bars are out there whenever ones are out there this is the best of them all so far now we have to give it a review before we can definitively say that the dark chocolate is the best amongst them so let's go ahead and get straight into it here now this is very expensive if you can see uh right there at the bottom not sure if it's gonna focus or not this actually cost me $25 a my dispensary for a 90 milligram which is insane but that is the highest I've ever seen this this is the the tax that you pay at my dispensary ignore that price it is still very expensive for what you for as what it's advertised as but it is worth the price so let's go ahead and open up this default hey dark give it a taste here so if you haven't seen any of our previous reviews the heat chocolate comes in a very strange shape and he's like trapezoidal shapes they're each at five milligrams that's what it gives you a little diagram there here's our chocolate and it's very foil or very fancy foil wrapper here and here my friends here is the good stuff the default say dark and all its weird triangles and trapezoids and whatnot five milligram pieces let's break some off give it a taste well I didn't get that perfectly square but that's okay oh good let me leave you be very honest about this this is not a good edible this is amazing chocolate this is not really good for an edible chocolate this is damn good chocolate that I am more than happy to eat and as a by-product I get [ __ ] stoned as hell this is incredible stuff this is incredible stuff mmm it's so good I like dark chocolate I'm a dark chocolate fan so I'm a little biased but yeah this is the best chocolate i've bes edible chocolate I've ever had and one of the best tasting chocolates flatout period I that I've ever had mmm well guys Devante has done it again in the taste department but for the more important aspect is it gonna hit in the potency department for that guys you're gonna have to wait a couple minutes or a couple seconds rather me however I'm gonna wait two hours come back to you guys in two hours as I just said and let you know exactly how I'm feeling so thanks for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit peace pink look how red I am so high right now guys and that's after only 90 milligrams ah duffau say works their magic yet again my god I love these guys Ayanna bash idli love them they are three for three the dark chocolate was exquisite I am at an eight eight and a half somewhere in there I could not be happier with that with with this product with these guys this is next-level stuff this is I struggling to come up with terms to describe it but I I absolutely love it I could not love it more if you guys I mean there's just there's there's no other way to describe at this point other than simply it's worth tracking down not only is it worth grabbing if you see at your dispensary it's worth researching to try to find to give it a try it's that good so guys go to weed Maps as much as I hate telling you to look at weed maps go to weed maps search for de pon say find out your closest dispensary make the trip it's worth it give it a shot DePaul's say the dark chocolate my favorite yet no the mid chocolate still my favorite I don't care they're all great give them a shot thanks so much for watching weeds guys over the moon with this one thank you so much for watching and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "2VNYCOaQFSY": "[Music] hopefully 71 the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on this web view we are taking a look at the final product to review from a cushy punch their 100 milligram sativa variety flavor is strawberries the strawberry 100 milligram sativa variety of cushy punch we've looked at their 200 milligram TK o which I found to be kind of lacking and then we looked at their 100 milligram indica and in an experiment we also look at the 100 milligram hybrids and I found both of those to be not too bad so I hope that this is on the better end of the cushy punch I hope it's as good as the other two 100 milligrams I found those to be much better than the 200 milligram sort of surprisingly I would just go with 100 milligrams in terms of cost because I think it's about just about as potent as its 200 milligram brother so without further ado let's going to open this up and eat her down and what's gonna happen after that guys after I finish this I'm going to come back to you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part about the edible review not necessarily how it tastes but more about how it actually makes you feel so here we go looks like a like a little jam packet or a little jelly packet or a little butter packet it's got four little blocks in there and after we get it plopped out you can see it with its four a little squares but we're going to ignore the little squares there just plug the whole thing in my mouth and one go mmm not bad definitely a little bit of what we taste so much better than the infused creations or the what's the other one I can't remember the name off the top my head but any of those ones that are just like the gummy bears with the basically just like THC oil sprinkled on the outside this is a lot better this is more like the flourish although I don't think it's quite as good as the flourish so now that I've slurped it down I'm gonna wait two hours to see how I'm gonna feel you guys however have to just wait a couple seconds I'll be back right after this break here and I'll let you know how I'm feeling see you then it's been two hours since I had the cushy punch that's the name of it the cushy punch should sieve a hundred milligram THC strawberry flavored gummy here and I gotta say this might be the least hi I've been from one of their hundred milligrams it seemed like the hybrid and the indica hit me more that might just be because I've heard this about um because she punched before that they're not the most consistent some are code and some aren't and that might just be the case with this sativa I'm not not high just more at like four four and a half somewhere in that range instead of the six five and a half six is the other ones so a little bit less than before but again that just might be this particular batch where it might be that sativa doesn't quite hit me as hard but it still is better than my original impressions of could she punch way back when when I had their TKO at the very very beginning I still don't think it would be the first thing I reached for at the dispensary but it won't be the last thing I go for like my opinion used to be so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching it as always and we will see you on the next review peace okay", "HDlrN3E9h20": "here is a fun fact about vitamin C only humans guinea pigs and fishes can be deficient in vitamin C today I will be talking about vitamin C

because it will flush out from your system everyday through urination let's see why there is a hype of vitamin C nowadays first of all vitamin C is very important for the functioning and production of white blood cells white blood cells are the cells which prevents you from getting infected from all the antibodies around you vitamin C is a very powerful antioxidant it stabilizes the free radical damage in your body studies have shown there is a significant reduction of common cold symptoms in the patients by just taking 200 mg of vitamin C or day in adult it was 8% and children it was 14% that means one less day of illness why did I choose by to me C complex first of all this is 1000 mg vitamin C in one tablet and 100 mg citrus bioflavonoids it is a powerful polyphenolic compounds found in citrus fruits like lemon and grapefruit it maintains cellular health by neutralizing free radicals in our body users take out one tablet added to water it becomes a fizzy drink the taste is

edible review show would we help you make sense of yo dispensary so today we are talking this is is is is is s zas strawberry lemonade first time we have taken a look from any product from SAS fun to say SAS that plosive P there at the end is a specific as you've probably figured out meaning this is not actually a marijuana edible review show but a marijuana drink review show so this is a 240 milligrams of THC in this strawberry eliminate in this fancy looking bottle here that is plastic with this wrapper on the outside it tells me to shake well many times on this package here so I'm gonna be sure to do that I don't know anything about SAS I seen them a couple times at different dispensaries I haven't really heard what they're good where they're not good it cost me 20 bucks for this which is pretty good actually a really good value for a drink that's 240 milligrams most drinks are about twenty dollars for 200 milligrams or higher so this is a good value I hope it's going to taste well it's smaller than the other drinks which I actually kind of like this is only eight fluid ounces as opposed to like sixteen as the other ones and only 60 calories so it's a smaller drink probably means it's going to be more potent or excuse me the flavors can be a little bit more wretched but less to drink so you know double-edged sword well let's go ahead and stop Yammer in my trap here open it up I've got this busted ass thumb which makes everything difficult I cannot figure out how cameras work we should making everything difficult to open but we'll get through it oh [ __ ] lift it has this handy little thing right here and I messed it up oh [ __ ] well I would say we are well shook well shaken we are now opening give it the a little snifter it smells like kool-aid it's very red it's very red alright uh sticky sit Yasser that is strong wow that is a lot of we taste a hot we taste that is really strong um hopefully means it's quite potent whew it almost tastes like medicine when someone's got that it almost hit and almost hasn't like an alcohol he tasted to it um that really bitter taste oh so bad well I'm as I said I'm really glad it's only eight fluid ounces I'm gonna have to go get something else to drink to help me wash down this drink so guys I'm gonna finish this off and I will come back to you in two hours but for you just a couple of seconds and let you know how it's hitting me because that is the most important part of any edible review if you don't get that in your edible reviews guys don't watch them they're not worth their sold I don't know what I'm talking about see you in two hours wish me luck [Music] guys welcome back it's been two hours since I have last seen you and I had some grand ideas for what I was gonna do for this second half of this video where I was gonna film it it was gonna go somewhere cool maybe bust out the old drone shoot some cool footage do all that cool stuff but then I got to hi yes whoo Thank You Jasper that is something that I'm will always be glad to fail to live up to my own aspirations for this show is by getting too goddamn high and it happened this is a winner check out those eyeballs there's there's some red there there's quite a bit of red I'm hi I'm Matt like an eight maybe um which is pretty good for me and I like this product a lot it is mm strong it is strong tasting their website calls it a refreshing beverage I will I'm not sure we call refreshing but I would call it refreshingly strong in both taste and in terms of strength Wow I am happy with this one guys really really enjoyed this ass I would wait one more of you before you know before you dive in and buy a bunch of ass just to make sure you know they're a consistent product I've got another one ready for a review so you know just hold off don't don't go out buying just yet maybe I don't know I don't know maybe if you really like the drinks go for it but I've got another review coming out from zas at some point and hopefully it's just as good it's another of the two 40s they also make 120s which I will now deaf give a review as well but yeah like this quite a bit that and that guys will do it for this review

brands this is the third fourth with you we've done from G drinks I found them to be all over the map so far actually not all over the map just I found them to be pretty bad to be honest I think I've reviewed two of their 100 milligram drinks and neither of them have done anything for me so this is their 210 milligram line slightly more than twice as powerful and so I'm desperately hoping that this one does something before we have to write off G drinks altogether so again as I said this is 210 milligrams of THC it cost me I believe $18 at my dispensary and I think he had got a discount like 16 maybe so it's uh it's you know about what you would expect maybe even a little bit cheaper than some of the other drinks at that price but let's go ahead and shake well as it advices and give it a taste this is the passionfruit lemonade variety of the G drink it's very very very very yellow oh no I forgot there's a seal technical difficulties oh wait there's a seal there's a ripoff thing guys always inspect the packaging first don't be like me there we go 210 milligram THC passion fruit G drink let's give it a taste ooh [Music] the we taste is more on the back end than the other G drinks not ice which is weird this might be the least we tasting we'd sort of infused taste that I've had from a G drink and it's twice as potent as the other ones that doesn't necessarily bode well the fact that this one tastes better you still do have that really a stringent cannabis aftertaste but none of that like burning taste they had on the front and with the other ones yeah that's not bad um again it does have a canvas taste and it's pretty powerful but it's certainly better than the others which again is a little disconcerting being twice as potent but will give them the benefit of the doubt and I will see you guys in two hours for you it'll just be a couple of seconds and I'll let you know how I'm feeling then thanks for watching weeks and I'll see you guys soon speed-dial welcome back to weeds it's been two hours since I had the G drink two times more THC two hundred and ten milligrams passionfruit lemonade and I gotta say it's a lot better than its a hundred milligram cousins liked it quite a bit more I think it's twice as potent got people waiting for me in the car bout ready ahead into the beach my dogs are waiting for me too don't have a whole lot of time again I think I misspoke I think it's $20 not eighteen I think I got it for eighteen not sixteen I apologize for that 110 calories in this or excuse me 220 220 calories in this entire bottle 110 calories per serving two servings each totally uh happy with this one really glad with happy with way I taste it and happy with the potency as I said definitely feels more than twice as strong as the hundred milligram version that's kind of a redeemer for G drink for me I was ready to write them off now I'm ready to try another 210 milligram drink and that's going to do it for this episode here on weights I will check you guys out on the next review peace", "Rqvhb0vXKv8": "Oh was good everybody hum for you be back at it again we got something new for you guys today it's not a blunt I already show you

time", "ImKhZavum7c": "[Music] all right so sometimes throughout the day or evening you may become thirsty while partaking in cannabis because sometimes the after effects can include cottonmouth I was walking and was thinking to myself that I was getting thirsty and I came across this so why don't you guys to check it out I'm here with the main sales rep and I want to introduce ever introduce yourself that will talk about it hello how are you I'm fantastic how are you [Music] okay I'm Callie and I am the Director of Sales at old KY logistics this is my sidekick Tamika I'm Tamika the brand ambassador spring spray is a really unique product it is a 45 milligram sativa dominant THC hybrid citrus soda let's light and refreshing and actually like thirst-quenching not filled with a bunch of crazy flavors for colors and doesn't taste like I'm not the popsicle it is not meant to be like annihilate you medicine time to go to sleep it's sativa dominant 45 milligrams so this is what you drink when you're going to a barbecue and like my husband who doesn't drink alcohol he loves to have a sprinkle it his buddies you drinking beer so there's a feeling of well-being as well as like uplifted nurse is that oh yeah and there's a couple of different uses so like I said if a great beverage is an alternative to alcohol but it's absolutely fantastic also on top of vodka or rum or tequila or champagne err and people are like oh that you must be quite so tore up that's so crazy and the truth is that I thought all my soccer moms hooked because we drink a lot less we're wait wait when you say blessed are you talking about volume less alcohol you end up making drinks and dosing yourself funny and elated and giggly and smart and you still can cook dinner and you're not so the effects of a sativa or what would be categorized as what a sativa would feel like combined with the effervescence of a soda drink it's just a manageable fun elating buzz that doesn't weigh it out that doesn't make you nervous that you're gonna have to have too much I like all natural sugars or I mean we have two different versions actually no there's only one flavor and the flavor is sprig just like news the flavor for spring or there's a flavor for fresca it's just break and the two versions are one that is regular pure cane sugar and the other that is sugar-free which is made with stabia so it's less calories but both are totally natural so stevia I'm very familiar with Cheviot soda has a very dominant flavor right so it may sort of change the profile most drinks and sodas have between 80 to 120 milligrams of THC which causes them to have to add a lot of flavors and a lot to cover up that taste but with spray because we kept it at a micro dose of 45 milligrams we let you taste the earthiness you get a little bit of that cannabis flavor but it's enlightened citrus and with the bubbles so it's still delicious and refreshing but we're not trying to cover anything up it's just all right you sold me I want to try it let me try it okay here we go bottoms up [Music] yeah it's like a sprite play it's like a fresca it's not as carbonated as a sprite that's pretty kick-ass and so you sell it individually by the case I mean how does that work how do they get ahold of you how do they buy this find that below links down below but yeah will give a great deal to get you started and we always come in promote your product push it out make sure that all of your patients really important spring is different than other products because people won't necessarily come in to buy spring but on a Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday what do you know those people if you regularly spend fifty to fifty five dollars in your store are just now going to upsell themselves every single time it's a way for you to make more money on every customer that comes through your door so it value-added accessory it's absolutely the best upsell product on the market I'm sure high margin that gives it kind of rounds out the home you don't have to tell me I'm just a billion weird jeopardy fold as well like we know we're not trying to squeeze people but we just recognize this is the way that stores can increase their profit margin like every single patient lots of their doors I mean that's a good way to market it let me ask you this how did you for you I mean was it the drinking party or something or like how did you like come up with this what were you thinking what was the Epiphany for you I take this I take this to a different level in my mind right like it in the shops that it has been legal in the past we'll see what is legal going forward but in the past we showed up to stores with tanks of Sprigg so if we can just fill strict for my 40th birthday I had soccer moms doing kicks you're 40 you're [ __ ] lying I thought it was dirty it must be this regular drinking I check it out I think it's a great tasting product and definitely worth trying out and an easy add-on when you're

sense of your dispensary today I am excited about this review we are taking a look at another product from yummy karma somebody who I've come to like quite a bit we're looking at their yummy karmis yummy Karma's medical medical cannabis popcorn mac and cheese we've already reviewed their parmesan and herb I believe and then MTV herbal Isha's if you know what I mean I can't really Winx play home so I'm really excited about the mac and cheese sounds like a great great flavor sounds like a real winner now this is 75 milligrams like the other one here I picked it up for 10 bucks but on a discount that really made it 750 so that's a hell of it that's a decent deal for a 750 750 milligrams excuse me 75 milligrams edible we've also taken a look at yummy Karma's tincture which I also found to be really good so let's see if we can make it three for three with yummy karma if you've never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this entire bag of popcorn all 75 milligrams of it which is a little bit less than than we normally review here on weeks but this hits a little bit harder than most 75 milligrams uh and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's really what you're in it for you don't really care how I taste you want to know how it's gonna make you feel so that's what I'm that's what we do

so let's go ahead and take a bite of this yummy karma mac and cheese popcorn okay doesn't look very tasty neither did the parmesan and herb it doesn't look terrible smells okay a little weedy type smell but not anything terrible here we go here is the yummy Karma mac and cheese medical cannabis popcorn that is not bad I can totally just like the parmesan herb I've had so much more disgusting of the like chip cracker popcorn kind of edibles this isn't bad at all this is totally edible I mean do I would I prefer to have this over a bag of Munim Lay's white cheddar popcorn hell no of course not well yes I mean if it weren't medicated but just eating in it but we're medicated no I'd much rather have like the white cheddar or a lady's popcorn but as it is it's as it stands can totally finish this bag and not feel like retching so that is a positive in my book now for the most important part hey how's it gonna work black guys you're gonna have to wait a couple of seconds me I'll come back to you in two hours to let you know for sure thanks to watching weeks stay tuned for the results city in just a bit boozes [Music] welcome back guys it has been two hours since I have enjoyed the yummy karma medical cannabis popcorn mac and cheese flavor and I'm pleased as punch to say it is also great still rocking 708 am i high for 75 milligrams edible no greater my tolerance is a little bit lower than what it normally is so so take that with a grain of salt but I can assure you that this is a this is a good package gear and at 10 bucks or as I paid 750 it's a pretty good value to I I don't I don't regret the money at all I think it's a pretty good deal in terms of flavor it's not disgusting which actually is a huge positive I don't mean that in any way in negatively because a lot of these are this is this is totally edible I'm just a really solid package from yummy car I would totally totally pick it up if I saw it at my dispensary and you're looking for something that isn't going to you know knock you out completely or and especially if you're looking for something on the more salty and the snack spectrum instead of the sweet give this one a shot this is a really good

watching as always and we will check you out on our next review beast", "NOiUSawrEjE": "[Music] what's up YouTube chef Hans here bringing you another adults-only CBD and cannabis product review so let's have some fun guys get right into it today we are talking about mile highs finest CBD shatter and we're talking about dang clean CBD syrup so let's get right into it guys so I've been ordering from this company for a little bit now and let me tell you guys top quality products right here now I did pay for this product I paid for it all some I'm going to disclose and all my videos from here on out in the beginning when I pay for it or not and I want to be completely 100% honest with you guys and you know everything about it so I'm gonna let you know what I paid for it or not in the beginning and I paid for all these products but let me tell you these products are some Fuego v guys I'm so excited about this stuff man this is crazy CBD shock the terpene profiles on this stuff is nuts I've had CBD showers from other people and the terpene profiles are always there and it's like it smells really good but then when I dab it it's kind of like it's not sponging it's not it's not as flavorful it's kind of faint when I dab it not this stuff guys this stuff is full flavor all the way through from time to cracked open the jar until that stuff hits your banger and it's a baked into your lungs it's just thick on the palate and it's just flavorful punch you in the face the whole way so let's get right into it guys so this is the packaging look at that - yeah baby so you either get it in half gram or gram okay and I don't know the half gram is does I haven't ordered a half gram but a gram of this is $45 on their website right now I'm leaving the link in the description but $45 for a grandma this quality CV shadows great price guys I'd pay you this all day long I plan on continuing to support this company because they're a great product and their customer service is awesome - I've been talking on and off with them before they had a website and I really wanted to try their products right but they didn't have a website well I finally you know talked to them a little bit and they hooked me on they let me buy some stuff directly and this is before their website and I was hooked as soon as the guy was like yep I'm just gonna keep on ordering from you guys forever it's not place quite a few orders now great stuff I've tried a couple of their products so that's what their CBD showers look like this one is well it's gonna be kind of hard for it to focus there but I got berry cereal I've gotten the mosa and I've got watermelon og okay and then let's talk about the dang clean dang clean see if it is here up guys so this is the choppin screwed cherry flavour okay and I've also had the great cadet I think it's called or great something there they're great flavored and both of flavors are really awesome I think I like the grape more than I like to cherry though that's just personal preference right now they do have another one which is citrus I haven't tried that one yet but it's next so you know you'll be seeing that a lot for me if you follow me on Instagram so this year guys this some Fuego fire I can't wait to tell you about this we're gonna talk about shadow first so this shatter so I've got the berry cereal you crack it open and it smells like fruit loops or something like that I mean it's just straight like breakfast bowl full of cereal milk its oh my gosh guys I mean that's exactly what it smells like and when you dab this stuff that's exactly how it days it tastes like I love this in the morning when I wake up or when I'm getting ready to hit hit off for the day take a big old fat dab of some berry cereal it's like breakfast in your lungs basically is what it is it's pretty awesome same thing with this mimosa this mimosa is probably my favorite strain so far I've only tried these three let's try the berry cereal the mimosa and the watermelon og so far the mimosas absolute favorite oh my gosh it's like it's like a citrusy tangy kind of orange smell with like a just like a hint of something funky on the end that makes me like oh ooh that's a good smelling stuff and it tastes the same way when you vape this and your banger and it oh my gosh it's just thick orange citrusy funky type of taste that mimosa is awesome and I love the effect I get from the mimosa we'll talk about the smells and then we'll go back over the effects real quick and then last but not least the watermelon oh gee what a melon oh geez awesome smells like so you know some things that they're supposed to be watermelon flavored then it has that like artificial watermelon smell this ain't it this smells like you just cut open a watermelon but then like let it sit out for a day it's kind of funky watermelon so that that's some awesome smelling turfs right there now the CBD is all basically CBD isolate but with terpenes added I do feel like I get effects from different types of effects and I attribute that to maybe the turf terpene profiles having different things maybe it's just in my head it probably is I feel like I get different effects like the phrases the mimosa being type of feeling like motivated energetic focus it doesn't get you high because it's on a there's mold I think they say there's zero THC in these it's under 0.3 percent THC federal legal limit so there you're not getting high but the feeling you get from this one most likes it's very energetic and uplifting focused definitely love this mimosa for in the mornings the same with the berry cereal I love it in the morning it's great first thing it gives me a very kind of uplifting but more relaxed whereas the mimosa was like yeah and the barracks feels kind of like yeah it's a little different you know like a more energetic with them of oh so the very cereal I'm like okay well I'm gonna go get [ __ ] and [ __ ] done today but I'm gonna be as energetic as may be with them about the watermelon og and I'll again guys this might all just be in my head I could just be a rambling idiot the water oh my god the watermelon oh gee I actually prefer the watermelon og like in the evenings and the reason I like it in the evenings not because it gives me more of a indica ish effect but because the way it makes me feel is like just super calm and I almost just don't give a [ __ ] about anything it's like I like I'm just content with life and everything's great when I hit this watermelon og relaxed definitely helps with my medical pains all these Hubble Medical paints makes it more bearable to go day-to-day takes it away or makes me not care as much about it so this one oh no jeez great for that too they have a couple more terpene profiles they got like Sour Diesel I think they got a Swedish Fish which I'm not huge on the Swedish Fish candy but I'm gonna try the CBD shiner maybe I changed my mind I think they have one more I have to check but like some $45 a gram for this stuff guys you got to go check that out it's awesome now let's talk about this dang clean 200 milligrams infused CBD in this dang clean and

remember stay positive stay medicated Hans AB", "sIwztZwvt7M": "all right hey good afternoon this is the healthy skeptics live for Monday the 19th of June over the weekend bombshell in the news you saw it I saw it everybody saw it the first one is coconut isn't healthy it's never been healthy says the USA Today that was quickly followed by a headline this morning a new study confirms that coconut oil is alarmingly high in saturated fat so we have a controversy as they would say in England and we would say a controversy nevertheless the point is what's going on and so we're gonna discuss this sign so you know fasten your seat belt take notes because this is important information we're gonna look at this from from a very critical side and at the same time the very common-sense side number one atherosclerosis the gradual clogging of blood vessels in the human body is a natural course of Aging it happens to everyone to some degree and this is what we're talking about because we're talking about you know oils and fats and blood fats and and you're talking about atherosclerosis how do I know that atherosclerosis is a natural you know process of Aging they think Otzi the the 5,000 year old hunter and gathering that they dug out of a sure in in Austria when they it was so perfectly fell into a crevasse after he was shot with an arrow and the guy was so quickly frozen when they dug him out of that out of that glacier 5,000 years later they could tell what he had for lunch now he was a hunter and gatherer you can't get much more natural than that and odds he had after all sclerosis so that's how we know that this is a natural process of aging as your blood vessels gradually get clogged so can we accelerate that you sure can triple bacon cheeseburgers stay that american diet will accelerate atherosclerosis heart disease is still the number one cause of death in the Western world by far but can you D can you decrease that can you reduce your risk for atherosclerosis the answer is absolutely yes so the controversy regarding coconut oil started with a American Heart Association a presidential advisory report called dietary fats and cardiovascular disease now you gotta understand that when a report like this comes out it doesn't just go out to scientists and doctors it goes out to journalists and so journalists at the at the USA Today said well gee that's terrible that that means that anything that is high in saturated fats is going to cause heart disease and look at that coconut oil is high in saturated fats now when you actually go to the report and and I invite you to do that here's what you're gonna find you're gonna find in the abstract for example statements like this in summary randomized control trials that lowered intake of dietary saturated fat and replaced it with polyunsaturated vegetable oil or by the way monounsaturated fats like olive oil achieved a 30% reduction in cardiovascular disease CVD cardiovascular disease a 30% reduction similar to the reduction achieved by statins so as good as the leading drug in reducing CVD risk was simply a reduction in saturated fat intake you got that now does that mean that automatically you have to completely avoid coconut oil because it in fact contains saturated fats No here is the the important point and this is a syllogism and you might remember that from either logic or mathematics a syllogism right a equals B be equal C therefore a equals C now that's absolutely true in mathematics is it always true in science no you have to be careful the syllogism that the USA Today folks were using and the syllogism that a lot of the authors of the American Heart Association study were using goes as follows LDL is raised low-density lipoprotein is raised by saturated fats that's true so a does equal be high LDL contributes to heart disease and that's also true and we're and I hope you don't disagree with that because those are numbers that have been it derived from millions of autopsies so high LDL is associated with coronary vascular disease risk all right but does that automatically mean that coconut oil because coconut oil is high in saturated fat does that automatically mean the coconut oil increases your risk for heart disease and the answer is we don't know because they didn't study that they always studied other sources of highly saturated fats so yeah the triple bacon cheeseburger right yeah in all of that the stuff that we know that is gonna be artery clogging probably you should avoid that or minimize that yeah I'll I'll give you that but I won't give you is that automatically we have to avoid coconut oil here's why when you look at the the study from the British Journal of nutrition which we posted on the healthy skeptics about six months ago in our ignore Explorer so members to the healthy skeptics get something every day called ignore explore this was the Explorer topic a couple months ago it's from the British Journal of nutrition so unlike you can read along with me unlike most other dietary fats that are high in long-chain fatty acids coconut oil comprises medium chain fatty acids or medium chain triglycerides mcps they're unique in that they are easily absorbed and metabolized by the liver and can be converted to ketones ketone bodies are an important alternative users for the brain and may be beneficial to people developing or already with memory impairment as in Alzheimer's disease now keep in mind that this British Journal of nutrition this report is is a is a summary of read may read that with me potential mechanisms of action so they're saying that hey coconut oil might be good for your brain and what did they use what's the logic they used the same logic it's this syllogism in other words the British Journal of nutrition is saying hey medium chain triglycerides are fabulous for your brain is that true absolutely B equals C coconut oil contains medium-chain triglycerides that's true too but does that automatically mean that if you want to take care of your brain you ought to be eating spoonfuls of coconut oil no it doesn't mean that but it also means that this it's part of a highly very natural for giant coconut I'm confident in saying can be used safely and with benefit as part of a highly very natural foods diet what we have to continually avoid is this idea that there is a panacea or that there is a miracle the coconut oil miracle by Bruce v nd no coconut oil is that a miracle even though we wanted to be because we want there to be a penisy and we want there to be one thing that we can consume that was going to prevent our you know our heart attack is going to prevent us from having you know dementia and it's going to prevent us from from getting fat we want there to be a panacea but there isn't coconut oil is not a panacea nor is this something that you should avoid because it might give you a problem with your elevated LDL that makes sense after getting this this the coconut oil miracle guy I would say that I would say that he fails the the reliable reference healthy skeptics test because again if you're gonna write a book and you're gonna coat the coconut oil miracle and you're not gonna support it with hard data on human beings because the book is filled with like data on animals and test tubes and very little data that I would hang my hat on so please it's not a miracle what what do we know what can we say with confidence what we can say with confidence is know your numbers okay know your numbers this is where this is where you can look at these numbers because again this data is pulled data now when you go and you have a blood test and and your doctor gives you advice regarding your numbers the doctors relying on it and the lab is relying on pooled numbers from millions of people including a lot of dead people who died of heart disease so what we have to do is know your number number one know your total cholesterol right now you've heard me say before that cholesterol is just one indicator all right and so and I'm not saying that cholesterol doesn't matter but it only matters in relationship to the other numbers so that again because I don't want any confusion here I'm not saying that cholesterol doesn't matter I'm saying that it only matters in relationship to other numbers what are those other numbers your HD on your high density lipoprotein so these are these are this is called the good cholesterol and when you have elevated HDL you don't worry so much about the total cholesterol if it's below 240 so that makes sense so then you've got the total cholesterol HDL ratio and that's easy and the lab you know when you get your blood test in the lab does that for you the laboratory will say here's your cholesterol and here's your HDL and if you divide your total cholesterol by your HDL you get a ratio and if that ratio is below 3.5 you're in good shape alright I would even say hey optimal is under 3 I have cholesterol level about 200 do I worry about that no because my HD last year was the highest of any male tested in the state of Washington now so when you look at my cardiovascular risk even though my cholesterol is hanging out at 200 if you divide that by my HDL you get a number which is like 2.5 which is considered to be spectacular thank you very much that's why my insurance company loves me the point is then what else do you need to look at your LDL in other words your LDL is what's called the bad cholesterol and because saturated fats raise HD a raise LDL that's what happened to all this controversy now what we have to understand is that coconut oil even though it contains a large amount of saturated fats can increase HDL as well hmm so you see that we shouldn't just automatically throw on our coconut oil we shouldn't automatically throw in our coconut milk right coconut is an important and valuable part of a highly varied natural college diet now I put down here and you need to look at that too because your progressive doctor may also not just look at the LDL number your progressive doctor somebody that's really up on there their biochemistry well want to look at the particle size of those LDLs and the particle size is important because the small dense LDL will increase your risk for heart attack by about three times that means a 300% increase in your risk if your LDL is primarily the small dense particles so a progressive doctor will want to look at that and not just look at the number of low-density lipoprotein particles that make sense and the last thing of course is you need to look at your triglycerides your triglycerides now what our triglycerides let's spend a moment so that we all get this because this is part of your risk of dying of a heart attack triglycerides where do they come from mostly they come from a food you eat so that when you eat more starches and sugars then you have a need for metabolically right what happens is your liver goes oh look at that we don't need that energy because I haven't heard from the muscles in like you know three so but at the same time oh dang I got no place to put this energy so the liver system I'll save it for later now how does it save it all right they do starches and sugars get reduced by digestion - what glucose and then the liver takes that glucose tags it with three fatty acids and makes a triglyceride get it triglyceride glycerine and three fatty acids and takes that little bundle and and stores it in the liver and then also stores it where in your bloodstream so your triglycerides are a storage form of energy that you need to use once in a while and how do you use triglycerides you burn them through this thing called exercise right exercise you heard me say it once I'll say it a thousand times you cannot succeed in in your endeavor to remain healthy and happy without consistent exercise that will not only burn up triglycerides but will do a thousand other things now at the same time you have to look at what your level of starches and sugars in your diet because even if you exercise you can eat so much starch that your triglycerides will in fact end up being elevated and that's a risk factor for heart disease the triglycerides think of them as waxy substances right it's waxy and Natalie talks about a few patients where you spin down their blood and a centrifuge and you look at the blood and you may as well just stick on wicken it and light it because it'll be a good candle their triglycerides just so I all right where do you want your triglycerides to be Malad we'll say under 150 I'll say under 100 your your triglycerides should be in double digits mine usually are like 40 why because I don't need a lot of starches and sugars all right and I exercise I don't exercise a lot but I avoid sugar like the plague it is alright and when you're good at that when you're good at avoiding the donuts the cookies the candies the cakes the sugars that when you're good at doing that your triglycerides will tend to fall into that optimal range which is double digits last slide really quick again was what taken right from the American Heart Association report the triglyceride factor look at this dietary carbohydrates raise plasma triglyceride levels by increasing the production by the liver of triglycerides and subsequent incorporation into very low-density lipoproteins here it is the magnitude of that dietary carbohydrate increasing plasma triglycerides is similar whether the carbohydrate has a high or low glycemic index so for all you starchy holics out there who are consuming tons of bread and in tons of crackers and tons of chips because you think that they're not as bad for you as the sugar that you put in your coffee right because those are not simple sugars those are complex starches throw you Carbajal except they're no it's gonna raise your triglyceride levels just the same as if you're eating spoonfuls of sugar so know your numbers know your numbers I hope I've given you a good sense of where we're at not only with the coconut controversy but I hope I've given you a sense of how to look at the numbers on your blood chemistry with a little more knowledge and understanding because don't forget your conventional doctor is likely to take your blood test and simply say you're normal put it in your file and that's it do not let your doctor do that because you want to know all the numbers you want to chart those numbers you want to follow those numbers from year to year and that's how you take responsibility for your health well last in closing statement and then we're gonna we're gonna end our session this afternoon it's important for you to remember or know or understand that 50% of fatal heart attacks have very little to do with atherosclerosis 50% of fatal heart attacks are due to a sudden cardiac arrest a sudden crest where the guy walking down the street clutches his heart falls on the sidewalk and dies now how many people does that happen to every day a thousand a day about a thousand people every day died of a sudden cardiac arrest and that has to do mostly with the electrical conductivity and the electrical impulses that go through your heart the rhythm of your heart and when that rhythm is upset and and dysregulated the heart goes into an arrest a spasm in which case only 5% of people survive a thousand people a day only 5% survive 75% of these are men ooh what does that mean we're going to talk about that tomorrow tune in tomorrow to find out why 75% of acute cardiac arrest patients are men find out how you can prevent that and live a much happier and healthier long life this is Steven Ernest key for the healthy skeptics thanks for tuning in today we'll see you again tomorrow at noon", "lB-crKr3a5c": "okay thanks for joining me tonight this particular presentation is called physical and behavioral problems often seen in autism troubleshooting these issues and then suggestions for intervention this is a presentation that I have done in the past matter of fact many of the presentations that I've done over the past year are actually available on as movie files and you can also access the color slides to each of these presentations at this particular website autism seminars on demand so this particular presentation is actually available through that website if you'd like a copy of the slides or like to get a more high quality movie recording of this particular presentation before we get started let me just give you some some tips here on some educational material that I've used in my practice and I want you to know about two books these are excellent resource books for you to have in your library the one on the left effective biomedical treatments from dr. Pangborn and Baker this is not a book that you would read from cover to cover but an excellent book to look at with respects to questions about supplements you know issues related to behavior testing some of the biochemistry with respects to biomedical intervention and then the book by dr. Shah the biological treatments for autism is PDD this is one of the first books that I read many many years ago this is a newer version both can be you know accessed through Amazon you can get the biological treatments book from dr. Shah through Great Plains this website two really good books to have in your library I also have a number of online resources autism recovery treatment is a blog site a video blog site where I record video transcribe those videos into articles and then placed here on this site this is all free information and then I also have a very interactive parent subscription website where you as a parent where a caregiver of an individual of autism can really reach me 24/7 through this website through an interactive parent forum doesn't matter where you are in the United States I work with people you know and answer questions for people around the world and it's a great place just from the stand point if you have questions when a troubleshoot you know things ideas on testing questions you may have respects to different therapies that's what this particular site is for I also have many of the recorded webinars on this site too as well as the PDF files that can be downloaded of each you know individual presentation and the color slides for future reference I also recently released a book called autism recovery book.com title is autism the road recovery it's an e-book that you can access if you want to learn more about things that I've discussed things that I discuss through this presentation things that could be found through this book at autism recovery book calm and as I mentioned before the autism seminars ondemand.com is where many of these presentations were re-recorded in a movie file that is downloadable as well as the PDF slides and then finally if you want to just get more information about me you can go to dr. Waller com this is sort of my official website it's the hub of the wheel if you will that has links to many of the other different websites that I have online okay so let's go ahead and get started here what we're going to talk about is common issues seen with kids in the spectra I'm going to troubleshoot some of these problems I'll come up with some treatment suggestions that can help overcome some of the behavioral and physical issues it's always important no matter you know what information you get online whether it's from me and other doctor etc is to discuss some of these supplement recommendations so the medication therapies that come forth with your own child's physician really before trying to implement some of the stuff on your own so we're going to go through a number of thing as we'll talk about abdominal bloating an aggression anxiety diarrhea looks like there's some typos on this that I missed irritability tantrums you know regression issues sleep issues and if you've heard this presentation before I'm really gonna just sort of talk about these things in general but then also give specific things that I've seen in my practice some things that I want you to think about instead of trying to read each individual slide to you that gets pretty boring I really just want to have a discussion with you um things that I've experienced in my practice clinically over the years so I want you to walk away from this presentation with some some things in your back pocket that you can think about with respects to your child when you talk about abdominal bloating there are a number of things to consider and and the first thing that I think about clinically in my practice when I have a child come in who is just distended with in the abdominal area first thing I think of is gas and we know that yeast and bacteria can produce gas specifically yeast and we know that yeast and bread is what causes that expansion so one of the differential diagnosis is for distended abdomen would be a ye and overgrowth of yeast constipation can also be a problem in that backup of stool in the lower bowel can cause the bowel to become swollen and that also can lead to a distended abdomen to also constipation can become a breeding ground for yeast so many kids who actually had are constipated will oftentimes have an overgrowth of yeast and bacteria as well sometimes it gets to the point where it's so significant you need to have some Diagnostics done to you know take a look from an abdominal x-ray to see actually how much stool is actually down in the digestive system so descended abdomen certainly constipation yeast and bacteria some kids actually have a deficiency or the inability to make adequate amount of digestive enzymes there's not a specific test that we have for this that is a hundred percent definitive you can do a comprehensive digestive stool analysis Great Planes has a CDSA test that actually looks at elastase levels which is a reflection of pancreas enzyme output but many times just doing a trial of digestive enzymes can be helpful pep desired enzyme prime are two enzymes that I've used quite a bit in my practice peptide is really more specific for the gluten in the case in zine Prime is a more all-around digestive enzyme for protein fats and carbohydrates these are both from houston enzymes they come in a capsule as well as chewable generally one capsule is equivalent to about two to three chewable taken with meals or large snacks some kids have a hydrochloric acid deficiency difficult to test for and using hydrochloric acid supplementation you have to be cautious particularly with little kids who can't swallow a tablet or a capsule you don't want them chewing a hydrochloric acid capsule or tablet because it can damage their teeth so it's not something that I've used all that commonly in my practice another thing to consider with respects to persistent abdominal distension is just chronic inflammation you may be dealing with a situation where your child has some type of inflammatory bowel problem a lack of intestinal motility is present in some kids it generally can be picked up through endoscopy or colonoscopy where they can you know look at look at the surface lining of the gut sometimes doing further diagnostic testing to look for intestinal motility problems is needed to be done it's not commonly done with kids on the spectrum just because it tends to be more invasive but a lack of intestinal motility can manifest with some kids as constipation so when we're talking about constipation ideally we should all be having a bowel movement for every meal we eat the reality is that doesn't happen so even in most adults if kids are having to mount bowel movements a day that's great many times I'll just take one bowel movement a day the reality is is that we need to get the stool out if we have any hint of constipation the constipation is only going to become a problem with respects to an overgrowth of yeast and bacteria and the bowel toxins that come from that so getting the stool out is of critical importance one of the things that I've seen you know over the years is that many times constipation can lead to aggressive behavior can lead to irritability can lead to moodiness for one what aspect of it is constipation is uncomfortable it causes pressure sometimes pain and then again if we have any sort of concern with respects to yeast or bacteria the constipation is just going to make things worse the ideal thing with respects to stools is that the stool should pass easily they don't necessarily shouldn't come out as a hard log and they shouldn't be real loose but soft and consistency and passed without much effort is ideal various constipating foods breads pasta pizza potatoes cornstarch bananas this will all increase constipation for many children couple of the things to think about with respects to constipation or persistent constipation again yeast and bacteria can cause constipation they can cause diarrhea too but they can also cause constipation parasites as well specifically worms pin worms round worms come to mind you're gonna be hard-pressed to do a stool test and actually find a worm they don't show up very often on stool testing but there are some hints that worms may be present one of them would be chronic constipation another a child who's constantly itching their bottom another is coughing in the morning morning coughing or clearing of the throat can be indicative of worms one of the tell-tale signs or at least one of the suspicious symptoms that seems to occur with worms is a worsening of behavior during the full moon so this is this has been known about now for many many years and as a big suspicion for worm infections not only with you with kids on the spectrum but but a lot of individuals but certainly with kids on the spectrum if there is a clear consistent pattern of a worsening of their behavior during the full moon it's it's pretty suggestive that there may be an underlying worm problem couple different remedies vormax which is also called mob end Azam he is a prescription medication that has been used for pinworms and roundworms 100 200 milligram chewable tablet given 1 twice daily for 3 days usually what I do is I'll give a ver mocks for 3 days wait two weeks and then repeat that dose it's generally easy to take their true but I don't see really any problems with them new beginnings carries some anti-parasitic herbs black walnut extract for example comes to mind after one dropper full 2 to 3 times daily you know for a couple weeks it's not a bad option usually though if I suspect pinworms or roundworms I'm going to be looking to use something like ver box because the reality is is that it tends to work so well couple other things to consider with respects to constipation and remedies for it high dose vitamin C is an option matter of fact this has been a longtime nature Pathak remedy in using ascorbic acid as a powder to what's called bowel tolerance where you just give ever increasing amounts of vitamin C because you can reach a certain point and it has a laxative effect it's not dose dependent based on age or weight its Jo's dependent on what you need to get the job done it could be a thousand milligrams it could be two it could be 10 it could be 20 I had one child that needed 20,000 milligrams of vitamin C in a 24 hour period of time to finally open the floodgates if you will with respects to a persistent constipation problem probiotics have an added benefit not only do they add to the intestinal flora of beneficial bacteria in the gut but if you use a lot of them they can actually cause loose fools so high-dose probiotics can actually have a laxative effect which is beneficial for an individual with constipation again it's not dose dependent based on age or weight it just is a natural reaction of the body to high dose probiotics in some individuals I always like magnesium whether it's citrate or oxide as a remedy for constipation I use that quite a bit 250 to 500 milligrams daily I usually will give it at bedtime so that we can have or at least attempt to have a bowel movement in the morning if possible and then other things to try would be you know aloe vera juice fiber supplements like flax seeds psyllium seeds apple pectin I can't say that any one of these works better than the others and some of it has to do with consistency some of it has to do with taste some of it has to do with what mixes well in a you know para sauce applesauce or a smoothie that your particular child will like another option actually is magnesium you can do magnesium tube al tall it's just like you can vitamin C to bowel tolerance usually don't have to use as much so some kids do you know do fine at 250 others at 500 Summits 750 milligrams I try not to use more than a thousand milligrams of vitamin C either in citrate or oxide on a daily basis for kids so if I was gonna do about tolerance remedy magnesium first ascorbic acid likely lean towards ascorbic acid and then just try to use a regular dose of magnesium you know 250 to 500 milligrams as some added benefit the one thing that you might be consider if you're gonna consider something like ascorbic acid is if your child has some type of known oxalate problem if there is an obsolete concern well then using real high-dose vitamin C is probably not the best thing for them so you know other options can come into play but the bottom line here is is just try to you got to get the poop out and that also means to some some kids need enemas some kids need suppositories to do it true fiber is a great product I really like true fiber since I started using it it's a digestible fiber it's also a prebiotic essentially it's a fertilizer if you will for the good bacteria in the gut one to two tablespoons excuse me one to two teaspoons or a tablespoon daily seems to work well for most kids just as an added product to help with constipation keeping kids hydrated as I mentioned before sometimes need to do laxatives sometimes they need to do an enema you know for two to three days to help unload the lower bowel is really important one thing to keep in mind with respects to constipation there are some kids who appear to be having a bowel movement every day so they actually you know maybe you know produce a three to four to five inch piece of stool and it looks like they're having a normal bowel movement but they still remain really distended their abdomens hard and appear swollen but if you look at their tests they may not have really high levels of yeast or bacteria but if you were to do an x-ray you'll often see in some of these kids a bowel that's overloaded with stool so what's happening well what they're doing is they're pinching off a small section of a larger piece of stool so technically they're constipated but they're actually producing a section of stool every day but they're not completely evacuating the lower bowel this is why when you're dealing with constipation many times if you suspect that there's fecal plug a large section of stool in the lower bound usually you can tell because it comes out really hard and dry which means it's been sitting there a while and the lower intestine has been absorbing the water this is why in some case it's actually better to do some type of a suppository one time daily for 24 hours and 48 hours or you know over a three to four day period of time to try to unplug the lower intestine and then your other remedies whether it's magnesium or vitamin C or aloe vera juice or whatever it may be has a better chance of working throughout the gut so it's sort of trying to unplug the drain before you know adding things to sort try to push stool through the digestive tract so if you're still running into a problem of constipation despite the probiotics despite the fiber just bite the magnesium you're probably dealing with a situation where your child has a fecal plug way down in the lower bowel let's switch gears here and talk about diarrhea what are some things to consider with respects to diarrhea well certainly the number one thing on the list would be infections yeast can cause diarrhea more commonly bacteria and parasites will cause diarrhea and there's a pattern that you need to be pay attention to is the diarrhea continuous or I should say diarrhea and neither lose stools to okay it doesn't necessarily have to be full auto really just be loose stools is it continuous is it intermittent is the cyclical or does it alternate between diarrhea and constipation usually diarrhea loose stools is an underlying sign of an infection inflammation in allergy you so if it's continuous think of either chronic inflammation some type of inflammatory bowel problem or a bacterial infection if it's intermittent which means it only happens once in a while it's likely related to some type of food intolerance if it's cyclical okay so maybe it occurs every 7 to 10 days or every 14 to 10 do it 14 to 21 days maybe it only hangs around for about three days and the stools firm up and then it cycles back usually highly suspicious of a parasitic infection whether that's Giardia Cryptosporidium entamoeba histolytica some type of parasite okay alternating diarrhea and constipation that gets a little more tricky certainly could be an infection chronic inflammation could also play a role you could also be dealing with stool impaction I had a case many years ago of a child who had severe constipation but it appeared like he was having loose stools because periodically you would have this loose stools emerge until an x-ray was done and actually found that he had a softball-sized fecal plug in the lower bowel so what's happening was was he was leaking stool around the fecal plug and it wasn't until we got the fecal plug out that his bowel started to normalize some kids unfortunately have persistent ongoing bowel problems where they really need to be scoped they need a diagnostic workup from a pediatric gastroenterologist a specialist to evaluate what the heck is going on and this generally requires ended osku pee to look down the esophagus into the stomach as well as a colonoscopy to look at the large intestine and in some kids doing what's called a PillCam evaluation where the camera the size of a pill capsule is deposited into the upper testin and then it moves its way through the bowel child wears a belt that that receives the images from the camera and that helps to identify more insidious problems occurring in the small bowel and that's something that dr. Craig's Minh does Craig's Minh is a pediatric gastroenterologist in Texas who is an expert at doing thorough GI evaluation gastrointestinal evaluation for kids on the spectrum so a couple things just to consider there with respects to diarrhea oh by the way let me just go back real quickly in when you're talking about parasitic infections and this is not a particular a specific talk on parasites but two very common medications that are that have a cross ability of covering different parasites one is flagyl flagyl you've probably heard of with respects to Clostridium bacterial treatment another is called Alinea both are confound at most compounding of excuse me most pharmacies Alinea is still in a patent I do not believe it can be compounded flagyl can Alinea is very specific for Giardia very specific for Cryptosporidium flagyl is also very good for amoebic parasites not so good for Cryptosporidium does pretty well for Giardia does a good job for bacteria such as clostridia flagyl is going to be much cheaper much more readily available much more ability to get it covered through insurance Alinea not so much it's not used as much but aleni is a very good pair up antibiotic specifically for Giardia and Cryptosporidium but it's more expensive so you know a couple options if this comes up for you if you've got a test you've got suspicion you've got questions on these types of things this is where you can actually reach me through my autism action plan com website through the parent forum you can post me these questions there and I'll be happy to go through a lot more of this information with you in greater detail let's switch our gears to anxiety another huge problem with kids on the spectrum it's not an easy condition to treat there are a number of natural remedies that may be helpful and I say maybe because they're not universally helpful unfortunately and usually it's not just one remedy sometimes it's a number of these things in combination I can't give you a specific amount based on age or weight again with these supplements they're really dosed I'm really on need so you have to start somewhere and then adjust it as you go gaba is a calming neurotransmitter in the brain it has been helpful for some conditions with respect to anxiety anywhere between 500 to 5,000 milligrams usually in my practice about you know 2 to 3 thousand milligrams per day does a good job some kids need a higher amount and again it's not universally helpful but it is a pretty darn good first start if you're looking for a supplement to help with anxiety theanine is an X is an extract of green tea theanine at you know hundred milligrams to 400 milligrams per day works pretty well in association with GABA inositol powder is an interesting supplement comes events from new beginnings about 700 milligrams per dose comes as a powder it's easy to mix in water easy to mix and dilute juice it actually has been studied with respects to obsessive-compulsive disorder it's been an effective treatment for anxiety in association with gaba and i've also found it to be selectively helpful for some states of with respect to obsessive compulsive behavior again not universally but it's something to consider magnesium has a role in anxiety it doesn't work by itself as well as gaba specifically for anxiety 5htp has some usefulness to 5htp is a supplement that actually is a precursor to serotonin again not a specific dose based on age or weight you know one to two capsules a couple times a day is not a bad place to start you have to be cautious though something to talk over with your physician if your child is taking what's called an SSRI medication a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor prozac Zoloft paxil you need to be cautious with 5htp because you may just drive too much serotonin which is not a good thing a couple of the things that I've actually had some good success with with respect to anxiety particularly social anxiety generalized anxiety is oxytocin I actually have entire presentations that go into oxytocin much more in-depth the nasal spray is not a bad option most of the compounding pharmacies carry at Hopewell Park pharmacy wellness least cells be the nasal spray works mostly pretty good for older kids for smaller kids they're not too happy with a nasal spray this is where an oxytocin tablet is going to be a little bit more effective again the dosing isn't based on age or weight so much as just a starting point if I'm using a tablet I'll generally start with a 5 unit tablet and I'll give it a couple times a day and then if I can do a nasal spray I may use the nasal spray as a as a in another emergency but as the therapy you might use in limited circumstances because it has a pretty quick onset let's say a child has a problem going to the mall or going to a restaurant but they get real anxious many times using a nasal spray in the moment can help decrease anxiety very quickly and you know it could be one to two sprays per nostril to get the job done so oxytocin has been a nice addition to biomedical intervention specifically with respect to generalized anxiety and social anxiety because the social part is that oxytocin in the brain helps to increase the facial recognition voice cue emotional recognition with people a couple of the things that have been helpful for anxiety one is respin a which I'll talk about shortly and then namenda onda Minda is actually a medication that's been used for Alzheimer's patients and it actually has been helpful for some cases with respects to anxiety respite a is a remedy that's been around now for about about four years I've been using my practice and it actually is a disc that's worn on the skin in that disc is a very small amount of something called brucer pain reser pain comes from the indian herb rural wall via a long time ago low wall via as a bulk herb was used for hypertension there was a study back in the mid 50's that used a liquid or or an herbal elixir an oral suspension of high-dose recipient ism and what they found was these kids had greatly improved socialization which environmental awareness less sensory issues across the board the problem was is they had some side effects to some of the kids became irritable because of it some of them had what probably was from low blood calcium where they got cramping and became agitated because reserpine is actually known to decrease blood calcium levels they're not the rest Binet but the or elixir researching can do that and so there's some special circumstances some of the kids over time became real emotional well they likely became that because what was happening was was the restore Pinos up regulating a specific enzyme called mao a an mao a is responsible for serotonin metabolism and over time if you're not replacing your stores of serotonin you can start to run a deficit and this can lead to irritability moodiness emotional instability let's fast forward and talk about respin a because respin a is low dose researching delivered through a disc it's not a high dose herbal oral elixir and so the side effects if they do occur are much more stable and much more low-key the benefits that have been observed with respects to RESPA may really fall into two major categories improvement in socialization where the kids are more engaged with the family more willing to participate more empathetic they're happier they many times just are overall improved in their mood and then in some kids they have more complex speech more deliberate and specific speech i haven't seen in a situation where a child went from being completely nonverbal to speaking but kids who at least had some language some words started to speak more side effects with respects to respin a hyperness very common with many different biomedical interventions nothing that's too extreme some kids have become irritable that's likely because of its influence on calcium moodiness emotional and depressed that's why when we use resume we make sure kids are getting enough protein or using supplements like 5htp or tryptophan for serotonin support I had one child that had increased stemming because of respin a but you know again that's that's not real common overall respin a has been a very favorable treatment it's something that you have to study it's something that you have to look into it's not a it's not a treatment that doesn't require some input on your part what I mean by that is it's not just about putting the disc on the skin and walking away putting the disc of respin a on your child's skin is easy but you also have to take some supportive supplements with it calcium needs to be taken at a certain amount we found out you know over time from the main researcher an innovator with respects to respin a elaine d lack that many times we have to modify other supplements modify the amount of essential fatty acids kids are getting vitamin D things like curcumin all can have an inhibiting effect on the effectiveness arrest but at least early on also b6 magnesium calcium as I mentioned and inositol are supportive supplements to rest Benes effectiveness so many times those have to be used to to help resume work more optimally so it takes a little bit of time to learn how to work with it a little bit of tweaking but overall it's been a very very encouraging treatment and something that I've used quite a bit and continue to use in my practice so if you want to learn more about respin a you can go to their website which is WWE and that's our es P and - a.com I also have a section on respin a in my autism action plan site as well okay what about gluten infraction what are some things to consider here what are some things to watch out for and this would also be for casein as well a couple things to have on hand if you know your child is extremely sensitive to gluten extremely sensitive to case in then I'll make sure I'd have some pepcid ac on hand you can get this over-the-counter this is only going to work by the way if it's if they if you can catch the infraction right away anywhere between a quarter to a half a tablet taken immediately after ingestion well many times nullify the negative reactions from gluten or casein epson salt cream as well as epson salt baths can be helpful this is something that can be done even if you didn't catch it immediately I wouldn't say days later but if within a couple hours putting add some salt cream on the skin um or doing an Epsom salt bath I learned from a parent a long time ago her child had an extreme sensitivity to gluten and whenever the child had an infraction she would put her child in the bathtub with about Oh about three to four inches of water and she would supersaturated that since salt you know use about four to five cups which is actually quite a bit in a small amount of water and should ever child sit in it and she swore by this that it helped to nullify the negative reactions that her child would have to gluten some kids skin is really sensitive I mean magnesium sulfate is a salt so you know it can be a little bit itchy and a little bit irritating so just you know be aware of that the things that are worthwhile I've had parents who carry around a bottle of Pepto side peptide is that Houston enzyme that is specific for gluten and casein digestion again you know this has to be an immediate this isn't something where they eat gluten and then you know six hours later you give a pep design it's not going to do anything some parents carry activated charcoal to help bind up the gluten casein right away immediately after exposure alka-seltzer gold can be used kind of similar principle as the pepcid ac essentially what you're trying to do is just neutralize the acids so that the peptides of the gluten encase and don't get broken down readily and then absorbed so a couple options there by the way if you're gonna do alka-seltzer gold it's got to be the it's got to be the gold it can't just be regular alka-seltzer so I think you know the probably the easiest thing to do is carry around an extra bottle of the peptide enzymes and if you know your child is really sensitive the pepcid ac is a good way to go okay hand flapping you know there's not one specific treatment for hand flopping and I realized that hand flapping can be situational okay it can just be a behavior that a child has because they're excited about something watching a video watching a TV show whatever it may be something that's just a situational but sometimes hand flapping has been associated with toxicity and sometimes dietary infractions ammonia is known to cause hand flapping ammonia for most kids on the spectrum is going to be generated by bacterial dysbiosis in the gut and protein mal digestion in the gut it's not always some type of internal biochemical urea cycle problem so a couple of things tickets with respects to that if you are suspicious that your child is hand flapping because primarily of bal toxicity it goes back to those bowel remedies activator charcoal to help bind up intestinal toxins once to twice a day whenever you do activated charcoal be cautious because activated charcoal can be a constipating agent so you need to work on things to prevent it i usually when i prescribed activated charcoal will also prescribe magnesium and again i'll use 250 to 500 ohms a day with activated charcoal used to try to prevent as best i can the constipation alpha q2 glute eric acid is a supplement that you can get from new beginnings it has been helpful in trying to helpful in reducing ammonia levels in the body whether they're coming internally for protein mal digestion or bacterial dysbiosis it's not universally helpful unfortunately but it is something to consider again percentage-wise for most kids their bacterial issue excuse me there ammonia issue is going to be gut related in in the vast majority of cases that I've seen so again look at constipation protein digestion problems you know even yeast overgrowth digestive enzymes working on the gut hyperactivity probably one of them the more troublesome things to try to try to figure out and help particularly from a supplement standpoint can be extremely difficult I mean quite challenging the first thing I think about with any kid who is hyperactive is diet so some type of food sensitivity whether it's to wheat soy dairy sugar intolerance you know what's their diet like with respect to sugar consumption juices sodas a biggie is artificial colors and flavors this is one of the first things I try to do is talk to parents respects to hyperactivity is really cleaning up their kids diets and the Feingold Institute you go to Feingold org grant website with regards to information with respects to food dyes and flavoring sensitivities that can trigger things like hyperactivity and it also talks about this this the the link between what are called salicylates and phenols so if you have a hyperactive child nothing else seems to be working you're doing gluten casein free you're doing supplements try to get them off of the the ritalin type medications please please please look at artificial colorings and flavorings the salicylates and the phenol connection through the Feingold Institute a couple of the things that you know can lead to hyperactivity or exacerbate hyperactivity a lack of nutrients so lack of B vitamins a lack of essential fatty acids this is one reason that cholera oil has been around for so long as part of a supplement in many of the introductory supplement programs for kids on the spectrum lack of antioxidants yeast overgrowth some kids are hyper because of yeast not all the time not every kid with yeast is hyperactive and but think of it okay this is why I always recommend doing the organic acid test from Great Planes because it gives you a good insight into yeast and bacterial toxins other metabolic imbalances but it really specifically helps to identify yeast which is such a problem again going back to a lack of nutrients new beginnings Nutritionals has something called a starter packet which includes B vitamins includes essential fatty acids through cod liver oil includes antioxidants a nice place to start some additional things that have been helpful for some kids hyperactivity I wish they were universally helpful but not always the linic acid can be a helpful adjunctive supplement on to kids programs you know usually about 800 milligram excuse me 800 micrograms per day not a bad place to start pycnogenol has had some usefulness in some cases pycnogenol is not one of the first things I think about when I think about hyperactivity taurine can be helpful in association with the linic acid again there's not a specific amount based on age or weight but it's been useful methyl b12 therapy it's interesting some kids actually who are hyperactive do really well with methyl b12 even though one of the most common side effects of methyl b12 therapy whether it's nasal injection oral or the lollipop is hyperactivity but many times what you'll find is there can be slight elevation hyperactivity for a period of time then in the hyperactivity can actually diminish and then you start to see an emergence of eye contact and awareness and sometimes language so methyl b12 therapy is an option Epsom salt bath Epsom salt cream which you talked about earlier with respect to the gluten infractions has been helpful to with respects to hyperactivity and then of course looking at the phenol issue is really really important so I can't give you an exact protocol of you know you know do all ten of these supplements and this for every particular child because it's very individualized but I don't know what I really want you to get a you'll come away with from this particular discussion about hyperactivity is looking at food looking at the diet specifically with respects to the the phenols and the salicylates treatment wise and we can have an entire discussion here you know about Ritalin type medication an interesting remedy which doesn't get a lot of play and doesn't get a lot of interest from parents and and from doctors too is something called the nicotine patch but I wanted to point it out to you just so you knew about it the nicotine patch idea was proposed by doctor Bradstreet number of years ago and what has been found with respects to understanding the biochemistry of nicotine is that its primary mode of activity is that it stimulates thing is called the nicotine receptors which helps control the production of acetylcholine acetylcholine is a part of what's called our cholinergic nervous system it modulates other chemicals in the brain specifically with respects to attention to memory to the speed of mental processing to just an overall improvement in cognitive function and it's also been helpful at reducing hyperactivity in some kids so let's uh let's look at a little bit closer what was being used and what has been used is purchasing a 7 milligram nicotine patch and again this is something that you've considered this is something that I highly encourage people to talk over with their doctor about but we're not using an entire cell 7 milligram patch you're generally only using a quarter to a half of a seven milligram patch one patch is equivalent to 0.15 milligrams of nicotine being delivered per hour a common cigarette provides anywhere between two to three milligrams of nicotine so we're talking about very very low amounts of nicotine applied through the skin over a 24-hour period of time so it's a very low amount delivered in a continuous way to try to stimulate these nicotine receptors and it's been helpful at reducing hyperactivity and some kids as well as focusing issues some kids get some sleep disturbance from it if that's the case the patch can be worn for less period of time maybe 14 to 16 hours a day so it's an interesting remedy that's been helpful for some kids with respects to hyperactivity now and again it could be considered an alternative potentially to the common medications would this be the first thing I would reach for of course not I would be looking at food sensitivities yeast issues nutritional imbalances phenyl salicylate sensitivities I'd go through that entire list first to see if we could get some inroads with respects to hyperactivity before I would even consider her something like a nicotine patch and I would encourage you do the same thing here to Bill we're also now falling into that group of the discussion with respects to aggression a couple things that want you to be aware of in thinking about your child's mood is it continuous or is it intermittent is it situational is it potentially or is it age-appropriate situational what could be some situations that could generate behavioural problems is it only occurring at school if it is occurring at school when is it occurring is it occurring around lunchtime is it occurring after lunchtime maybe it's something to do with their food could it be low blood sugar is there some new kid in class that's bugging them is it occurring with neighbors is it occurring with an aide so one thing is not every problem is related to a medical issue it could just be an environmental problem is it age-appropriate this is gets hard honestly because you can have a six-year-old child on the spectrum who behaves more like a four-year-old so by age they're older but by developmental age they're not so unless you have another child in the family that you can reference things to sometimes it's hard to know but sometimes kids act out behaviorally because of their age of the old terrible two scenario sibling rivalry even though you may have a child on the spectrum that doesn't mean that they're always going to get along with your brother and sister so it doesn't mean necessarily that there's a medical problem it could just be that their brother or sisters bugging them I mean I see it within my family with my my daughter and my son you know sometimes they're gonna fight so that can happen so again can be again diet okay artificial colors flavors he salicylates these phenols found in chemicals I could take this conversation back you know with respect to that to what we just talked about with respects to hyperactivity the same thing B vitamins essential fatty acids antioxidants he's Grover growth but more commonly irritability moodiness Tantrums if it's going to be tied to some kind of biotoxin it's going to be tied more specifically to a bacterial worms may be an issue particularly if you see it around the full moon that's certainly a possibility but more often than not a moody irritable tantrum a type behavior is more bacterial based than it is yeast based so therapies you got to do some investigation and we can start to look at you know things like testing like the organic acid test etc a couple of the things what I've tied into here with respects to irritability and tantrums is would fall into the category of anxiety so many kids who are anxious when they're overly anxious will become irritable and may tantrum okay they can't necessarily tell you but that's what's going on so this then references us back to what are some things that are usable you useful for anxiety the thinning the gaba the inositol they may be helpful aggression again hyperactivity anxiety irritability agitation moodiness now we have aggression same thing is it continuous is it or a mittened is it situational is it happening at school is it happening with neighbors is it happening with an aide it's not always a problem medical wise quick story years ago I had a patient and this is actually a case that I present in my autism the road to recovery book was a boy severely autistic who did you know very well on dietary intervention really really bad behaviors but that what happened was was there was a point in time in treating him where he started to develop a behavior where he would come home from school and 2 hours or whatever was after school he would tantrum so much that he would essentially destroy his bedroom and just you know and essentially go through the home and tip things over throw things and just was out of his mind what we finally found out and what what came of this through the pattern is that it was only occurring Monday through Friday wasn't happening on the weekends well it turns out that what he was having was he was having low blood sugar he was hypoglycemic he wasn't eating his snack at school and he only sporadically ate his lunch so what was happening is when he came home from not having eating his lunch and not having eaten a snack was he was hungry he couldn't tell his mom he is hungry he just lost it and he would tantrum and tantrum until you know finally at some point he ate something interesting is that it wasn't occurring on the weekends because he wasn't in school it was remedied by making sure his teachers knew that he ate if he had to eat something he had to eat his food and then also he need to eat a little something before he headed home and once that was the case no more tantrums same thing here though ok from a biomedical standpoint diet think about diet diet diet is there some type of problem particularly the sensitivity to the phenols and the salicylates allergies is it a possible food allergy or environmental allergy I've had kids who've left their home they go on vacation they do finally come back to their home and they start getting aggressive and irritable could be mold damage not real common but it's something that does happen the other thing you absolutely want to Lou lout and work on and remedy is constipation I've seen more kids develop acute problems with aggression when they become constipated so that whole discussion we had early on about constipation one of the reasons I also recommend doing the organic acid test from Great Planes laboratory is to rule out Clostridium bacteria Clostridium bacteria there's a bunch of these bacteria they produce some of them produce a marker called HP HP a HP HP a will affect dopamine when dopamine becomes erratic it causes erratic behavior and this I've seen this over and over and over again on my practice really really important to assess and to consider there's a wide variety of treatments for Clostridium problems everything from culturelle to sacrum Isis Velarde to the use of flagyl to the use of vancomycin they're very individualized but these these can be effective some kids do okay just on culture well others need antibiotics that's that's the reality comparing flagyl and vancomycin as a treatment flagyl again is going to be more readily available it's going to be cheaper it's also going to have cross coverage too parasitic infections - vancomycin is a very good antibiotic very good against clostridia but it's going to be more expensive and not readily as readily paid for via insurance one thing to consider with respects to cluster T of treatment neither of these antibiotics whether it's flagyl Alinea or vancomycin treat the spores of clostridia cluster t is a spore-forming bacteria this is where you need things more like high dose probiotics taken long term like culturelle or another probiotic like VSL 3 or from custom probiotics the the D lactate free these are the things that are going to help suppress cluster attea long term again more this is more of a discussion we have time for tonight again you can visit me if you'd like for more detailed questions on the the parent forum through the action the autism action plan com website a couple other things to consider with respects to aggression again constipation gut inflammation this is why so many kids have responded well to something like the specific carbohydrate diet is because the sed diet helps to decrease gut inflammation the low oxalate diet or an oxalate issue is another consideration something that you can actually pick up on from the organic acid test as you look at the oxalic acid marker there's a great website Lowe oxalate info oxalates are organic compounds of any mat fan and many different types of foods actually healthy foods that many of us eat but some individuals absorb oxalates to a to a to high degree in many individuals and severe cases it can lead to kidney stones typically what's happening with kids in the spectrum is we're getting an accumulation of oxalates they excrete them through the urine it can cause painful urination but it creates pain and inflammation throughout the body which can impact the brain adversely and we can see aggressive and behavior irritability etc from an oxalate issue bsl-3 high-dose probiotic helps to break down oxalates magnesium and calcium citrate the the situated forms of calcium magnesium are needed to be taken with meals to help bind those oxalates in the gut and then allow them to be excreted the low oxalate dot info site is in depth get much more information there if you detect oxalates on your child's organic acid test or if there's a family history you know that you know of oxalate kidney stones it's always a possibility so the oxalate story is another component another dietary intervention that can be helpful something i think about particularly with kids with just they're irritable all the time they're constantly on edge I think about off the problems also individuals with fibromyalgia certainly it has been associated that oxalates could be a problem with them as well okay what about sleep problems this is one of the first questions that I ask parents is how well is their child sleeping because if a child is not sleeping generally the parents are not sleeping and everyone is tired and everyone is miserable so the lack of sleep is really a high priority of things to try to correct dietary infractions can be a problem again you have to look and say is it because of something a child might be eating is it because of peptides is it because of the gluten soy or dairy is it because of a food allergy is because of too much sugar not eat enough complex carbohydrates and protein but just eating a bunch of simple sugar you know in your bedtime you know cakes and cookies and jell-o's and muffins where they're having a blood sugar problem those are some things to from a dietary standpoint that might be a link that's not a link you may be looking at some you know checking a blood level for iron or ferritin would be a good thing to do some of the things that can contribute to sleeping issues B vitamins in the evening you know b6 for example can be overstimulating for some kids I had one child years ago actually have a sensitivity to a zinc supplement that they're taking a couple other things too much activity before bed many kids these days don't have a bedtime routine so you know it's just expected that they're gonna go to bed and fall asleep well kids on the spectrum are very sensitive to electromagnetics they're very expensive to frequencies they're very sensitive to sensory input so TV video games DVDs tronics will over stimulate their brains a nervous system and one thing that i found and i think it's true of all kids but it's it's something to be aware of with kids in the spectrum even though they may appear that they're not watching TV or not paying attention they are they're very aware and they're also very sensitive and innocent and I think you know because they many kids can't talk and they can't express to you how they feel they can't always express a nightmare they they may not be able to express some type of excitable image that they saw something disturbing and you know honestly TV these days for the most part is is awful with respects to the types of images that are flown forth into our homes particularly in front of our kids and it's a very difficult thing to control so we have to think of that that may be something that's happening you know is so creating a routine turning out the TV turning out the videos turning out the DVDs and creating a routine for bedtime some parents not all but I found in certain circumstances actually had full-spectrum lights in the house full-spectrum bulbs will suppress melatonin so we need to turn off those off also a change in the seasons in the summertime you can expect your kids to stay awake longer there's a natural tendency for kids just to stay up longer during the summer couple other things to consider with respects to sleep assess the pattern do they have a difficult time falling asleep are they waking up at night are they waking up at night giggling goofy so stimulatory behavior if they're waking up giddy goofy and silly think yeast could be a phenol sensitivity to but think yeast if they wake up irritable and agitated oftentimes it's a food sensitivity many times it's a bacterial problem in those cases unfortunately it could be a nightmare but I wouldn't expect a nightmare to be going on every night so usually that goofy giddiness the silliness is definitely yeast though if we have a difficult time falling asleep many times melatonin can be helpful melatonin between 1/2 to 3 milligrams 30 minutes before bed can help kids get too young be helped melatonin can be you obtained for many supplement companies like new beginnings sometimes magnesium in the evening can be helpful and some salt baths in the evening can be helpful I've had a few parents you know have some luck with some of the herbal teas like chamomile passionflower given before bedtime as well routine as I mentioned before establishing a routine you know turning the TV off taking a bath you know getting them a bed getting them prepared to go to bed as best you can a couple other things with respects to sleep 5htp and tryptophan another 5htp and tryptophan are the precursors to serotonin i generally if I'm going to use either one I will start with 5htp and 1 to 4 capsules 30 to 90 minutes before bed can be helpful for some sleeping issues sometimes we have to use tryptophan although I don't use it that often as I mentioned before melatonin is not a bad place to start the melatonin that you would get from your beginnings is going to be more of a quick-acting sometimes we need to use more of a time-release melatonin and where we can use a quick-acting melatonin to get to sleep in a time-release military stay asleep the difficulty is with the time-release melatonin is a difficult thing to give and use and to have it be effective if your child cannot swallow a tablet or capsule excuse me a tablet or capsule if the time release has to be broken up and mixed in food and for the most part it's not a time-release tablet anymore but if you do have a situation where your where your child can swallow a tablet or capsule then that time release melatonin is a nice option sometimes just a short-acting is all you need and sometimes if kids still wake up in the middle of night giving another dose of a short-acting helps them to get back to sleep I've not found melatonin to be toxic matter of fact melatonin is an antioxidant in the brain so it has a lot of usefulness do we want to use it long-term would it be great not to use it at all certainly would it be ideal not to use it long-term well I think any of these supplements particularly a hormone would be ideal not to use long term so we try to do the best we can to get kids sleeping but if they're not sleeping and the only thing that works is melatonin then in my personal opinion it's a worthwhile thing to use because the lack of sleep is devastating you can actually obtain time release in short-acting melatonin through this web link here at Emerson ecologic s-- there's a doctor code called sunset and a zip code of nine to five nine one that actually need to be used to order the time release and the short-acting melatonin and actually in doing so through that link there's a 10% discount on on the supplements through that Emerson ecologic so again this information by the way look at the presentations being recorded will be on great plains website for a couple weeks but there's also another recording that you can obtain right away through the autism seminars on demand and if you want to get a copy of those of the slides then you can do so through the autism seminars on demand as well and just download the slides so stimulatory behavior well there's a lot of things that can lead to that first couple things I think of any recent illness cold flu or allergies all known to access to be yeast is there a dietary infraction gluten casein soy other allergens food dyes could this be a contributing factor to stemming then I start looking at other factors that might contribute to to self-stimulatory behavior is it worse or an onset after a particular situation is it happening at school is it happening from something they're doing in the community okay swimming for example in the summer the chlorine maybe in quotes in quotes a potential problem a glutton fraction that you don't know about I don't want to throw grandma and grandpa under the bus but the reality is is some family members don't get it you know all kids deserve milk and cookies you know that's the perception anyway of some people so you think do some detective work a couple other things is the stemming worse at a particular time of the year is it really only is it getting worse in the winter or maybe there's more propensity to illness or in the spring where it could be tied to allergies a new supplement that was added maybe it's a lack of supplements you know where they need something more sometimes you have to work this out you know with with your doctor to kind of to kind of figure things out the problem is is the list for things that can contribute to self-stimulatory behavior or huge it's not just one thing unfortunately and I have found all of these things on this page to be useful for some kids at certain circumstances cod liver oil has been a wonderful therapy for visual stemming sigh glancing for example with some kids treating yeast has helped many kids with respects to self-stimulatory behavior but I've had kids who had so stimulatory behavior work olive-oil did nothing and treating yeast didn't stop it but respin a helped or doing a combination of gaba and lithium seemed to to make the difference because in in those particular situations the cell similar behavior was also in association with a child being irritable and agitated so I wish I could give you an exact breakdown of you know do these five things and it's going to help every time it's just not the reality this is why we have so many different things that we can use and in many cases they work quite well but sometimes we have to keep searching and searching for other things that are available that may be helpful this is why understanding what to do clinically and working with a doctor who understands the the the subtle nuances of problems is important so a couple things for my observation self-stimulatory behavior is generally worse with anxiety it's worse with repeated exposure to the television set to video games most it's worse with kids being indoors a lot and I see that happening with a lot of kids on the spectrum they're in therapy sessions all day long where they don't get outside much why is that happening is it because of the excessive electromagnetic radiation that they're exposed to maybe it may just be because of they're not getting enough exercise so not getting enough exercise not getting enough outdoor activity running swimming being in nature many times will just increase the problem with self-stimulatory behavior that might be a simplistic viewpoint for some kids I mean I get it there's some kids that are impervious to no matter what you do with respects to trying to help their self-stimulatory behavior but these are things that I've seen we ran over my practice throughout the years and then finally what about regression well the reality is is that you have to go through the the you have to go through that list of all the usual suspects is there a dietary infraction do you have a do you have a history with your child to being a strong reactor to gluten casein could it be yeast and bacterial overgrowth even if you did a test three months ago that showed nothing doesn't mean they couldn't have picks up picked up something new or had an overgrowth occur because of a of a weakened state of immunity in that moment is it a new infection is it tied to some type of seasonal change again situational changes that may be occurring at school a detox reaction die-off certainly is something that can cause regression so is it a new therapy that you've just started are you treating yeast are you giving something for detox are you doing chelation therapy think back you know as to what maybe is going on recently could it just be an age transition kids develop and kids go through brain development at certain times that could cause emotional changes and we know about we know that about kids and teenagers you know there's a transition point around 10 to 12 years old we're you know kids become combative and they talk back and they're constantly saying no you know these same types of changes are happening with kids on the spectrum so it may be it could be an age transition issue too so some final comments okay I always encourage people to journal you don't have to write an obscene amount of information on a daily basis but but keeping a journal that you can take your observing with your child keep a spreadsheet of therapies it could even just be a calendar notebook that you write down in your notebook and your calendar when you started a therapy and then keep some notes under what you're seeing it's also important to note when you stopped a therapy so that you could share that with your doctor try to recognize patterns okay situational seasonal time of the day all of that is is useful and then looking to say well you know what new therapies have been added what's been seen are we seeing any positives any negatives no changes because a lot of times I'll find that if I it if I find that a child's reacting to something I'll usually start backtracking and what was just added recently this is why I often don't like to start 5 or 6 things at the same time so if I'm going to start a group of supplements then I'll usually have the parents introduce one new supplement every 24 to 48 hours so that we have a little bit of a lag to see what kind of reaction they're going to have so the reality is is you have to become a detective with respects to your child's particular autism condition and there's a lot of great resources out there these webinars I know are helpful for many people a lot of other great books and conferences to go to a lot of online sites a lot of parent chat rooms as well and then you know hopefully you know if in time and if it's something that you find useful this is why I created the autism action plan comm site was to be there for parents and caregivers to answer questions to try ideas about things that I have seen from my experience even if you're working with a doctor the reality is you can't always get a hold of them you can't always get an appointment and this is why I answer questions on the weekends in the evenings on holidays it's just it's an avenue for people to go to who want to have access to a medical professional okay so with that said I hope this information was helpful for you and again this particular presentation can be found through the autism action plans comm site as well as the autism seminars on-demand website again it's going to be it has been recorded will be on Great Plains as web site for a couple weeks I'm also available for private consultations I have office I see patients in Southern California occasionally in normal well as having just established some office hours in Oregon in Bend Oregon which is in Central Oregon so if you're from the Pacific Northwest you can certainly contact me if you go to dr. roller comm that's my central website you can access my office information through that website if you want to get more information about me my consultation services and just an FYI parents who are members of the autism action plan comm site actually receive discounts on consultations through my practice whether that's office phone or Skype okay so just some general information for you again I hope this information was helpful for you I realize there's a ton of stuff to consider a ton of different scenarios to consider but at least you can hopefully walk away tonight with some some useful tips that you can start applying care of your child and I hope everybody has a great holiday however you celebrate it I hope this holiday season is a happy and joyous one for you and your family and we will be back in leave the second week of January for the start of our 2013 webinar series okay good night everybody take care", "4vqx-mbJaH8": "thank you for joining garlic once called the stinking rose and shunned by the higher classes as food suitable

good day and good help [Music]", "FM4nc2w-L9g": "okay welcome back in this video we will continue our video series on pharmacology for health professionals and this video will talk about chapter number three drug forms learning objectives for this chapter name the various forms in which drugs are manufactured describes seven different types of tablets describe the difference between a augment cream and a lotion name seven different types of drugs that come in a solution form describe the difference between a solution and a suspension describe how pellets beads wafers and inserts are used as drug forms and lastly define the key words and phrases for this chapter I first off a brief introduction before any drug can receive approval by the FDA the drug company that manufactures it up must clearly state in what form or forms the drug will be manufactured now different forms of a drug are appropriate for different routes of administration now some drugs are ineffective if they're administered in a certain form and other drugs may seriously injure the patient if they're administered in the wrong form alright the first form we'll start off talking about is a tablet now a tablet is a solid form and it contains active agrees and also in earth ingredients tablets will come in different shapes and in different colors some tablets are scored which means they're able to be broken either into halves or thirds this is how you get some prescriptions where you're you're told to take half a dosage or half a tablet some tablets are ever VES --nt and what that means is when that tablet interacts with water it forms a large amount of bubbles very quickly and actually will lead to a a foam on top and a good example that would be alka-seltzer and another type of tablet is called enteric-coated what that means is the tablet has a special coating on the outside that prevents it from being broken down by acids in the stomach so it can make it to the intestines to be absorbed there so the word enteric is reference to the intestine or more specifically the small intestine tablets will come in different colors different shapes some are slow-release if you need the medication to be released over a very long drawn-out period of time that's why it's called slow release caplets lozenges and troche or pastel those are types of lozenges but they differ in how they are manufactured but those terms are still synonymous with being a type of lozenge it's more of a compressed lozenge in this image we have an example of the drug santech a very distinctive shape to the tablet it looks like the home plate of a baseball diamond and of course has Z that's etched into each tablet that makes it very clearly identifiable compared to any other drug the pink color the CE Marking is etched on the tablet and then the core state unique shape C focus on health care a survey on pharmacists found that a tablet that has a unique color in a unique shape and one that has a drug name and dosage imprinted on it and those that have a distinct aroma for the best combination to help positively identifying drugs and be able to decrease medication errors and nearly 70% of pharmacists report that patients asked them weekly to identify random tablets that they bring to them or capsules after they've been taken out of the original packaging so the FDA advises patients who take more than one type of medication to be able to identify them by size and by shape and by color imprints or drug form this image if we have another example of scored tablets you'll hear this one will be would be easily able to be split in two and here same thing here and this one here you could easily split into three equal parts are this image we have an example of alka-seltzer which is an example of a effervescent tablet and they start off quite large here so there'd be no realistic way that anyone could swallow this without having a great deal of pain but you drop a tablet like this into a glass of water it forms large number of bubbles right away and eventually we'll give you that foam on the top and then you're able to drink the medication all right now we'll talk about capsules also known as cap or caps for short this is a one-piece gelatin shell with a liquid inside it can also be a hard shell that comes in two pieces and that pull apart and when you pull it apart you have in there granules or powder inside the two shells here are some examples of capsules and a variety of different colors depending on the manufacturer of the drug and the drug itself and you see here blue and white shells form together and there's a blue part there's a white part and when they're pulled apart from each other you see the granules that it would go inside a quick historical note many over-the-counter cold remedies and drugs that were used to treat pain were manufactured strictly as capsules until 1980s when there were multiple sources of Tylenol capsule that were intentionally contaminated with cyanide and after that point many drug companies will manufacturer their over-the-counter drugs for pain and a tablet or caplet full so it's not as easy to tamper with but many prescription drugs however still manufacture their pain reliever drugs as a two-piece Michell capsule the next form of drugs that we'll talk about is the film is a thin dissolvable substance that will contain a dosage of a drug this could be administered either sublingually or trans buccal e so either under the tongue or on the side of the mouth on the inside of the cheek and from there the drug is absorbed through the oral mucosa and then it will it will bypass the digestive system completely and go directly into the bloodstream the next form that we'll talk about is an appointment it's a semi-solid emulsion of oil and water and of those two components oil is the dominant ingredient and this will be absorbed in the area that the drug is applied to so this has a local effect on where is being applied our next one will talk about our creams a creams is another example of a semi-solid emulsion of oil and water but of those water is a dominant ingredient this is absorbed into the skin it also has a local effect now when comparing point missing creams this is how they would look a side by side on top you have a a standard antibiotic ointment and here on the bottom you have a hundred cortisone cream and just by looking at this you can tell an ointment will be we'll have a much more solid consistency to it and it will be clearer in appearance and a cream will be much more opaque another kind of drug form is a lotion this is a suspension of a drug within a water base this is also absorbed into the skin and this will also have a local effect in this table we have a comparison of ornaments and creams and lotions and how they feel and their appearance and their consistency and how they're dispensed so an ointment will feel very greasy it will appear very clear as a very firm consistency and is always dispensed for my to both creams and lotions are non greasy and they're both going to be opaque or have a milky appearance a cream will be semi liquid and lotion will be more of a liquid consistency and creams are from a tube or bottle and lotions are from bottles another form of drug are powders these are a finely ground drug these are what can be found within capsules can also be reconstituted if needed they can be sprinkled on skin and they can be sprayed on the skin and they can be inhaled into the lungs another form of a drug is a liquid and there are various aspects first one aqueous this comes from the Latin word aqua this is pertaining to having a watery consistency the opposite that would be viscous this pertains to being very thick and very non watery as if we were to think of a syrup like a maple syrup or oil you put in your car that is very viscous and flows very slowly because it is so thick that's non watery are the aspects of a liquid drug solutions these are drugs that are dissolved in sterile water or saline they're used for injections and they can be stored in either a vial or an ampule and four ampules those are a small glass jar that are used for storage of solutions but the way to access the solution is to break the neck of the ampule and we'll a problem with that is they cannot be resealed once you open an ampule you have to use all the drug right away or it has to be disposed of there's no resealing or restoring a container a vial can be closed with a rubber stopper or a cap those can be resealed and use again later on now drugs that are resolved in a liquid base those would include elixirs or syrups or tinctures now these three different types are related but they do vary in other composition both tinctures and elixirs are gonna be alcohol-based usually elixirs are usually manufactured as a dilute product and they have additives added to them to make them much more palatable for the patient usually something very sugary and very sweet pictures can be either an extract from a plant or a pure chemical substance in the syrups are typically a sugar based liquids so all three are considered solutions is depends on what they're composed of and how they're administered this image we have an example of an ampule a small slender glass in order to get to the solution that's inside here in the body of the container you need to break it open right here at the net but once that happens everything that's in here either has to be used or has to be disposed of this image you have example of a vial a small glass bottle but it can't be resealed either rubber stopper or a cap that comes with it this image we have an example of a pretty standard looking syrup and it could be cough syrup for example a viscous solution a little bit thicker consistency than other liquid drugs now many over-the-counter and prescription drugs for pediatric patients will tend to come in a form of a syrup because they are sugar bait so it's easier to have a child swallow something that's sweet as opposed to something that's going to taste very bitter and very harsh so making a a cough syrup taste like cherry or taste like grape makes it a lot easier for their parent or the doctor to administer most pediatric drugs the other types of drugs that can be dissolved in liquid base I can have liquid sprays we're gonna have a foam or you can have a mousse again all depends on what the drug is and what it's treating will determine how its best administered then you have drugs that can separate from the base but evenly distributed throughout the solution such as a a gel or an emulsion and we're comparing these last two terms emulsion and gels and emulsion is a suspension of two liquids that don't mix well together and so think of oil and water for example you have two distinctly different liquids in one general suspension so you can shake up that container really well and you'll get a suspension of the two ingredient but let it sit still and they will separate out and it comes to a gel a gel is a a semi seller to a solid colloid combination of a solid and a liquid such as a jelly for example a suspension another kind of liquid we have fine undissolved particles that are suspended in a water or an oil base the particles will gradually settle out that's why it's important to shake to make sure that all of the are mixing well together alright another form Drunken take suppositories this is a solid base of glycerin or cocoa butter that contains the drug within it and these are going to be manufactured in appropriate sizes because these are administered either vaginally or rectally and also different sizes for an adult versus a child now suppositories can be taken orally in an effort to treat yeast infections another form a transdermal patch this is a patch that well containing a dosage of a drug that could supply to the skin and these will have a will release a small amount of a drug overload or period of time and drugs that are that are administered this way and have a systemic effect not topical so it's gonna impact the entire body not just the area where the patch is placed a good example of that would be NicoDerm this is used to help people quit smoking so instead of smoking cigarettes this transdermal patch has a slow release of nicotine so the person still has the a contact of nicotine with a slow release of nicotine over a very long amount of time is to help wean the patient off of smoking in general next cons pellets baits wafers inserts these will be placed within a body cavity and these forms will have a a slow-release drug some examples of these would be septuple beads these are implanted into bones to help prevent a chronic infection another example this would be Mirena which is an IUD which is inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy you know the form of the drug would be a gas obviously these will be inhaled a very common example this would be a general anesthetic given to patients before surgery make sure that they are unconscious so as you can see there are a variety of different ways that you can administer a drug to a patient it really just depends on the kind of drug you are trying to administer and what is the most effective way to get that drug into the patient the treat of what is wrong this will bring us to the end of chapter number 3 in our pharmacology course we will continue our course with our next video on chapter number 4", "XpQRsy-HOeg": "[Music] dairy farmers in Barra have allotted abundance

and they are here daily we're bringing state-of-the-art treatment to little company good afternoon and welcome to all of you to our first and hopefully many webcasts what you need to know about pregnancy is today's topic i'm dr. robert van dominio i'm joined here today by dr. quinn and our nurse midwife mary mary kate burke we're all members of women's health care affiliates we're also joined by dr. Travis Haldeman dr. Jessica sulkowski and our new midwife member Breanna bloom Bergen at women's health care affiliates you can experience a very caring environment skilled physicians certified nurse midwives dedicated to managing your health care needs at every stage of life and our team is prepared to be a lifelong partner caring for a range of obstetric and gynecologic issues that come with age all of the physicians in our group graduated from the same residency program through Chicago osteopathic and now Midwestern university which we're very proud of I'm board certified in obstetrics and gynecology and have interests in general as well as high-risk obstetrics and minimally invasive surgery dr. Quinn's our newest member to our group as I mentioned this same residency program and graduated from Midwestern university of osteopathic medicine our nurse midwife Mary Kay Burke graduated from University of Illinois at Chicago and she's been providing a great new angle to our practice with her midwifery practice collaborating with us as board-certified physicians to offer personalized birthing services Mary Kay knows that each woman has unique health care needs and requires individual attention there are so many important pregnancy related topics that we could discuss today but we wanted to focus on an optimum health during pregnancy and a healthy pregnancy actually begins before you become pregnant so we advise a healthy balanced diet regular exercise in a healthy emotional state that we feel lays of a very solid foundation to the complexities both affecting physical and emotional changes of pregnancy to your body if you have any history of chronic conditions such as diabetes hypertension and asthma we advise to meet with your health care provider immediately and preconception alee address these conditions even if they've been very well controlled because we know pregnancy will have an impact on them you know that when you're pregnant you receive a lot of advice and and there's numerous outside sources including the internet that provides information and great websites and books to be read we encourage to empower you and during the time of amazing changes in your in your body during during pregnancy one of the most important decisions is choosing a health care provider that meets your personal needs good prenatal care is essential so we advise calling your provider right away and scheduling your first prenatal visit during that visit routine baseline lab work ultrasounds and evaluations are performed they can even address any medical concerns and medical conditions and medications that you may currently have this is a very important step and our our discussion today again is to optimize health and pregnancy so let's talk about some certain trends in obstetrics that are a Kurt have been occurring over the past decade if not longer preterm labor is an ongoing problem at least a half a million babies are born prematurely in the United States and even more so globally teen births are actually down for the first time in ten years since 2010 more women in their 30s and 40s are becoming pregnant whether personal choice personal and professional responsibilities or second relationships with this however especially in women in their 40s a greater susceptibility for complications may exist such as high blood pressure and diabetes placental problems and birth complications can o can also occur so tight surveillance and and strict prenatal care is advisable we continue to see health disparities especially in african-american women and Latinos increasing cesarean section rates and materne maternal other maternal morbidity and mortality cesarean section rotes specifically have increased dramatically from 1996 to 2007 and currently reaching a peak of thirty-two percent so in choosing a health care provider with low cesarean section rates physiologic approaches to labor vaginal deliveries after cesarean section is is highly recommended those choosing more natural approaches such as hypnobirthing and water birth are also available so let's go back to preconception risk assessments as I mentioned can include medical conditions both acute that may occur during their pregnancy or chronic such as those mentioned like diabetes hypertension and asthma there's an ongoing evaluation during pregnancy which will require maintenance and re-evaluation and changes potential changes in treatment age which which may affect pregnancy complications and genetic chromosomal issues reproductive history for those women that unfortunately experienced numerous or recurrent miscarriages family history substance abuse and psychosocial issues are also things to address and weight both under and over weight can affect pregnancy some genetic testing screening tests that are that have become more popular recently sequential screening is a is a two phase screening test in the first trimester and these first two that I'm going to mention has really replaced the more invasive more diagnostic testing because of their reliability and success so back to sequential screening it's a tube two-part process in the first trimester pregnancy that involves blood tests and a specific ultrasound to view the baby between 11 and 13 weeks harmony blood test is is a free fetal DNA test that's actually extracted from the maternal serum or a simple blood test to the mother and has shown reliability of 99 percent so those that are at high risk or those that simply want the test it's currently available quad screen is an older test that really isn't utilized much anymore and then the more invasive diagnostic testing that i mentioned amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling can both still be done and our our near 100 percent reliable so I'm going to pass my this current lecture over to dr. michelle quinn now thank you alright thank you for your attention i am dr. michelle quinn and i want to kind of focus today on early pregnancy what's going to happen when you come to visit us for the first time what do you expect when you first find out you're pregnant so you get your positive pregnancy test at home how are you feeling you probably have some breast tenderness you might have some nausea you might have some cramping you might feel like you're on an emotional roller coaster at the beginning but that's where we come in you come in to us kind of sit down talk with us and we'll kind of go over everything kind of lay out the course as to what you expect with your pregnancy the most important thing again like dr. bono Mineo mentioned is establishing a consistent health care provider that you feel like you can trust and will carry you through the pregnancy so by coming with us by coming to us initially you will and we'll set up a plan for you and that plan will be multiple appointments throughout your pregnancy you will find that early on in pregnancy we see you every four weeks sooner if needed if there are any of those complications that dr. von dominio had suggested and as the pregnancy gets closer to your due date we will see you more frequently so regular follow-up is a point is important as dr. Bonnie Mineo mentioned weight is very important and I think it's something that you can control so it's all about what you eat why should you watch what you eat when you're pregnant are you supposed to be eating for two not really the reason you need to be conscious of what you eat and what you put into your body is because excessive weight gain and pregnancy has its implications problems that could arise would be an increased birth weight of your baby you're an increased risk for cesarean delivery if you have excessive weight gain and then of course that weight gain has to come off somehow so you can have difficulty losing that weight postpartum how do you calculate what is a body mass index this is something some people may or may not be familiar with body mass index is a formula based on your weight and your height by this your physician can give you your what's called your BMI score based on that BMI score at places you went to a category underweight normal weight overweight and obese why is this important well for each individual in each of these categories we have different recommendations for weight gain and for instance a normal weight female with a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 the recommended total weight gain is 25 to 35 pounds in your pregnancy and as this chart suggests which all of these guidelines are from the Institute of Medicine which was published in 2009 that's about a pound a week in your second and third trimester so if you are overweight or obese as you can see obese women the current recommendation is to really only gained 11 to 20 pounds total in your pregnancy gaining about a half a pound for those last 26 weeks of pregnancy so kind of you know take it down out of the chart what does that mean very little weight gain will occur in your first trimester a normal way individual should gain about 0 to 9 pounds leaving you to gain that additional pound a week as we would expect for your last 26 weeks of pregnancy obese or overweight women should gain maybe 2 to 10 town 10 pounds in their first trimester gaining a half a pound a week over the next twenty six weeks what about if you have twins you're pregnant with twins what's the expected weight gain so a normal weight female who has twins the expected weight gain is about 37 254 pounds overweight 31 to 50 pounds and obese 25 242 pounds so nutrition how much additional calorie should you take in in your diet while you're pregnant you actually only need an additional 300 kilo calories a day that's not very much and I've got another side to demonstrate that for you so again you're not eating for two you're picking healthier food options and only slightly increasing your daily caloric intake now when you are breastfeeding postpartum you actually should take in 500 kilo calories a day so you actually will eat more postpartum when you're breastfeeding as opposed to the calories required during your pregnancy again we recommend all of our pregnant women to take prenatal vitamins that will contain an iron supplement 400 micrograms of folic acid is a is very important in the first trimester of your pregnancy and again this kind of goes back to the preconception counseling we want all of our women to be taking a regular multivitamin every day with 400 micrograms of folic acid because the folic acid supplement will help decrease the risk of you having a baby with any neural tube defects the most common one being spina bifida the neural tube develops within the first six to eight weeks of pregnancy so it's important that you have that folic acid in your diet in the first six to eight weeks of your pregnancy some women don't even know they're pregnant in that time so that's why again we recommend taking that baseline prenatal vitamin even when you think you might start to be getting considering conception so back to portion control exactly what what is 300 calories a day for instance based on this chart you can see eight ounces a plain low-fat yogurt is about 145 calories a day so two additional yogurts a day while you're pregnant or two additional cups of 2% milk alright one bagel one and a half bagel you know you can kind of look at this chart and quickly identify that it doesn't take much to get those an additional 300 calories a day that you need during your pregnancy should you exercise in your pregnancy so of course if you've never exercised before we don't want you to go out and start a new exercise regimen because now you're pregnant alright but we do recommend regular continue your regular moderate-intensity exercise walking is good especially after meals it helps with that caloric intake helps you process your carbohydrates in your sugars in addition what types of exercises are safe in pregnancy we want you to avoid any activities that would put you an increase of falling or injury to your abdomen and no scuba diving due to the increased risk of decompression sickness so when should you not exercise reasons to not exercise or if you have ever been diagnosed with labour you have a cerclage in place you've had any bleeding with your pregnancy that your provider has put you on limited activities you have a placenta previa or if you have any chest pain breathing problems or any other pain after you perform any of your exercise activities when you are exercising we want you to choose activities where you avoid lang supine for prolonged periods of time avoid contact sports specifically hockey soccer basketball avoid those sports that you might fall gymnastics horseback riding snow skiing racket sports is it safe to bathe during pregnancy yes it is the thing you do want to avoid you want to avoid any Jacuzzi or water temperature greater than 100 degrees fahrenheit in the first trimester as it can be teratogenic to the baby travel is safe air travel is safe in pregnancy but we recommend that you not fly after 36 weeks after 36 weeks you're at risk for going into preterm labor in any other complications that we would not want to arise while you're in transit in air without you know having the availability of one of the obstetrician gynecologist for you again always wear your seatbelts when you are traveling wear them low and below your belly sexual intercourse is okay in pregnancy unless again you've had bleeding during the pregnancy you are at risk for having a miscarriage or you've ever been diagnosed with preterm labor during the pregnancy it is safe to go see your dentist for regular cleaning and treatment during pregnancy caffeine how much caffeine is safe in pregnancy so the current recommendation by a cog is to limit yourself to moderate consumption 200 milligrams a day of caffeine and again we've nicely identified so example a brewed cup of coffee is 135 or 137 milligrams a day whereas your average 8 ounce cup of tea brewed is about forty eight milligrams a day so again think about what you're taking in and your goal is to have less than 200 milligrams a day don't forget about chocolate ice cream sweets all of these things contain caffeine as well so instant for instance dark chocolate you know one point four five ounces is 30 milligrams of have seen so now I want to focus a little bit on two of the common complications of pregnancy and kind of screening tests that we can focus on so in your mid pregnancy your doctor is going to order a diabetes screen and why is this diabetes screen test important diabetes testing is important because if you are diabetic during your pregnancy you're again at risk for having a infant that is larger than expected the infant is at risk for having what's called shoulder dystocia when you deliver the baby vaginally the shoulders don't want to come out traumatic birth injuries which could result in nerve injuries to the baby's arms or neck they could also have your infant infant would have low blood sugars after delivery the infants can have breathing problems be at risk for childhood obesity mom if you're diabetic you're at risk for preeclampsia having a cesarean delivery and you yourself have the risk in the future for developing type 2 diabetes so it's something we take very seriously because it is common it affects seven percent of our pregnancies in the United States so who was at risk for it increasing age obesity if you have a strong family history of diabetes if you have ever been diabetic in your previous pregnancies these are all risk factors again people of Hispanic African native american south or east asian or pacific islanders these racial categories also are at increased risk for diabetes so what is the test the test we ask most patients to do routinely at 24 to 28 weeks during your pregnancy is the 50 gram one hour glucose tolerance test this is a test that you do not have to be fasting for you simply come into the lab you will drink a sugary liquid and then one hour later they will test your blood sugar and you will have a result now if you are considered high risk when you meet your practitioner at your initial obstetric visit you may be offered this test in the first trimester now again this is a screen the screening test does not give you the diagnosis it will tell us your screening tests negative you can be reassured you do not have diabetes if your screening test is positive then we have to do one additional tests to confirm the diagnosis and that confirmatory test is a hundred gram three hour glucose tolerance test unfortunately this test is time intensive and requires you to commit four hours of your time in the lab to complete the test we do recommend the patients should maintain a normal diet prior to today prior to performing this test such that you should be taking in 150 grams of carbohydrates for three days prior to the test you come in the morning fasting eight hours previously they draw your blood again you drink a hundred gram sugary liquid this time they will test your blood at one two and three hours after you have consumed the beverage we will then get those test results and you will be diagnosed as diabetic if two of those four results are abnormal so what do you do if you have diabetes during your pregnancy well initially we would like to start with dietary modifications and exercise you will monitor your blood sugars regularly and present those logs to us in the office based on your numbers we then decide if further treatment as indicated further treatment would then include either pills or injections for the duration of the pregnancy and don't forget postpartum you had diabetes during your pregnancy at your postpartum visit when you come to see us at six weeks we again need to repeat the glucose test to again make sure was the diabetes only associated with your pregnancy or is this something that is still present in your body and we need to continue to follow you closely alright the last topic I'm going to touch on is late in pregnancy one of the very common complications we see is preeclampsia what is preeclampsia preeclampsia is high blood pressure in combination with protein in your urine what are the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia patients will have swelling in their face and hands increased weight gain in general over the last week or so persistent headaches that don't go away whenever you rest or sit down there hunting you might have vision changes you might see floaters or spots and some patients have abdominal pain specifically in the right side of their upper abdomen who's at risk for developing preeclampsia those are patients who have multiple just stations it's their first pregnancy they've had preeclampsia in the past if you do have a history of high blood pressure or develop high blood pressure during your pregnancy you are also at risk if you develop diabetes if you're obese if you're over then older than 35 african-american race or have a history of significant kidney or vascular disease so why is it important that we screen for this disease preeclampsia can be a reason for early delivery and intervention undiagnosed preeclampsia or preeclampsia that is not treated by delivery can progress to e clamps yet each clamp SIA is a seizure disorder that results as a as a spectrum or as a component of the preeclampsia disease how do we treat preeclampsia we deliver the baby so that's why being aware of these signs and symptoms are important so that we can intervene in the appropriate time timeframe for you and your baby because ultimately our goal is always healthy baby healthy mom so lastly we're going to turn it over to our certified nurse midwife Mary Kay Burke and she's going to touch on what to expect when you come to us in labor and delivery so thanks dr. Quinn so here you are now you're making your way toward the end of your pregnancy heading toward your due date and there's a lot of decisions to be made decisions about you know am I going to have a natural birth am I going to ask for an epidural when the time comes so for women that are choosing a more natural approach We strongly recommend you know being very cautious about who you choose to help you to support you in labor We strongly recommend considering hiring a doula and doulas provide continuous labor support and we know that studies show that when you hire a doula that and they're giving you continuous labor support there by your bedside through the whole labor experience studies show that it you often have faster Labour's fewer c-sections and are often very satisfied with your experience we definitely needed need an arsenal of tools to help us maybe a hypno birthing class which actually we offer here at little company which allows which really works to teach us to how to eliminate fear maybe music maybe water either utilizing the shower or possibly tub an epidural is definitely the most popular option for pain relief across the united states and here at little company as well an epidural delivers continuous pain relief to the lower part of your body aline allowing you to remain fully conscious it decreases sensation but doesn't result in a total lack of feeling so you can move around and you can often feel sensations of pressure as a baby descends so brief word about gentle caesareans we started doing the gentle sea as we like to call it here at little company last year and it really is a team effort you kind of utilizing all of our staff in our operating suite at little company in labor and delivery that really offers a more human approach to surgery we try it when we have a mom that is maybe she's had a previous c-section or maybe this is her first caesarean planned possibly for breach for example we help mom or we encourage a mom to plan music in advance something that will help her stay relaxed during the process and when the baby when the baby comes out we check with our mom to see if she would like to you know lower the drape so so that she can see the birth of the baby if that's something that she's interested in we we want mom's hands to be free so that when the baby comes out we will quickly dry the baby and put the baby right away skin-to-skin on mom are many of our families that have had this experience we're very happy and it really does add to it enhances the experience for them now water birth has been a very popular edition for our moms who are planning a natural birth of those you know that are looking for alternatives to medications and epidurals warm water and labor is a very effective mode of pain relief some women want to labor in the water and some want to labor and also birth in the water and it's really their their choice as long as as long as they're safe when a woman in labor relaxes in warm water and she's you know free of the gravity's pull on her body and sensory stimulation is reduced her body is less likely to secrete stress hormones like adrenaline and catecholamines and when mom becomes emerged in nice warm water she has you know as she relaxes and she's releasing you know oxytocin in lots of endorphins and that actually by allowing her to relax and have all this positive hormone secretion she often will progress rapidly and in it and it allows for a very nice gentle birth and there are numerous studies that have reviewed thousands and thousands of water births really related to safety and truly the baby spends very little time in the water after the baby comes out the babies as soon as a baby births the babies gently brought up to the water service and the as the air kind of hit the hits the baby's face that really triggers a response to take a breath and there have been many studies that show very similar Apgar scores in water birth babies similar to the traditional route so we wanted to really put something in about postpartum which we sometimes referred to as the fourth trimester and you know there's so much when especially for our first babies you know there's a lot of you know prenatal classes that we attend and lots of energy lots of emotional energy as well that is um is spent preparing for labor and birth and what we discover many times is that you know sometimes a postpartum period can be very overwhelming for for new moms and for families and the initial period in the hospital is at first very exhilarating and filled with excitement and then you know generally focus on kind of resting and recuperating and you know in feeding most women find the first few weeks and months after they go home you know to be you know a lot of great emotional upheaval intense feelings of joy exhaustion fatigue you know happiness are all common in the postpartum period the transition to Parenthood is referred to as kind of a normal life crisis and life will never really be the same again you will redefine who you are as a mother and father you will find that you're expected to put your baby's needs before your own you know taking care of a totally dependent baby can sometimes feel overwhelming if you have other kids at home you know you often feel some sadness and guilt that they aren't getting the attention that they're accustomed to and that you know that they need the depth of these feelings are partially due to enormous hormonal changes taking place in your body fatigue and then of course the amount of support that you're receiving so baby blues occur in fifty to eighty percent of new moms we often you know sometimes that you know we I sometimes tell my moms to expect it to almost feel like a home like a continuous Hallmark card you know you're very happy and yet you know why am i crying it's just it's just overwhelming emotions and that is very very common now postpartum depression is a different thing and postpartum depression can occur in about ten percent of new moms and it can occur anytime within the first year after birth so women with postpartum depression often feel inadequate hopeless unable to cope with everyday life sometimes they have physical symptoms like headaches panic attacks and ability to sleep sometimes they lose their appetite sometimes you're overeating sometimes they're feeling you know they're spontaneous like crying guilt sometimes a disinterest even in the new baby so as your provider we want you to always call us and let us know if you know and we usually talk about this you know throughout pregnancy and especially it are when we see during your postpartum visit now breastfeeding and we at little company Mary are very proud of our baby friendly status that we achieved just 10 months ago the baby-friendly designation maybe a new work term for many but to explain simply the world health organization in UNICEF launched initiative back in nineteen ninety one that recognizes hospitals that offer an optimal level of care for infant feeding and mother baby banding it recognizes hospitals that have successfully implemented the ten steps to successful breastfeeding i'm here at little company the entire hospital staff was involved with evenness recognition of course our lactation consultants are are experts at breastfeeding and we often seek their counsel with any of our moms who may be struggling in addition all the nurses in the maternal child department have had additional education and are readily available to assist with proper latch and observation of breastfeeding so that when you go home you have an excellent start and of course the breastfeeding support group led by our lactation consultants every Wednesday afternoon right about this time is very popular and a great resource for all moms who are breastfeeding in our community and we have all of our information here on our slide like I said it's every wednesday at eleven thirty and the end the lactation consultant contact information is there too if you ever have any questions feel free to always leave them a message so our labor and delivery suites we are just about at our first year anniversary and our new facility also known as a west pavilion it's always exciting to give our families tours of our new labor and delivery department it's great to see how happy and excited they are some of our main features we have five labor and delivery suites similar to in the picture and we are hoping to add three more in the near future we have five triage rooms for evaluation and observation we have two large our suites for our c-section patients we have a couple of very spacious waiting areas for our families and we have one that's right within the labor and delivery department that does have a TV and coffee and very comfortable surroundings we have anesthesia providers available twenty-four-seven and we also have OB hospitalist that are available twenty-four-seven so there's always physicians in the department and of course we have an exceptional nursing staff who really understand that this day means everything to you now as you can see in this picture the mother-baby suites are wonderful we have a queen size bed in every room for your comfort generally speaking when you leave labor and delivery you your partner and baby all go to your new room together and you will stay in the hospital generally for two days for vaginal delivery and usually about three days for a c-section the bathroom isn't shown here but it's very roomy and has an excellent shower you are invited to go to classes and new baby care the lactation consultants and nurses will be around to assist you with breastfeeding if you choose to breastfeed the golden in the mother baby department is really to rust rejuvenate and get to know your newborn so that about wraps up our presentation and we will start our Q&A session now and I do have one question that our lactation consultants helped us answer and that is how can you get a newborn to latch on so Eileen Murphy our our wonderful lactation consultant answered with as a baby friendly hospital the goal is to have your baby on your chest skin to skin after delivery unless there is a medical indication now in labor and delivery a little company I mean we always try to put babies immediately skin-to-skin there are some times where you know maybe we have the pediatrician attending and you know in that we may need the pediatrician to evaluate our baby but then the baby immediately goes back to mom on her chest this is usually very good time for you're awake and alert newborn to learn how to latch on skin to skin for mom and baby is recommended and encouraged throughout the newborn period so early feeding Hughes are recognized and frequent breastfeeding can be practiced while in the hospital please ask our staff to check your baby's latch so they can assist as needed one of our questions is regarding genetic testing and is it for both mom and dad and currently the ones that we mentioned is for the mother only however with recurrent pregnancy loss it it should be evaluated as a couple and the father may have certain genetic or chromosomal markers and and there are tests for those and we also strongly encourage in these situations that a genetic counselor be involved and they take both mother and father's current medical history their family history which is very important and then there's some serum or blood tests that can be done to see if they're at risk for any chromosomal familial abnormalities or genetic abnormalities that can be passed on to to the baby second question I'll addresses when does postpartum go away and it really varies among among women which can can both be affected by their there certain support support system at home or their responses to counseling or medical therapy I like to treat for at least three months and and within those three months whether it incorporates both counseling or medical therapy frequent visits or phone conversations would be beneficial but i'd say the farm majority resolved within the first year a few more questions one was if you if you had gestational diabetes during your last pregnancy that you are are you at risk to get it again with the next pregnancy and the answer is yes if you have had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy you are considered a high-risk patient and we would like to see you early you would have an early one hour glucose tolerance test it in your first trimester and then if that one is negative you still would get the repeat glucose testing at 24 to 28 weeks another question will varicose veins and stretch marks go away after births so varicose veins and stretch marks are unfortunately one of the common physiol side effects with pregnancy varicose veins develops due to a kind of slowing of the blood flow in the legs so women some women get them some women don't it can be a lot of it as genetic as with stretch marks both of them may improve someone after pregnancy however for most patients they generally do not go away after pregnancy another common question we get is what can I do to prevent stretch marks in my pregnancy and there is no good literature out there to say that there is a great butter lotion cream that will prevent your stretch marks from developing in your pregnancy again a lot of it is genetic things you can do to help yourself out to try to prevent some of the pain in your legs associated with varicose veins and try to prevent them from developing as if you are in a job that you are on your feet for prolonged periods of time you should wear support stockings compression hose you could get them at a local pharmacy go above the knee some of them go all the way up to the thigh that will help kind of push all that blood flow back to prevent that blood from kind of settling in your legs and you developing varicose veins next question we had is are you accepting new patients at both Evergreen Park and Oakland locations and the answer is yes for all practitioners in the office okay we had a couple of questions um the first one was tell me about the gentle caesarean I've been hearing about it so I talked a little bit about that but you know we actually heard about the gentle caesarean from one of our patients who had had a c-section and with her first baby and she was hoping to have a v-back a vaginal birth day after but her thought was that if for some reason it didn't work out that she would like to she would be interested in a gentle caesarean we hadn't really heard about it before but when we did some research we found a really great video on YouTube that was on a dr. Fisk in the UK kind of felt that you know women that were having traditionally vaginal birth there was always a lot of attention and you know trends improvements all the time to make them really meaningful experiences and that they felt that really cesarean sections were always kind of very cold very sterile procedures and and often you know women after a cesarean you know would sometimes feel that way that it wasn't really the warm you know wonderful experience that they were hoping for and so therefore they're disappointed so when we did our research and made a few phone calls making sure that that there was no increase in infection rate for example if we were to lower the drape kind of nearing the sterile field and and we discovered that hospitals that have started doing this like there was one in Maine for example that they've had absolutely no increase in infection rates and and so we decided that we would give it a try and it's actually been really successful and what we usually do if we know if we're planned in advance maybe a repeat c-section or primary we have our moms put together music that we can play for them you know we try to ask the staff in the in the o.r sweet to keep any talking to a minimum and our as our anesthesiologist are really key for us too because you know kind of the head of the bed is sort of their area and you know we need their cooperation and they've been great about you know helping allowing kind of keeping mom's hands-free with the goal of you know as soon as the baby comes out to have the baby skin-to-skin which has been really a very very meaningful experience for our minds instead of having kind of the baby over in the corner in the warmer so um I usually attend I tried to come in and kind of help a little bit with these c-sections when we do the procedure so that I can kind of stand and and just help at the head of the bed with a bit with the mom in case she feels dizzy or if she's you know feeling very tired just to kind of help make sure the baby's stable on mom's chest and and our other question that came in is what is the difference between having and Midwife versus a physician so you know midwife you know is not a physician and a midwife you know is really the midwives as far as labor or as far as prenatal care you know we often follow the same protocol you know visits every four weeks in the early part of pregnancy you know increasing we often order the same types of testing the but you know when midwives really do take care of more low with low-risk pregnancies on what's nice of course in our group is that you know that our physicians are readily available to us if we have any moms that all of a sudden may develop a complication at the end of the pregnancy such as you know high blood pressure I can still you know remain connected with you as my patient but we have our physician experts that are here helping us and midwives tend to you know to spend a little bit more time we you know we aren't quite as rushed and it just makes for a very meaningful experience we have a couple other questions on one was on whether or not we have any YouTube video on our gentle c-sections and we currently have a video on the on the website from channel 5 news that we filmed over a year ago or so and but we don't actually have video of the actuals is a cesarean section here at little company but the story is on on the website elsie mhm org secondly what exactly does baby friendly as far as the hospital mean and we're going to be covering this very soon on our special fox news segment that's shortly going to that will follow shortly here and lastly another gestational diabetes question as far as its effects on the infant it and I believe dr. Quinn went through this but just to highlight the the effects on the infant is mainly it increases their their growth it in accelerates to the point where it may affect the delivery and and lead to possible cesarean section there's also other anatomical problems that can occur in uncontrolled diabetics prenatally so we'd like to thank you for tuning in to our webinar we hope we will be able to provide more for you in the in the near future as well and upcoming now is the as I mentioned the baby-friendly Fox special that's going to play for you to watch right now so thank you very much pacha gawa takes us inside a suburban hospital that's getting serious recognition look at those cute little ones suburban hospital is the first in the area to be recognized as the most baby-friendly yeah Patrick Elwood has the story it's afternoon at Evergreen parks little company of mary hospital and this gathering of moms and babies is all about breastfeeding i use a pump and I pumped for him first he's gonna be eight months old I've been pumping for him for eight months Melissa Trask and the rest of the ladies here get together on a regular basis socialize share tips about baby raising and mother nature's natural elixirs milk straight from the breast no formula here it's how we all are here today is our ancestors breastfed in our family members before we were here you mean empanel hasn't been around some figuration of dawn believe it or not it it's no coincidence this group is here at little company known as the baby hospital for Illinois for years Dow little company has just received an accreditation as a baby friendly birth facility by the organization baby friendly USA the baby-friendly hospital initiative was launched in 1991 but more hospitals have applied for that title in recent years that might be because hospitals appear to be less wary of the chief requirement they not accept free formula from the makers experts also say hospitals are catching up to research that shows that breastfeeding has major benefits for mothers and newborns the American Academy of Pediatrics says infants who receive formula run a higher risk of getting childhood diseases diabetes and childhood obesity the organization says breastfeeding helps women reduce their chance of breast and ovarian cancer hypertension diabetes and heart disease little company is now the only Hospital in chicago and suburbs and the only one of three in the state that now have that designation and the medical professionals here couldn't be happier it's a national and international program very few hospitals are recognized and it means a lot for the community but these fine folks also want to make clear that just because they are a breastfeeding baby friendly hospital they know it's not for every new mom and everyone is welcome and taken care of here whatever their decision is we totally support Patrick Elwood at fox 32 news very nice Dora bear hug yeah well thanks so much for being here", "epKsq1XmnTo": "vitamin E is a nutrient that aids the maintenance of healthy skin cells and replaces those that have been damaged this vitamin increases the act of regeneration and leads to the production of healthier and younger skin cells the result healthier younger looking skin that is smooth to the touch vitamin E is also an incredibly helpful nutrient when it comes to aging healthily so what are the benefits of vitamin E taking a vitamin E daily can boost your immune system and help prevent disease from damaging the body it does this by aiding the flow and distribution of oxygen around the body this is vital to cell aging and tissue repair vitamin E is also known for its blood clot reducing properties and is currently being researched for its effects in lowering the risk of heart disease this property is thought to be linked to the fact that this vitamin is an anticoagulant and so it discourages the build-up of fatty tissue or blood both of which contribute to heart disease vitamin E is also linked with the increased diameter or dilation of the blood vessels this means that blood flow and blood pressure may stay at a healthy rate increasing your vitamin E intake can reduce the chances of you becoming anemic this is an iron deficiency disorder vitamin E can also control the amount of fat in the blood and is therefore a helpful component in maintaining a healthy weight and controlled weight loss increasing your vitamin E intake has also been associated with a reduced risk of developing arthritis and muscle cramps as vitamin E prevents blood clots it encourages older tissue to be rejuvenated rather than age and become damaged beyond repair with all of these benefits it's no wonder vitamin E is being touted as the new Beauty nutrient i'm dr.

information we've got 404 calories it's very very specific I doubt that they can know that they say that this is a 30 dose edible which seems a little laughable to me I don't know how you're gonna break this into 30 parts and I'm just gonna do it as a one dose edible all right and white all milk and cookies edibles with these new packages there's some overwrought terrible description on the back that I cannot wait to read it to you alright here we go the cocoa Louv the cocoa love cereal bar immerse yourself in this rich revelation of chocolate fantasy that is our cocoa love cereal bar a sweet symphony of luscious milk chocolate swirl together with extra fluffy gooey gooey marshmallows it's the foreplay to the guaranteed satisfaction you what the hell does that mean who are they petting to right that I don't know they should pay me to write it I write a better one here's my gray hey it tastes pretty good it gets you pretty [ __ ] up but you know they're the wordsmith snot all right so let's open this puppy up I let's see what this I'm not just the Lu cereal bar looks like okay it's a cocoa pebbles are let's give it a taste there's a slight we donor not too bad but you can smell it Oh if you've ever had a rice krispies treat or a fruity pebble treat for a cocoa pebble treat you've had this but with this light marijuana taste to it that's about all it is it's not the best shoe bar I've ever had it's not particularly good shoe bar that's not terrible I can totally jam this without gagging which I plan on doing here which if you've never joined us for weeks before

will let you know how this MILF and cookies cocoa love cereal bar is making me feel see you guys then bye thirty doses thirty doses who are they kidding they think that this is going to be a thirty dose edible welcome back two weeks guys it has been two hours since I consumed the cocoa love cereal bar from Milton cookies and I am very very very disappointed I believe this was $11 sue not that expensive but man for a 300 milligram edible I am feeling practically nothing yeah on the cusp of nothing at all and they have the audacity to call this a 300 milligram edible that is designed for 30 people maybe 30 ants or 30 you know maybe some small mammals maybe 30 mice might get high off of it but I I don't think they're gonna be 30 human beings that what could divide that up into 30 things and then get high off of it I'm one human being who would consume the whole thing granted I have very high tolerance but I'm not high at all this is the most disappointing MILF and cookies product I've had so far I've had 200 milligram edibles from them that are more powerful than this 300 milligram edible if you see the cocoa Lou cereal bar at a dispensary near you that's a pass from me really disappoint with milk and cookies on this one so with that being said guys thank you so much for watching wheats and we will check you out on the next review and hopefully next time we'll have

hours I must confess I accidentally took a nap in between this review which might have tested the power of the product of the Kanak Oh a lemon bar 100 milligram that I felt it necessary to take a nap in between the the review there I enjoyed the product quite a bit I loved how it tasted absolutely left how it tasted and it got me up to like a solid six half maybe from a hundred milligram at a bull which is just I mean it's just ridiculous it's incredible as all kind of coat products seem to be I love them all this is definitely no exception for me I love love love the lemon bar 100 milligrams even at 100 milligrams it got me really really high so I'm completely pleased with it oh I believe it cost me ten bucks at my dispensary so an utterly affordable edible as well if you see one at a dispensary and you like the lemon bars do not hesitate to grab one you will certainly be happy you did that is again the Kanak Oh lemon bar 100 milligrams thank you so much for watching wheats guys

moderate to moderately severe pain when taken by mouth and an immediate release formulation the onset of pain relief usually occurs within an hour it is often combined with paracetamol acetaminophen as this is known to improve the efficacy of tramadol in relieving pain common side effects include constipation itchiness and nausea serious side effects may include seizures increased risk of serotonin syndrome decreased alertness and drug addiction a change in dosage may be recommended in those with kidney or liver problems it is not recommended in those who are at risk of suicide while not recommended in women who are breastfeeding those who take a single dose should not generally stop breastfeeding tramadol is a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor SNRI and acts by binding to the mucoid receptor of the neuron both pre and postsynaptic lis it is converted in the liver to decimate remodel a more potent opioid tramadol was launched and marketed as trammel by the german pharmaceutical company grunen Thal gmbh in 1977 in West Germany and 20 years later it was launched in the UK US and Australia it is marketed under many brand names worldwide medical uses tramadol is used primarily to treat mild severe pain both acute and chronic it's analgesic effects take about one hour to come into effect in two h2 for h2 peak after oral administration with an immediate release formulation on a dose by dose basis tramadol has about one tenth of potency of morphine and is practically equally potent when compared with pet adenine codeine for pain moderate in severity its effectiveness is equivalent to that of morphine for severe pain it is less effective than morphine these pain-killing effects lasts for approximately six H available dosage forms include liquids syrups drops elixirs effervescent tablets and powders for mixing with water capsules tablets including extended release formulations suppositories compounding powder and injections fibromyalgia as of 2015 tramadol was not approved in the United States for fibromyalgia based on three small trials with weak study design there is fair evidence for tramadol is a second line treatment contraindications use of tramadol is not advised for people deficient in cyp2d6 enzymes the enzymes are crucial to the therapeutic effects of tramadol by means of enabling tramadol metabolism to decimate remodel pregnancy and lactation trauma dolls use in pregnancy is generally avoided as it may cause some reversible withdrawal effects in the newborn a small prospective study in France found that while there was an increased risk of miscarriages there were no major malformations reported in the newborn its youth during lactation is also generally advised against but a small trial found that infants breastfed by mothers taking tramadol were exposed to about 2.8 eight percent of the dose the mothers were taking there was no evidence of this dose having a harmful effect on the newborn labor and delivery its uses an analgesic during labor is generally advised against due to its long onset of action one hour the ratio of the mean concentration of the drug in the fetus compared to that of the mother when it is given intramuscularly for labor pains has been estimated to be 94 children its use in children is generally advised against although it may be done under the supervision of a specialist on September 21st 2015 the FDA started investigating the safety of tramadol in use in persons under the age of 17 the investigation was initiated because some of these people have experienced slowed or difficult breathing the FDA lists age under 12 years old as a contraindication elderly there is an increased risk of opioid related adverse effects such as respiratory depression Falls cognitive impairment and sedation liver and kidney failure it is advised that the drug be used with caution in those with liver or kidney failure due to metabolism in the liver to decimate remodel and elimination via the kidneys side effects the most common adverse effects of tramadol include nausea dizziness dry mouth indigestion abdominal pain vertigo vomiting constipation drowsiness and headache compared to other opioids respiratory depression and constipation are considered less of a problem with tramadol there are suggestions that chronic opioid administration may induce a state of immune tolerance although tramadol in contrast to typical opioids may enhance immune function dependence and withdrawal long-term use of high doses of tramadol will cause physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome these include both symptoms typical of opioid withdrawal and those associated with SNRI withdrawal symptoms include numbness tingling paresthesia and tinnitus psychiatric symptoms may include hallucinations paranoia extreme anxiety panic attacks and confusion in most cases tramadol withdrawal will set in 12 to 20 hours after the last dose but this can vary tramadol withdrawal typically lasts longer than that of other opioids 7 days are more of acute withdrawal symptoms can occur as opposed to typically 3 or 4 days for other codeine analogues a 2014 report by the World Health Organisation's expert Committee on drug dependence found less than pre greater than / pre greater than dot-dot-dot in many cases of tramadol dependence a history of substance abuse is present less than pre greater than pre greater than dot-dot-dot but less than pre greater than / pre greater than dot the evidence for physical dependence was considered minimal consequently tramadol is generally considered as a drug with low potential for dependence in a recent German study including a literature study an analysis of two drug safety databases and questionnaires analyzes the low abuse and low dependence potential of tramadol were reconfirmed the German expert group found a low prevalence of abuse or dependence in clinical practice in Germany and concluded that tramadol has a low potential from its use of use and dependence in Germany because of the possibility of convulsions at high doses for some users recreational use can be very dangerous tramadol can cause a higher incidence of nausea dizziness loss of appetite compared with opioids which could deter recreational use compared to hydrocodone fewer persons choose to use tramadol recreationally overdose recognized risk factors for tramadol overdose include depression addiction and seizures naloxone only partially reverses the toxic effects of tramadol overdose and may increase the risk of seizures deaths with tramadol overdose have been reported and are increasing in frequency in Northern Ireland the majority of these overdoses involve other drugs including alcohol there were 254 tramadol related deaths in England and Wales in 2013 and 379 in Florida in 2011 in 2011 there were twenty 1649 emergency room visits in the United States related to tramadol interactions tramadol may interact with certain antidepressants and anxiolytics particularly SSRIs SNRIs Mao ice and tcas other opioid analgesics pethidine to Pentagon oxycodone and fentanyl dextromethorphan certain migraine medications triptans turgut's certain antibiotics namely linezolid and isoniazid certain herbs eg st. John's wort passiflora etc stimulants including amphetamines phenethylamine and phentermine lithium methylene blue as well as numerous other therapeutic agents as it is a substrate of cyp3a4 and cyp2d6 any agents with the ability to inhibit or induce these enzymes will likely interact with tramadol a presser response similar to the so called cheese effect was noted in combinations of amphetamine and tramadol which appears to cause dysfunction of her toxicity to epinephrine norepinephrine receptors cyclobenzaprine a commonly used muscle relaxant a typical analgesic adjunct as well as a potentiate are often used with analgesics like codeine dihydrocodeine hydrocodone and the like is structurally related to the tricyclic antidepressants and therefore should not be used with tramadol this is also the case for trazadone pharmacology mechanism of action tramadol has been found to possess the following actions agonist of them you okey ID receptor more into a far lesser extent of the delta opioid receptor door in Kappa opioid receptor core serotonin reuptake inhibitor sri and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor NRI hence in SNRI serotonin 5-ht to C receptor antagonist m1 and M free muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist NMDA receptor antagonist very weak TRP a 1 inhibitor tramadol acts on the opioid receptors through its major active metabolite Desmet remodel which has as much as 700 fold higher affinity for the more relative to tramadol moreover tramadol itself has been found to possess no efficacy in activating the more in functional activity assays whereas desmet remodel activates the receptor with high intrinsic activity Emacs equal to that of morphine as such Desmet remodel is exclusively responsible for the opioid effects of tramadol both tramadol and Desmet remodel have pronounced selectivity for the moreover the door and core in terms of binding affinity tramadol is well established as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor in addition a few studies have found that it also acts as a serotonin releasing agent 1 to 10 um similar in effect to fen flora mean the serotonin releasing effects of tramadol can be blocked by sufficiently high concentrations of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor 6 nitric clipazine which is in accordance with other serotonin releasing agents like fen floor amine and MDMA however two more recent studies failed to find a releasing effect of tramadol at respective concentrations up to 10 and 30 M um in addition to serotonergic activity tramadol is also a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor it is not a norepinephrine releasing agent tramadol does not inhibit the reuptake or induce the release of dope a positron emission tomography imaging study found that single oral 50 milligrams and 100 milligrams doses of tramadol to human volunteers resulted in 34.7% and 50.2% respective mean occupation of the serotonin transporter cert in the thalamus the estimated median effective dose edie 54 cert occupancy hence was 98.1 milligrams which was associated with a plasma tramadol level of about 300 30 nano grams per milliliter 1300 NM it was also estimated that the maximum daily dosage of tramadol of 400 milligrams 100 milligrams qid would result in as much as seventy eight point seven percent occupancy of the cert in association with a plasma concentration of 1220 nanograms per milliliter or 4632 NM this is close to that of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs which occupy the SIRT by 80% or more peak plasma concentrations during treatment with clinical dosages of tramadol have generally been found to be in the range of 70 to 592 nanograms per milliliter 266 - 2250 NM for tramadol and 55 to 143 nanograms per milliliter 221 to 573 NM for desmet remodel the highest levels of tramadol were observed with the maximum oral daily dosage of 400 milligrams per day divided into one 100 milligrams dose every six hours ie for 100 milligrams doses evenly spaced out per day there is some accumulation of tramadol with chronic administration peak plasma levels of tramadol with the maximum oral daily dosage 100 milligrams qid or about 16% higher in the area under the curve levels 36% higher than following a single oral 100 milligrams dose positron emission tomography imaging studies have reportedly found that tramadol levels are at least 4 fold higher in the brain than in plasma conversely brain levels of Desmet remodel only slowly approach those in plasma the plasma protein binding of tramadol is only 4 to 20% hence almost all tramadol in circulation is free and thus bioactive correspondence to clinical effects co-administration of clinton a potent cyp2d6 inhibitor with tramadol a combination which results in markedly reduced levels of Desmet remodel was found not to significantly affect the analgesic effects of tramadol in human volunteers however other studies have found that the analgesic effects of tramadol are significantly decreased or even absent in cyp2d6 poor metabolizers the analgesic effects of tramadol are only partially reversed by naloxone in human volunteers hence indicating that its opioid action is unlikely the sole factor tramadol s analgesic effects are also partially reversed by alpha-2 adrenergic receptor antagonists like you him bind the five HT 3 receptor antagonists ondansetron and the 5 h t 7 receptor antagonists sb 2 6 9 9 7 o and SB 2 5 8 7 1 9 pharmacologically tramadol is similar to two pentad all in methadone in that it not only binds to the more but also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine due to its action on the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems such as its atypical opioid activity tramadol has inhibitory actions on the 5-ht 2c receptor antagonism of 5-ht 2c could be partially responsible for tramadol as reducing effect on depressive and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in patients with pain and comorbid neurological illnesses 5-ht 2c blockade may also account for its lowering of the seizure threshold as 5ht 2c knockout mice display significantly increased vulnerability to epileptic seizures sometimes resulting in spontaneous death however the reduction of seizure threshold could be attributed to tramadol s putative inhibition of GA baa receptors at high doses significant inhibition at 100 um in addition desmet remodel is a high affinity ligand of the door an activation of this receptor could be involved in tramadol ass ability to provoke seizures in some individuals door agonists are well known for inducing seizures nausea and vomiting caused by tramadol is thought to be due to activation of the 5-htt 3 receptor via increased serotonin levels in accordance the 5-ht 3 receptor antagonist metoclopramide can be used to treat tramadol associated nausea and vomiting tramadol and Desmet remodel themselves do not bind to the 5 HT 3 receptor pharmacokinetics tramadol undergoes hepatic metabolism via the cytochrome p450 isozyme cyp2d6 cyp2d6 and cyp3a4 being O&N demethylated to five different metabolites of these Desmet remodel odessa methyl terminal is the most significant since it has 200 times the mew affinity of plus tramadol and furthermore has an elimination half-life of nine hours compared with six hours for tramadol itself as with codeine in the six percent of the population that have reduced cyp2d6 activity hence reducing metabolism there is therefore a reduced analgesic effect those with decreased cyp2d6 activity require a dose increase of 30 percent in order to achieve the same degree of pain relief as those with a normal level of cyp2d6 activity phase two hepatic metabolism renders the metabolites water-soluble which are excreted by the kidneys thus reduced doses may be used in renal and hepatic impairment its volume of distribution is approximately 300 6l after oral administration and 203 L after parenteral administration chemistry tramadol is marketed as a racemic mixture of both R and s stereoisomers this is because the two isomers complement each other's analgesic activity the plus isomer is predominantly active as an opiate with a higher affinity for the micro opiate receptor 20 times higher affinity than the isomer synthesis and stereoisomerism the chemical synthesis of tramadol is described in the literature tramadol to dimethyl amino ethyle minus-13 methoxy phenol cyclohexanol has to stereogenic centers at the cyclohexane ring thus two dimethyl amine omental minus-13 methoxy phenol cyclohexanol may exist in four different configurational forms 1 R 2 R isomer ones to S isomer 1 r 2 s isomer once two are isomers synthetic pathway leads to the racemate one-to-one mixture of 1 R 2 R isomer and the ones to S isomer is the main product minor amounts of the racemic mixture of the 1 r 2 s isomer and the once two are isomer are formed as well the isolation of the 1 r 2 r isomer and the ones 2 S isomer from the diastereomeric minor racemate 1 r 2 s isomer and once two are isomer is realized by the recrystallization of the hydrochloride the drug tramadol is a racemate of the hydro chlorides of the 1 R 2 R plus and the ones - s - enantiomers the resolution of the racemate 1 R 2 R + isomer once - s - isomer was described employing our - or s + mandelic acid this process does not find industrial application since tramadol is used as a racemate despite known different physiological effects of the 1 R 2 R and once - s isomers because the racemate showed higher analgesic activity than either enantiomer in animals and in humans detection in biological fluids tramadol and Desmet remodel may be quantified in blood plasma or serum to monitor for abuse confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or assist in the forensic investigation of a sudden death most commercial opiate immunoassay screening tests do not cross-react significantly with tramadol or its major metabolites so chromatographic techniques must be used to detect and quantitate these substances the concentration of Desmet remodel in the blood or plasma of a person who has taken tramadol is generally 10 to 20 percent those of the parent drug patent history the US Food and Drug Administration FDA approved tramadol in March 1995 and an extended release her formulation in September 2005 tramadol was protected by US patents knows six million two hundred fifty four thousand eight hundred eighty seven and seven million seventy four thousand four hundred thirty the FDA listed the patents expiration as the 10th of May 2014 however in August 2009 US District Court for the District of Delaware ruled the patents invalid a decision upheld the following year by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit manufacture and distribution of generic equivalents of ultra more in the United States was therefore permitted prior to the expiration of the patent society and culture abuse tramadol is used in Nigeria both by Boko Haram and vigilante groups fighting Boko Haram fighters are given it to make them feel strong and courageous there are also large numbers of youths who are addicted to tramadol in the area the cost is about 5 US cents for a 200 mg pill it is common to take twice the maximum daily dose of 400 milligrams users become angry and irritable when using it but experience headaches stomachaches and depression if they don't get their dose the tramadol is imported legally from india as there are no international regulations on trade in tramadol legal status effective August 18 2014 tramadol has been placed into schedule four of the federal Controlled Substances Act in the United States before that some US states had already classified tramadol as the schedule for controlled substance under their respective state laws tramadol is classified in scheduled for prescription only in Australia rather than as a Schedule 8 controlled drug possession without authority illegal like most other opioids effective May 2008 Sweden classified tramadol as a controlled substance in the same category as codeine and Dexter propoxyphene but allows a normal prescription be used currently the UK classified tramadol is a Class C Schedule three controlled drug on the 10th of June 2014 but accepted it from the safe custody requirement research investigational uses diabetic neuropathy antidepressant postherpetic neuralgia premature ejaculation obsessive-compulsive disorder false findings about sources in nature in 2013 researchers reported that tramadol was found in relatively high concentrations 1% plus in the roots of the African pincushion tree Nakhla latifolia in 2014 however it was reported that the presence of tramadol in the tree roots was the result of tramadol having been administered to cattle by farmers in the region tramadol and its metabolites were present in the animals excreta which contaminated the soil around the trees therefore tramadol and its mammalian metabolites were found in tree roots in the far north of Cameroon but not in the South where it is not administered to farm animals a 2014 editorial in lab times online contested the notion that tramadol in tree roots was the result of anthropogenic contamination staining that samples were taken from trees which grew in national parks where livestock were forbidden it also quoted researcher michel de warrant who stated that thousands and thousands of tramadol treated cattle sitting around a single tree in urinating there would be required to produce the concentrations discovered in 2015 radiocarbon analysis confirmed that the tramadol found in NDOT latifolia roots could not be plant arrived and was of synthetic origin veterinary medicine tramadol may be used to treat post-operative

give them a taste and if you guys have never tuned into a wheats root review before the way they work is I'm gonna eat the product some number of it in front of you maybe not the whole thing don't wanna bore you to death and then I'll come back to you guys in two and actually let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so okay nice little tear open packaging easy to open it's always a plus so here are our gummy bears very again weird we are looking gummy bears it's not focusing very well there but nothing like I've ever seen before a lot of like crystallized sugar on them let's give it a taste mmm not bad certainly taste better than infused creations or at a pure it doesn't have that really astringent cannabis taste there's a little bit of a cannabis aftertaste but it's not nearly as bad again as the sort of more egregious companies yeah not bad slight cannabis taste but not gonna make you gag so guys I'm gonna finish off these multiple bear gasp limbs which I do kind of like that name and then I'll be sure to come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how we're feeling so thanks for watching weeds and I will see you guys in just a bit peace welcome back to weeds guys there have been no bear gazans to speak of certainly not multiple bear Gazans not that I really know what a bear gasm is but I assume it's kind of like getting high or having a normal gasm orgasm and this is nothing like that this is like having shitty gummy bears and then not much else happening after that yeah there's not much to say about these they're bad they don't taste as bad as a tepee roar infused creations or some of the other really awful tasting gummies out there but they're just as weak as those in terms of potency and even shittier packaging and maybe a little bit more expensive than those as well so uh straight-up no thank you when it comes to the master baker 420 I think I might try some more of their products review some more cuz I think they have some things that are more confectionery in nature your brownies your cookies we'll see if those are any better but a really bad start so far for the master baker 420 with the fun named but not so hot of a product multiple bear Gazans 200 milligrams that's a total total pass for me if you guys see these skip them no problem saying that well that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys sorry for the bummer hopefully next time we'll have something a little bit more fun for you I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a future review

the hydro chefs gonna be in the building amongst many other sponsors like momma Mary's edibles smoke woods they all hanging out although we got it going down and we'll be talking about that later but first we're gonna bring you up to date on some news in the industry so we're going up to Portland first blockbuster marijuana deal it's a Russian billionaire is looking to get into the game I think we got to turn the speakers down in the other room we got some feedback in here tell Javon to stop playing all that crazy as rap music but um so cure leaf massachusetts company is getting into the recreational cannabis business and it's an astonishing figure last month's deal for cure cannabis was the biggest acquisition in the history of lee guys marijuana in the united states it's a sign of just how quickly the market is emerging and that's just the beginning of the story so currently if it would make curly for valuable than all but three public companies in Oregon despite reports that eighty million of the revenue last year along side with a 56 million dollar loss the marijuana market is an industry in flux caught between its underground roots and the new era of enormous commercial potential it's consolidating rapidly as early as players like Kura and Kura Leaf both with highly unorthodox corporate histories raced to lock in an early advantage like other new industries the cannabis business is coping with enormous uncertainty and rapid change a recreational marijuana remains illegal under federal law it's not clear when or how this might change but I mean if I had money to bet on this I mean that's a big deal there's Russian dude coming in and I mean really in inflating some money and that company and making it now the most valued brand in the cannabis that's a that's a that's a wild thing that just happened so what do you guys think of corporate cannabis coming into this side of things I know it's a touchy subject for things I mean the mom-and-pop is a slowly becoming a thing of the past what do you think J part of me it makes me a little bit sad you know I mean it's this industry was built on the mom and pops here I mean so it's it's tough that there being you know forced out by the big business but at the same time it's really exciting to see the industry moving into such a forward and legitimate market yeah because it need it needs the something's got to happen in Oregon right now all right it's bad like I don't know this is gonna be the change for it but we're hoping that all those farmers up there that had to suffer through the worst of the worst times I mean you want to talk about the number of licenses per person out there that were issued for cannabis cultivation it's it's it's crazy and the $5 a gram thing last summer I mean that was a the house a realistic thing and more money coming in I don't know if that's gonna change it or not how do you do five dollars a gram yeah nobody buys it low market yeah I mean that's another that's another thing too you know it was a mid market at the time so yeah a lot of things have changed right now I mean you say corporate coming in scaring a lot of people also you know the big you know mom-and-pop shops have been around since the beginning so it's kind of a touchy subject I'm just kind of curious to see how they're gonna come in they're gonna come in steam rolling and just knocking people over or are they gonna come in somewhat open armed and be like okay we got to figure out like this community and you neither be part of it or you know just going to be the other pharmaceutical because we got a lot of people that want in this industry who have never touched a plant before they've never grown before they've never even maybe smoked weed before you know and they want in this industry and they wanted to like they want you to stop buying the black market and they want you to buy from the from the actual legal way we call it white market now and we'll call the audible in traditional market but I mean after that raids last week and you know breaking news go ahead and give me the breaking news the heavy police activity reported in Anza up coming again and in the Lake Elsinore area and in Paris in Hemet and Santa Cruz its attack of the killer tomatoes I mean if they pulled this [ __ ] on any other industry yeah it just there would be a [ __ ] revolt nothing is is heavily regulated and you know falsely reported as the cannabis game I don't have a question though do you think that the big markets are making that happen yes and that's absolutely the question that everyone wants to know is legal cannabis and making this happen to the black market and absolutely that's the real answer to the question Gavin Newsom the governor of California now has you know enabled the each county and provided the funds and given the National Guard the authority to go in there and help eradicate black market cannabis a lot of this is said because they're worried about the trafficking out of state well we know that's not quite true when these things go down you see the people that are targeted a lot of the time they're minorities not a lot of time they're legal citizens too they're not legal so this is a way to go after a lot of people that normally I guess they wouldn't be able to get into the cannabis market I mean these are people that are here trying to grow and I'm not defending anyone I'm just saying both sides of the story you know you want to talk about why pack prices are gonna go up right now it's because the cheap illegally grown weed is not there anymore and a lot of that weed was it grown by illegally here people you know a lot of the farmers that went down they weren't the locals and if the locals think that they're gonna get away unscathed I think you got to stand up and really fight back jut not just cheer at your other farmers demise and b-girl add that their greenhouse went down but you gotta fight the local authority on this because your next locals who grew up in the town because in these small little towns where they're going in going hard these individual farmers I'm sure give multiple dollars back to the community in different ways and so by this happening what does it now do to those communities I'm how are the people not rising up and saying because I'm sure on top of those they're not just growing you know flowers they're putting money back into already her community and so how is this helping everyone that's where a lot of people a lot of people say it won't a lot of people say that it's going to lead to higher prices on the streets which will lead to people having to go pay that that for that cannabis that might not necessarily be tested or in other other other places it might be cheaper to go to the white market so it really does defeat the purpose when you hear about $3,200 for a pound on the black market that makes people a lot of people get into the gardening game which makes the prices change again so yeah just shout out the black market cultivator for single-handedly changing the weed game with the mean with his meme game right uh-huh he's definitely meet me maker of the year in my book so we're gonna be back we're gonna finish talking to some more crazy news it's been happening and we're gonna get lit here with chronic elixir good food gang you already know

his last post you can get hooked up and speaking of so good food gang here what's up man you're here man you'll be cooking for a minute now yeah how you get into the cooking with cannabis thing in working with catering uh something for your mouth catering well I met some of the free mouth ray and Bakersfield our first event man it was a yeah for sure so it was it was cool is one of our first events and I just met ray and I don't know it was something about us man we both just exchange food and next thing you know we're just you know became friends it's the Great Communicator it is like it's a it's a trip it's a lot of it's a lot of reasons why we start a conversation yeah it's a why why in Italy they'll never let you eat by yourself because foods to be enjoyed and you'll get you'll get invited over to sit with people if you try to eat by yourself so it's like it's amazing what food does to bridge that gap and now what it's done to bridge the gap for cooking with cannabis so how long you been cooking with cannabis I'm actually been cooking with cannabis for about five years I'm a I used to start actually I started a brownie called Mary Jane's pastries and I was selling those but I didn't know what I was doing so I was doing crazy amounts and I and then I ended up getting into it further well I mean there's a lot that goes into cooking too again I mean you know how it is a classically trained chef tour not non classically trained chef well actually I was security I did a executive protection for wait hold on record scratch you worked your way up from security the [ __ ] kitchen to the kitchen I got tired of you smashing he can make some good stay up when I started wearing a bulletproof vest I felt like okay you know I'm getting out of this you know like I can't get shot for no reason you know I mean so I felt like you know for a long time yeah so once I once I felt like you know being in the kitchen was was I made sure that I hit the manager up that was working at the casino I was at Diamond Jim casino man shout out and I got the opportunity to cook and I got trained for three weeks and then it was like hey sink or swim and finswimming ever since man so I ended up doing my own thing I went to Vegas for a while did some things with my chef Mario challenger chef Mario - man for putting your boy on with the plating and you know all the fancy [ __ ] because I mean you got it you got to kind of fail before you succeed right of course it was I wasn't able to even like I wasn't able to even cook a steak correctly because you know it Mike in my culture we we eat steaks is well done you know saying they see blood it like all [ __ ] but then you realize when you start cooking you understand the meat you understand like a this is supposed to be red you know I'm saying because it's easier to digest and then also you know it's a better food so once I found that out and and just going through trial interpolation should I go through it every day anyway you know I'm saying so but right now I mean look we're at the highest one of the highest peaks right now just being on a radio show and being invited done well I appreciate you hold us as such we got high regards I think we're in the highest peak right now in like culinary in in in the aspect of there's finally something new that hasn't been tapped yet oh the Mariachi tacos have you've seen those right yeah well that's another thing too you could look up right now cannabis infused teriyaki tacos there would never be a recipe for that online man so anything you do cannibal right now you are a pioneer in a way I mean from the time I did the KITT medicated cheese will cheese were wizard over here to the cannabis infused micheladas with the CBD - I mean it's groundbreaking stuff now how do you in this ever-evolving field keep you know elevating and showing you new things instead of just doing me - because you mentioned the brownies everyone's done brownies you realize like [ __ ] I don't know how do you get into something and really do it and do it right well my thing was I still want you to eat food right so there's there's these things when it starts that the oils the oils kind of saturated with the marijuana taste so I wanted to be I wanted you to be able to enjoy your food so I got the what's the distillate and then we started using the distillate so now you have no taste but yet you still get the same high so I wanted you to be able to you know enjoy this food now I'm out to hook you up look good food gang men we have it on our back because that's what we believe in you know good food we want you to eat like this because we know that our food is good and you will never have anything shut out without though you never have anything like this you know so those teriyaki tacos infused teriyaki tacos people haven't seen that yeah you know we're hitting them with the sriracha aioli you know I'm saying so we're hitting them with different things how do using things so I'm using the CBD and I'm actually just doing you know the correct amount I don't know the amounts really you know I suck wave measurements oh come one of those regular you know CBD I think it's um you're you get a little bit more leniency because you're not gonna really overdo it but yeah you th see me like that with the hey I don't know what you're doing my wife [ __ ] ambolyn because I'm thinking hard but wouldn't talking about CBD and stuff and we've got the in my opinion like the experts when it comes to dosing properly in proper dosing techniques because you guys have really like I think wrote the book on moderation and using things to be healthy so chronic elixir what's your opinion on a good dose for CBD per day you know it you're trying to get this amount per day and you would break it down between a couple meals you know just in in your opinion and in consumption with your product me personally I would say a good dose would be at least 200 milligrams a day and I think that's a safe starting point right I mean I've seen the homie chef Brandon Allen go deep on some things before and I've also seen them you know recommend weaning yourself off slowly so I don't know if it's about that one hard punch and then going micro dosing or what but I think there is a lot of research to be done and with CBD it's nice because you can play with it not like THC yeah you're able like you said you could play with it and if you start with that big hard punch and you realize oh hey that's too much for me what's the worst that's gonna happen you're gonna fall asleep a little bit you know you feel a little tired that's that's the worst so then you engage just like any other medication from there you're like okay I need to kick back a little bit and start myself off smaller and then from there I can see how throughout the day how much I can increment a little more or I can't in you know take down a little more you know and with that you know you don't have anything to worry about like you said a lot more control it's extremely controlled that you don't have anything of a THC worried about because it's you know just being all pure and derived it's pure CBD so that's what we're gonna talk about tonight we're going to talk about proper dose and techniques okay and how to make sure that you know what you're putting in what you're putting in so if we're making if we're making a butter for instance you know and you've got a gram of cannabis and you know that gram is testing at that's a big thing right there is making sure you know it's 20 percent off that 20 percent measurement you know how to do your math and then based on that knowing your percentage you can break that down on the butter so if you got four tablespoons in a recipe and you know each of those tablespoons is five milligrams each you fighting that recipe among four people you know how to split that that's how and that's how you to make sure we're doing proper dosing techniques and there's a lot more there's equations that go into that and maybe we'll throw that up on the Instagram afterwards because there's nothing worse than overdosing on like a food that you can actually say when I first started when I first started I overdosed on on the brownies because I was just eating them I should say overdose I should say overmedicate true right just you know because we're trying to break this just it just jacked you up yeah I was really super high you know it was actually speaking of uncomfortably high last time you guys were here you were nice enough to grace us with a couple of samples we do a show after this show called the heavy t grow show we have a character we have a character named D ed named dr. Duff okay doctor does really cool guy got a crooked eyes short guy all kinds of spunk man piss and vinegar but when he drank that when he drank that 1500 milligrams it took a little bit of that piss and vinegar out of him but we got video of him in the studio right there just latest like just like a frickin I don't know what to refer to him and he was from another planet he literally was on another uh he was on another vibration level so uh with with the THC proper dosing techniques we always got to do that you don't to be a doctor death and then with the CBD what do you think about the whole synergistic effect CBD by itself or just TBH THC by self mix them together what do you think CBD by itself is can be a great thing I think you're gonna have a much stronger effect with this energy yes well it helps them work together yes I think you're gonna have some sort of plateau effect actually with the just the CBD so you'll get the benefits but at some point increasing the dose isn't gonna give you more or it's gonna give you you know I mean you're not gonna get and a linear effect but you know I mean linear growth as far as increasing your dose whereas with the the synergistic cannabinoids I feel like you would I can dig it alright for sure so we're gonna take a caller real quick you guys you ready we got someone on holder : from Hawaii let's take a wire it's a long-distance call what's up Hawaii where you know Island you calling from hi yeah I can hear you where are you calling from what I ran right on Kayla so what what do you got going on nothing I was honestly I follow you guys on Instagram and I was calling so when something how she wants to win something we'll check it out nothing's free you got to pay attention so what question do you got about cooking with cannabis or gardening that you could think of right now that would be worthy of a prize to ship all the way out to Hawaii that's quite expensive kay super far how about the question how good of a question can you come up with about infusing but what kind of prizes were you looking for our wish is your command [Music] and Andrews like Andrews like Aladdin he's like the new Will Smith you come over and give him a little rub he'll grant you three wishes do you guys got CBD out there in Hawaii kala I actually work at a vape shop so I know what was quite a bit about CBD I'm still learning about well what do you think is like a good dose for a person to start dosing if they were gonna start dosing like every day to try to get the beneficial effects well what do you think the good dosage rate and this isn't a test this is what's your opinion well I guess that depends on what's going on with the person if they're having some like physical vaccine or more body paint and need a more relaxing release all right all right well I dig it I can dig it so um do you do any of your own garden and out there or do you are you just following a couple of the page especially not Instagram because I find how to grow my own and I would definitely love to learn how to put in my food as well that's right I do go to the dispenser area but I want to learn myself you following you following the hawaiian alchemist shoutout to the hawaiian alchemist out there you following him no I don't follow his page I should alright check this out cannabis Expo so I'm gonna let you I'm gonna give you a huge solid right here so there's a cooking with cannabis class brought to you by Aloha green apothecary and they've been doing several of them with the Hawaiian alchemists so shout out to the Hawaiian alchemists go check out his Instagram and he'll hook you up with some tips on how to cook with cannabis in the meantime I'm gonna go ahead and ship out some gardening samples from our good friends over there at general hydroponics so you can have some stuff to grow that a one out there on Oahu oh great I don't have another question oh she's thinking of rapid fire questions okay let's keep it going it was best to grow with clay pots is that true or should I do something else I mean cloth pots are the preferred method everybody will say out here in California and throughout the nation that the cloth pots are better because it helps air prune the roots your plant will grow through the cloth they'll get you know air pruned and then they'll create more roots and thus you'll get a bigger root structure so I'd say cloth pots are the way to go clay school too because it has a cooling factor and it also has a the poorest poorest quality so it holds water nice but I mean the more your plant eats and the more your plant dries out the better and I know you have a huge humidity problem out there in Hawaii so I think you're you're gonna be thinking about how can I get my plants to dry out and not stay wet yeah so and the last thing is you know I'm gonna make a recommendation you know make sure you're gonna take some preventative maintenance from mold out there because you know that's the biggest crop killer and the tire and I hired stayed out there is that a is that mildew I had one more question if you had time I mean hello Andrew woody what are you doing tonight got anything to do later no let's take let's take a long-distance question [Music] would it be best this is gonna be my first time trying to grow inside with the pen or use mean I heard of you the name on the that's that's four questions Oh Andrews rolling his eyes over here you're trying to Aladdin this fool so when it comes to like what's what's easier inside you can you can run into just as many problems as you can outside and I think it's gonna come down to what you're able to adapt to luckily for you you can bloom outside like 24/7 out at Hawaii you don't have to trip on that you you you should go outside because your power bill is power I think is like so much more expensive to out there in Hawaii so I would say immediately outside be your better bet get a little green house I think you're allowed to have sex many plants what's the laws out there what's next when you guys legalizing mushrooms and bath salts go down that rabbit hole alright so Kayla we're gonna hook you up with some of that general hydroponics for being such a good question ads we went from wondering if you had anything - holy [ __ ] can we get a minute Aloha Mahalo and all that thank you so much and

you or does that not work well no I'm actually you know I the main thing and I put THC and everything you know we make a soluble powder for cooking that's about 25 milligrams per gram and it's kind of that you know you being a chef you know about turning oils into powders right right and we do that oh no it's basically it's a cooking technique and we turn that infused oil into a powder and I added some my ramen I put it in my coffee I sprinkle it on my spaghetti and meatballs and that's that's the spicy meat the both you know because you can infuse olive oil and turn that into powder how you dry it out well again you start with what I start with is a full spectrum crude oil I then infuse that oil with cannabis and and you know I I'm taking that oil and I'm putting that oil that full extract cannabis little directly into the olive oil or whatever I was using to them and then I'm taking that oil and I'm using a cooking technique I'm using dude I don't want to give the major secret come on how you gonna call sponsor table cannabis and to keep secrets here's the deal Mitch Alto and watch videos on turning oil into powder cooking oil into powder and you'll see there's basically you're using an ingredient that converts the oil into powder you're running it through a screen and that you got powders out of it boom and you can use that on anything from your coffee to your cheese Andrews over here shaking his head that's chronic elixir approved these guys are these guys said yeah that's a technique yep that's certified Mitch where you second of in every other episode a lot of times you'll take bacon oil on bacon grease and powder it and I'm telling you what you make user salad and put some of that bacon powder that's a good way to infuse a salad infused bacon grease bill walking out Mitch say the other thing you said the other thing you can do is we we also make lemonade you know what they're called Don primo we do anima classic in a pink lemonade and they're available in dispensaries all over LA in California is the dosing you have to be able to hit ten milligram serving and whatever size your your you need to come to our market bro well we're playing on the medical market where we're going on where we're going we don't need roads yeah we do an 888 milligram one out picture an eyedropper tincture see black market only allowed to sell recreationally because it to concentrate keeping fools lit Mitch well 888 milligrams and that dose for about forty five dollars out the door in LA last week that shit's worth eighty eight now what do you think let me ask you this Mitch because you've been in the game for a minute hold on this my [ __ ] show hold on Mitch hold on let me get this question to you you would your opinion on this whole raids that have been going down cuz I know NorCal just recently took a hit to the Trinity Mendocino and they hit ends are heart and you know they took down that giant facility on the coast there in like Santa Maria yeah we've heard Santa Maria - that sucks but we're talking tens of thousands of plants well I I'm a little surprised I didn't think that Newsom would actually spend money on enforcement I do he's the two-faced on that I mean he did it from day one when when Trump went ahead and threw those our troops over to protect whatever the Mexican wall and [ __ ] and he pulled him back in the immediate next day he pulled them back and then it was just pause yeah [ __ ] ponds it's bull 100% and he was just playing the game from the get-go of beans and when he was lieutenant governor's it all for pot I'm so for pot yay for pot [ __ ] [ __ ] man now look it a black boy it's never a black markets never gonna have been thrown stronger we're gonna just hit the reset button it is 1998 you guys I mean you've got one hand you've got a firming up of the pricing for the legal side of the market and yet we're seeing an explosion and the illegal growers and people are getting arrested again it's like I was telling somebody as soon as they arrest somebody the prices are gonna firm up now let me ask you this will we get to 42 opee dude I've that crazy ROI hi I hope not because that means there's more there's more businesses so the feds rescheduled cannabis I lose about five cents on every dollar we make so there is no money in there's never been a worse time to get into any more you have to literally roll them put them on the shelf pay for the testing and then you're allowed to sell them if teeka's don't know we got tired of dirty hippie lives you're not laughing with us Mitch started so if everyone doesn't know Mitch is the owner of a sanctuary and mission fertilizer which I can't even give you a [ __ ] shout out Jesus Christ giant giant money and they're gonna end up having like three kinds of cannabis out there and that's about it yeah three big brands you paint you paint a dark picture but I tell you what though we we respect you and what you're doing for the industry give give some love out there up to the NorCal formal farmers and the Central Valley farmers and Visalia and all love that to you guys we appreciate you guys being in this industry with us and just you know doing things the way you guys do so much respect out you too Mitch and I'm gonna send you for calling in because every caller wins a prize I'm sending you a magical butter the glove so you can take hot stuff out of the oven when you have to live with the THC in it now you got a reason to swoop it up dude thanks for calling in Mitch much respect all right thanks Mitch thanks Mitch alright and so dude back to the CBD of the hour can I get lit on some CBD or because that's the question people keep saying well I feel like I get high on CBD and I'm like it's not a high it's that you haven't been rest relaxed before yeah you've never chilled we like you you don't know you don't your endocannabinoid has never your systems never been hit the reset button you touch your button before for those who've never smoked yes but for those who are smoking that synergistic effect is still on mean doesn't matter how you consume it if you're smoking and then you drink some of the CBD you're gonna have a very indica effect yes so so a lot of people think that and and is that it's countering the THC it's not actually countering the THC it's bringing out some good synergistic effects like the calming the anti-inflammatory the non anxiety yeah stuff like that so it's not the CBD getting high it's the CBD making the THC work better and on that note pass me that watermelon CBD I'm gonna make up a mini cocktail you can too at home with CBD from chronic elixir so you guys last time you're in here 200 milligrams we're talking baby doses overwhelming a request for can you guys basically make a stronger one of course we can we can make a stronger one and we're gonna put it out there proper so we went ahead and made a thousand milligrams here CBD triple lab tested and at the same four ounces and people would think you know oh you might throw off the taste or a little bit or anything like that nope not at all I mean our taste is right on point our flavors right on point you can tell the difference I mean and it it works so pineapple one of my personal favorites I like to float this one on a little the vodka with some of that Japanese soda the remm moon that stuff I love that stuff with the marble in it Oh cheers to you guys oh yeah hydroponic chef approved now what went into the watermelon and this was like you guys's last flavor you brought out yeah that was whenever I mean it's one of our original flavors and all that is the strawberry watermelon pineapple you know are some of our newest ones have been the caramel and the grape we've gotten a lot of overwhelming support from the whole caramel side with the whole coffee community they've been loving it I mean pouring is either on their ice cream or just literally start in the morning great for cooking one can cook with I mean yeah like you said it means pretty much it's it's user base that would at your pleasure at the same time of whatever you want to do whether you're pouring into your water ice tea coffee smoothie you know or by itself so I'm gonna ask for anyone that hasn't listened to you guys on other episodes J Andrew you guys take so much pride in what you put into this product what are you doing to source your own ingredients to make sure you know the highest quality products are going in well yeah well we make sure that we source everything organically I mean with me having celiac sand Crohn's disease the last thing I wanted to be doing is putting [ __ ] into my body and also into anyone else's body and then passing it off and say hey it's great and it's [ __ ] snake oil you know so we only work with some of the best hemp growers in Colorado you know at CBD distillery and they provide us with some of the best isolate purist isolate you could possibly get you know we also then run double lab tests after we get their Co way through Bell Costa and you know we get overwhelming numbers and you know and everything is coming back and the way we want and you know no medals no pesticides none the junk you know it's a constant cleaning now there's a stigma around where the hemp now and I feel like it's partially created by the legalization of hemp yes people think you're not supposed to ingest hemp for some reason like they think that it carries heavy metals or that it can it can somehow leach what's in the soil into the extract well I guess there's two signs reason with the wonderful science that exists today in the lab a molecule is a molecule and they call it CBD isolate for a reason because they're isolating if you have a good source that's making producing good isolate going through the proper steps regardless of whether was there to begin with it's not in the final product see now that's a big difference than some of the stigma they like to put out there because they'll say anything to get you to not try this stuff and make it healthy they don't want us to be healthy guys like it's not in their benefit for us to have CBD because we don't buy their drugs and their long life prolonging stuff we'll be able to live our life long on our own yeah America is the country that's about keeping people sick not getting them healthy right why we charge fifteen hundred dollars for a [ __ ] pill that's supposed to no just help everyone you know instead we look at the profit that's to me the great sides and benefits of cannabis is that you know it's [ __ ] a plant you know and it's been here for god knows how long and we've all been using this for god knows how long and it's been now thrown back into society in such a major way of looking at it like not demonized anymore and now it's put onto a level of like oh hey grandma can I take this yeah you know or you have PTSD please try this and not be eleven [ __ ] pills we just gave you you know or you've had you know a horrible car accident you want to be on that oxycontin anymore you've got options now and that's the big thing right there's is now you're able to show people and give people an opportunity to medicate you can safely educate them you can let them know that hey everything is being tested you know we're putting the same protocols into what these so-called other companies are doing that they say they're fda-approved half them they're not FDA approved they call it FDA cleared and that that's a big one that's killing me right now through the community majority the [ __ ] out there you're seeing all these pills that are coming out off the market or FDA cleared which basically is meaning that it was just sitting through a panel of people and just decided whether or not that pill works or not and those people went ahead and cleared it through a stamp on it and there you go it passed the FDA you don't have to do the four [ __ ] trials anymore ten rounds of ten years of [ __ ] so I've been seeming overwhelming a new medication is coming on the market there have nothing to do if the FDA just on the slap at the clear on there and it's just by paying off a little bit of your lobbyists and you get what you want and that's the thing with the industry right now they would prefer we take a pill that's not canvas derived and whether it's it's it's our syrup or it's our concentrates I mean and I mean that's where the shame comes and we source all of our materials properly well you source all organic materials pesticide free don't put any [ __ ] into any of the flowers that we smoke and so then you know we pass it on over to this great guy here and he turns it into some of the best now 949 extract shane in the building throwing it down talking to the microphone sorry for not having enough headphones there's a full studio today but I mean first things first working with chronic elixir that I mean these guys in my opinion are some of the few people in the industry that care about quality as much as god I wish other people cared about what people care about their food as much as these guys care about the [ __ ] cannabis you know so you are doing your extract thing how the hell did you get into this game and for these guys to take notice of it that's that's got to say something about your products first tell us where you're from and now what got you started well basically we're based out of Southern California Orange County mainly and been doing it for a long time now pretty much since I was about 18 years old and just been you know working hard and something I met this guy oh yeah came up to him at the grocery store because he was wearing a dispensary shirt you guys bro down like that oh hey did we just become best friends yeah and you know that's who I am you know I I guess I have no filter when it comes to people too I just like to go up I start talking to people networking and just you know hey I'm imagining that some funny situation happened with you and southern dabber where you guys are foreign were friends I'm sure it must have been a one hell of a story oh well me and him you know when I first started networking I hit up everybody you know I sent out emails everything you know just trying to get noticed and that's that's how you get noticed in this I've been doing it for two two plus years and just everyday hustle-bustle sending out emails and not taking no for an answer and you know it paid off you know and then these guys send me some CBD chronic elixir I did a shout out for them you know and that's how we first met and then I went to cush stock in March of oh a teen and I was just passing by their booth and he's seen me called me up he's like a whatever you want man just come back you know just you know you you can you know all you to all the drinks you want you know you're whoever's with you to you know just showing hella love you know I wanted them to say Walmart don't look at me like you can't shop at Walley world I love Walley world that's where it started off at cush stock and you know just told me like your fam so like we're gonna take care of you when you come into town we're gonna treat you as such and it's been synergy ever since so you keep bringing great people here you know back to Shane what I mean people say shatters dead right now everything's about the sauce and the resin and the rose and what are your thoughts to people like that well I mean I kind of say to each his own everybody's definitely all about the sauces right now because of all the Terps and all that everybody's all about those Turks right there with those flavors comes PPM's right yeah you know you have to watch out - a lot of people are you know adding the the fake terpenes and stuff and and you know doing stuff like that and not doing live resin extractions and you know using those real terms it's it's important it's important that you're using like canvas derived trips what terms are using they're using turps derived from that non cannabis plants and lima mean I mean that's this comes from citrus it's called citrus oil in other industries we call it you know Terps people used to use that stuff like cleaning counter tops and stuff it's in the other industries it's the it's the essential oil industry the trip you know shame the way that he does everything in the process and you know it all comes back and material that we you know give him so it literally shows in itself the proof is in the pudding when is in is what comes out yeah so let's take a look at this and most of all those take a dub of this um you know me I like to get lid on the air I'm not sure to uh you know stutter well into the microphone first things first what flavors do you work with what do you like to grow and are you a grower are you just an extract artist not just but you know a little bit of everything right now focusing more on the extracts unfortunately as you know we talked about the spike and the prices on the pounds and everything right now kind of wish I was still growing but this this guy grew the best Mendo breath I've ever seen ever seen it's time to it's time to dust off that mole [ __ ] grow life bro open up storage slap them girl lights up hit the gross stores do it where's the warehouses yeah yeah that's what I'm saying I mean it's a changing industry right now it's never been a worse time to get into these economies that's pretty much sparked that his win once I saw his flower you know and we kind of like met up and I saw his extracts and like he kind of liked sesh together I'm like okay he's on his [ __ ] game like this is this is my type of people right here that like want good quality [ __ ] they're gonna put out good quality [ __ ] and they rep good quality [ __ ] and that's all they stand for you know and those are the people that we want in our inner circle Shane pass me something to smoke as your attorney I advise you to take this free shot out okay I'm gonna tell it like it is if this is if this is a beautiful it looks and it doesn't taste is as beautiful as it looks that's never gonna happen that's alright that's [ __ ] Queen right there [ __ ] the the classic non-stick clear paper mm-hmm that's that's a rarity right there the PTFE so this right here the in cannabis right now packaging is such a huge thing if you if you're not gonna take some pride in your packaging they don't even put the product you've got to do something outside the box something niche very much you know oh so honey man yeah what flavor is this again that's the dream crack yep nice ateva it literally tastes like pineapple mango that son want some breaking bad like pure [ __ ] right there to me yeah but he's not doing it is garage yeah and he's not illegally and he's not gonna blow a hole through his ceiling first sure I'm just sayin security that that hydroponic chef approved that's good that's right oh nine for nine extra fire thank you thank you so what made you go with the extract route instead of the gardening route well I've always done both to kind of go hand in hand because you know you can use all your smalls or whatnot stuff you do people wouldn't want to buy you can easily turn that into an extract and then as it started to pick up you know just the amount of space you need to extract versus the amount of space you need to grow ain't that the truth you get a lot more done that risk versus reward also much too and then also if you know you're not growing anymore and you're linking up with also really good people and got really good connections that means you got really good connections on flour coming your way fresh frozen coming your way you know it's left farm to lab do they're going for me now yeah pretty much we do everything now with farm to lab and they're our in-house that's taken care of every single plant that goes into our body pretty much well you guys do it for the right reasons you're bringing out great product we got a caller wants to take a question so let's uh stay with you all right what are you doing Tim out in Rosemead well excuse me rose where are you from Tim Rose mom okay all right what a ten oh [ __ ] looking calling out Tim you've been on hold for a while even more girl from Hawaii so write out the rip you've won a magic butter machine Jen and Bob boy - now let's get your question so you ain't feel the pressure so much to ask a good question let's just get some stuff answered for you what's good Tim what do you want to know about cooking with cannabis I can't really smoke with my job but that's a great question and Andrew we touched on this in the last episode CBD derived from hemp technically could have point 0 3 percent THC and right now your product is derived from isolate you want to explain to him what the difference is well big difference in there like you said it some some CBD products out there still you know are grown with hemp plants that still contain somewhat of a THC count in there by isolating the individual molecule out itself and just pulling out the CBD there is no THC whatsoever in the actual product that we produce so it is 100% not going to show up not gonna pop positive for anything and also it's not going to make you inebriated at work or anything like that it's not going to slow you down like you're on some type of a too much of an edible or anything like that at the very most it's gonna make you feel a little tired or anything we're relaxed and that's what you're trying to achieve you know you're trying to achieve that you know boss have been bitching at you all day you've got you know nine hours of grinding going and all that and you got overtime you need to kick in and all that and the body's you know wearing on you you know you know what you need to do something and it's not about you know going and slamming a six-pack and all that cuz it's only gonna do so much for you the body has an endocannabinoid system and is literally built for us to be absorbing as much as this as possible and whether it's THC and needs to be then CBD so if you're gonna use one you recommend using the absolutely but the big thing is is if you did only want to use CBD your products don't contain any THC it's not gonna build up in your system like so you know you might get with some of those non-certified brands your brands are certified CBD only great easy healing I mean you made this from personal experience yes I mean you're you you're a patient yeah not only are you a doctor you're a patient patient guinea pig everything yes my partner Jason used mean pretty much as the beginning pig to make sure if it's if it doesn't affect me because I do not have an ironclad stomach I have the weakest stomach there possibly is with Crohn's and celiac disease so I needed to make sure that it did not affect me whatsoever in any regards you know I did that positive medical benefit from it and slowly by slowly we achieved it and now Havoline achieved it you know we have got them like risen to the top with what we have made and with the quality the pureness and everything that goes into its just heart and soul I mean you guys can't talk too much about it because its proprietary but there is a process that goes into this very much where the homogenize a ssin other people can't achieve this this and this is something you guys are you know you guys are real humble it's the worst kind of humble guys like don't want to spill the beans too much but did you guys do it right yes you see these products out there and there's [ __ ] syrup in the bottom and then that's our dressing and sugar on the top and it don't even say shake well on the front you could have at least put shake well [ __ ] so uh salute to you for the homogenize a ssin which is a word I learned really from you guys on your first [ __ ] appearance here J yeah you know and I mean really the possibilities are endless you can use this for mixing with not just I know you look at me a little bit different this way but Jamie and you were on the level of putting this in alcohol that's our [ __ ] man you know what I just came back from a wedding up in Temecula and you know I'm not a drinker and I'm sitting there throughout the wedding and everyone is you know knows what I do and if they don't they're watching me just sitting there just pouring that my iced tea non-stop everybody went from the groom and bride now we're coming over and like what are you doing over there and I'm like oh I'm just you know medicating some CBD this that and the other sort of like oh this is CBD you know it's just you know conversation starter not just discuss conversation starter but it's like I'm loving the conversation starter who I'm with it's a 91 year old vet and from Mooreville - you know its own has no idea what the hell this is and why I'm using it and then to turn around and be like so this helps you and like you don't get hooked and you don't need to see a doctor Wow I don't need my pain so I don't trip on fireworks July 4th absolutely what we got right here is some vodka and a nice jelly jar cuz that's how he is and then a little watermelon cvd what do you think that was about 10 milligrams oh that stuff is 42 I believe milligrams per teaspoon oh [ __ ] so yeah I just I guess I got you a good little uh a little feeling right there I got a feeling he's on minute 25 a Tim so get the get the address over to us in the DM and if you got any more questions we got your back like a chiropractor bro yeah hey good lookin calling out there Tim so you better come you better come out the 21st is something for your mouths event where your good food gang Jamal gonna be hanging out of jails all day you gotta talk to Tim if you're gonna call it missing questions and he was interrupting you every time awesome we love Mitch to thank you my dude thanks for calling in tell your friends you got a magic button all right so we're gonna take another break and we're gonna come back we're gonna keep rolling till the heavy T grows show pops off so let's see can you see CBD daily getting split every day is getting radio calm form the table Canada's call in five six two six five three oh seven oh seven check out Osama he zone down [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] nobody [Music] / got me fired oh he got me fired of course kami Pardo he got me fired oh don't donate I'm coming down he got me [ __ ] let me know [Music] [Music] come down you know what okay 100 AD ad I'm starving for another bad beat you feel like a bad person I'm dropped off somewhere smart game I really want some but you can't get this is oh she ain't got my sorry okay then I'm running up trains like it's Christmas [Music] it's going down in the studio southern Davor got us so high we're higher than giraffes a super smoky man you so [ __ ] shale dude we do you just ate you can stay lit and [ __ ] positive like I just like is his fingers stay moving I used to be a piece of [ __ ] negative person you know well you what advice you to give anyone to switch their mentality like that you know when they do something every day for 30 days straight it becomes a habit so if you push positivity every day and just try to be the best person you can open doors for people smile at them you know just tell them hey how you doing you know just try to interact maybe get my 31 on a pack instead of 32 yeah and then you never know there's a lot of people need that you would be surprised how many people that have reached out to me and told me that I was just just my words and just me being positive and smiling on camera has changed their lives you know and that's what keeps me going you know when I on that and when I see you know impact I'm making and then people doing the same thing and then I see a lot of people imitating me and doing the same thing and you know trying to be as positive they can just smile and even though they don't want to what's your reach how what's the farthest uh you ever got a DM from oh I know you get reached so we're just where where's the beer I mean from Africa let's reach bromine that's positivity a lot of people in the UK a lot of people in Iran and there's a little east over there you know Asia there you'd be surprised man yeah that kind of positive message making it to the places that needs to make it to all corners of the hill Elba pose for us and I'll get diem from Mexico UK how do I get CBD in Mexico both b1y and it's it's incredible it just blows my mind so what's missing in the cannabis industry right now as a collective as a [ __ ] way of you know either branding like what is it what's missing mm-hmm it's a good question a lot of things that I see is a lot of you know people need to come together and work together instead of you know trying to you know if you share ideas everybody no no there's enough food for everybody to eat you know you don't have to [Applause] exactly all about eating with you know a big table when I first started doing the chef thing people I was always out there taking pictures in being at someone else's thing and shouting them out and it's not because I was being facetious you know I was doing it because it's the love of food you know and I don't care about you eating and you know I want you to eat you know I'm saying I'm not trying to stop your your flow I want to promote you because it promised me and then it promotes positivity all in one you know I'm saying and if you don't do that then you have nothing really because now we're just sharks you know and you know sharks are fish take everybody with me that's why I did today what Tommy Chong and them you know incredible yeah he'd be networking like a [ __ ] Tommy shout out to Tommy for being so good the community still all these years long he's still you know it's like he's just now getting this [ __ ] payback right right right let's take this long time so when fools are out there hating on Tommy for being [ __ ] what he's doing at that [ __ ] is a [ __ ] all-star you better learn something because he got hated on for 20 whole years Michael Jordan they stopped in from imagine if they just put it on your brand for 20 years we were there for the bcc boys bongs shits are seaso gracious so you know thank you every to me the yours gracious is that so thank you every time you come on man thank you for [ __ ] you know spread in the positivity and then putting the right message out there yeah you want to leave us spread some positivity for people before we before we take off just do the best you can you know you you know it don't matter what you do just do it be the best you can at it as long you know make it positive you know you don't want to be a criminal and be the best criminal because then you're going to be the best person in jail probably but you know my thing is just be the best person you can be you know do all you can to better yourself and everybody around you and you know and then I don't know man I just some you know just something that I like is making people smile you know and just being different you know and and being different but being yourself you know that's what anything I do I try to be myself I try to because you can't fake yourself you know when you're yourself whatever you do then you don't have to be like let me put on that image so I can be this person you know and that's my that's my whole thing all right be yourself from the beginning as you don't have to fake it at the end shame that's gonna be hard to follow that but here's Jerry's Shane here's Jerry's thoughts what message you give out there to those extra artists blowing in their garage trying to get their name out there trying to do just keep doing your thing man don't don't let anybody discourage you and and like I said do do what you're good at and keep doing it do the best you can at it well that's well said - I could date that those are words to live by now drew Jay you

so I love the cocktail approach of the Hogs", "27JHBPZOAuQ": "[Music] you", "hqSvf2Typw8": "- Hi everybody, I'm so happy\nthat you joined me today. I'm going to teach you how to make a very simple cannabis tincture. So I'm gonna move my camera down below so that you can see everything that you'll need, and I'll walk you through the process. All right. So to make a tincture, the first thing that you're gonna need\nobviously is cannabis. I keep my cannabis in a glass mason jar because it keeps it fresh. I am going to weigh out 14\ngrams of cannabis on my scale. The reason is is that I decarb my cannabis in this awesome machine. I'm gonna talk about it in a second, and that machine only takes 14 grams. If you're gonna do your\ndecarbing in the oven, you can decarb as much as you want. I have 14 grams here. Decarbing is the process\nof taking the cannabis and heating it up to a certain temperature so that the molecules THC-A and CBD-A, if you have CBD in your\nplant, turn into THC and CDB. So they need to be activated or heated up in order to turn into the\ncompounds that we're looking for. And like I said, I do this in this handy\nlittle machine which I love, and if you make lots\nof cannabis creations, I definitely suggest\nthat you get one as well. It's called a Nova, and\nit's by the company Ardent which is woman-run company which I love. And all you do is you\nput in up to 14 grams and literally hit this\nbutton, and it turns red. In about an hour and a\nhalf, it'll turn green and I'll know that my\ncannabis is decarbed. The number one reason why I bought this is that if you decide\nto decarb in the oven which is a very simply process as well, you just keep your\ncannabis in your glass jar, take the label off, put it in the oven at about 240 degrees\nFahrenheit for 40 minutes, and when it comes out it'll be\na little bit dry and crispy. Again, we do this to activate it, so you must do this\nbefore you make a tincture or basically any edible. When you decarb in the oven, you can lose up to 30% of the compounds, and you don't wanna do that\n'cause cannabis is expensive. So this little machine pays for itself really quickly if you\nmake lots of infusions. The thing you're gonna do next is grind up your decarbed cannabis, so this is some stuff that I did earlier, and it's dry and crispy, and\nit smells a little bit toasty, and you're gonna grind it up. I bought a coffee grinder\njust for this purpose. You don't have to do that, you can just cut it up\nwith scissors if you want. You're not looking to have it pulverized, you're just looking to\nbreak up the surface area so that the alcohol can strip off more of those precious\ngoodies that we want. So this one that we have\nis called Zombie Kush. I always recommend\nreally labeling your jars with as much information as you can. How much cannabis you put in there, how much alcohol you put in there, what kind of alcohol you put in there. Fill that green piece of tape up with everything that you\ncan, it's easy to forget. So this one I am going to do in vodka. You have lots of options, you can basically use any clear alcohol. If you're in the states, they tell you to use Everclear\nwhich is really high alcohol, really high proof alcohol. And we don't have access\nto that here in Canada, but I'm gonna post a link\ndown below for anybody who has a medical prescription. There is a way, at least in\nOntario, to write to the LCBO and tell that that you would\nlike higher-proof alcohol to do your tinctures with, and then you can go ahead\nand buy that at the LCBO. So I've got my alcohol in\nhere and my decarbed cannabis. You're gonna shake it a lot, and you put this little\npuppy in your cupboard and let it sit there for a long\ntime, the longer the better. You can see that I have\nquite a bit of liquid in here for how much cannabis I have. I maybe shouldn't have poured\nin a half a cut right away. I should've checked it. The thing with making your own creations is that you never really have\na great idea what's in it, so you always have to\ntest the product anyway, you start low and go slow\neven with your own products. But if you want a more potent tincture, put in less alcohol so that there's more cannabis and less alcohol. And yeah, you let this\nsit in your cupboard. Some people leave it a week,\nsome people leave it month. Some people leave it a year, it just gets more potent\nup to a certain point the longer you leave it. And you can add in more cannabis\nas you get it if you like. You can make this a\nreally dynamic process. So the other trick that lots\nof people don't know about and I love telling them about is that if you use a\nvaporizer to user your canna-- To smoke, instead of smoking cannabis, I ask that save all the stuff that you... All your kind of spent\nremains that are in here, save them because even though\nyou've already used them when you used it in the vaporizer, this stuff is still potent. It's not as potent as fresh cannabis, but it still packs a wallop. So this is called ABV oil which stands for already been vaped. Sorry, it's not oil, I'm gonna make a\ntincture, an ABV tincture. And you can see I didn't measure this, so I am literally just\ngonna pour this on top. This one is moonshine which had a pretty high alcohol\ncontent, but it tastes awful. So I'm just trying to use up\nthe rest of it to be honest. Yeah, so that's not enough, so I'm gonna add in some vodka here. It's just a tincture however it works out. Basically, what you're trying\nto do is to get the good stuff off the cannabis and into the alcohol. So again, you shake the\nheck out of your tincture, and then you're gonna\nstore this in the cupboard. So this is called a cupboard tincture. There's a bunch of other\nways to do the tinctures, but this is called the cupboard tincture. When you are ready, and you can test this every couple of days or every week by just\ntaking a little spoon of it, and putting it in some\njuice, and drinking it. You should notice the\neffects if you drink it, let's say within 20 minutes\nup to an hour and a half. I know that's a really big range, but gosh, cannabis is hard\nto really narrow down. So once it's at the\nright strength for you, all you do is you take a strainer and put some cheese cloth in it, and you pour this\nconcoction into the strainer and let it drain into a jar. And then you have a\ntincture that you can just-- You can take it in a little,\nsmall tincture bottle with you, it's really discreet, you\ncan drop it into beverages. Some people can handle it\nunderneath their tongue, I cannot. Yeah, so it's a really great way to ingest cannabis without smoking it. The other things that\nyou can do with tinctures is you can turn them into gummies. That's how people make cannabis gummies is they use a tincture base. You can boil off some of the alcohol when you're done making the tincture so that it's like a\nreally thick goo almost. You can infuse that into honey, so just to melt it into some honey. And you can use that and just\nswish it around in your mouth so that you get the benefits\nof how quickly it'll go into your system in your mouth, but you don't have to\nhow terrible it tastes with the alcohol, the honey\nreally helps with that. So starting with a really\nbasic cupboard tincture can be a really fun,\neasy way to get into it. If you have any questions,\nplease let me know. I'm gonna link to all the instructions for you to do this down below, so don't worry, you don't\nhave to write anything down which maybe I should've\nabout before but whatever. I do hope that you enjoyed it. If you did, please give\nme a thumbs up on YouTube and write me a comment, it helps, so that other people can find me. And if you are looking\nto improve your life and you'd like to start using cannabis, but you don't know how and you'd like somebody to hold your hand, then reach out on my website which is www.revealcannabis.com. I have a cannabis consultation there. It's 150 Canadian dollars, and I walk you through the\nprocess, and hold your hand, and help you learn how to use this beautiful plant medicine for health. Until then, I will see you next week.", "uMPqRxO2_UY": "hey what's going on everyone finding supplements here and today we're gonna look at these two caffeine tablet types of supplements here we got all max caffeine versus the prolab caffeine and i'm not here to tell you which one is better because in all honesty there is not much of a difference as to effects and how long they last and which one works better or which one gives you more energy or anything like that they pretty much give me the same feeling same energy the same wake-up buzz that we are all looking for okay and of course before i continue always you want to consider your health if you are already taking lots of caffeinated coffee or drinks energy drinks then you're better off not buying these because they're not going to do anything and on top of that if you are taking these super powerful pre-workouts and you're taking it like every day then taking this is also not going to do you anything would just be a waste of time money and you're just damaging yourself because too much caffeine in the long run will hurt you so you want to take some caution when using these supplements and i would always advise to those of us who are taking these or starting to take these to take it when you just really need it and i mostly take these on days when i'm not working out and i take it when i start my day because if you want to keep on taking so much like that you're going to lose the effects of them and then when you go to actually work at a gym using that actual pre-workout you'll find that the pre-workout isn't doing you much because we're just abusing these supplements all right so let's start with the price range here and uh basically these can be purchased under 10 depending on where you buy them from and that's excluding shipping and also you can purchase them um in large quantities in terms of like for prolab you can get about like three or four of them for around maybe 25 to 30 dollars and that's of course depending on where you shop you can get deals on those especially on ebay and same thing with allmax as well you can get about two or three bottles for under 20 and again that depends on your location and excluding the shipping price so i'm just throwing that out there these are all just uh prices that will fluctuate so don't expect to see what i just mentioned where you're shopping okay at the same price as that is okay and of course do check out metabodysubs.co.uk it's a supplement site that has supplements you won't find anywhere else on the market and before you continue if that would be really awesome to like share subscribe you can do that after watching my video but i'm just reminding you to do that and let's go ahead and continue with these here so the prolabs again now that we got the price out of the way the bottle comes with 100 of these and each tablet is 200 milligrams of caffeine and it says here energy focus and endurance and with every other caffeine tablet out there the best way to take these is on an empty stomach with water only and i always say room temperature water is the best and on top of that um again try not to take it so much throughout the day if you need one go for it and maybe three to four hours later if you feel like you need one more then possibly try it out but do not make this a replacement for sleep alright so i'm just throwing that out there again and when you look at the label here to the back they do tell you how much to take a day and again up to three times a day but i would not go no more than two a day remember your health is more important than these things here you may feel great you may feel all that energy and some of us may have heart issues and we're unaware of it so be careful and you can just pay attention to the ingredients as to what is shown here and it's um it's got uh these very unusual ingredients in there so just keep in mind you're not just consuming caffeine you're also taking in these other ingredients to help make the tablet but it says uh no yeast wheat corn milk egg soy gluten or any of those other preservatives and stuff like that so we're kind of on the safe side with these and again another reason why you don't want to abuse these because you know what they're made out of is not 100 pure coffee bean all right at least from my little research then we got the allmax caffeine tablet again same thing 200 milligrams per tablet and it's 100 tablets in the bottle so choosing between these two in terms of price range and the quantity they're basically the same amount and i don't know maybe for me um they feel the same way the same thing maybe for you they might be different the biggest difference between allmax and and the prolab is the tablets for allmax one is different and on top of that you can break them in halves which would most likely give you 100 milligrams if you don't want to take so much and on top of that i find that these go into effect faster than the prolapse and i think what i noticed is that when i put them in my mouth they actually start to dissolve in my mouth faster than the caffeine prolab caffeine so that's one of the major differences from them but again in terms of price quantity how much you're getting per tablet effects side effects good side effects um they're pretty much the same so it's just a matter of your preferences what you want to get what you can actually get access to it looks like prolab is not available in every country i have been reading some of the comments on my channel here and it seems like prolab isn't available everywhere and on top of that once again if you want something faster effect the all max is the better choice but it's not by a long shot okay you still do get the fast effect with prolab it does work but in terms of duration how long they last in your system at best maybe two hours at the best and then when you're entering the third hour you will start to notice the crash if you get those or the fading of the energy levels and that's pretty much it for these two i always wanted to do a video like this now that i have both of them at hand and again you want to keep in mind how much you're using a day or how much to take how much you actually really need and that's that so like share subscribe turn on notifications and again do check out metabodysups.co.uk and that's that i'm not paid to do any of this these are all purchased from my money okay so no one's paying me to do this no one is sending me these products here i bought all of these with my own money so like share and subscribe and thanks for watching", "JmPIAQmsX6A": "[Music] a drink for the first time dozers we are looking at dozers cannabis infused strawberry lemon-aid comes up

ounce bottle so this dozer has 100 milligrams of THC serve shake well serve ice-cold just came out of the fridge looking forward to it first time trying to drink on wheats so let's see both how it

feeling so not further ado let's open this bad boy up shake well again just in case give it a taste that's pretty good there is a strong marijuana taste to it however Dusty's like lemonade but the after room the more I sit here the more it tastes like marijuana there's a strong there I want to have to taste but the initial flavor is quite good but it does linger still lingering but it's not gonna unless you test the taste of weed edibles now this is gonna be just fine but yeah so the dozers gee strawberry lemon-aid cannabis infused tastes a little bit like weed tastes okay but the most important thing as we all know is how it makes you feel and so I'm going to jail this bad boy drink the rest of this off and come back to you guys in two hours and let you know thanks so much for watching we'll see you soon hi guys we are back here on weeks it's been two hours since I have consumed this drink down this bottle of dozers strawberry lemonade I'm not sure why there's a G on it it says dozers on the back but yet there's a drink the G and a strawberry and eliminate I don't know dozer I I'm not a hundred percent sure it's actually even called juicers to be honest but I would not recommend it so don't concern yourself with what the name is the more I drink of it the worse it started it tastes it started it tastes less like strawberry lemonade weed and urine mixed together and two hours later I don't really feel very high at all which is especially disappointing because my tolerance has been a little bit lower recently because I'm just getting back from vacation so I just wanted to let you know if you see dozers or this random G and a dispensary near you hard pass no thang I'm looking forward to reviewing some more drinks in the future to see if my mind changes but right now wheats would not recommend you spend your money on drinks thank you so much for watching guys and we'll catch you on the next video", "pUhJnKKQDTE": "as marijuana becomes legalized throughout North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the munchies? check out our AsAP stop video that breaks down the science behind that by clicking the screen or using the link in the description and subscribe for more weekly science videos every Thursday", "ppKvv2668OI": "[Music] when I was doing a bite here and today we're going to make some high-quality MCT oil using some canvas so there is a couple of steps to this and we do need a couple of different things so everything that we are going to be I have right here in front of us so we're going to need a crock pot for using this method of the making our empty tio which is a batch to the have right here this is some very potent stuff I found this out last night you're supposed to start low and go slow I definitely suggest doing that so when you're going to need for this is some MCT oil that you could pick up if you're in Canada at GNC health has some pretty cheap or if you go to probably any local health food store they're probably gonna have this stuff you're going to need some cannabis depending on how much you want the rear there are calculators out there and I will put a link for a calculator to kind of give you a rough estimate of how potent your your things are going to be like let's if you want to make gummies or stuff like that so I'm gonna put the calculator below and it'll basically just help you decide what you're going to do now when I made this little here I used 38 grams of cannabis as well as I don't know probably like three four grams of Keef and just the mixture of other candidates that I had around so it was pretty potent stuff so if you're going to use okay so to start we need to talk about D carving your cannabis or decarboxylation it's basically turning your THC a into THC which is what you are really looking to do if you're going to ingest cannabis now if you don't decarboxylate it really won't do much for you so what we're going to do so I guess what I should say is you have a couple of different methods of being able to decrypt leave so you can use the crockpot method because on high they usually heat up to around 220 degrees you put it in a calendar and you just put it there thank you news [Music] okay so there are a couple of different ways that you can be box decarboxylate your cannabis so you could either put it into a canning jar you can put it onto a cookie sheet or something like that or something like this here silicone cookie sheet and you can put this in your oven for about an hour at 225 degrees and that will decarboxylate your canvas this is the method that I chose to do this because when you do it inside of a canning jar with the lid closed you were actually keeping in the terpenes now if you were to just decarboxylate on a cookie sheet throw down a silicone on top of that that put your cannabis right on it you are actually going to lose your turkeys you're going to strip them out of your oil and that's something that I did not want to do so the canning jar method for this instance is a pretty good way of doing that because if you're doing your infusion in the same jar that you decarboxylated it you're going to keep all of your terpenes inside your jar which is great so let's start the process so in the oven 220 degrees for an hour what you're going to do is want to take this out every 15 minutes set an alarm and you're gonna want to turn your jar just kind of shake it up make sure that it's kind of everywhere mixed up and every half hour you're gonna want to burp the jar so you're only gonna burp it once burp it in the first half hour period then you take your cannabis out of the oven you are pretty much good to go so I have some footage that I use the making this oil here and this here is a pretty potent oil I had some last night and I can honestly tell you that you should probably really start slow and go from there don't don't overdo it I made some gummies and just like licking the spoons and the bowls I think I got my fill so yeah make some pretty potent oil and that's we're planning on doing here today it's you know so let's get started and we'll go from here [Music] so the reason why I'm wishing it up like this is because I have 473 milliliters of MCT oil and I know that that won't be a full jar up to here so we're just gonna squish it down [Music] all right that one's mixed up you see this mixed up pretty good here let's get this in the MCT oil and we're gonna get into the slow cooker [Music] [Applause] [Music] so the reason one of the reasons why we did it into the canning jar meant that was so that we were able to keep the terpene profile over animus now if you were to just decarboxylate on a tray we wouldn't got the same abilities out of it so we would have lost all of our terpenes [Music] this here looks like it's just to say covering at all and we got maybe like a couple teaspoons left in the bottle [Music] so perfect [Music] [Music] all righty guys so we dropped her in there and now you just gotta let her do or think what we're gonna do is just I guess probably keep filling this crock pot back up with water as imagine it's gonna get pretty hot and we're gonna lose some of its kind of the steam out so we'll just have to keep an eye on so we'll come back and check them in this problem you tomorrow all right guys so it's been about 12 hours now we put it in a little midnight last night it's just a little bit past noon here and 66 degrees Celsius one hundred and forty nine point seven it's temperature that it's been going at on high and if we take a look at her oil when first put it in it was clear oil now we can see it's a nice dark green delicious looking oil let's see if we can maybe get under light here a little bit sassy we'll get you a better shot your moment with flashlights alright alright guys so I've got my measuring cup I've got the strainer that sits in it I've got my cheesecloth what I'm gonna do is take this out of here this is actually pretty freakin hot play with and we're just gonna let it cool off for a little bit and while that's cooling off let me get some cheese bot open [Music] get a couple little laters wrapped around here don't really wanna be able to see through it but I would like to filter out most of those kind of fine once particles so I've got me one of these Curie filters and that's really gonna get all the very fine fine fine stuff out of it so that's what I'm gonna use for the very fine stuff so for now we're just going to pour it here into the cheesecloth get out most of the large particulates and then we're going to do the finds with this year we should have some awesome future oil and then with this taintdroid we can do lots of things with make some gummies well I don't really know lots of things but other than just that using this nature but I really want to make some gummies and that's what I was thinking about doing so if you guys are interested in that let us know and we will make a video for you on how to make gummies you can probably start to see this I'm not sure if you can see some camera not butter there's a nice green oil nice green danger I think what I've done here is underestimated the amount yes I have underestimated the amount the cheesecloth I would need to strain this out [Music] [Music] oh yeah there's quite a bit in this cannabis though [Music] you've got a clip holding this and now we're going to just do we're fine strain into our jar that we're going to store it in a little bit better review here my messy cupboard cannabis all over it alright [Music] all right so I've got a lid wash to clean ready here what I'm going to do is I'm going to stick a notice I got some MCT oil it was made November 5th 2019 and we're just gonna stick that on here now I'm gonna grab a flashlight so we can kind of see this here so we can see here it is a greenish oil we put it in it was Coulier clear clear and now it's a nice green so what you're gonna want to do the store this oil is it want to put it in a nice cool dark place some people recommend putting it in the fridge and that's one of the benefits of the MTT oil if you put it into the fridge it will not solidify like it does if you were to use coconut oil and I believe that also preserves a little bit longer as well so there's definitely some benefits of using the MTT oil so here you have it guys I hope this video was easy enough for everyone this stuff here tastes really good this tastes a lot better than the textures that I was buying from the licensed producers and with 38 grams plus a couple of grams of Keef this [ __ ] it should be pretty good well so we're gonna try some out and yeah we'll go from there [Music]", "aNUcMvxH3ds": "good morning folks how are you today hope everybody's doing real well um get it highlight you get about what sitting this fool you know this is my series is called fool for fitness so I truly believe you cannot have work in the gym the bad food that you eat at home so it starts we get to your supermarket so if you end up middle aisles get out up I call that the zone of death because there's nothing in it they said maybe some soups and they're not really that good for you because of all the salt they put in them but processed food in general it's just bad it's just bad so let's talk about today one specific ingredient this would be maybe a three four minute video at the most all right and that's how we're gonna do it we're gonna keep them short and we'll keep them sweet but remember its food for fitness you can't do it all in the gym you gotta have some discipline when you get to that supermarket and we give to that table but if you're eatin wrong things that are not really food it doesn't matter how much of it eat you eat it's bad for you let's talk about one ingredient right now I look this up it's called first sulfate its iron but it's the body really needs but usually it's prescribed by a doctor so you have something in your food right here it was on a bag of cheese curls hot cheese girls I don't eat them but I bought them because you know look everybody's seen the experiment on the on that and is that the other day when the guys set it on fire and it burned like a torch I'll tell you about that in the next video anyway ferrous sulfate okay it's normally prescribed by a doctor and the doctor has to determine is the safe for you to take the it can cause nausea that sounds like fun severe stomach pain that sounds like a lot of fun bloody diarrhea oh wow that's great coughing up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds okay shallow breathing that sounds like a lot of fun seizures yeah you really want to be down the ground shaking it sitting like that don't you because you ate one of these of agony think about it folks seek emergency medical attention if you take too much of it so if you're eating these just sitting there chomping on big old bag like this little tiny bag that big old man you got guess what think about it seek emergency medical attention now I'm not personally won't take anything that says that but it doesn't say on the back then tell you that I'm telling you may be fatal to a child now who is most likely to be eating me a child so they put this stuff in your food don't tell you what's in it it's all in the back it's on the back but it'll tell you what it does and what it's really for I'm telling you listen to me you heard it here first puh for fitness peace out have a great day", "o3fYypXjEeM": "hi buds it's candy here today I'm going to be making THC infused strawberry lemonade that I made with distillate so I'm going to be a hundred percent honest with you I'm leaving a timestamp here so you guys can go straight to the recipe because I've made this way more complicated than I needed to be and basically this video you're gonna watch me turn a mistake into something magical I can start feeling the heaviness right now Dex first things first you're going to need a gram of distillate roughly it does all the grams and I'll be talking more about it later on two cups of sugar 1 cup of Everclear this recipe calls for a two-to-one ratio and we're using Everclear to dissolve the distillate that Everclear is something you could potentially skip next we need roughly two cups of half strawberries as well as one and a half cup of fresh squeezed lemons next you want to preheat the oven at 200 degrees and leave it at 200 degrees so that where we don't activate the THC and I honestly just so it you don't need to activate the TFC because it's already there so we just want to make sure we conserve as much as possible next get the 2 cups of sugar and put it into a pan then get the 1 cup of Everclear important to a bowl now we're going to be putting that one gram of distillate into the so that we can start mixing this distillate roughly houses around a thousand milligrams of THC in it the reason I wanted to put it and Everclear was so that it would dissolve evenly and that way I could put it evenly throughout the sugar my original plan was to make granulated sugar about what I did was I messed up and I closed the oven door and then it turned into a syrup so then I decided to work with what I had but yes I will be making an actual tutorial on how to do the guy kneeling sugar now we just mix the Everclear and the distillate together next you pour the mixture onto the sugar you could use a little bit of a wider pan than we did then we mixed it all together and make sure that everything is saturated evenly next just place to the 200 degree preheated oven and set your timer for 13 minutes and check for daily and this is where I messed up my original plan I did close the other door so it did cook down and it created an actual cistern so if you do want to make granular sugar you simply just leave the oven door open so that way it can all evaporated but then you get this golden to cool this is where the real recipe begins you simply boil two cups water and keep it on a very low simmer because you do not want to activate the THC and then I poured the syrup that I created into the water just to dilute it a little bit now here I'm going to be placing the actual instructions on how you can make it a lot easier and save the headaches basically ideally you would just put the two cups of water melt two cups of sugar into it and then add a distillate right on it I actually enjoyed several clearer taste to it it had a little bit of a move to the lemonade so I didn't mind it now it's time for the lemonade start cutting an equivalent of two cups of hats strawberries put them into a little bowl and then start mashing away you could certainly use a blender but according to my friend he doesn't believe in them use this now it's time to roll some lemons and get the juices flowing and start to squeeze the lemon juice in there I did get a roughly an equivalent of a cup and a half of lemon juice it could certainly be anything ever they want and then I add the mashed and pureed strawberry onto it I actually enjoyed the masher because it left Jack pretty pulpy give it a good stir and then we're ready to add the syrup we created put it in along with two cups of water and that's pretty much it after giving it a good little stir simply serve in chilled glasses and enjoy I really enjoyed making this granted it was a headache and a half just because of a failed experiment but you can always turn something negative into a positive and definitely this was a positive hope you guys enjoy it as we did and I'll see you guys later we're gonna feel it slowly I'm happy you", "Q-F8DTU-jn0": "Dr. Steve Wolf: Phenobarbital is one of our\noldest anti-seizure medications that have been around. It's indicated for both seizure types. The major problem with it is sedation, sleepiness. That's why the newer medications have a lot\nless sleepiness and side effects and waking issues. Patty McGoldrick: Now it still is used a lot\nof times in infants, children who present with neonatal seizures, and that's one of\nthe first medications that's given to them. It's also used for people who present in status,\nwhich is prolonged seizures, and who may be in the emergency room. Not necessarily as the first medication that's\nused for that, but somewhere down the line. Dr. Wolf: The problem is in the emergency\nroom, when you use it, it can really knock you out, and put you to sleep. And of course, if you give too much of it,\nit actually can affect your respiration. Patty: Now, the other big issue with phenobarbital\nis that we've been using it for years to control seizures in newborns and in infants. And actually, the latest research has shown\nit can cause much more cognitive damage than we initially thought. So we're trying not to use that as rapidly\nas we did in the past. We use some of the newer medications. We try to get children off phenobarbital pretty\nquickly if they were using it. Dr. Wolf: There were studies in the 80's showing\nthat it can affect hyperactivity in young children, as well as reading scores and attention\nscores. So again, this drug can have a lot of potential\ncerebral side effects. That's why it's nice about some of the newer\nmedications that are out there that might have less cognitive effects. So it's important to discuss with the people\ntaking care of you whether this is the right medication for you, and what are the other\nchoices.", "ZBiwmu4NEuE": "epilepsy is the most common serious

the date Saturday for me but well I I mean but it's a it's gonna be uploaded on Sunday so you're good you're good happy Sunday everyone or Saturday no it's it's Sunday for you now cuz you're seeing this on Sunday but or I mean maybe Monday or whatever day of the week it is today I'm gonna take a bunch of weed pills and see what happens I've taken thirteen before one time but it wasn't it wasn't these ones the ones that I made before when I took thirteen weren't nearly as potent as these these ones I used more reclaim than those other ones if you guys want to see how I make my reclaim pills I have a youtube video up just go to my profile and you can find it so I make reclaim or THC caps with reclaim these ones are pretty strong probably around 60 milligrams each maybe a tiny bit more I'm gonna take six of them right now I normally take two and when I take two I get pretty blazed and a lot of the times often take two and then I'll take two more so on I'm taking four in a day but you know spaced out and then that'll Holly not need to smoke as much because I'll be pre placed throughout the day enough I'm trying to be or whatever so today we'll see what happens if I take six so let's say that let's start taking these I'm really really bad at taking weed pills um just cuz they're fat I mean these pills are you it's [ __ ] hard you miss okay though we'll get to it look into it one we're drinking a mango smoothie by the way right here mangoes help you get more lick if you eat mangoes 30 to 45 minutes before getting late these pills probably gonna take longer than that to kick in but still mangoes I love them what you guys might witness me choke right here in this YouTube video cuz really better taking pills you know we to Ithaca okay number three going in okay gone down easy so far number I think it's the smoothie honestly a thicker consistency drink makes it really easy to swallow fat pills for me number four down the hatch up to number five I did not drink quite enough somebody knew that but it's doing down it's just fine the last but not least not least goodness gracious number six Cheers I almost got that one stuck in my throat but we're good six pills down the hatch a YouTube video though I feel like from me wouldn't be complete without at least a DAB so I'm swiping the wheel off of my fingers they just these ones have a little bit of oil on the outside just cuz I found sitting here for so long sometimes they leak a tiny bit instead did YouTube video for me wouldn't be complete without an ice dam but I'm not yours Emma do you want to die right now all right we're gonna do a dab right now then I was gonna say I'm not sure if I'm gonna do it now or wait like a little bit but then it took a weed pill while ago so I feel like once that starts kicking in she probably won't want to dab so it's perfect timing to take it down right now I'll heat it up and let's get it got that well you know what I feel like I hit the creation in the last YouTube video didn't bring my last video on Instagram last video on Instagram was at that pen in nature let's go for it the konk studios burning tube here nicely clean ready friend Aloha I don't know why I have a feeling that while recording this video the storage on my phone is gonna run out I just have a feeling we'll see so if it randomly cuts out yours like wait a minute this video doesn't seem quite right it's probably because my phone died not my phone dialing my phone ran out of storage recording in 4k 60 frames per second takes up an incredible amount of storage no [ __ ] big files so yeah what I do normally is all I record a video and then I have to edit it right in Adobe Premiere is what I use it's on the phone it's really great for editing for videos like that elissa we're at 5 minutes in 20 seconds so we've got like 6 minutes and 30 seconds will be about damn time so then I'll go and edit it and once I edit and get the full video then it saves again in my phone so it's like I have the footage twice so it's just an insane amount of sort so I've been going back and kind of deleting the extra videos and stuff so we're good on that I actually forgot to grab dams hey babe do you think you could grab some dabs um we have 30 seconds and some papaya and lime warp would be lit gonna go six minutes in oh no I think I said six minutes and thirty seconds tonight in the recording yeah okay as usually I'm not ready at all whew sorry about that babe knows like I just feel everyone else okay going in on the dab cheers everyone might be a tiny bit let's have I mean I need to be here I'm not sure Wow definitely didn't sorry I'll get you're good you did it was my apology long and okay here hit that up really interesting on the temp there but still nice now holy [ __ ] I'm gonna be so glazed when these weed pills kick in oh and we interesting to see what we end up doing today probably some streaming on Twitch yeah some art maybe will be will try to make some music [ __ ] yeah well I'll check back in um and like an hour maybe I'll check in every hour on these weed pills and let you guys know how it's going I think every 30 minutes okay okay every 30 minutes we'll do a quick clip until I start feeling them and they'll tell you guys a little bit more about what's going on so yeah I'll start a timer catch you guys in a sec when I check back in in 30 minutes yeah all right Chiefs it's been thirty minutes actually 35 minutes we just finished some yoga um I mean we took that dab right before so I can't say that I'm baked from the six pills yet but I was laughing while doing that yoga because I was farting a lot yoga always makes me fart I don't know what it is [Laughter] yeah it's all the stretching and stuff so I had the giggles I was like what's this because of the weed pills like you know what I don't think so but my stomach started hurting maybe like 15 minutes after I took the weed pills but it's because I hadn't really eaten much except that mango smoothie right and so I ate a Nature Valley bar and now I feel phenomenal but I mean it's like 2:30 now so I should probably eat some lunch you know actual fat meal you know what I'm saying before these weed pills really start kicking in is what I'm thinking so yeah I think that's next up on the plate is making some food maybe some potatoes oh yeah it's settled making potatoes I'll show you guys what I make alright it has now been 1 hour as you can tell via my eyeballs I'm starting to feel it it took 6 weed pills I haven't dabbed in just about an hour so I could be mine early lit still from that last time for sure for sure but I am NOT just mine early let you see realized pretty nicely blazed right now we'll check back in on another 30 and see if they're fully kicked in and whatnot what's going on I got my eyeballs and they're pretty red right now so see if they get redder if I get more lit we're not thinking about it I feel like thinking about how that I am makes me realize that I am indeed quite blazed already see where it goes see you in 30 peace alright checking in haven't made the potatoes yet it's been at least another 30 or so minutes I need to make the potatoes now and then it's like what type of potatoes are you gonna make I was you're good I'm blazed the pills are working and yeah I got a little cardio in so that was nice you know warm up the metabolism to get the pills going even more so yeah ok let's check back in in 30 minutes or actually I'll check back in when these potatoes are ready which will be 30 minutes we're checking that's like a blanket to see it's like it looks like a blanket but it's a jacket it's like psych Oh underwear with it two things all right so it's been another 30 minutes the potatoes are cut up I haven't seasoned them yet because I was checking my canvas which is freshly rezoned what are you judging how much you think I'm lid off of based off of that's what I thought this is literally reflective now I can reflect a traffic light like oh it's green no I'm just kidding I don't think that's the thing look good at that this one's available on our website links down below alright we're now four hours in since I took the pills and I am blazed I forgot to take I'm so blazed I forgot to take a video of the food I literally just ate a ton of potatoes some turkey sausages and some guacamole I like to dip turkey sausages in the guacamole and then yeah and then potatoes and I just ate all that and now I'm just like yeah [ __ ] yeah so I think that uh Senna and I are gonna finish watching this episode of this dank show we're watching and then we'll see where the day takes us after that you know what's good YouTube its cosmos and as you may have noticed it's not the same day as I was just recording and that's because I kind of fell asleep last night I mean I definitely stayed up pretty late but I forgot to keep recording about how late I was I was pretty damn blazed overall I would say but I figured since I forgot to record it again we'd wake up and do it all over again cheers [ __ ] let's get it we'll take when I take six pulse we'll take five bills right now I got pretty blazed yesterday we'll get pretty blazed once again today we're getting kinda low on the pizza Oh kind of low on the pills and I have to make some more soon let's down these five pills take a DAB to start the morning off

"5-o1BEb8eek": "now speaking of getting high yeah you know not all highs are good highs sometimes there are bad highs yeah do you have a horror high story of that experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "alXmrk8rWWY": "hello everybody welcome to token daily today is the 16th of februari years 2010 and for today I have a product review for you yesterday I stopped in to a local dispensary called karma suit Cole's here in Denver they're located on for South Santa Fe so give them a call stop in and check out what they got I myself picked up a medicated soft drink they this is the Dixie elixirs brand and I'm excited to give it a shot I've never had a Medicaid soft drink myself before I a couple drinks of them but never full dose of it so I'm very excited to give this a go and see how it turns out they didn't have a variety of flavors this is the sweet tea flavor um I can't recall exactly how many they had I want to say about seven or eight flavors total so I'm going to go ahead and give this a go I'm hoping it's a twist top if not that I'm gonna have to do a quick cut and grab a bottle opener okay so it wasn't a twist top the top did turn a little tiny bit but then it just wouldn't turn anymore so I gotta put the bottle opener and pop the top off so here we go not much to say before actually taking the drink it looks like your typical soda smells like a Saudi can't really smell the weed a real nut in it first impressions it's not too strong a flavor of the weed I didn't really shake it up at all because it is a carbonated drink so I want to make it to flat it does taste a little old and doesn't have too much bubble and left in it if I were to pick this up on the table not knowing that there is weed in it especially if it was sitting next to a similarly flavored regular iced tea I don't know if I'd be able to tell that there's a weed in here I don't think it's too strong usually with most read things you can you can taste it with the aftertaste if it's not so strongly initially flavored and this I'm not getting a whole lot of residual we taste I hit do it though definitely getting with the bigger gulps so maybe it's just because I am eating towards the ball gonna do it a swirl here maybe the flavor kind of settled down a little bit not sure exactly how long it had been since the manufacturer dropped us off at the dispensary and how long he had been sitting at the dispensary before I picked up yeah definitely get more of a taste now so I think it was just the case of the weed particles in the soft drink kind of settling down so when you do pick this up give it a like swirl there carbonated so don't shake it up too much but you are going to want to shake it up a little bit just so you can distribute the flavor among the whole bottle of stuff in the end the flavoring is decent than I have to say because it is like most other good products it's not overbearing with the taste of wheat it's not gonna really put off somebody who doesn't like the flavor of it and it should hopefully be enough of a dose to do something for us but with most edibles it takes about 45 ish minutes boards even start to kick in so I won't be able to tell you in today's video exactly the effects of it um but I will have a quick update for you on that in tomorrow's video so stay tuned and I will give you the results of today's test I didn't do this in the morning I've only had a couple bowls vaporized so I do have a fairly fresh palette for the day so until next time this has been another token daily episode my name is Paul and that's all I've got for you", "8OJ6v23ah6w": "good morning guys I wanted to quickly go over how to calculate milligrams of THC and explain what it is exactly I think this is one worth knowing since milligrams of THC is quickly becoming the new dominant unit of measurement when it comes to trying to discuss dosages just like it's the dominant unit of measurement with prescription medication and a lot of other substances also in legal jurisdictions it's becoming increasingly the standard way to label the dosage up on marijuana edibles and drinkables when we talk about weed traditionally it was always done by weight grams ounces pounds and so on which was very broad and also very standard and in the last 15 years we also started using percent THC to be more precise which describes the THC content of a particular strain per gram and thus its potency per gram but that figure was always expressed as a percentage for example this strain is 12% THC but now we've gone one step further to the milligrams that milligram figure is not as confusing as it seems if you have one gram of weed also known as 1000 milligrams and it's a strain that's 12% THC that means there's 120 milligrams of THC in that single gram why do we need to take things to milligrams because one standard dosage especially when it comes to edibles has been defined as 10 milligrams 10 milligrams of THC is the amount of THC that a relative novice consumer would need to consume in order to feel mild of cannabis effects a mild high so if you buy a marijuana chocolate bar and it states that the whole chocolate bar contains a hundred and sixty milligrams that means that's that chocolate bar has 16 of those standard doses and they're most likely divided into the little chocolate squares in that bar now that doesn't mean that to the average marijuana consumer they'll be able to get decently stoned off of ten milligrams as I said in my episode on tolerance just like with alcohol marijuana tolerance Rises 10 milligrams is really just a measurement for novices for myself I need at least 25 to 30 milligrams and my tolerance is above average but it's nothing special I know super heavy marijuana users who don't feel much of anything until they get to about 50 milligrams but if you're just starting out with edibles 10 milligrams should be your first trial run obviously to control dosage on such like with such precision you have to live in a legal weed jurisdiction because that's the only way you're gonna see the percent THC or the milligram THC vigor expressed in a reliable way on the package so there you go now you know what milligrams THC is and how it might apply to you hope you enjoyed the show if you found it useful be sure to subscribe and hit that like button see you next time", "rfx3WcD5F_M": "[Music] this is Dixie elixirs manufacturing facility we're coming up on our one-year anniversary in just a couple of months go on take me on the tour the bottling filler these things crank out 8,000 units a session with any given month we're going through between three and four hundred kilos of raw plant material transforming that into liquid and that looks like a bunch of oil right there we're looking at our state-of-the-art lab it's a supercritical co2 fluid fractionator what that's doing is taking raw plant material and converting it into an oil uh-huh and we believe that the future of cannabis is that of the oil technology is a white white-hot sector and we're making those investments literally monthly well cool I want to see where all that edibles are made looks like we're packaging up our ridiculously sophisticated toasted rooster 70% cacao so it's really high-end that's very very high and I would put that up against Godiva any day long it's 84 milligrams 12 pieces 7 milligrams each the sublingual mint law very socially acceptable flat yeah just pop a mint in there very efficient it's a low dose this place is massive and so how much product do you guys make a day when I look back at where we started we used to manufacture these widgets by the hundreds now it's literally the tens of thousands oh the reality is that the demand for adult use cannabis is like nothing we could have ever predicted as an industry so you're making a lot of cannabis products yeah", "pvply1CNh9Q": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are looking at another product from cannabis quencher I know what you're thinking if you're a fan of my videos but wheats you're saying you've already reviewed the strawberry lemon-aid and that is correct but I've only reviewed the 200 milligram variety I have not yet reviewed the 100 milligram bretty in fact I've never reviewed any of the 100 milligrams from cannabis quenchers and the strawberry eliminated was my favorite flavors so far so I thought I'd give it a go if you've ever tuned in two weeks before guys the way our show works is I'm gonna take this edible or drinkable consume a bowl here finish it and come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling cuz that's the most important part of any edible review but without further ado let's open this up and give it a smell give it a taste see how it tastes and smells it's got a strong we do der just like the other cannabis quenchers but that's okay because the the taste isn't that bad if it's like the others I assume it should taste even better having less THC in it but let's find out [Music] and yes that is the case he's just like the other one except with a slightly less power potent wheat aftertaste which is great because the that's the worst part about this is the sort of lingering marijuana taste in your mouth is sort of oily weedy taste the initial taste is great it's just that aftertaste can linger a little bit but this is less potent than the 200 milligram variety in terms of that aftertaste so that's something look boy - it's good the gondolier said Strawberry Fields and cannabis fields equals are sweet and refreshing strawberry lemonade forever again don't know what the gondolier has to do with cannabis winter at all can't figure it out but I'm glad he's there to tell me all right guys well I am going to finish this off and I will see you in two hours to let you know how we're feeling thank you so much for watching wheats chasm we'll see you soon peace guys half the price half the THC but not half the potency man I gotta say pleasantly surprised with the cannabis quenched your 100 milligrams I am pleasantly stoned for something that it's only advertised as half the strength as it's a hundred milligram brother and I don't feel half as high I feel you know not as high but but certainly not significantly less and the price is uh it so this is all this is I think it might dispensary half the price of the other one I think I would go with this one unless you really really really want to get knocked off your ass or if you have an incredibly high tolerance stick with the two hundred milligrams but I gotta say the hundred milligrams gonna do you the job probably and it's gonna do it at a more affordable price and I really really have enjoyed my reviews with abbis quite sure I will probably try some of their more exotic flavors just as an excuse to keep drinking them Wow yeah a plus um this gets uh well say an a because the the flavor isn't perfect and that's the first time I've ever given anything a letter grade before and probably the last time I ever do that so enjoy that and thank

we're in the other tent I pulled them so it's just these two that shape gums", "-fWfip8_nkA": "hi and welcome to Kara basics today we learn five easy ways to use cannabis vegetable glycerin tincture marijuana vegetable glycerin or VG tincture is a thick sweet and usually golden to dark brown color tincture which has the amazing capability to allow THC to mix easily into water-based liquids there are several ways of making vegetable glycerin tinctures some involving the cannabis and VG sitting for months on end others use heat to speed the extraction and sometimes alcohol is used to extract the THC which is then combined into the vegetable glycerin we'll put links to some of these methods at the end of the video and in the description but no matter how you make or acquire your tincture here are five easy ways to put it to good use one of the easiest ways to use your vegetable glycerin tincture is to make jello with it you can use it one small package of jell-o and make it just for the directions and once you pour your jello into your boiling water you want to mix that make sure it's thoroughly mixed and then go ahead and add in your vegetable glycerin tincture for one small package of jell-o depending on the potency of your tincture one tablespoon is probably enough next step is to go ahead and make sure that you've fully incorporated and by that I mean really really mixed the hell out of it and makes your VG in there and then now you're going to go ahead and get a cup of cold water ready I like to do that by pouring a water over ice and then using the ice to water and then combine the one cup of cold water with the one cup of hot water and again mix it very thoroughly and making sure that we get that tincture mixed all the way through as much as possible and then as per the directions of the jello put that in the refrigerator for about three or four hours and you're gonna have a nice marijuana infused dessert treat that you can hardly at all even taste the cannabis in this if you use that ratio it's very transparent a nice way to get a small dose of the vegetable glycerin tincture and it really helps if you have a sore throat of anything and that jello next up we have fruit juice because the vegetable glycerin tincture allows the cannabis to become soluble in water you don't really even need heat or anything like that to be able to mix it into a water-based drink such as this is a watermelon drink here but you could use pretty much any kind of drink that you want or a smoothie and just simply take the cap off depending on how much you're gonna put in you might need to take one drink out to make a little room but I've only put about a teaspoon in this and I didn't need to take any room out but just make sure you shake it thoroughly and again now you just want to make sure you incorporate it good so you don't get all of your tincture in one drink so you don't want to shake it a minute or so and then if you let it sit for very long between drinks you'll want to shake it up between each each sort of session okay and conversely as well as you could add it to cold drinks you can also add it to hot drinks so the third method we're showing here is to add it to a cup of tea but of course you could also use coffee and you could also even use a cup of hot cocoa but especially if you're using tea what you want to do is you want to make sure that you go ahead and let your tea steep fully and then go ahead add in your any other flavorings such as honey or lemon or whatever you're adding in and then add the tincture and last and you certainly don't want to add your tincture in first because it's gonna absorb into your tea bag so make sure that you've taken your tea bag out squeezed it out added anything else and then add your tincture and last again mix it thoroughly I like to use the dipping spoon to mix it when it's hot it'll melt all the takes you right off there you've got a nice marijuana infused cup of tea or coffee or cocoa [Music] okay and the next method is to make silly syrup and what silly syrup is is basically taking any kind of syrup or honey I would recommend real maple syrup but I'm just using kind of just cheap breakfast syrup here which has a very similar consistency to the vegetable glycerin tincture and not adding in a ratio I would say at least two to one but you probably want to go maybe even four to one for parts syrup to one part of the vegetable glycerin texture then once you have it combined mix it well again and you can store it just like it is for on the counter for as long as you could store the syrup usually but the one thing is you wouldn't want to make sure that you thoroughly shake or mix it each time before you use it but once it's made you could use it just like you would any other kind of syrup I'm putting it over some waffles here with some melting butter and it's delicious again the artificial maple flavoring and this syrup totally disguised that a pretty large amount of cannabis tincture that was in there you didn't even notice that at all and it's a really effective way to to get your medicine into you on a daily basis without smoking or causing any further harm to you and it's a nice subtle way to do it the only thing about this especially in the syrups or anything like that you want to make sure you label it and keep it out of reach of children if you make any of these kinds of recipes that would sit around and then she could use on in and then our fifth and final method here is to use it as an e-cig juice a lot of people don't know that this vegetable glycerin tincture will just vape perfectly right inside of your ecigs cigarette device and you just however you fill your device normally you just put in the tincture I use a little syringe with the the big needles which is used for that and it's perfect and it vapes good it tastes good you could add in some flavorings some lemon or some pine or whatever flavor you might want to flavor up your tincture but it's great just as it is this episode of cata basics is brought to you about the roughhouse studios of smoke shop selling vaporizers wax pans rolling papers and

vitamins and minerals so let's get to it now first of all take your multivitamin and throw it in the trash all right most multivitamins are trash right they don't give you enough of the ones that you need or they give you too much of the ones you don't need not to mention the whole vitamins the minerals competing for absorption thing right so most multivitamins are trash so get rid of your multivitamin and it's best you actually get them from food or you get them separately and again obviously you guys know the importance of vitamins and minerals right they're not optional most people think they're the optional when they're not in fact most people that i run into are completely deficient in the key vitamins and minerals which is insane because they have such a huge impact on your health your strength your ability to put on muscle your energy levels everything right so a lot of you guys thinking hey um i need more coffee or i need more of this or i feel like all the time my t levels are trash your vitamins and minerals are lacking right and it's due to five main reasons number one like i mentioned most multivitamins are trash number two most people have a shitty diet not enough fruits and vegetables number three even if you eat enough fruits and vegetables chances are you're not getting enough vitamins and minerals because our soil is trash and lastly most people forget that minerals especially minerals um have a very very low body availability right not all of them but the vast majority same same thing with vitamins too right so just because you're taking let's say a thousand milligrams of xyz that does not mean that your body's using all of that right a lot of these vitamins and minerals have very low bioavailability so that's why most people are deficient but anyway so let's rank them according to uh the most anabolic ones meaning the ones that directly influence protein synthesis all right let's get started so borrow i'm gonna put bro on that okay right the main benefit of bronzer is mainly uh reducing sexual mobility globally increasing free testosterone um but i'm not to put a high on the list because it's not anabolic per se right but it will help you indirectly next calcium obviously calcium is going to go to amazing right you can be deficient in calcium it's obviously important for muscle contractions protein synthesis in fact one of the ways in which testosterone acts is by increasing intracellular calcium so obviously without calcium no contractions and shitty bone density all right next magnesium is in i'm about another category right almost everyone is deficient in magnesium which is insane because it's so important for insulin sensitivity testosterone levels protein sentences you name it right so i'm about to another category also keep in mind guys i do not recommend any of these brands i'm not sponsored by any of these i literally just went online and looked up the first snapshot i could find right so you'll notice a lot of these basic ass companies i'm not sponsored by any of them and i'm not recommending i'm not saying they're good or bad i'm literally just using their pictures to make this video as fast as possible all right next selenium is going to be in okay you can get that from brazil and that's literally like one or two brazil nuts and you got all your selenium for the day um next vitamin c amazing very important for recovery antioxidant properties now obviously you don't want to overdose right because it's going to hinder your growth adaptation so don't overdose on vitamin c just get enough to up your recovery and your immune system and so forth iron is obviously okay very few people are deficient in iron anyway right unless you're a vegan or some right but i'm gonna put an okay category obviously you guys know why i do it helps with energy red blood cells blah blah all right next potassium i'm going to potassium are amazing right so many people are deficient in potassium i think it's like 90 to 100 of people um and again very important for optimal performance muscle growth protein synthesis vitamin k i'm gonna put that okay very important for bone density and insulin sensitivity um but it's not anabolic per se right chromium i'm gonna put that one that  amazing because almost everybody's deficient in chromium and it's very very important for insulin sensitivity um next zinc obviously zinc is an i'm about to nut category especially for your bodybuilder which is what this video is for anyway right very important for your immune system for bone testosterone protein sentences managing sex homo body globulin estrogen you name it right so i'm about to another category iodine i'm about to nut category extremely important especially for your thyroid obviously i made a lot of videos in the past about t3 t4 that but again over 80 of your body's iodine is located in your thyroid gland right which shows you how important it is right for t3 function so a lot of you guys thinking hey my metabolism is slow how do i speed it up what chances are you deficient in iodine um but again if you if you're eating iodized salt chances are you're getting enough next vitamin a amazing so important for so many functions including your immune system believe it or not everyone thinks of vitamin c obviously your eyesight uh but it also plays a role in protein synthesis and uh testosterone function b complex i'm about to nut right and i just put all the b vitamins into one right you cannot be deficient in your b vitamins right and obviously everyone knows what they're mainly known for which is obviously energy production right so again if you feel like all the time make sure you're not deficient in your vitamin b they do a bunch of other things but they're mainly known for energy production phosphorus i'm going to put that one in okay right mainly known for dna synthesis protein synthesis and obviously bone health vitamin e again i'm gonna put that one in okay known for its antioxidant properties um vitamin d3 you guys really know where this is going if you watch my video on sunlight um this is the king and again remember guys this is not a vitamin it's a  hormone it's a steroid hormone you cannot be deficient in vitamin d i'm not going to go into details because this video is going to be way too long but watch my video on sunlight you cannot be deficient in vitamin d so hormone guys it's not just for bone it's not just for calcium i think it's crucial for satellite cell activation lowering myostatin increasing protein synthesis improving insulin sensitivity increasing your strength optimizing your neurotransmitters i mean i could go on and on and on and on this is the most important thing on this entire list here right you cannot be deficient environment especially if you don't spend enough time outside chances are you're deficient in that right next chloride i'm gonna put that one out okay everyone is getting enough especially if you obviously put salt on your all right manganese believe it or not i'm gonna put that one that amazing right very important and very underrated mineral that has a ton of uses in the human body from enzyme antioxidant properties insulin sensitivity again most of your sex hormones your lipid metabolism glucose metabolism amino acids you name it right this mineral is very very underrated i'm gonna put that one amazing uh chloride i'm gonna put that one out okay everyone's getting enough chloride colleen extremely important for your energy for for lipid transport your neurotransmitters building your cell membranes blah blah blah but it's not directly anabolic it's not really going to boost protein synthesis too much i'm going to put that one at okay um copper everyone's familiar with copper's role in energy so i'm going to put that one in okay here somewhere and obviously fluoride man that's the only one i was going to put that bad up your garbage but obviously we don't want to put any of those things in battle pier garbage i'm just going to put it right here all right so that's it guys i'll try to make this video as quick as possible these are your most anabolic vitamins and minerals i'm about to know you vitamin d3 magnesium zinc iodine your b complex uh amazing you have your calcium vitamin c potassium chromium vitamin a manganese and then everything here is okay right so i'm not saying it's okay to be the official in the ones that are down here right obviously you don't want to be deficient in anything but the ones in the top two tiers you definitely don't want to be deficient in right if your goal is to maximize strength and muscle growth all right guys hope this video helps comment below and let me know what you want to see

marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary although this time we are not going to be reviewing an edible we are instead going to be reviewing capsules delta-9 capsules to be exact 300 milligrams of THC 10 capsules in there with 30 milligrams each this will be the second time I have reviewed a capsule I reviewed I think it was gold caps the first time hated them a huge waste of money they were very expensive and they did nothing for me these are both cheaper and more potent I believe the other ones were 250 milligrams for 40 these were 300 milligrams for 30 so not a good sign necessarily but this is from Delta 9 this is why I decided to give capsules another chance Delta 9 is a company that I know from their chocolate I've reviewed three of their chocolate bars and have found them to be all amazing so I thought I would give their capsules a fair shake because I've never tried anything from gold capsule than there's one capsules and those were terrible so because this is from the trusty brand delta 9 or at least their chocolate is the trusty brand I thought let's give the capsules another chance who knows you might find some some gold here if not liquid gold so but I think I'm gonna do with these actually is I'm not going to eat them or take them all right off the bat I think I'm gonna do them in two batches 250 milligrams batches about 90 minutes apart so do all three of these over the course of the three hour span and come back to you guys two hours after the last time so this will take five hours in in totality to let you know how we're doing so I'm gonna take or four and a half hours I guess I don't know something like that so I'm going to do ten of these then come back to you guys in 90 minutes let you know how I'm feeling and then take the other ten and then come back to you guys two hours after that and lets you know how we're feeling with the whole batch so let's get started with this first half here let's open it up and just like you would expect this little bottle here oh and we've got our dastardly packaging which I opened nice and easy alright so here we go open open open here are what our capsules look like they're pretty handsome capsules white and green just like the packaging so let's grab five of these for now let's put the other five back in the model and let's take the five that we've got here and just uh I pressured that male life like I could choke okay [ __ ] it'd be funny did it choke thank you Ron Palmer love you alright well those pills tasted like plastic and amazing oh my god such rich complex flavors and those pills ooh still you know decoding all of the complex and just interesting tongue feel that I had with those pills of course I'm just [ __ ] with you who cares what they tasted like they tasted like pills I will see you guys in 90 minutes however to let you know how these first half of these pills are filling so I will see you guys in just a bit thanks for watching wheats and I will see you soon all right guys on back it has been about an hour and a half since I had the first five of the Delta nine capsules which is 150 milligrams of THC and I would say I'm already way higher than I was before when taking the gold caps 250 milligrams of THC definitely way higher than that but not outrageously high I'd say I'm at a four maybe a five somewhere in there so definitely feeling it which is a huge improvement but not you know this isn't like akarova 150 milligrams cookie um these excuse me these five pills um but we still have half the bottle to go so we'll see how much more these final five pills are how much farther they get us in the process all right so here we are we've got our final five these handsome little devils here we'll just do the same thing as before risk choking to death and take them all down in one go still alive that's got to be a sign of something so we've seen how it the first half go after about 90 minutes now let's see how the second half of the bottle goes and for that guys I will check back with you in about another 90 minutes and we will see if I am maybe at Delta nine instead of a delta for that kind of works all right guys I'll see you in about 90 minutes peace welcome back guys another 90 minutes has passed since I had the Delta nine capsules the remaining 150 milligrams and that seemed to do the trick put me from about a four to a straight linear about eight or so I'm quite high as you can tell from the eyes well no no no let's not say eight let's let's let's let's pump the brakes a little bit and go with a seven it's not let's not jump too far I think I'm maybe at about a seven but I'm pleasant with them I'm happy with where I'm at capsules I don't think are ultimately going to be for me these are a hell of a lot better I think than the gold caps the Delta nine capsules that's just on a sample size of one from both companies so you know take with that what you may but but my experience on these are a hell of a lot better than what I have with the gold caps and these were cheaper so that's a total win for Delta nine I don't think I'm gonna be purchasing them they're a little too expensive for me for what you get I do like the concept of them I do like the idea of capsules and just being able to like have something super super discreet that you don't even have to eat I just haven't found one yet that's as potent as I'd like them to be these are close these are close and if they were a little bit cheaper I would buy them on the regular for different occasions but as is I think I'm going to probably not be picking these up in the future but you know who knows maybe if they come out with different dosages or change the price or if I'm looking for something just to mix into a medicine bag or something maybe I'll maybe I'll still give these a chance and also let's give the wheats producer here round of applause for this back here oh my god isn't this amazing the wheats producer just which the they came in here the other day and they're like this place is a piece of [ __ ] we're whipping it into shape and I was terrified because if you ever met the wheats producer you would be you know mortified if something like that were to happen to you and look what happened you know a few days later we have this professional-looking thing in quotations thank you so much for watching wheat skies we will check you out on the next review Papa Papa peace great", "0lxV6jowuJ4": "[music] Researchers at the Arizona Health\nSciences Center are discovering that the root of the Turmeric plant used for centuries in\ncooking and in ayurvedic medicine is effective against some inflammatory diseases. Turmeric is a spice that's used, it's\nwhat causes curries to be orange, and it's traditionally used a lot in Indian\ncooking but it's also used traditionally in Indian medical systems and it's used\nspecifically for inflammatory things like colds, sore throats, and arthritis. Dr. Janet Funk is a clinical endo-crinologist at\nthe University of Arizona College of Medicine. With support from the national institutes\nof health, she studied Turmeric to see if it is useful in treating arthritis. In her lab, she found that\nit prevented arthritis by blocking an inflammatory\nresponse in the body. Turmeric attacks something early on. We know that same pathway is\nimportant in a lot of other diseases. Dr. Funk recently teamed with Dr. Leslie\nRitter, coordinator for the Stroke Center at University Medical Center to see if\nTurmeric might help stroke patients. Their research has shown that\nTurmeric can reduce the inflammation that complicates the effects of\nstroke and may even be preventative. Are more curries in order? or Turmeric supplements? As we know in laboratory\nmodels, it works very well. But still, there's no clinical\ntrials with people showing that they work and that they're safe. Turmeric that we buy at the grocery store\nand that we use in cooking is basically comes from the Turmeric rhizome and they dry it\nand grind it up and that's Turmeric powder that you buy in the spice\nsection at the grocery store. When you go to the store to buy turmeric as\na dietary supplement, it comes in a pill form and it's not just the dried\nrhizome put in a pill, rather, instead they take the dried rhizome,\nthey extract it with various chemicals to get just a small part of it so that\none pill, one dietary supplement pill of turmeric is usually equal to\nthis much of the dried powder. So what you buy is very different\nthen what you use in cooking. These are just different capsules that\nwe've opened up and we've looked at them to see what they're composed of and\njust looking at their colors you can see that they're not all the same and when you go to\nthe health foods store, you can't really tell. There's not enough information given to\nyou to figure out what's in a given capsule because that's just the way they're regulated. In their lab, Dr. Funk and Dr. Ritter\nused turmeric extracts that are isolated and prepared specifically for them so\nthey know exactly what they are testing, what works, and how. Additional research and clinical\ntrials in the future may prove that turmeric is an effective\ntherapy for many of our ills.", "SG7EE3sX51Q": "Iron tablets, difficult to absorb by the body but here's everything pharmacists learn to help you get the most out of this tablet and if you can guess the name of this iron tablet? leave a comment below and I'll let you know if you're correct so, you've been prescribed iron tablets because you're anaemic or you're at risk of becoming anaemic iron is needed for the production of haemoglobin which is super important because it carries oxygen from our lungs to the rest of our body in our blood cells which is why too little iron can make you breathless, tired, lacking energy, pale and may even cause heart palpitations so now that we know the basics let's talk about how to get the most out of your iron supplement take your iron supplement on an empty stomach so that's one hour before food or two hours after food and research shows that if you take your iron supplement with a drink containing vitamin C like orange juice it can actually improve the absorption iron is difficult to absorb in the gut and this is massively reduced by the presence of food, tea and milk so avoid these one hour before and one hour after taking your iron supplement some medication also reduce the absorption of iron supplements for example antacids iron supplements can also reduce the absorption of many other medicines so for example levothyroxine is one of them and certain antibiotics too so to see the full list and what to do about it I've left a link in the description below feel free to check it out now you've tried to take your iron supplement on an\nempty stomach but it's leaving you with loads of side effects like tummy pain, constipation, diarrhoea and feeling sick the good news is that these usually go after your body gets used to it but if they're not going and you can't cope with it then speak to your pharmacist or your doctor about these following options option 1! check with your prescriber if they're happy for you to reduce your dose and build it back up slowly to the prescribed dose\nthat way your body has more time to adjust option 2! speak to your prescriber as they may be able to prescribe you an alternative iron supplement with a lower strength and option 3! you've tried 1 and 2 and they haven't helped you're still getting side effects well speak to your prescriber or pharmacist about taking your iron supplement after food to reduce the stomach irritation lastly iron supplements can make your\nstools darker and sometimes black which can be a bit of a shock but remember it's completely normal and harmless always check any medication you purchase\nwith your pharmacist or doctor to make sure it's okay for you to you use please remember to always read the information leaflet that comes with your medicines and if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask your pharmacist and that's it you're now an iron supplement pro! let me know if you found any of these tips useful? by commenting below which ones you never knew about and if you liked the video if you found it helpful make

this year that we absolutely need to dive into and it's looking at a molecule called nmn or nicotinamide mononucleotide and this molecule it looks to be fantastic in the fight against aging researchers such as dr david sinclair have made enemies famous but for such a hyped molecule we've got surprisingly little human data and that's why this new trial coming out is so exciting so in this video we'll briefly go through what any men actually is and how it works what the current research is that we've got what this new trial adds and what i personally do with all of that information by watching this video you'll give yourself the best chance to fight aging re-energise your cells and protect your dna and if you like this video please do smash that thumbs up button it really does help with the youtube algorithm and we've got a great giveaway at the end of the video and all you need to do to enter is be a subscriber and leave a comment now let's get into it all right so to understand what nmn actually is we need to go through what a group of enzymes called tattooins are so situants are an essential factor that can extend an organism's lifespan and the saturns can do this by protecting the telomeres at the ends of the chromosomes sustaining the genome integrity and promoting dna damage repair so we want to do everything that we can to activate our situants we want to make sure that we're repairing our dna the trouble is though the situants they use a molecule called nad plus they use the nad plus almost like they're fuel but as we age our levels of nad plus go further and further down this means that we don't have the fuel that we need for our situants to activate we're not going to be repairing our dna as much as what we once were this is not what we want we want to boost our nad plus back up to healthy youthful levels and this is where nmn comes into it so preclinical studies have shown that nmn can help in heart and brain health alzheimer's disease diet and age induced type 2 diabetes obesity all of which are linked up to the deficiency of nad plus now a d plus it's a large and bulky molecule so our bodies it struggles to absorb it and that's why we have to take other molecules such as nmn the nmn can actually be absorbed by our bodies and then converted into nad plus in our cells and when we give nmn to mice we get some truly epic results so in mn treatment it significantly improves both insulin action and secretion in type 2 diabetes it maintains the neural stem cell population and it restores skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and arterial function in aged mice so that's why we get so excited about nmn because in the mice trials it looks to be a fantastic molecule to help in the fight against aging but here's where the problems begin for such an exciting molecule we've got very little human data all we've got right now is a clinical trial that investigated the safety of a single nmn administration in 10 healthy men so this trial did show that a single oral administration of any men was safe and effectively metabolized in healthy men without causing any significant detrimental effects but it's a very small trial and it only gave any men once it didn't look at the effect on the nad plus levels in these people all it was looking at is is enemies safe when given once that's it that's all the evidence that we've got not good right well luckily for us we've got some human data looking at another molecule called nr or nicotinamide ribozide so just like any men the nr it gets converted by our bodies into nad plus and the latest trial that we've got was published in 2019 and it was an eight-week randomized placebo-controlled trial and it did show that nr significantly increases the nad plus within seven days relative to baseline and placebo so we do have some human data showing that this theory works by taking nr we can boost our nad plus levels we can make sure that our solutions have got all of the fuel that they need but we still haven't proven it for nmn so at this point you might be asking yourself if we've got all of this human data for nr but we don't have much for nmn why do we still get so excited about nmn well in a couple of mice trials the nmn looked to outperform nr so while assessing how to treat frederick's ataxia which is a rare inherited childhood heart disease nmn was found to be successful where nr treatment fails and when we have a look at alzheimer's disease for which amyloid plaques are thought to be the main culprit nmn is potent enough to reduce the burden of these amyloid plaques by reducing its production but when we have a look at nr there was no impact on amyloid accumulation so that's why we still get very excited about nmn even though it's got less human data than nr the nmn trials in the mice it looked to be more promising than nr and that brings us on to this next trial the one that's due to be released at the end of this year it's looking at nmn so it's a study involving 66 adults and it's a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study where they are directly comparing 300 milligrams of nmn against the placebo and most importantly they're measuring the blood in a d-plus concentration so this trial is finally going to answer will nmn actually boost our nad plus levels in our blood and our cells it's also going to measure what happens in a 6 minute walking insurance test the effects on our blood pressure a 36 point questionnaire and the evaluation of any adverse events so this is a massive trial because it's going to be so useful in answering once and for all will nmn actually boost our nad plus levels but i wanted to know a bit more detail about this trial so i reached out to the company who's actually running the trial who's called effie farm so effie farm are based in shanghai and they were established in 2016. they focus on the research and development of new ingredients in the lab and then put them into mass production so they're one of the companies who actually produce enemies so the chances are if you take an enemy supplement you might be getting from effie farm already so i asked iffy farm why did they want to do this trial and they got back to me and said after any men entered the market many enemy brands appeared one after another so in order to make our nmn stand out and better serve human health we launched a new brand called youth ever we are the only any men raw material manufacturer to conduct clinical trials in the world we predict that there will be hundreds of enemy brands next year so the only different selling points that can guarantee sales and establish a brand image is by doing clinical trials i then ask them how expensive is it to run a trial like this and they came back and said to me a staggering half a million to a million dollars so it's no wonder that we don't have many of these any men human trials they are just so expensive so for me personally i'm very thankful that a company like effie farm has taken the stand and they're going to do trials like this i then asked effie farm what does the future hold and they're going to do another trial looking at a higher dose of any men they're going to look at one gram of any men and see what that does to our nad plus levels effie farm they also want to make sure that they continue their relentless drive to make sure that any men is safe they're still devoting a lot of effort into doing the clinical trials like the one that we've just been discussing and after that they want to get us fda approval for gras so all that means is that the enemy will be generally recognized as safe which is a massive step in the right direction and it will help brands worldwide to operate the enemy product legally and coming back to nr or nicotinamide ripocide so remember we can use nr to boost our nad plus levels so within our cells that nr is converted into enemy men and then the enemy into nad plus so what is it about the manufacturing process of nmn that makes it more expensive than nr so how any min is actually produced is that manufacturers such as effie farm they take the nr and then convert that nr into nmn so from this manufacturing process you can see that nmn is always going to be more expensive than nr and the final thing that i wanted to ask effie farm is around a concept called methylation so if we take these nad plus boosters then our saturns they're activating more which is exactly what we want and when altitudes are activated it produces a molecule called nicotinamide and when our body processes that nicotinamide it either converts it back into any men or it clears it out of our system and to clear out that nicotinamide it methylates it all that means is that our body is adding a methyl group to that nicotinamide unfortunately though our bodies have got a very valuable source of these methyl groups and our methyl groups are needed to switch on the right parts of our dna and to create neurotransmitters so if we're using up all of our methyl groups on nicotinamide then we're not going to have enough methyl groups to switch on the correct parts of our dna which is not what we want so some people including myself take methyl donor molecules such as tmg so i wanted to see did effie farm consider using tmg in their any men trials and they replied and said no effie farm is a raw material manufacturer we focused on the dietary ingredient industry so we'll leave this part to the finished product manufacturers and brand operators so overall that's all of the human data that we've got so far so for me personally i'm definitely convinced to take a precursor to boost my nad plus levels now the precursor that i've chosen is called niacin and i've primarily done this because niacin is a lot cheaper and i've still got a lot of medical school student loan to pay off so for me right now i can't afford the nmn but in the mice trials it does look like nmn is the best way to boost the nad plus levels in our cells so for me if i could afford any men i would definitely take it but please let me know down in the comment section below what are you going to do are you going to take an nad plus booster such as any min or are you going to wait for this human trial to come out and if you liked this video please do smash that thumbs up button it really does help with the

you enjoyed this video and until next time thanks very much [Music] you", "Ftn2xgfI_3g": "[Music] welcome to infuse deeds this is Natalie I'm your host and today's recipe is funny honey [Music] first you will need some cannabis flowers or shake you need soy lecithin powder you need coconut oil and you also need honey but you can also use a gobby nectar if you want have vegan virgin if you'd like to find the complete written recipe with the exact quantities all inside of an interactive cookbook of cannabis infused recipes then please subscribe to and views deeds you can check that out at the link on the screen or in the description now if you're not sure what story lecithin is it's safe it's an emulsifier then it's natural and it's available online and in some health food stores this is going to be used to help us keep our recipe mix by preventing it from separating over time and this is an optional ingredient we will begin by processing and decarboxylate in the cannabis but in this method we're going to infuse the coconut oil and cannabis together at the same time what we'll be doing is activating the THC another cannabinoids so that we get high and at the same time binding the THC to the fats and the coconut oil so that it gets into our bloodstream in an efficient manner so first weigh out and grind the cannabis into a coarse meal consistency and be sure to remove any large stems and seeds now first we're going to use one half of the coconut oil and add it to the cannabis we're gonna put that in the oven safe dish and cover it tightly with aluminum foil or a lid if you have one now we reserved back the other half of the coconut oil for the next wave of heat now put the bowl with the cannabis and the oil into the oven set that for 250 degrees for 30 minutes now we'll let that heat undisturbed and be careful when you remove it because of course it will be hot now you can mix the oil and the cannabis and see that most of the oil is absorbed completely into the marijuana now we're going to add the remaining coconut oil as well as about 1/4 TSP of soy lecithin powder and mix that together again replace the aluminum foil or your lid and place it back into the oven at 250 degrees Fahrenheit for another 30 minute round of heat [Music] after this round you'll see that the oil is beginning to darken and there's a more moisture and a nice aroma when you remove the lid this last step should get us up to the temperature that we need to activate the cannabis and it would provide enough time and heat to complete the infusion of the coconut oil and cannabis together mix it together again replace the lid the school go back into the same temperature oven at 200 degrees Fahrenheit but this time it's going to go for one full hour when we come back we will begin the next phase of the recipe [Music] now that a cannabis is activated and the oil is infused we can move on to the next step which is melting the honey and the oil together set up a global boiler with the bowl big enough to hold the honey and the oil mixture together and combined the entire mixture of cannabis and coconut oil together with the honey now mix this together and then add in another quarter teaspoon of soy lecithin if you're using that and we're gonna let this mixture infuse over the double boiler for 30 minutes now what we're doing in this step is we're heating the honey and the oil to help it mix as the two will not mix normally and they will now remain mixed over time if you don't do another special step that's coming up later now if you're using a Gavi nectar you can skip this step and the other special step that we'll talk about later and simply jump to straining out the coconut oil from the cannabis and then adding it directly into the agave mixture we'll talk more about that later you you now after your honey is infused for 30 minutes you can now very carefully strain the mixture through a fine mesh screen or filter now you're gonna press out as much of the honey and oil through the screen as possible before move on to the next step and now for the final step in making the funny honey we need a high speed blender such as a ninja like you see here and you'll want to do this while the mixture is still pretty warm so if you don't it won't pour very easily so after a couple of minutes of letting it cool off pour the entire mixture into the blender seal it tight and let it mix you're gonna let this mix as long as it's needed for the oil and honey to fully combine it could take a couple of minutes to a few minutes depending on the speed of your blender well we're whipping air into the mixture to keep them from separating as it cools and you would not be able to skip this step if you're using honey once it's whipped you can pour it back into the honey bottle or your choice of container and as a note it's best to add some hot water and dish soap and bless it through the blender right away to get rid of that sticky honey while it's still hot now as I mentioned previously with a Gavi nectar you can skip right from infusing the coconut oil to adding it directly into the copy and shaking it by hand unlike honey agave nectar easily blends with the oil at room temperature and it will settle out after a few minutes or in over a time over a few days you'll settle like you saw at the beginning of this but it's very easily mixed back together and with a few good seconds of vigorous shaking of the bottle it's good to go now the honey after being will will thicken as it cools but will remain completely mixed and ready for use days on end just like regular honey now there's so many uses for this recipe that it's hard to make a list without obvious omissions but some of my favorites are using it to sweeten hot cup of tea such as red bush or rooibos tea it's although it's really good in any kind of tea it's also good as a topping over a bowl of hot cereal for breakfast or ice cream but you could also brush it on your baklava you can baste a hand with it and it - barbecue sauce or pretty much anything that you could use regular honey for you can also make this recipe with butter instead of coconut oil for a delicious

talking to people on a facebook thread yesterday and it made me think about it even more and so I figured I might as well make a video about this and that is the subject of nicotine okay most of us are you know we're vapors we're addicted to nicotine we became addicted to nicotine from cigarettes obviously with cigarettes there's a lot of other crap in there that made them even more addictive and and whatnot but if we just look at nicotine by itself most of us are nicotine addicts okay and some vapors do want to slowly lower their nicotine levels and some of them do want to eventually quit vaping altogether as well they're using it as a tool originally to get themselves off of cigarettes and then you know taper off of the nicotine and you know not use vaping at all and that I totally respect that me I enjoy vaping I've been using the three milligram for a long time and I don't have any desire to quit vaping but I know a lot of people out there do so I think that that's something that we should talk touch on because I think that there's also a lot of misconceptions when it comes to nicotine and how to taper down off of your nicotine now obviously with a nicotine addiction you have that physical addiction you get to nicotine and then there's definitely a mental addiction and part of that is why we enjoy vaping so much to over say something like gum or a patch we are addicted to the action of you know hand to mouth putting something into our mouth puffing on it you know we're addicted to that as well and the mental addiction a lot of times can be just as strong as the physical addiction can and a lot of times even a mental addiction can cause physical withdrawal symptoms so you know I've even heard of people that have lowered their nicotine all the way down to zero and been on zero for a while but once they quit vaping altogether they still have a you know some physical feeling physical withdrawals and I could totally vouch for stuff like that I have dealt with addiction in my past and I know that if I even think about it's too much I can all of a sudden feel physical responses even though my body is not physically addicted to that substance anymore but I wanted to talk about milligram levels in nicotine and I think sometimes we overstate that right we talk about something like the Joule being 50 milligrams and you know that's just why would I start the Joule I'm gonna be using too much nicotine well you got to think of it this way your body let's get sciency here well titrate to the amount of nicotine it's used to okay so if you are someone that say smoked a pack of Marlboro Reds every day for the last whatever ten years obviously maybe you had some days maybe you went out drinking and you used a pack and a half one day but for the most part you are a pack a day smoker well your body is used to that amount of nicotine that pack a day Marlboro red nicotine so whether you go out and buy a 50 milligram Joule or some other Nick salt type pod device or maybe you just buy some kind of clearomizer more conventional clearomizer and you use an 18 milligram normal nicotine the normal freebase nicotine odds are your body is going to use that product enough to get the nicotine that it's already used to so you know if you're using a lower nicotine like that 18 or something you might end up using that even more than your 50 milligrams so it kind of all comes out in the wash if that makes sense so all we're always talking about nicotine levels nicotine levels oh that's too high that's too low honestly you're really gonna reach for your vape as much as what your body is used to using when it comes to the amount of nicotine and and just to the side note let's talk about Nick salts a little bit because there are some misconceptions with it basically Nick salts are you know your body absorbs it a little bit differently it hangs out in the lungs a little bit longer but also it makes it a smoother draw so for example if you were to use a 50 milligram normal freebase nicotine that throat hit would be so harsh and so severe you it would be too much for you for 99.9% of the people out there it would probably be too much for you now what a 50-milligram Nick salt will do is smooth out smooth it out a little bit still give you that throat hit you want that throw hit that is you crave that's close to the cigarettes you were used to but also give you a little bit smoother draw and that's why I think a lot of people really like the Nick salts especially when they're quitting smoking it's because they end up using it about as much as they probably use their cigarettes and each drug is fairly comparable and fairly you know you don't get a lot of vapor it's very close more so close to what a cigarette is like so when you're wanting to finally wean yourself down on nicotine it's not just about lowering your milligram level so let me give you an example here if I am used to always using a six milligram nicotine okay in this tank so I'm always using this tank it's six milligram that's what I'm used to and then I decide I want to lower my nicotine down to three milligrams well odds are you're just gonna vape that more than you did the six okay so it's not just about lowering your level sometimes we trick ourselves and we say well I'm using a lower level nicotine well you might very well so be doing that but you're also most likely using that product more often than you were the higher nicotine and that's where puff counters come into play when they started first started putting those in mods I just thought it's kind of gimmicky it's kind of silly but the more I think about it the more I think it can really be a helpful tool if you or someone that is trying to lower your nicotine intake so if you are someone that wants to lower from a six to a three you still should be keeping track of your puffs on that six and then when you go down to the three try to use the exact same amount of puffs per day because like I said your body will more than likely try to get try to use that even more and so it's getting that same amount of nicotine that it's already used to now I don't want anyone out there just to think that I'm telling you hey you should lower your nicotine like I said I'm fine with where I'm at I enjoy vaping nicotine is a drug I'm obviously addicted to it but in the whole scheme of things nicotine by itself is not the the super dangerous drug it's you know what you die from is the other stuff in cigarettes and whatnot but I do know a lot of people out there that want to lower their neck between nicotine and finally quit but I think a lot of times they're doing it wrong by only worrying about their milligram level that they're using so let's say you're using a salt neck forty five milligram Nixle liquid you can wean yourself down in multiple ways you can stick with that forty five and then just slowly lower your puffs every day so say you're doing two hundred one day you know go down do go down ten a week okay every week but keep on that same amount especially if you enjoy the vape experience off of that amount or you could also lower it down to say a from that forty five down to a twenty five milligram but you want to maintain the same amount of pops that you were using at forty five and not start using more puffs with it okay am I making sense here a lot of you guys are probably gonna be like well duh Matt I already knew that and but then a lot of you guys might think well yeah you're right I didn't really think of it that way either and I didn't for a long time I was just always lowering my nicotine I I went it from 12 and then I went down to six and then I went down to three but never really keeping track of my puffs or how much I'm using it but the more and then I've even went down to one and a half for awhile but I did find that when I went down to one and a half from three I was just baking it more and more than likely I was getting the same amount of nicotine that I was getting from three just with more vapes now obviously there's a lot of different variables here you know a lot of people go from a mouth to lung device that's tighter where they're getting less vapor and then they go to a straight to lung direct to lung device where it's a higher wattage and there's more vapor but they're using a lower milligram nicotine and so that's kind of hard to figure out but odds are your body will still use that newer higher wattage device that has lower nicotine to get out about the same amount of nicotine that was already used to from the mouth to lung device that had higher nicotine okay so all I'm doing here is just kind of giving you guys some food for thought if you're somebody that wants to taper down off of nicotine there's multiple ways to do it but don't think that you just only have to lower your milligram level a lot of people will I think actually have more success staying with the same milligram level they're at but just taking less puffs because you know if they lower their milligram level that puff just isn't as satisfying to them anymore they're not getting as much of a throat hit they're not getting that same feeling so it might just be easier to stay at that higher milligram you're at and just lower your puffs everyday puffs are just as if not more important than your milligram level that you're using and I also think that there's some misconceptions when it comes to higher milligram nicotine a lot of people I've seen so many people say how those Nick salts are bad for vaping because there's such a high milligram yes they may they are a higher milligram right but but those people are more than likely puffing on that thing a lot less then maybe you are with your twelve or six milligrams juice in a conventional addi now obviously there's some other issues with Nick salt products you know teens have tended to gravitate towards them it's not necessarily great that when they when they decide to experiment they're grabbing you know a nicotine product that is fairly high in nicotine because they're you know most likely gonna get hooked on nicotine faster than if they were trying some low or zero nicotine product but you know as far as the smokers go really it's all about what is gonna help you at the end of the day quit so don't be afraid to go out there and grab a really high nicotine product if you're lower nicotine product isn't working for you or if maybe you want to conserve more juice maybe you find that oh it's working I quit and I'm using 12 milligram but I'm going through so much liquid every day you know and don't be afraid to possibly try something with a higher milligram doesn't mean you're gonna be taking in more nicotine your body's gonna regulate itself out most likely and take in the same amount of nicotine you were already getting from that 12 milligram so used to whatever it takes to quit smoking that's the most important thing and then if you do in the future decide that you want to start lowering your nicotine levels you can try it multiple different ways like I said slow down on the puffs or lower the Nick nicotine amount if that's still satisfying for you but also try to stay at the same amount of puffs and you know then you could taper puffs down at that level you know there's a lot of ways to go about this but then there's also people like me that will probably continue using 3 milligram liquid and a device like this for a long long time because I enjoy it so to each ISM I think we're gonna wrap it up there guys hope you all have a wonderful weekend that about wraps it up until next time thanks for watching suck my mud", "QdhE9HV4Z1I": "Dave Palumbo here and I want to just tell you something very special because this past weekend I was at the mr. Olympia contest all weekend long and as you know when you fly from Florida the Vegas it's multiple flights you get jet-lagged you feel rundown you get up early in the morning to get to the airport you don't sleep much the entire weekend we work all weekend long getting you guys all the best coverage up there and then we come back on that same germ-infested plane and I got back to Cape Coral Florida at about 3:30 in the afternoon on Sunday morning because I woke up at 3 in the morning to leave and I was sneezing and I was getting like a scratchy throat and I said to myself I am going to do an experiment I'm gonna take one supplement in one supplement only and what I do is I got out my tight medical refrigerated bottle of glutathione ok and glutathione is a an antioxidant it's only absorbable entry when you take shots of it if you take it orally it doesn't get absorbed that's why a lot of people take and acetylcysteine pills because that's kind of a precursor to it but glutathione is the most powerful antioxidant in the body it's also a great liver cleanser so I started taking my shots of glue of glutathione I took one shot when I arrived home I took another shot before bed 1cc and then I took a shot every day this week by Monday morning ok which was less than 24 hours later I already had no symptoms of of the cold I think I might have had a little bit of sniffle my nose by Tuesday nothing so I never actually experienced any symptoms other than like the beginnings of when you get sick nothing came out I didn't get like drippy nose I wasn't blowing my nose and sneezing like a maniac and this was the only supplement that I used now I'm a very big believer in the fact that glutathione not only is a detoxifier in the body but it's an immune system enhancer and this kind of proved it for me so guys I know you guys love to go to Titan medical for your hormone replacement needs testosterone HCG Arimidex and stuff like that but they're injectable vitamins a tremendous - and this glutathione injection it does need to be kept refrigerated so shift you on dry ice is a spectacular formula I highly advise it especially if you get sick real easy calm up go to Titan Medical Center comm and get the number call them up and you tell them the day palumbo and rx muscles thank you and they will give you a great discount Thank You Titan Medical for my injectable glutathione you saved my life", "B6r-01cxQ4A": "you hi there when I got through 4 examples of tablet those calculations with you and therefore need to have a first look at the tablet dose formula now what you want means what you want to get the patient whereas what you've got means what we got in stock so we could have written this not simply as patient over stock and this is the former I'm going to use for these four examples so let's dive right in ok the first question says a does to request 30 milligrams of a drug and just stopped us publicly 10 milligrams coming published you administer to the patient well there's that formula patient of the stock so I'm just some uses formula to unpack the question I want to give the patient 30 milligrams I'm in stock I've got 10 milligrams now this one's pretty straightforward the first thing about it straightforward is that our unit are the same top and bottom so we can proceed with the working out now you can probably see the answer already but let me go through with you in case in another example it wasn't so straightforward knowing that my units are the same I can look to simplify the function and in this case both values top and bottom end in jail or so I can cancel the zeroes otherwise known as dividing by 10 so the answer equals 3 over 1 in other words my answer is 3 tablets now that was a pretty straightforward question but in an examination on the wall you might want to double check with the calculator so let's do that so to my calculator on I have 30 divided by 10 equals showing up that confirms that our answer is indeed 3 tablets good stuff let's go on to the next one second question we need to give the patient nor point 1 grams of the medication and each tablet is worth 50 milligrams and again we need to find out how many tablets to administer to the patient now this time you'll notice that the units are different between what we're giving to the patient and what we have in stock but again we do start with our formula patient sell the stock but we just don't ask the question faithfully using the values given so the patient number no point one grams and the stock value is 50 milligrams and because those units are different we cannot proceed unless we have made both use the same so we'll need to convert one I'm going to go with the awkward-looking one which is the Northpoint one grams and I'm going to convert that to milligrams so I do need to remind myself how to do this well just showing you the chart that I actually used to think of when converting units of weight and we considered to go from grams to milligrams we are multiplying by a thousand or in other words we are moving the decimal point three places to the right there's my naught point one and I've said I'm going to move like decimal places three places to the right one two three I think you can see there is room like two extra zeros and hopefully you can see that that's come out to be one hundred milligrams so I can now rewrite that question as one hundred milligrams over fifty milligrams my helix are the same so I can now just simplify that fraction line down well again we can publicly what the answer is going to be but let me just work through it anyway both values again happen to end in zero so again I can divide top and bottom by 10 which is what we mean by cancelling out the zeros and also 5 goes into top and bottom so becomes 2 over 1 in other words our answer is just 2 tablets again that's going to be kicking this without calculator now because we have to do a conversion let's mimic that part first we said it to go from grams to milligrams with the times by a thousand to not point one times a thousand equals showing up equals 400 and then we did a hundred divided by 50 and unsurprisingly we do get agreement down to us obviously to tablet excellent let's do another one just to request Northpoint exclams of medication our tablets now come each worth 150 milligrams and again we need to find out how we tell us to give to the patient as before we unpack the question using the set formula patient of the stock so we want to give non point six lamps in stock we have 150 milligrams again we did not have agreement with our you missed up on bottom so again I'm going to give some thoughts to convert it now here I'm thinking I'm going to convert the top number because that's the awkward decimal and will convert null point six grams to milligrams so we have null point six grams to milligrams mother again going downstairs so again I'm going with that decimal point three places to the right one two three which is the same as multiplying by a thousand again I jumped outside the number there's two empty loops so I'll put those in now is two extra zeros and I hope you can see that what we've got there is rewriting a question of 600 milligrams over 150 milligrams how are you nice Alassane so we can now to simplify this once perhaps not so obvious 600 over 150 well both values to ending zero so I'll just cancel those out as divided by ten and then I know this as 5 goes into both or 5 goes into 60 12 times and 5 goes into 15 3 times and finally we can see it's illegal into both top and bottom three to 12 is 4 3 to 3 is 1 so our final answer is 4 tablets in the two cases we've done so far were the units are not the same we've had to ensure we do the conversion first before we tackle the simplification let's check all this with a calculator clear the memory the first thing we did when we untouched the question with the formula was to notice that our units will not return so I'm going to convert null point exams not point six down two milligrams by tangent by a thousand and sure enough I get 600 and then now the units were the same I simply divided by 150 to give the answer for with a calculator this whole process is a lot quicker and we don't have to do anything like the same amount of working out but our final answer for tablets comes out nicely okay on to the last question the doctor requests one point two grams of medication your stop dose tablet is 200 milligrams how many tablets do you give to the patient so there's my former become familiar now unpack the question using the formula I want to get the patient 1.2 grams in stock I have 200 milligrams once again we see that our units are not the same so as before we have to think about converted I'm going to choose to convert the 1.2 grams to milligrams and therefore thinking about my conversion again I happened to be going downstairs tangent by a thousand move that decimal three places to the right therefore this room for two zeros we can now see that formula has become 1200 milligrams over two hundred milligrams are eunuchs now dill agree so now what I can do simplify that down 1200 over 200 both numbers ending zero so I can divide by 10 once divided by 10 twice that leaves 12 over 2 and then I can have top and bottom to get 6 over 1 and you should be able to see that I our final answer six tablets you know you've made a mistake if you end up with a final answer that isn't a whole number because we almost certainly expect all tablet questions out hold number answers okay finally checking one more time with the calculator clear the memory I did one point two times a thousand to do that first conversion to make sure my users are the same that cannot be 1200 and then I divided by 200 showing off 86 now you might have had the thought does it matter which value we convert you keep converting those values with a decimal I could instead of converted this value here milligrams to grams which would have been three places in the other direction so what I would have had is it's my 200 milligrams with my decimal point where I need to decide where the decimal point is to begin with aries on the end one two three and I hope you can see that comes out to be not point 200 or just more simply not point two so I would have been written it has one point two grams over not point two grams with a calculator so easy to do clearly remember it one point two divided by not point two is equal to six without a calculator it was a bit tricky to do we can do it we requires something a little subtle you can't simplify that too readily because they're not got whole numbers top and bottom would have to multiply top and bottom by 10 I suspect this is step too far for sewers but just to complete that thought that comes up with 12 over 2 so it finally comes down to 6 over 1 I then you can see the rationale behind me deciding to convert that value which I found most Awkward that value which had a decimal but either way is a straightforward procedure a tablet does to use the patient or the stock what you want over what you've got with a calculator - lot quicker whichever way you do it you must always ensure before you fully carry out the formula that the units are the same top and bottom thanks for watching [Music]", "TMp-3RLW2FY": "you hi everyone I'm Liz with passport to organics where we discover beauty from around the world and this week we're going to be talking about hyaluronic acid serum and five warnings to look out for when you purchase a bottle of it and I'm really excited about today's video and I'm going to do a demonstration because there are just so many false claims out there about Heather onic acid so if you don't know what it is really quick we're all born with it it's not really a crumpled acid it's a natural occurring substance in our skin and our joint and what's great about it is it keeps us from aging because it keeps us our skin youthful and plump so hyaluronic acid is great to add to your beauty routine because it helps Mother Nature along and keeps your skin youthful so let's get started warning number one purchase a hyaluronic acid serum that's vegan palindromic acid is sourced two ways one from yeast and one from a Rooster's comb i'm not kidding after the rooster is slaughtered they take off the comb they freeze it unfreeze it and I extract hyaluronic acid and they used to breathe roosters and their head would get so big they couldn't keep it up because they call me want to really big combs for a lot of hyaluronic acid so if you're not into using animal by-products and your purchases then opt for these warning number two there is no such thing as a completely 100% pure hyaluronic acid serum with a hundred percent hyaluronic acid content if that were the case your bottle will come like this and this is what the content would look like it would be pure powder so a lot of companies claim that they're 100 percent pure but they don't mean they're 100 percent pure onic acid because this is again what it would look like there's also no such thing as 50 percent higher on acid content twenty five and ten percent higher on the most safe and effective is one percent hyaluronic acid in your serum i will do a demonstration I'll show you here's our demonstration of a 50 percent hyaluronic acid serum one ounce so this is 50 percent of one ounce container of pure hyaluronic acid we're just going to show why this is not possible and of course a hundred percent is not possible because it's pure powder like we said but 50 percent is still not possible because I'll show you in a second 50 percent of other onic acid point five ounces now we're going to do 25 ounce O'Connor and the speakers one ounce hot erotic acid serum now look how goopy it is it actually starts tunning really really hard almost like concrete this is what 50 percent hyaluronic acid content look on twenty-five percent same thing 10 percent in film so the safest and most effective is around 1 percent because if you start adding too much hyaluronic of course it will do the opposite of what you want but also it's just a misleading claim there's no such thing as a hundred percent content for hyaluronic acid serum I hope you guys enjoyed that experiment because it was an expensive demonstration because hyaluronic acid is an expensive ingredient and we clearly state on our bottles that it's 100% pure colorada acid with a 1% solution so look out for those misleading claim moving on warning number 3 look for a hyaluronic acid serum with a low molecular weight you want a low molecular weight because that will penetrate your skin a high molecular weight will just stay on the outside of your skin and really need to be small to effectively get into the deeper layers and do what it's supposed to do I've moisture to your skin so look out for that when you make a purchase warning number four look for hyaluronic acid serum that does more good than harm to your skin you want to avoid serums with parabens with extra added ingredients with artificial fragrances or coloring all you need is a simple hyaluronic acid solution with hyaluronic acid at the top of the ingredient list and remember Heather onic acid is an expensive ingredient so you don't want to go over the cheapest one because if I just get what you pay for and also you want to make sure that you do purchase a hyaluronic acid that the company has done stability testing and bacterial testing because it can't grow a mold so easily so don't want to do by yourself you want to get a reputable company that produces a hyaluronic acid in the lab and finally warning number five read the instructions on your hyaluronic acid bottle make sure you know how to apply it this is really important a lot of people misuse hyaluronic acid so you only apply a few drops and you always have to make sure it's applied to damp or wet skin you can also mix it with your favorite moisturizer and that will lock in the moisture so if you do the opposite it'll have the opposite effect that will lock the moisture out and stead up in so if you feel your skin is dry or really tight then use it the wrong way scale back in the mouth that you're using and also make sure your skin is fully moisturized and damp before you apply it all right we're all done thanks so much for watching I really hope you enjoyed the video I love presenting about hyaluronic acid we love it here at Passport organics we use a lot of our products and check our description on YouTube because we'll be giving different coupon codes and you never know what kind of discount you're going to get so stay tuned next week and we'll have another great video for you about beauty secrets from around the world thanks so much you", "OS6w_P1rOJU": "hi my name is dr. Todd Rowe and I'm here to talk about the homeopathic medicine silica before I start I just wanted to say that nothing in this material is meant to diagnose cure prescribe for or treat any illness please consult your homeopathic practitioner for treatment options silica or quartz comes in many forms also Flint it's an element on the periodic table and the remedy is derived from silicon dioxide it's a nonmetal and forms 25% of the Earth's crust in addition to quartz it's found in sand and sandstone feldspar kaolinite mica olivine zeolite asbestos granite and on and on and on it constitutes about one third of all minerals in the earth also you can find high amounts of silica and natural waters and also well known for petrified wood where the woody tissue is replaced by silicon dioxide it's an element that is very similar to carbon but less reactive it's used in plants to increase the strength of the plant and it's used in homeopathy for similar purposes also silica is used in communication it's also used in syringes for diabetics antiperspirant on and on and on so it's a substance that's used a lot by mankind there are many uses for this homeopathic medicine chronically or constitutionally we're going to be focusing today on just some of the acute care uses and these include stage fright ear infections vaccinations abscesses dental problems constipation and abscesses silica is one of our main remedies for stage fright along with the homeopathic medicine gelsemium silica can help to reduce the anxiety associated with performing and to make people much more comfortable silica is also a remedy that is very useful for vaccinations and you can use it for someone who has a bad reaction to a vaccine are going to often times ameliorate the problems and symptoms people who need the homeopathic medicine silica are often very chilly and worse from the cold they also are fatigued and don't feel strong and often will collapse they're sensitive to cold air in particular drafts and they tend to perspire a great deal especially on the hands and feet and they're worse from suppressing the sweat there is a strong tendency towards abscess formation anywhere in the body whether it be in the mouth or in the skin abscesses seem to come easily it's also a wonderful remedy for failure to thrive and infants where they just don't seem to gain weight very easily there's a tendency with silica infections to have enlarged or swollen glands particularly in the neck also there is the tendency for poor teeth formation loss of hair and slowed metabolism silica is a slow-acting remedy even acutely it takes a while for the remedy to work and also it's around me that is worse from exposure to dairy products or milk which tends to bring on many of their problems some of the physical characteristics of silica include sinus headaches it's one of our importance sinus remedies particularly when they're strong headaches that are associated it's also our main remedy for blocked tear ducts of the newborn as I mentioned is very useful variety of dental problems particularly dental abscesses and recurring dental infections the teeth tend to come in slowly and children and not easily and so definitely administering this remedy can help to strengthen the teeth area it's also a useful Roundy to consider for recurring sore throats and even for acute sore throats particularly when there's a lot of swollen glands that are associated it also can be used for both acute and chronic ear infections particularly with a lot of discharge some of the physical characteristics of silica include a chronic constipation similar to the remedy sepia or Knoxville McComb there constipation though is often referred to as having a bashful stool or receding stool and that is it comes out a little bit and then it goes back in silica is around me that is worse from dairy products whereas from milk it oftentimes can cause vomiting and children it's also one of our main remedies for mastitis or breast infections and even breast abscesses it's one of our main remedies for and bunions and ingrown toenails and also their nails in general are weak and tend to crack or disfigure crumble easily and as I mentioned all kinds of abscesses can be treated with silicone you can compare this homeopathic medicine to pulsatilla diagrams or the Windflower calc area carbonic are calcium carbonate fuya occidentalis or arborvitae Sonique yellow which is a water made from the siccolas spring in Ottawa Illinois or heap are sulphuric sore calcium sulfide you can order this remedy at hoarders at AMC of H org or if you'd like to know more about this medicine or other acute care medicines you can learn about our acute care program at acute care at MC of H dot org

corn syrup and high and potassium sodium tartrate into not wine but weed welcome to wheats guys uh we are here with jesus and all my other homies today to talk moana that's right we're back with wanna uh surely i'm not gonna take the time to link below uh the video where i screwed up reviewing them before so we are here to review them in earnest today they're watermelon hybrid gummies uh this is a vegan gummy from wanna coming in at 20 bucks from my dispensary so this puts this at the uh highest end of the gummy um edibles at my dispensary so a bit of a premium for the wanna gummies um but nothing else too fancy here pretty basic packaging from wanna with their hybrid watermelon gummies we're gonna do it nice and short and quick here so that we don't upset the j-man we're going to pinch here as it says open it up and there are our wanna weed watermelon gummies manufactured by high life farms we've got our wonderful lab testing results and all of our stuff my cameraman is currently being uh pulled away by the dogs at this moment but that's okay here we go here is our watermelon gummy looking really nice and square how wonderful watermelon sugar weed aftertaste not bad pretty good well i am now my own cameraman again um and these wanna weed gummies well if you've had a weed gummy before you know what to expect um a lot of sugar to mask the taste and a pretty hefty cannabis aftertaste but i have certainly had worse uh and haven't had too many that are quite a bit better in terms of taste but it's not about how it tastes about how it makes you feel and for that guys i'm gonna come back to you in about two hours after i finish another whole hell a lot of a hell of a lot of these gummies and once i do i'll come back and i will let you know if these wanna weed gummies are as good as we all wanted them to be ugh anyways say hi stay healthy we'll see you back here in just a bit goodbye welcome back to wheat skies i'm back from paradise on earth or what was it called jesus's cameraman do you remember desert christ park welcome back to wheats guys i'm back from desert christ park or something like that the place with all the jesuses uh where we first tried the wanna cannabis infused watermelon hybrid gummies and these are pretty good gummies uh i'm not a hundred percent sure they're worth the 20 premium uh they are uh sort of better quality than the cheapest gummies for sure uh but whether they're the uh sort of eight dollar premium i'm not a hundred percent but they are definitely good quality and if you are concerned about um healthiness in your gummies excuse me guys there's a dog who's really just insistent go get them get out of my face um so if you're really concerned about your uh health and all that these are vegan uh and they are all natural flavors and colors nothing artificial here so uh they also claim to be artisan quality whatever that means anyways uh good quality stuff still pretty high from these uh it's been about three hours since i had my last one and still i am quite high so that is a pretty good endorsement right there and then anytime we have a product we like this much i'll take that camera person she's driving us all crazy go get just get out of our face just just just kid it's it's going to make it worse anytime we have a product we like this much i like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that's not weed related so i'm out here in the middle of nowhere in the middle of uh god's country and anytime i'm out in the desert i think you know area 51 ufos sci-fi and we've been doing board games recently so i'm going to give you one of my favorite board games of all time one very cosmic and theme and that's cosmic encounters plays like five six seven eight players uh it is too hard too difficult to explain right here but i can tell you it's going to be one of the best times if you have friends who are into board games if you've never heard of cosmic encounters and you have a group that is willing to um do something different give cosmic encounters a try don't even remember who designed it right now that's because of wanna gummies and these wanna i was gonna make another one a pun but i'm too high so just you know uh know that that is an endorsement and that's going to be endorsement as well for cosmic encounters on your local board game store or online in some way i guess we're still in the middle of a pandemic board games are a weird thing to endorse but um they're an optimistic one and i'm rambling thanks guys it's been a it's been a blast here i'm sorry about the dog i'm sorry about all the jesus stuff you know uh we're just uh we're out here on vacation having a good time here on weeds stay high stay healthy we'll see you soon", "lS__pzIoCDc": "hi guys welcome to my her board review today I would like to talk to you about kana she led him toward awesome this is the scientific name kana is a shrub from south africa and is sedating effect and anxiety relaxing but also mood lifting effect so is a little antidepressant and a higher doses can be euphoric so it's not some properties that are really similar to cannabis but obviously a lot milder and for this reason it can often be smoked as well so I'm going to show you here a few options that I've found and this is amazing because kana is quite rare to find in Europe due to the fact that it's a South African plant and only a few certified suppliers of colleague and my supplier I've got all these versions which are hasari which are really amazing I'm really excited so this is a just cannot dry help it come in in this packet can be a 5 gram park' thing rampant in five different sizes so it's just a dry herb and you can use the both as a team or smoked and when it's marked it have to be honest by itself it doesn't really have a great place and taste to me and I'll show you here is the actual dry herb so as you can see is a squire very dry herbs of it's not it doesn't have a particular flavor sense so a lot of people and prefer a smoke together with other helps and mix with a damiana or cannabis to enhance the effect of cannabis kind of common as well otherwise you can use it as a infusion tea as well and still get the sedating anti-anxiety and mood listing properties and my provider you can find the Sultana in tea bags so it's already ready for use boil some water for your carnal tea bag or even cannot call a speaker a strainer to use after in a cup ouple come in they're covering up with steaming for about 15-20 minutes to get the full effect out of it and then at the bit of sebum on if you want or some sweetener and you can drink and it's gonna be really relaxing and what we think oh this is a totally new entry in the can product and its really unique you kind of finding everywhere and this is a cannery liquid so for the vape lovers this is a easy and quick way to get all the benefits of kana in your vape pen nice you can carry everywhere and using any time you want to have a little bit of a sedating effect and more lifting effect so this can be a liquid my supply is available in different sizes and format and if you want more information if you need to ask me any questions if I haven't answered all your questions are curiosity about kana please get in contact my condom my whatsapp number is in the description of this video I love having a chat and if you need anything if you want to know about more about kana in ear and contact or information please get in touch thank you for watching bye bye", "LGxMyTPPCDY": "[Music] hi guys welcome to week two the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today's review we are taking a look at our second drink from the company that I just found out their actual name up I called them dozers in the past because there's the only labeling I saw was this little dozer guy right here I have no idea why it says dozers because the name of the drink is actually G drink by G pharma labs the same people who make the candy bars liquid gold the liquid gold candy bars same people make these make the drinks I didn't particularly like my dreams during class time but I've heard enough good things that I figured maybe I'd give you a second shot so this is a hundred milligram edible excuse me drinkable two servings hundred and ten calories per serving so 240 calories in this bottle it cost $12 as you can see there but I got it nine bucks so about what you would expect for a drink edible they're usually a little bit more expensive and edible but let's open it up here give it a taste and then I will come back to you guys after I drink it two hours is not good there's a very strong marijuana that astringent sort of acidic burning right at the top [Music] so I don't think it's as good as the Cannabis winter or be partly rape or excuse me the habit sparkling sodas but I'm gonna finish it and I will let you guys know how we're feeling in two hours because that's the most important part of the animal review so let's hope this it's us a little bit better than the G drink from last time and I'll see you guys in just a couple of seconds but for me it'll be two hours guys it has been two hours since I had the G drink pink lemonade hundred milligrams of THC and I apologize for the sort of construction going on behind me here doing a little bit of remodeling so I've got the closet covered down so I'm sorry that you guys can't see our fancy star system that's will be back there and I apologize that you're seeing all the mess that's back there as well but you know wall do one thing that I'm not happy to deal with is how unhide I am yeah this G drink is a total total bust just like the other G drink I had before I really don't feel anything at all and it tasted terrible so this is a this is a total bust for me again I can't say I feel high in the slightest and again and it was just the most awful taste going down the worst drink I think I've tasted so far and so yeah even though and it's it's not super cheap at $12 for the for the drink I think I'm gonna I would have to give a hard pass to the G drinks I do have one of their higher potency drinks to review think it's 210 milligrams so we'll see we'll give them another chance on that one to see if maybe they can turn things around but for right now I would tell you guys to avoid the G drinks if you're looking for a drink go with the cannabis quenchers like there's a lot and we'll definitely get you high these here so far the two I've reviewed major duds from me well guys that is going to do it for this review here on weeds thank you so much for watching I appreciate you guys watching it as always and we will see you on our next review peace", "vfggQpNaTjE": "GOT GOT TO GOT

officials reported they took in about 2 million dollars in recreational pot taxes in January just the first month of sales some say it's a billion-dollar industry so you can bet people right across the u.s. are turning on and tuning in as radio Canada's Joyce Napier discovered there are already surprising spin-offs from the Colorado experiment welcome to Colorado home illegal marijuana yeah saturday morning in Denver 11 a.m. and already it's party time these bus passengers are visitors from all over the United States here for a perfectly legal Rocky Mountain High I have the absolute best job in the world hands down Matt Brown a true cannabis maven is the tour guide today since marijuana was legalized here on New Year's Day his agency has done nothing but hot tourism business is smoking so you having a good time oh I'm having a great time absolutely marito and kim are from El Paso Texas this is a unique American moment and they came to savor we're gonna go to a grocer and got some plans got to see how they grow up look at different kinds of weeds and last night we got to experience that see massage oil it was wonderful just a few months ago a casual chic gathering like this one would have been underground now though this crowd at the space gallery is emerging into the legal sunshine along with the rest of colorado's cannabis industry with here I mean if they do it smart could make money out of it you know get the cartels out of the way go ahead and bring in tax government and then they'll invest within themselves yesterday's pushers and dealers are today's entrepreneurs sellers growers tourists promoters all of them happily celebrating the end of a prohibition just as another generation did 80 years ago then retreat spot like cigarettes you can't smoke either one in a public place so a rented bus provides a private smoking salon for this evenings party goes there's really nothing else that can equate to what we've done with cannabis by bringing it from the black market into a legitimate industry Tony Fox is a cannabis veteran for years she grew and sold medical marijuana now she's catering to a vastly larger clientele it's a billion-dollar industry in its infancy so it is going to be the next big business and it's definitely the next it's it's a green rush this is called the Colorado experiment and the whole country is watching there are billions of dollars at stake in massive new taxes for governments and if it works here as many as eight states may hold votes to legalize marijuana in the next two years love's oven has joined the Green Rush it too was a medical marijuana dispensary until January now business is not just up it's exploded by a thousand percent hope was loves ovens master creator is working flat out but she still can't keep up with demand for cannabis lay streets and we also do just chocolate dipped graham crackers cookies a spicy ginger cookies most of her baked goods are created with something called cannabutter that's right cannabis butter green and oily and reeking of a smell that once attracted law enforcement our best selling cookie is that right mm-hmm you know when people take up I and they're like oh this tastes just like you know my grandma's cookie and I realize it's not quite their grandma's cookie but it'll make you happy for a long time afterwards in an era when public smoking of any kind is not just against the law but out of fashion the so-called pot edibles are the hot commodity everybody wants them North America's first legal marijuana tourism company this is our cooking class at one of the stops on our weekend tour here in Denver Colorado so you just reduce the balsamic cannabis cooks turn out a mixed bag of treats cakes cookies juju's their candies and sodas manna for retailers and clients alike I sell out every day I'm open and I'm doing at least 20 times my volume on a daily basis so average daily sales are 25,000 currently by summer there'll be 50,000 by fall we're hoping to do a hundred thousand dollars per day as going it may now be legal but this new industry is far more regulated than alcohol you must be 21 to buy any sort of cannabis every gram is legally accounted for Colorado residents can only purchase one ounce at a time visitors can't buy more than a quarter ounce all products are imprinted with barcodes and electronically trace it's one of the biggest stories we'll deal with in 2014 certainly and of course like any big issue it's become a specialty beat for reporters we've talked about wine criticism and music criticism for decades and now we're talking about legitimate professional cannabis criticism the biggest daily in Colorado the Denver Post now has a website dedicated entirely to cannabis with its own editor in chief Mack and his colleagues are clearly a new breed of journalists in a new world it's kind of ubiquitous it's everywhere it's the smell of a bar or it's the smell of the park at lunchtime that smell is kind of ever-present in a weird way because legalization has changed everything it really is like a gold rush here denver now has more cannabis shops than starbucks outlets and it's just the beginning so what did you guys buy oh we ended up getting a dream they just spent three hundred dollars on various products dark chocolate spicy orange candy bar nice birdie a quarter of that money will find its way into government Treasuries Colorado is eyeing all that new state income as much as 150 million dollars just this year but there are ampang durables how for example to test for driving under the influence of marijuana what level if any is tolerable but all of this planned because federal law still prohibits pot it's very challenging as an industry that financial institutions won't take our money Washington has said it will not prosecute in states where pot is legal I picked up some of the specs but banks are nevertheless nervous and don't like accepting drug profits even perfectly legal ones so in a twist that makes no one happy a lot of dispensaries here store massive amounts of cash in safes just like they did in the illegal old days and lots of cash always invites trouble mostly though this experiment is proceeding well there's been no reported increase in criminal activity or in traffic accidents Mary 1 ization if you want to call it that is happening discreetly in private and well happily very much done yes absolutely there is no doubt about that Joyce Napier's CBC News Denver Colorado as Joyce mentioned police in Colorado are in a quandary about how to test drivers for marijuana impairment there's no device like a breathalyzer to measure pot impairment and a person can have a positive blood test for marijuana days after smoking right now there are no clear statistics in Colorado to measure whether driving while Stone has risen since pot was legalized in January in the past those suspected of driving while high were treated as duis with no differentiation between alcohol and pot but clearly authorities are concerned Colorado's Transportation Department launched an ad campaign today called drive high get a DUI", "pSngWRXhWHQ": "a patient for CVG is prescribed gaviscon what's in gaviscon guys so William le yeah what is sodium alginate it floats to the top of stone what else has it got in it Nick nice yeah it's got salts which bind to acids which neutralize it in the stomach and what formulation is better tablet form gaviscon or liquid form Nick voice app cuz it was because it's easy you be solubilized I know it's easier because it only works in a solid soluble eyes form if you're taking tablets you're just chewing it up and making liquid gaviscon in your mouth you'll still get lumps in it so it's better to have the liquid so ten milk UDS what's oh dear what's OD what Shalini what's lady be chatty that's UD what's what's five times a day I don't know I don't have only ever seen it written but obviously but you do take one medicine five times a day one very popular one Wow yeah very good a six of the Shing alkyl Brie yeah what do you think five times a day is from your in-depth knowledge of Latin anyone pencil baby isn't it he sits probably peed pds I reckon yeah even Wikipedia doesn't know normal Wikipedia all right let's leave that alone who cares doesn't matter never see it so where did we get to the prescriber asked the pharmacist how many animals of sodium ions the patient is taking from this in 24 hours which of the following is correct this is quite an easy question Claire do you know the reference of this how do you mean how do you know how many millimoles of sodium ions in something oh and nectar wait we know where when you see this question what's a what's the first thing that goes through your mind what's taken in 24 hours yeah so 50 Sen mils QD s is 40 oh and 20 mils so it's 40 mils plots at 60 mils 60 mils a day so once you know that then what what you need to do how many and millionaires in that mature how did you get that so you'll have to go to BNF and check how much what's the concentration of sodium phase contains 3.1 million hundreds on or sodium it works you know 3.1 millimoles per per what melon their final so yeah five now three point one three point one yet okay so what's that times we've got a times it by 12 yeah yeah yeah to make it six about it's about 36 isn't it yeah it's someone that is if let me just six to them 2.1 do yeah it's 36 minimums yeah that's super easy okay next one adult patient has been prescribed Ben nor relate wherever that is suspension five mill three times a day for rheumatic pain if needed how many paracetamol tablets BP may be taken in addition each day without exceeding the normal daily recommended dose of paracetamol so from that you can kind of gather because there's quite a few combination and preparations of paracetamol and something else it could be I don't know paracetamol and codeine maybe paracetamol and aspirin how much paracetamol can you take in a day normally hate do you find green ya know four grams leather nipple ring I can't find out in the movie I think it might have been removed this looks like an old question but been oral 8 has two grams in five mil paracetamol two grams in five mil and they're taking 15 mil three doses which is equivalent to about six tablets so out of that you can probably take two so the answers Deeley okay let's do this one let's do this one number six okay okay the retired the required dose of Amina file in by in IV infusion is one make per kick per hour for children aged between six months and nine years six months and nine is okay calculate the rate at which the infusion should be set for a three-year-old child of average wait I mean a file in injection is available on ward so for a three year old child await is 14 kilos okay 6:14 mates but other do you guys want to work it out and just give me an answer at the end of it okay guys remember you've only got two minutes to do these questions and this one's quite straightforward so wouldn't yes I was trying to see what the options were so I have it that they would have 1.79 and mills so they're 20 it's 25 25 musics in a mill in a male okay so 14 exclusive patient is going to need 14 makes if it's a 1 make per kilo and the patients 14 kilos yeah so they will need eat one make try donate 14 mix per hour so they're going to need the 1.7 nine mils of that oh I think I see what you're doing no but you're after a rate you know after I've drawn you are you given I know you don't use another um the needle weatherizing like that on that one it's very straightforward this one so that if the child is let's say 14 kilograms yeah and it's one MIG per kid per hour all you do is do 14 kilograms divided by 25 mix per mil that's excess not point 6 or not en ran about naught point 6 so the answer is going to be C 6 ml see you calculate the rate at which the infusion should be set for a three-year-old child so you figured out the weight which is in the back of B in there then you've just multiplied it by one so then you just divide by by the rates of fifteen or fourteen over twenty five is run about 0.6 mm let's go back to this one yes if you multiply by can tells me it what for me I find these really do you find these quite easy these ones yeah these ones are all right um Cindy I told them I don't seem that difficult I think these are all concentration questions yeah trained at the right concentration a halflife patients admitted to hospital following an overdose of something the drugs half-life is 8.5 hours a toxic plasma concentration of 52 micrograms per mil is measured how long in hours will it take for the plasma concentration to fall to three point two five microgram per mil he's gonna you know form like to put the stuff in for half-life do you know yeah but you don't you don't get that in the exam Oh Joseph's life is eight on the final I know it feels like a nice you lived at my knees there isn't I tend to UM draw it oh so where is it so it would just be like you're starting at 50 - yeah and so that's at t 0 0 26 26 at t1 I can I think 13 13 at t2 six point five six point five at t3 three point two five two five at Ft four or set in half it is one point six two five at t5 so how long so we've got to get to this mm-hmm so this is that so T 4 equals four times eight point five which equals 34 yeah yes sir there's probably an easier way but um when this is easy enough yeah and it was kind of flung its own kind of foolproof isn't it how do we will Donald well I I wouldn't know how to work this out like well you can work it out exactly but you can rule two and things out as you said you don't you need two tablets yeah yeah so this options wrong yeah um so you know that that's definitely wrong you need to have a minimum of 200 milligrams times 10 so you need to have a minimum of 2 grams yeah so you know that this one's wrong yeah okay so you know this one's wrong and you know this one's wrong yep it also can't be this one because this is going to be 60 grams which is above that within the excipient so if you think about the proportions it's not possible so the only two options that you can have is either this one or this one the way that you would work it out is two tablets is going to be 60 milligrams in in 2,000 milligrams no in 2400 milligrams so you work out proportion to 60 milligram in 3000 milligram so what are these as percentages well 60 60 divided by 2 400 is not point not to 5 this one is 60 divided by 3000 is not point not to I'll try not to and the percentage needs to be the same as the percentage of this so 50 divided by 2,000 equals nor point to 5 so this is the right answer mmm do you understand that though Merlin oh yeah yeah so as we said so it can't be this one because this is think of the proportions so you're trying to get this proportion so this would be 60 milligrams in that mm-hmm okay and this would be 2 times 10 so 60 60 in 2000 this one be 60 and to 400 this one would be 60 and 3,000 this one would be 30 in 2400 so it's all about the proportions so it definitely can't be this one so it's 30 divided by 2 is not fine one two five six see see the main thing is getting to this proportion so 50 in two thousand is no point not to five yeah okay what was cool yeah so looking at the proportions that's probably the best way to do deal with that which one of the following is usual dose of Subutai recommended for one child is aged way yeah so that's a direct BNF reference question that's pretty easy that's well for them too strong should be added fun yeah you want to do that one yeah under gravity is that what you start on oh um I know that nine point nine so the concentration of the infusion is not point nine percent yeah so that means not point nine grams and 100 now yes and then in 500ml we have four point five rounds yeah does it multiply yeah now your x fine then it's the millimoles you know when the mini moles come in have to convert it yeah so less over ella and mom but you do need to know them and more of potassium chloride then you do which isn't written this yeah I'll get it pretty soon d then the thing and exam you'll have to walk it out no no no no no yes I'll give it to you oh yeah ok it is 75 75 oh yeah so 0.5 grams so 4.5 divided by 7 so 500 ml mm you just times it by 2 so then it would be more playing not six millimoles per good things it is it yeah yeah well good that was a bit tricky that one yeah that is quite tricky the answer is um melon this one mm-hmm this should take you 20 seconds you're little bit nicer so you have to look it up yeah don't bother as long as you know where it is okay it's in the front isn't anything in anything yeah yeah okay this one should take you about a minute tablet contains the following ingredient chlorophyll amine formula ground how much lactose the coordinates 10 towels and tablets okay so how much of flat so you just have to pour milligram plus 20 so that is 24 mate brown so 14 minus 24 yeah six and then more 16 milligrams of lactose in one tablet uh-huh so make it into 10,000 so you just times it thousand milligrams isn't it Roger so yeah so it should be one C only thing yeah so that would be a crumb 160 grams I'm getting so that's not playing one six kilograms yeah d very good that was good that took me about 40 seconds a Makris or suspension mitad if the pediatric dose regimen is two point five milligrams ten three times the patient's weight within if Spencer goes wrong that's easy yeah there bother with that one this one you know straight up dime orphan easy syringe driver let's do this one a syringe driver is set to 20 what's a syringe driver is it when I don't gradually oh you know it hazard rate said and it will deliver that much amount of the drug in that time so when one the one thing I remember about syringe drivers is a friend of mine broke his leg playing football ended up in hospitals and um they gave him morphine in a syringe driver and they gave him a button to self administer and he just sat there pressing the button the whole day and he had like a really good life but basically it's like yeah it's a syringe with a little motor in it and it just pushes pushes it in so this syringe is actually it's got 20 mils of one milligram sorry one gram in fourth hour 400,000 mil solution over three hours how many milligrams will the patient receive overall mm-hmm it's easy all three hours how many milligrams so we just have to cross multitude yes cross multiply so all you're doing is one gram in four one gram is 1,000 milligrams yeah 1,000 times 20 divided by 400 times exactly so yeah you can do that the only way in the exam though what they can do so rate what's the answer to this anyway the wonder what about train which is not five oh gram-gram zero okay so tell me how much is delivered in an hour and a half how would you delivered in hole around a half it'll be half of that point good so you're just doing kind of proportions yes good okay um next one it respects to betamethasone following professions how many bit nerve ard do you require to have same amount of bit in a methadone in one pack of 30 gram in English person vita misses on candy you know our D stands for I do not reduce those oh so ankle so what does it reduce those means is it like gum and Mar no it just means a little there's a smaller concentration okay of BC metals oh no you know though and the questionable oh so that is not point mom why isn't it more point if I'm a little dumb so 16 D this is the answer I got for it oh no you got ya know it's D you got one misery it was just that mg yeah that's fine just thinking and the time CD yeah yeah sees it this before that betamethasone you'd have to look it up in the BNA yeah it's good to know though that um I know this off by heart I don't know why Rd is usually four times less so the answer C you need four times as much okay so Faris conversion you know you know where that is mm-hmm ten-year-old stung by a bee anaphylaxis ambulance what dose so what dose would you give a ten-year-old child you'll have to look it up and ambien area it's good to know this you'll probably learn this actually am such a 12 and above units 500 Mike's friends if you're between 6 and 12 is all it is 300 Mike friends if you're below 6 it is 150 micrograms yeah okay I've got a question for you what's the answer II know you said that between 6 and 12 it is 300 micrograms a child is 7 years of age yeah yeah so according to this line hmm you need to give how much is yeah 300 micrograms how how what volume is 300 micrograms of this it's not going to be America but you have a prefilled syringe which is 1 mil so 1 minus not point 3 ml good okay more point 7 or more so it's actually reading the question because you're asking much waster hmm triplets you put that in and you just add it in it's a good question hogan 1608 drops it's like a that's like a swimming pool I should know right where did I get that oh come on this this is this is pretty straightforward okay what is it drop rate per minute what is it drop rate per minute oh that's why so what I worked out is per hour okay so - I press one button yeah do it about 16 to get dancer 2 times 3 2 times 18 a 2/3 have writen 2.6 something for me to it 8 be 26 so it's 26 drops yeah 26 drops so with them in which which which answer only six point six twenty seven drops should be because you need a bit more so these this is what

anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, migraine and bipolar disorder,\nas well as other psychiatric conditions requiring the administration of a mood stabiliser. Sodium valproate can be used to control acute\nepisodes of mania and acute stress reaction. Side effects can include tiredness, tremors,\nnausea, vomiting and sedation. The intravenous formulations are used when\noral administration is not possible. In pregnancy, valproate has the highest risk\nof birth defects of any of the commonly used antiepilepsy drugs. However, some epilepsy can only be controlled\nby valproate, and seizures also pose grave risk to mother and child. Some of the common adverse effects include\ntiredness, tremor, sedation and gastrointestinal disturbances. In addition, about 10% of the users experience\nreversible hair loss. The oral form is the only form available in\nthe US. Safety in pregnancy\nThe risk of birth defects with valproate is two to five times higher than other frequently\nused antiepileptic drugs. Children born to mothers using valproate have\nsignificantly lower IQ scores. However, some epilepsy can only be controlled\nby valproate, and seizures during pregnancy can have grave consequences for both mother\nand child. Doctors recommend women who intend to become\npregnant should be switched to a different drug using combined therapy if possible, which\ntakes several months. Women who are already pregnant and taking\nhigh doses of valproate should try to lower their doses. All antiepileptic medications have been shown\nto be associated with higher risks of fetal abnormalities since at least 1983, with the\nrisks being related to the strength of medication used and use of more than one drug. Valproate has also been recognised as sometimes\ncausing a specific facial change termed \"fetal valproate syndrome\". Sodium valproate has been associated with\nthe rare condition paroxysmal tonic upgaze of childhood, also known as Ouvrier-Billson\nsyndrome, from childhood or fetal exposure (this condition resolved after discontinuing\nvalproate therapy. While developmental delay is usually associated\nwith altered physical characteristics, this is not always the case. A 2005 study found rates of autism among children\nexposed to sodium valproate before birth in the cohort studied were 8.9%. The normal incidence for autism in the general\npopulation is estimated at less than one percent. Valproate may best be avoided in women with\nlocalisation epilepsy, where more effective and less risky alternatives, such as carbamazepine,\nare available. A 2008 study also suggested a correlation\nbetween higher rates of autism in children whose mothers were treated for seizure disorders\nduring pregnancy using sodium valproate. However, only 632 children were followed in\nthis study, prompting criticism that this study was too small to determine whether a\ndefinitive correlation existed between the use of sodium valproate in pregnant mothers\nand higher autism rates in their children, or whether other antiseizure medications used\nduring pregnancy may cause this effect. One multicentre trial in the UK and US compared\ncognitive function in 309 children born to mothers with epilepsy; it found sodium valproate\nuse was associated with an IQ level eight points lower in children born to mothers taking\nsodium valproate than mothers taking other antiepileptic drugs. The authors of the study attempted to correct\nfor confounding factors, but this was an observational study, so could not prove a causal link. Proving a causal link requires a randomised-controlled\ntrial, which is not ethical to perform. Stronger evidence likely will not become available. A class action lawsuit is currently underway\nin the United Kingdom regarding the claim that the drug used in pregnancy caused a range\nof problems in children, including autism, learning and social difficulties, ADHD, spinal\nstenosis, facial abnormalities, vision defects, dyslexia, developmental coordination disorder,\nand delayed speech and motor development. he U.S. Food and Drug Administration uses\na pregnancy category system to classify the possible risks to a fetus when a specific\nmedicine is taken during pregnancy. Depakote is in pregnancy Category D when used\nfor the treatment of epilepsy or manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder. Pregnancy Category D is a classification given\nto medicines that have been shown to present a risk to the fetus in studies of pregnant\nwomen but may still offer benefits that outweigh the risks that the drug presents. A pregnancy Category D medicine may still\nbe given to a pregnant woman if the healthcare provider believes that the benefits to the\nwoman outweigh the possible risks to the unborn child. Depakote is in pregnancy Category X when used\nfor the prevention of migraine headaches. Pregnancy Category X means that the risks\nof taking the medication during pregnancy clearly outweigh the benefits. Medications in this category should not be\ntaken by women who are pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant. Women who are taking Depakote for this reason\nand become pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant should contact their healthcare provider before\nstopping the medication, as it should not be stopped abruptly. Many studies have shown that Depakote may\ncause birth defects in humans. Sometimes, these birth defects can be very\nsevere. Studies have also shown that children born\nto women who took valproate medications during pregnancy tend to score lower on \"cognitive\nfunction\" tests, compared to children whose mothers took other epilepsy medications while\npregnant. Pregnant women should not take Depakote unless\nabsolutely necessary. However, uncontrolled epilepsy can also be\ndangerous to both a pregnant woman and the fetus. You and your healthcare provider must discuss\nthe specific benefits and risks of using Depakote during pregnancy for your particular situation. If your epilepsy is very mild, you may consider\nstopping Depakote. However, if your epilepsy is severe or difficult\nto control, it may be best for you to stay on Depakote. No matter what, do not stop taking Depakote\nsuddenly. If you and your healthcare provider decide\nthat it is best for you to continue taking Depakote during pregnancy, you will need frequent\nblood tests to measure your Depakote levels. Pregnancy can affect the way your body handles\nthe drug, and it is important to keep your dose at the lowest effective level. Your healthcare provider may suggest a higher-than-usual\ndose of folic acid, as this may also help protect the fetus. Safety for children\nTwo children developed severe cognitive and behavioral deterioration suggestive of a degenerative\ndisease while being treated with sodium valproate for idiopathic epilepsy. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple\nareas of brain atrophy. In both patients, clinical symptoms and signs\ncleared in a few weeks once they ceased taking the valproate. The magnetic resonance imaging appearance\nimproved within 3 months in 1 of the patients and normalized in both after 6 and 12 months. No metabolic changes were associated with\nthe clinical or imaging abnormalities. Although the mechanism of this rare idiosyncratic\ncomplication of valproate therapy is unknown, we advocate discontinuing valproate therapy\nin all epileptic patients with neuromental deterioration or brain atrophy of unknown\netiology. Mechanism of action\nSodium valproate is a weak blocker of sodium ion channels; it is also a weak inhibitor\nof enzymes that deactivate GABA such as GABA transaminase. It may also stimulate the synthesis of GABA,\nbut the direct mechanism is not known. Because of its many mechanisms of action,\nsodium valproate has efficacy in all partial and generalised seizures including absence\nseizures.

my hand and we are not [ __ ] sitting the [ __ ] down but today is a busy day and we have a review on some awakening meds 10 milligrams THC permit so 16 minutes total 160 milligrams THC per package look in the back you'll see that the strength is a 10 so these things are potent F if you don't know what half means look it up there's a 45 minute activation time with a asterisk saying then toxic aiding effects of this project may be delayed by two or more hours hmm well you know we know because we've we've had these you know the packaging that you see on the tape is obviously doesn't look like that anymore three are now missing but it's great packaging kind of looks like just gum like your normal mints which is great but yeah anyways medication that's one of the things I like about it is that it looks like the medication yeah and it is a medication it's not just like any other mint and if it was in like a mint container they would break off and stuff like that so then you wouldn't be actually getting your dose yeah they're specifically dose not like how you know some pills are just a nicotine and they all like meshed together and they break apart these are our words yeah these ones are separately encased oops um but alright let's break into these who talked to the people I am doing homework just if you guys were wondering because I have an exam tomorrow exams exams and these awakening mints are well awakening and yeah like I said we've had these and there's yours or sublingual application yes yes I would say one thing that it's a con about these that we have no this is just like the taste they are very effective mm-hmm very potent like very tonight and potency is just a taste which I made a mistake last night of getting it on the top of my time do not do that try and keep it on your tongue as best as possible okay right now I'm like okay taste in that bad that's because it's not on my actual telling so follow the directions people doll the directions don't chew them it's not going to taste good it starts to take on the taste of the medication yeah but in that last last night we tried his hand came home I came home for work I'm like oh let's try these mints out and I was like all right and we try to and then we pinned in the we're like Oh what is this cinnamon yeah we have you know listen to directions last night but 15 minutes later though we were giggling like a mug well seriously yeah the activation time listen as long as they say it is but that might be for the full effect to kick in yeah but well did you get it back let me start feeling the effects peace for now well just brought it back and can you couldn't do it Kian had about it it's gone drink down some of this it's gone so what are they like me you chew it it's sort of taste like those Trader Joe's chewable vitamin C's Oh like the orange heists like the orange like tasting ones yeah so it's like its chalky its chalky and like I said it does taste like you a little bit of a medicine yeah so but if you push it so you should be patient like money and follow the instructions like you're actually supposed to yeah I just can't suck on stuff these guys alright guys we're back and it's hard to hold up this camera but because it's like potent but I don't really I don't know yeah so at least for me maybe TMI but I started that time of the month today and my cramps are killing me but these mints really helped out like I didn't think that they'd kick in that way maybe that's why I don't feel highs because it's affecting other parts of my body but no definitely definitely is great so win-win so how do you how do you rate those just if we're doing Oh Hollywood okay like overall as a like steady 8 like I used it I would definitely read it 10 out of 10 but look if you're just gonna get high like how would you rate I was like sometimes just to get you high like if you were just they I would use those like throughout the day like if I was gonna go to like Disneyland or something like oh yeah that's like a packet of those and then figure out how I could like you know get them in a container I don't that would I mean you punch do this I mean yeah they oversee mints they won't really actually look at it's just I'm not sure but it looks like a container full mints yeah come in two descriptions do you think business not this she's a good mid thing but Nick pockets are in your bag do you think they'd actually like look I'd be like THC oh my god I'm Lauren Disneyland comments I know right we love you Disney we're not sneaking reading no we are not we are just asking questions just ask questions so for day-to-day I would say I give that a 7 out of 10 because I prefer to use the cartridges or like throughout the day definitely I I prefer smoking more than animals edibles especially like I said I have a hard time keeping something like a sucker under my tongue or like even a sucker in my mouth so like choose I guess for me um because of my like situation I would probably get it like a 9 9 10 and the reason I don't give a 10 10 is because it's the taste I'm not really an orange fan anyways and yeah but effectiveness and just like how like yeah I could pop them through the day and stuff I don't say yeah good solid 9 and 10 but just a different video for you guys on the go type video got [ __ ] to do but these guys", "BLj7UGMjO3g": "the purpose of this video is to explain how to mix and how to use BBC 157 um things are gonna need are your BBC 157 I have mine for my tendon regrowth and healing you need a mixing needle insulin needle and bacteriostatic water you also want some alcohol pads because you don't wanna get sick first things first take out the alcohol pad while the rubber stopper on both your bacteriostatic water and your BBC at 1:57 make sure you take the top off there we go um I've been talking to my doctor and we've decided that we're going to do 12 and a half days of two times a day at 200 micrograms um the math we're doing for that is this is a 5 milligram little bottle of BBC one 57 so we are going to inject two and a half milliliters in there once this is dry you can stick this straight down the middle let's cure bacteriostatic water turn it upside down and pull out exactly to the number you're trying to hit once you are axed the correct number for your dosage you can put the mixing needle into the peptide now you're going to want to stick it and point it down towards the side so you don't denature your protein like so and slowly let it in at an angle let's we're good there you can't swirl it around until clear and we are clear and we are ready to use our BBC 157 thank you take your sterile insulin needle open both sides my dosing is going to be at 10 cc's sick needle straight down the middle of your BBC 157 pull it down to ten and you are good to go now I recommend having your doctor talk you through this this is just a little something to demystify the process of it and um you can inject it intramuscular or subcutaneously my main point of advice is talk to a doctor talk to a trained professional and have them run you through all of this if you have any questions feel free to reach out to me have a wonderful day"}
