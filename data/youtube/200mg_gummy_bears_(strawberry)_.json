so it's definitely gonna hit the car like a train but we'll see what happens i don't really eat edibles ever so you've never eaten edibles i have before like once or twice but never like this amount we'll see how it goes you're down to do this oh hell yeah all right he's gonna eat the whole [ __ ] bag yeah you ready he's [ __ ] down that [ __ ] again it's gonna taste like ass no it tastes pretty good i mean it's [ __ ] gummy worms let's see how it goes but um yeah so for those who don't know delta 8 is actually 66 percent the psychoactivity of delta 9 but i mean 500 milligrams you know oh man he's just down and look at that how's it taste [Music] yeah so these are the sour gummy worms so you just downed it we're probably gonna check back in in an hour it's gonna take two hours to kick in but we'll check in every single hour to see where he's at you're gonna he's gonna be drunk yeah i know he's gonna get screwed up dude he's gotta wait 40 minutes yeah no he's gonna get [ __ ] up it's 500 milligrams dude fun fun dude i mean we'll see what happens i don't get that [ __ ] up normally one hit of a bomb and i'll be [ __ ] fried you're gonna be [ __ ] up i'm hoping i'm like paralyzed that's what i'm hoping for so yeah [Music] those taste like real gummy worms though that [ __ ] well no they are real gummies yeah but normally like if you infuse like a cookie with thc and you can still see guy should be [ __ ] up it will be worth it though dude perhaps you're doing that i mean it's not like it's not like you know i mean you don't have to work tomorrow right he's underplaying it dude yeah i'm unemployed baby you're good you're good 25 minutes how do you feel better cousins not bad not bad i don't think it's i feel like it's not hitting yet all right we'll check back in it's a placebo effect right now i his eyes are getting kind of red man i'm baked let's make that right here let's go to the light a bit so these uh people can see how red the eyes are um so guys um i shouldn't say guys i don't like that hey you look at those eyes right there that's what those edibles do after one hour that's 500 milligrams of delta 8 thc um edibles man they're frying me already hell yeah it's been what are you expecting in the next 30 minutes sleeping probably so we'll see if we get any more of this are they sativa indica or what just distilling distillate oh so [ __ ] blacks is that what that is i guess you could call it delta 8 wax i mean wax is desolate um i guess but there's different methods of extracting it like co2 and bho and i guess the consistency determines what you call it but it's just distal it's just super thick and sticky and uh basically the gummies just regular gummies and they actually spray it with the actual thc oil oh wow so you're when you eat the gummies you're literally eating the straight oil on the actual gum that's insane i don't think i heard like a word you said because i'm just [ __ ] just going in and out of my eyes oh okay [Laughter] you feel [ __ ] up oh [ __ ] i can't feel my lips oh no like stuck to my teeth so wait you what do they feel like they feel like nothing yeah basically wow incredible dry can i get

and two-hour check-in three-hour check-in we only got to the first check-in and uh after that he's just like i'm [ __ ] up so yeah uh moral of the story don't eat the whole bag only eat one or two if you want try the edibles yourself and just only take one or two you hit the link down below and try it out for yourself and if you get too high you can smoke some cbd and calm yourself down you can get an eighth for free by the way so uh yeah i hope you enjoyed the video hit that like hit the like", "4lLn0PhkakM": "[Music] [Music] hey guys mr. and mrs. Smith here and today we're going to be reviewing the heavy hitters cannabis infused gummies we have strawberry pineapple to try today we're actually very excited to try these uh if you don't know already heavy-hitters is possibly our favorite brand I would definitely say I would say it's also primarily smoke heavy hitters for our everyday cartridge and then when we want to like it up a little bit we'll grab some other stuff but heavy hitters is definitely always on a cartridge for us so we're also going to be trying the heavy hares GSC I say trying we've had it many times but we haven't been able to find it for a while not what you are it kind of it kind of went out of stock just weird it used to be available a lot in like 2018 but it kind of just fell out of favor except for certain places would still carry a guy in town by our main delivery service was no longer carrying it but they had it the other day so I had to pick it up cause it's been too long it seems like they almost haven't had it in stock since the name change so JSC used to be Girl Scout cookies I don't know if they changed it in others stances I'm pretty sure it was part of the laws that happened I'm pretty sure it's part of the laws that happened in 2018 for California that's they weren't allowed to call it they can't call it candy I believe they can't use the term candy and they can't use the term anything that could be marketed yes towards children can't market towards children right Paul any so that's why it says gummies or it'll always seem medical or cannabis like that they never never make yeah that would be appealing to a child exactly it can't be bears or anything like that so I mean it's a good law honestly I totally understand why there's some other laws that happened in 2018 which I will give you a refresher on right now now there was some weird stuff that happened when California passed a recreational marijuana back in 2018 I believe it was one of the things that happen is towards the middle of the year they actually switched it to where edibles could no longer contain more than a hundred milligrams per package now if you work in the medical marijuana industry or if you were a user or anything like that prior you know that there used to be packages up to a thousand milligrams in just one treat and what that used to be really good at is you could like just take a nibble off of a treat throughout the day and just kind of keep yourself dosed and medicated off one treat for a whole week basically but they changed it because there were way too many people who would come into a dispensary have no idea what they were doing by one of those really high potency edibles eat the whole thing and then they have a really bad time and end up going to the emergency room they got sick of dealing with that so they made a law saying you can't have more than a hundred milligrams per package there are certain things you can get around that such as cannabutter tinctures and pills those three items you can definitely get in higher doses than 100 milligrams but for edibles and then kind of cookie or anything like that max you're gonna get in a package is about a hundred so today we're reviewing B's from heavy hitters and the way they went about with these twenty milligrams per piece is you can actually rip the pieces in half so it's actually two servings per piece so it actually comes in two to ten milligram servings which I'm pretty sure is the law is that each piece inside a package can only be ten milligrams or something like that I know five to ten milligrams is a state recommended serving I'm not a hundred percent clear on the laws but it's just an unfortunate thing that happened with edibles in 2018 but I am absolutely dying to try these guns so let's go ahead and open up to the [ __ ] strawberry cuz I'm Joey it's been it's been a long time looking for out that let me grab the a7 r3 with the 70s [Music] [Music] yeah we just won't have us we won't help you all this video it's just not working at the moment six and a half hours Nathan I might open the pineapple real quick to maybe these do not open well I feel like we should show just how much of a struggle these were to open just like a montage of the [ __ ] difficulty this is bad this one opened much easier but that first package it just ripped in such a way that it was really hard to open but this is just like the other one has a really strong smell I figured it's it's really strong artificial pineapple mmm it's it's kind of a a bit herbal but not like too herbal it's not like overly pungent or anything like that like you're not gonna have you're not gonna get in trouble they're just keeping these in your drawer or anything like that like no one's gonna smell it yeah I don't know if this has any actual like pineapple juice or anything in it it doesn't have it listed on the ingredients mm-hmm so we're not sure if this is artificial flavoring or real bad no artificial actual coloring and flavor so is that natural flavors that display really use the natural coloring and flavor like or is it a flavor that's kind of that's kind of weird I don't know if I feel someone from heavy Harry's modified food yeah I don't mind it I mean that's just what I mean the people are heavy hitters you might want to put that it is natural flavoring as well like actually specified natural color and natural flavoring because natural color and flavoring just sounds a bit odd it's it leaves it up to the imagination as to is the flavoring also natural or just natural color you're always a nice flavoring this yeah always alright so let's try the pineapple yeah I'm gonna do a full 20 but I'm gonna show the camera how it splits so this is the gummies from heavy-hitters it's a square and if you look very carefully there's this little seam in the middle that if you pull whoops it starts to come apart yes it does if you start to pull it comes apart very nicely into two perfectly even ten milligram pieces so let's start well I'm actually just gonna eat the whole thing at once wait so where's our list of like criteria so I know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing bring it up go on top down your mouth and just roll around a little okay yeah my hands are all sticky now you know I gotta say I'm a little disappointed I'm a little underwhelmed actually I had I had much higher hopes it could just be the pineapple yeah because I mean the strawberry definitely smells better than the pineapple the pineapple is a little strong it's kind of it's very herbal forward which isn't a bad thing a lot of people enjoy that it's not a bad flavor necessarily but it is definitely herbal forward if you're looking for something that you could just totally mound shun and forget that there's weed in it not that we recommend it's not gonna be that yeah definitely don't recommend that but I mean like if you're if you're a fan of someone who like Eric or someone who likes really really flavorful very liked gummies that don't aren't bitter or plant alike at all this is not for you this is made to be strong and to be potent and it definitely tastes like it so keep that in mind and next up we have the strawberry so let's go ahead and pop these open and yeah will rate them in a second let's try the strawberry and I want to go ahead and split this one yeah because there'll be 30 milligrams each mmm much better much better mm-hmm all right strawberry is actually really good um I would say it's definitely pretty it is still has that herbal flavor but um let me bring up the criteria so we can actually start to break these down aftertaste yeah yeah really bad yeah I would say it's a bit odd I I'm almost feeling a little bit um disappointed I know me too it which it sucks because I'm such a fan of their oils but that's where comes in would we be as disappointed if we hadn't hyping it up so much yeah we did we we've also we've held on to these for about two weeks we've been waiting and waiting and waiting to try these specifically for the on camera experience and you know I think that also kind of built it up the fact that we've been we've been like dying sitting on me dying to try them the whole time and I mean they're they're good [ __ ] effects for sure by new user mm-hmm will probably like would probably really like it however its strong grams each heavy hitters recommends 10 milligrams as a dose the state of California recommends that california recommends that I personally have very low tolerance when it comes to most things so if you're like me I would definitely recommend starting with 5 milligrams when it comes to edibles but I mean you've been doing it you've been using medical using marijuana medically for two years yes so her tolerance is pretty high so we can handle the 30 we just say no problem but the big thing is though from let's let's go ahead and actually break this down but the main thing that I'm getting from these is but from trying both of them it is quite herbal forward the the flavor is there the strawberry is much sweeter and more flavorful I would say than the pineapple pineapple is a little more herbal forward as well but let's actually start talking about our rating categories here and give these are actually solid score each [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we're also gonna open this GSC previously known as Girl Scout cookies for those of you have been in the game a little longer and actually know the OG strings we're gonna be trying that card out today so anyways hope to catch you all later and see you in the next video like and subscribe [Music]", "wzzn1t-__Xs": "today kevin and i are going to be trying some boom candy um i have the these are gummy bears this is prosecco and rose and i have the strawberry daiquiri gummy bears and the sangria bears so we found three of these these three we found at home goods they were 4.99 at homegoods this one we went in marshalls after home goods and we found this one that we hadn't bought at home goods in marshalls and it was 4.99 so uh hungas and marshalls and what tj maxx are all the same they're owned by the same people so yeah they were stuffed but they're wrong about it they got a lot of things so you might see like when we were in marshalls we didn't see these that we had just bought in home goods so it was this lone random bag they got so you just have to be aware and kind of remember what you bought from place to place if you're like us so these are gummy candy gummy bears nine pieces 32 grams is 100 calories distributed by boom candy toronto this is ontario canada so it's a canadian company and these are refillable bugs so ooh how pretty that is a strong smell yeah all right it looks like there's you didn't get a white one one two three four five six seven eight nine ten looks like there's ten different flowers they're they're a lot you want to sort them out so you have a picture for you did you get orange yeah you got orange yeah i think you got them all yeah 10 flavors that's a lot and it does not tell um what the flavors are so we just get to guess yeah and one of these is heat i'm sorting them out so we can have one for a picture oh okay let's see you you need a clear one of course we could sort them out after we're finished with this too that way we're not taking i think we're almost there we're on this one what flavor we're missing a light green there we go all right okay those are gonna go back in the bag okay these will go back in the bag and um which one do you want to try first i don't know you can grab it on my hand here okay let's see let's try a clear who knows with clear one i'm gonna guess pineapple yep pineapple absolutely pineapple it took me a second to get it but then once i got it i got it yeah that's a good flavor it's a very nice pineapple yeah and good and soft the gummies are good and soft too so the textures are even really good now what do you think the lemon honey i'm assuming yeah lemon i'm gonna stick those on there these are all the same flavors so these are really cute little bears too i love the texture the texture is very um they're not sticky no and they're soft but they're not really really super mushy soft um so they have some chew to them but they're not rubbery um and sticky that lemon is very uh refreshing it's not like a cleaner that's not chemically at all no this is a pink so are we gonna go strawberry oh okay no grapefruit or something like that i was gonna say cantaloupe that's some citrusy like a grapefruit or a mango mangoes usually orange though um that's some kind of citrus i'm going to say grapefruit or maybe even a tangerine might be a tangerine i don't know i think it's more grape yeah it's more tart than them okay now we have a light blue um i have no idea let's say raspberry i don't know it's very refresh reminds of the ocean that reminds you of like something just refreshing yes i don't know what it is i don't either it's some kind of berry but i don't know what i know it does taste like berry but i i i can't be sure what that is it's not as strong as like a raspberry or light green which i would think would be lime lime or watermelon hmm this is going to be apple apple definitely apple green yeah that one is stronger i think that one was lime it just wasn't strong this is purple we are eating only half so we're meat and i eat a whole bag of rice beans right i mean gummy gummy bears soy beans because we have so many to try that's why we're having them um that grape was it's great but it's a lighter gray it is it uh honestly i wish the grape had been stronger just because i really like grape it's good that's a lot maybe if you've eaten a whole one it would have been better but oh i like the orange you've got a good flavor orange is nice orange is one of those that although companies have messed it up before it's hard to mess up the orange yeah do the blue or the red red oh i like that cherry yes that is an excellent cherry it is strong too almost cough droppy yes which is a good thing it's very nice that is blue raspberry yeah it's definitely blue raspberry or or is it more tropical bunch no i think it's blue raspberry um make that mix with the cherry probably through y'all right but yeah that if you ate both of those at the same time you probably have a really good tropical patch if you mix the blue and you get that light um orange one with that kind of citrusy that sharp citrus flavor yeah that would be a good mixture yeah you could mix these and do your own stuff these are a really good job i mean i keep saying jelly bean gummy bears i think these are very we really like the albanese the quality i think these are very in line with the office oh yeah yeah i think albany's are actually a little tougher than these are yeah these these are very very good quality flavors are really good worth five dollars for that bag i think this is gonna be interesting prosecco and rose nine pieces are 90 calories yeah these are all the same i know there's different well there's three different colors it looks like these are like sugar coated oh they're the yellowy kind of color yeah what um let's see what you're just gonna have i would think they're all the same but we'll try to just to make sure because i did just eat it oh wow i don't like that no at all no but you have to try another one oh gosh it does have that prosecco flavor you know what though i don't mind prosecco i don't like a little bit those so mostly different flavors because that one was worse than the first one yeah which one did we not draw the yellow this one you've been cutting them i don't know which one you these are a little tougher too yeah but they're sugar coated on the outside [Applause] yeah i just they're a little too earthy for me yeah they have a um they have a um oh okay a bitterness to them yeah it's that's probably the rose um yeah it's a it's it's bitter and biting and you're you're stuck with that bitter flavor all up in your nasal passages it's not good and so up in your crew yeah so as much as we raved about the gummy bears i would pass on this you know what though that would be a flavor i personally buy anyway right so if that sounds interesting to you you would just have to try them honestly this one is strawberry daiquiri these are all of the signs this one sounds interesting these are all the same so just grab one yeah these are definitely tougher and this is sugar coated as well 11 pieces is 110 calories really good strawberry flavor though yes i really like that just know that they are a tougher chew than the original bears right i would prefer the original but now i really do like that sugar it's a very small flavor yeah it's that sugar cutting is nice i wouldn't have said strawberry daiquiri i would have just said strawberry i don't know it kind of reminds me of that um you have a little whipped up kind of strawberry i can i can picture that in my mind when i mean that but it's not as i like that prosecco no it's not you don't get the alcohol kind of flavor this is sangria spoiler alert we usually don't want 11 pieces or 110 calories it's a better flavor than i thought because we've had other things that saying we absolutely hated it yes because it tastes like rotten fruit right um that's actually really good it's very sweet yeah this is actually very very nice it um it it has to me just a berry flavor it does i can see berries like like even leaning towards like a raspberry or something it's just and i do like that sugar on the outside these are tougher really i think they're bigger too though yeah they seem bigger when but the gummy bears are long and they're thin these are shorter and they're thicker looking but you were also cutting them in half i was but you can tell a difference i mean when i when i'm eating it though it feels bigger only because i was eating half a gummy bear oh well that's yeah that's true that's why i didn't think about that yeah well the strawberry daiquiri and the sangria i would buy those yes i would pick the regular berries over any of them yes because those all those flavors are so so good and this would be just a niche thing if you really if that sounded interesting to you trying we wouldn't buy them again but right so if you're looking at the front of these they say like gummy candy this one says gummy candy you need to look on the back and then it tells you on the back exactly what it is but if you see this brand i think you are very safe to get it because i think at least the gummy bears yeah i think they're delicious yeah so definitely worth a try so i'll have a picture for you at the end and thanks for watching [Music] you", "2_mDkLjlTCw": "so what is the best snack to eat at the movies say it with me popcorn but gummy bears are close second or maybe a third they're somewhere on the list gummy bears are delicious but what's the problem with gummy bears it doesn't matter how many gummy bears you eat they never seem to satiate you and they're just filled with sugar and calories because what are gummy bears really they're little tiny sugar bombs or sugar bears gummy bears are a delicious sweet treat i can eat endless amounts of gummy bears and they never seem to satiate me and that's the problem with gummy bears they are high in calories and high in sugar and they're delicious so you can eat a ton of them but they're not really satiating you and providing any sort of nutrition but today i have a gummy bears recipe that only requires two ingredients it is super simple and super easy to make very quick to make as well and you can make any flavor gummy bears that you want and these are low in sugar and low in calories so you can eat a lot more gummy bears and i'm rahul and on this channel we cover healthy recipes recipe reviews and all things related to fitness and nutrition so if that sounds good to you hit that like button hit that subscribe button and let's jump right into the recipe so the ingredients we are going to need for this recipe only two ingredients super easy super simple the first ingredient is gonna be sugar-free jell-o so this is sugar-free jello right here it comes in a bunch of flavors so whatever flavor gummy bears you want pick that flavor of sugar-free jello i have strawberry here and then we also have orange black cherry and another packet of strawberry so you're going to need one of these small boxes these are 0.3 ounce boxes and they have four servings so we're going to use an entire package of this so pick your favorite flavor what flavor should we do today we got orange we got black cherry we got strawberry i'm thinking strawberry because strawberry is probably my favorite fruit my favorite berry and i love strawberry flavored things i love strawberries so it just makes sense we're gonna do strawberry flavored gummy bears but whatever flavor that you want you pick that flavor of jello and the second and last ingredient we will need is some gelatin in this box there are four pouches of gelatin and we're gonna use one pouch so if you buy one of these boxes you can make four different flavors of gummy bears and you can just get four different packs of jello so very easy and the third ingredient is gonna be water so we're not gonna count that as an ingredient say it's two ingredients but if you wanna count water as an ingredient then these are gonna be three ingredient gummy bears but i'm hoping that you have water to make this recipe so let's get right into it so let's jump right into making this recipe first things first grab your jello grab your grab your jello grab your gelatin and grab your foods recipe will not need a food scale guys i know anabolic kitchen making recipes without a food scale is unknown to this channel i love this thing and i use it for everything i make but for this one you will not need a food scale i have a measuring cup right here and first thing we're going to do is put a third of a cup of water in here and a third of a cup of water is 80 grams of water i'm gonna measure out 80 grams even though this thing has markings on it i could just look at this thing and find out what a third of a cup of water is you might be wondering why am i using a food scale measuring the amount of water i'm using when i'm using a measuring cup that tells me what a third of a cup is well that is a great question that we don't know the answer to next thing we're going to do is take our gelatin take one envelope that's in here and put it right into our water and just let it chill let it let it chill on the side for a little bit because if you try to mix this it's kind of hard to mix but the gelatin just absorbs the water so if you let this chill for a little bit it's going to absorb the water and then you can easily mix it while this is relaxing for a minute let me know in the comments what your favorite flavor of gummy candies or or candy is for me it's definitely strawberry or pina colada flavor is there a better drink out there than a nice pina colada i don't think so so pina colada flavored gummies are amazing strawberry is always good and if anyone comments grape psychopath so take a fork or a spoon but a fork is easier and stir this up you can see there let this chill for a minute the gelatin mixes up super easily we're going to microwave this for one minute we don't want it boiling we don't want it really really hot we just want it warmed up so that the jello mix mixes easier in this so throw this in the microwave for around a minute until it's warm and then as soon as it comes out we're gonna dump our we're gonna dump our jello right in here [Music] while that's heating up the microwave let's open up our jello so if i read the ingredients on this should i be worried about what's going in my body i'll make that sacrifice because i want to eat gummy bears and it's okay so now that our jello mix is opened up we're going to wait for that thing 10 seconds left and it is going to finish right now right now right now first try get it [Music] so this is hot dump this right in here mix this up oh another pro tip if you have one of these milk frothing things do not use this to mix this up trust me when i was testing this recipe i used this thing this turned into foam a ton of bubbles came in the gummy bears did not turn out very well at the end they were like foamy gummy bears so don't use this thing use a fork or use a whisk so now that all the jello mix is dissolved in here you have a mixture that resembles lava but it smells good smells very strawberry if you have a gummy bear mold use that and put it into the mold or just get any dish and pour the mixture right into here and once it sets you can cut it up into cubes so we're going to make gummy cubes but it's 20 20 guys these cubes can be bears if they want to make any shape you want make pyramids make cubes make rectangles make circles greg you set but get a container we're just going to pour all the mixture right into this you don't need this i did it without it but i like to use a little oil spray just because why not just cause in case it sticks which it never does but just in case now that you have your container spread with oil take this mixture and pour it right in here so we want a thin layer so we can make small gummy cubes just like the size of a gummy bear so best part about having one of these is you can just pour right in really easily and guys one thing i forgot to say earlier is if you want these a little sweeter just add a little bit of artificial sweetener here add a splenda add some erythritol add anything you want into this mixture to make it a bit sweeter but i'm not going to add any because i'm sweet enough [Music] tastes pretty good is it bad to have jello raw wait there's nothing raw in this it just goes in the fridge it's not being baked never mind this is one tasty mixture so this goes right to the fridge for an hour and then we'll cut up into cubes and i will show you how these gummy cubes aka gummy bears come out so look how this came out a block you can just eat this like as is but let's cut this up into some cubes and make some gummy cubes gummy bears gummy bears that look like cubes but they're actually bears because we said so on this channel we want these cubes to be bearish so they will be bears so just cut it up into cubes but i want to try one right now they taste so similar to gummy bears they're so good and remember if you want to stop here gummy worms [Music] [Applause] this whole bowl right here is 50 calories and another tip on the calories on this recipe so it is pretty hard to know because let's go with the jello brand of jello this says 10 calories per serving and a serving is 2 grams of the mix let's go with great value walmart brand of the exact same thing if you look at the ingredients they're basically the same 2 grams is five calories so if you look at that so we know that nutrition labels can lie to us the real calories on this is somewhere probably between five and ten jello probably rounded up to ten our boy great value rounded down to five so even though these probably have the exact same amount of calories if you're cutting use this one if you're bulking use this one and you know i'm just kidding guys don't lie to yourselves don't trick yourselves it doesn't matter which one you use it is pretty minuscule and it doesn't matter that much so just use either one of these but it's something i wanted to show you these are pretty much the exact same things if you look at the ingredients they're the exact same but the calories on them are different so just a pro tip nutrition labels are not accurate so it is really hard to be that specific with your calories because even if you count every single thing in your diet the nutrition labels might be lying to you and they might not be having the accurate amount of calories because they're just rounding up rounding down we don't know what they're doing so the macros on both of these are zero carbs zero fat one protein and we know that one gram of protein has four calories so if there's one protein in a serving then there should be four calories in a serving so how do they get to 10 that is a mystery that we will never know the answer to or maybe there's some amount of carbs that that is less than a gram so they just said zero grams of carbs but when you look at the calories it's greater than five and they rounded up to ten we don't know we got to call our boy jello and ask him how he got to 10. and we got to call our boy great value and ask him how he got to five so if you use the great value jello mix it's 40 calories if you use jello brand jello mix then it would be 60 calories so we're just gonna go right in the middle and i know that there are 12 grams of protein in this and so we're going to say that's 48 calories so this bowl has 50 calories so you get a bowl of gummy bears for 50 calories and all those calories are pretty much coming from protein because there are 12 grams of protein in this no carbs no fat crazy imagine eating gummy bears instead of a protein bar so 50 calories you get all the gummy bears double this put a different flavor mix in with this 100 calories and it's just straight protein that you're getting so the gummy bears that you would get from any convenience store just regular gummy bears let's compare 50 calories of this to 50 calories of this so if i look at the back of this these are sour gummy worms and it says 100 calories for seven pieces which is 31 grams so 15 grams should be 50 calories let's go one of every color and there we go 15 grams so if you look at that that is 15 grams of gummy worms and that is not a lot quite disappointing 50 calories 50 calories the difference guys this is what i'm trying to share with you guys on this channel this versus this neither of these will fill you up that much right because it's not a lot of food it's only 50 calories though so what if this was 200 calories so you would have instead of three 12 of these for 200 calories or four bowls of this you see how this would eventually fill you up a lot more than this this is also straight protein so it's gonna be more filling than the sugar that you get from this guys healthy gummy bears we did it and taste test it's so good it's so good this is really good like i'd go crunch this bowl and i'd be super happy really good guys you guys got to try this try this recipe out and don't eat three of these eat this whole bowl instead and you're getting more protein and it's just as delicious you know that if i open this up i'm crushing the entire pack in this whole pack 500 calories and this would not fill me up this is not that much versus this so as always guys thank you so much for watching this video try this recipe out because i have a feeling that you guys will really enjoy this one i'd love to know what you guys will think what flavor gummy bears do you guys make let me know let me know down below your favorite candy and thank you so much for watching this video like this video if you like this recipe subscribe if you're new and i will see you all in the next video these are so good literally can't stop eating them these are so good guys i can't stop eating them they're delicious and it's just straight protein can't go wrong i", "P_KArHdguG8": "What's the story behind gummy bears? How did they get their start, and what makes\nthem so perfectly chewy? They're a ridiculously satisfying candy, but\nas it turns out, there's a lot more to their story than meets the eye. Here's what you should know about gummy bears. Gummy bears have been around for almost 100\nyears. They were created and popularized by a German\ncompany named Haribo. Hans Riegel, the founder of Haribo, was only\n27 when he became a trained confectioner and started his company in 1920. Riegel began by producing hard candies until\nhe decided to try a few experiments with gelatin. It took two years, but he invented his first\nbear-shaped candy made of gummy in 1922. Riegel originally called them Dancing Bears\nand they were a bit larger and thinner than modern gummy bears. It wasn't until 1960 that Haribo updated the\nDancing Bears name to Gold-Bears. Then in 1978, the bears changed shape to the\nshorter, thicker version that we know and love today. While gummy bears have been a popular candy\nin Germany since the 1920s, it took many decades before they became widely known and loved\nin the United States. According to Bon Appetit, U.S. high school\nteachers in the 1970s would bring gummy bears into their German language classrooms so students\ncould try snacks from Germany. As more Americans were introduced to the tasty\ntreats, candy companies knew it was time to jump on the gummy bear bandwagon. Jelly Belly was the first American company\nto begin producing these little bears in 1981. However, Haribo wasn't willing to sit quietly\nand watch from the sidelines. So one year later, in 1982, their gummies\ndebuted in America. Other brands such as Brach's and Albanese\nfollowed years later and started producing their own version of gummy bears. Have you ever grabbed a handful of gummy bears,\nand picked out all of the bears of one specific color because, presumably, they were your\nfavorite flavor? Then you bite into the gummy candy only to\nfind out the flavor was lying to you? It happens to the best of us. According to Charles Spence, a professor of\nexperimental psychology, all our senses affect one another, and flavor perception can be\nincredibly multisensory. That's the reason why when we see an orange\ncandy, we think it's orange fruit-flavored. Keith Dannoff, Vice President of Marketing\nfor Haribo, told NPR that the company's gummy bears come in five flavors: strawberry, lemon,\norange, pineapple, and raspberry. Oddly enough, there is a green colored gummy\nbear in the mix. But when we bite into that green bear, the\nflavor is actually strawberry, which might come as a big surprise to some gummy bear\nfans. \"The red one is more gooder to me 'cause it\ntastes like berries.\" We all know that there's something unique\nabout biting into gummy candies. Next to the flavor, it's the texture that\nwe love. But what gives them that special chewiness? Well, much like other classic treats, such\nas marshmallows and Jell-O, it's all about the addition of gelatin. Gummy bears, gummy worms, and all of our favorite\ngummy goodies are made with sugar, corn syrup, water, coloring, and flavorings, but it's\nthe gelatin that really gives gummy candy that perfect, squishy texture. Gelatin allows for the thickening of a product,\nwhile still keeping a gooey consistency without adding any color or flavor. Gelatin comes from collagen, which is found\nin the tissue, skin, and bones of animals such as pigs and cows. Also, this is the reason that vegetarians\nand vegans should stay far away from traditional gummy bears. \"Did you learn that at vegan academy?\" There's always something joyous about eating\na handful of gummy bears. They're one of the most adorable candies out\nthere, and for many, it's hard not to remember eating them as a child. But what if you could take gummy bears and\nreally kick them up a notch to make an adult version? Turns out you can. Just like the magic combination of Jell-O\nand alcohol, you can make your own gummy bear shots. All you need to do is add gummy bears to a\nbowl or a cup, pour in vodka until it just barely covers the top of your gummy bears,\nand let them sit for a few days. The bears will absorb the alcohol, and you'll\nend up with plump, juicy bears that will make you feel warm with nostalgia - and booze. There aren't too many candies that have been\nmade into successful television shows. Sure, there's plenty of commercials for various\ncandies, and of course, they appear within shows, but a TV show inspired by a candy is\npretty rare. In 1985, Disney decided to capitalize on the\npopularity of gummy bears in the United States and produce a cartoon. A group of cuddly, colorful bears make up\nthe characters in Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears. The show tells the story of a civilization\nof bears that was almost destroyed by humans. However, there's one group that still lives\nbeneath a medieval kingdom. Most humans stopped believing in Gummi Bears\nlong ago but a young boy named Cavin [still believes in them because of the stories his\ngrandfather told him. After being chased by ogres, he's discovered\nby a group of Gummi Bears who are understandably suspicious of humans. \"I've never seen a human close up before. Zummi, do they really eat Gummi Bears?\" \"Oh no, oh no, of course not, Cubbi.\" Cavin earns their trust and they join together\nto battle the evil antagonist, Duke Igthorn. He's on a never-ending quest to steal the\nbear's Gummiberry Juice, which keeps them bouncing and gives people superhuman strength. It might sound a little gimmicky, but the\nshow actually had a big international following and aired for six seasons until 1991. When you consider the number of companies\nproducing gummy bears, all vying to be crowned the favorite, it's extremely impressive. Haribo has factories all over the world. Plus there are plenty of other gummy goodies\ncoming from such brands as Jelly Belly, Albanese, Trolli and Black Forest. The amount of gummy bears being produced and\nsold is astonishing. In 2017, Haribo announced plans to open its\nfirst U.S. factory in Wisconsin. According to the Seattle Times, Haribo said\nit will create 400 new jobs, adding to the existing 7,000 people Haribo employed worldwide\nat the time - all working to produce 100 million gummy bears daily. The introduction of the new factory was in\nresponse to the ridiculous growth the candy industry had seen in gummy bear popularity. According to Quartz, U.S. sales of gummy bears\nfor Haribo alone from 2011 to 2017 had increased to $115 million. Not bad for a little bear from Germany.

Store-bought gummy bears, although delicious,\ntend to have tons of foreign, unpronounceable ingredients in them. So I want to show you how you can make them\nyourself at home with just four ingredients and all natural sugars. So let\u2019s get started. Being able to bake is so great for a lot of\nreasons. One in particular is that you know and can\ncontrol what goes into your food. My one tip is always is to use quality ingredients. We\u2019re going to start out by preparing our\nfruit for our homemade gummies. So I have some strawberries that have been\ndefrosted. Feel free to use fresh, but when berries are\nout of season, I like to use frozen. Now what we\u2019re going to do with these is\nput them into a food processor and make a puree. We\u2019re just going to puree them until they\u2019re\nnice and fine and there\u2019s no lumps. Next, we\u2019re going to take our puree and\npass it through a sieve. Now we do this step because we want to remove\nseeds and we also want to end up with a nice, smooth strawberry puree at the end. So we have our lovely fruit puree, we\u2019re\ngoing to head over to the stove and combine it with the rest of our ingredients. In a heavy-bottom saucepan, add in your strawberry\npuree, water, lemon juice, and honey. And then heat all of these ingredients together\nuntil they just come to a simmer. Now that our mix is simmering, it\u2019s time\nto add in our gelatin. Now if you are vegan or don\u2019t eat gelatin,\nyou can always replace this with agar powder, which you can buy online or at a health food\nshop. Sprinkle your gelatin over the mix and then\nwhisk it in until there\u2019s no more lumps and your mix comes back up to a simmer. Ok perfect. So I\u2019m going to take this off the heat. I can see that there\u2019s no lumps of gelatin. It\u2019s nice and smooth. If you do find lumps of gelatin in yours,\nyou can feel free to pass it through a sieve again to remove those. To make these real, authentic gummy bears,\nI\u2019m going to set mine in this mold I got online. It\u2019s really inexpensive. However, if you don\u2019t have one of these\nmolds, you can always line a tray with cling wrap and this\u2019ll work just as well. You\u2019ll just have to cut our your gummies. I\u2019m going to put a link for this mold along\nwith the recipe for my gummy bears on biggerbolderbaking.com. If you\u2019re using a mold, lay it into a tray\nbefore you start filling it up. Pour your mix into a jug with a small spout\nso it\u2019s easy to pour into the molds. And also, if you see any bubbles floating\non top, just scoop that away with a spoon. Now just very slowly, fill up all of your\nmolds with your gummy mix. If you see any air bubbles, just pop them\nwith your finger. So when I worked as a pastry chef, one of\nmy jobs was to make the sweets for after dinner. And every night, we made pate de fruits, which\nis exactly what this is. It\u2019s kind of like a fruit paste. Ok and that\u2019s them done. So now remember, you don\u2019t just have to\nmake strawberry. You can make any flavor you like. I also made blueberry homemade gummies and\norange flavored homemade gummies. The orange flavor is particularly easy because\nyou just use orange juice instead of a puree. Once you\u2019ve filled your mold, we\u2019re going\nto put our gummy bears in the fridge overnight so they can set. If you like this video, don\u2019t forget to\nsubscribe to my channel so you don\u2019t miss out when I upload a new one. So I made these gummy bears yesterday because\nI wanted them to be nice and set so I could show you. If you\u2019re using a mold, just go very gently\nto ease out your gummy bear. You don\u2019t want to damage him. Just look at this little gummy. He is adorable. And the best thing about it is you made him\nand you know exactly what went into him. It\u2019s all good ingredients. You can create any fruit flavors you like\nso the possibilities are endless. Don\u2019t forget to head over to my website,\nbiggerbolderbaking.com where there is a recipe on how you can make your own sour gummies. Thank you so much for watching and I\u2019ll\nsee you back here next Thursday for more Bigger Bolder Baking.", "KAycqbqNaes": "[Music] thanks for coming back to my channel my name is Karen a and you are my bluff I am you need to eat edible for the first time I bought two all two of them because it's my first time so what if the first one doesn't work in like an hour so neither just chew up the other way I put on a salsa I'm gonna do I'm gonna be eating edible for the first time this is my first time tasting the edible smelling edible being around and it'll just it'll um going to do that why doing makeup I'm eat the edible and I'm away to our or whatever but just keep on watching keep on watching write it and like I'm already goofy and everything I bought snacks and it's most necks on the floor [Music] [Music] so I know outside of isolation is like a white wall behind me is something okay so I didn't finish the first one and I'm awake I'm awake by like an hour and I'll see what happens I know if I'm not high I'm just you know I just thought about it I ate I ate food at will that last time and I was seven [Music] [Music] about since I eat and I eat a little piece Oh so alright I'm wearing my ski we're going up top from you guys my name is Kyla Anderson I'll work my whole name gosh a little an\u00eds Renee embassy [Music] I don't even know what look I'm gonna do okay so I'm a thing I'm gonna do [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so I think I'm doing questions I [Music] don't like I drew like a state [Music] I know I can see how this is how my skin [Music] just heavy like I can't keep it in one place [Music] I look like I like Teenage Mutant by a turtle 49 units a metal Omega let me know why I was so small oh my god I know today like when I laugh like my eyebrows look like is so up in the air like my aunt Lily they drooping down that's just that's weird [Music] I'm so mix I did not want to start off with this color [Music] [Music] I'm gonna fiddle yo is either I'm trippin with my my vibrations like I know the vibration is certainly hit some [Music] I'm up here talking some on my camera just to look up and see that it's not reporting [Music] [Music] you know I recommend I'm not doing your feet try to do Yummie go waiting when is your first time eating it my drawers dismiss all the holidays holidays [Music] the lady charts ancestors I want them into my channel [Music] bro I'm really over here thinking [Music] thank you guys watching my video like comment and subscribe don't forget to say I'm hoping your brother uses to get are you a great granddaughters or a great great granddaughter let them know and I'll be enjoyed this video no I don't know how right at this moment right now I don't know how it turned out I don't know when I'm editing it and crazy party dress party just like I was checking out comments comment coming up Concord comment gonna make comments comment ok CC b9 Clare [Music] [Music]", "c5dQpHfbbrk": ">>> GET BACK!\nI TOLD YOU ALL TO GET BACK! >> LET HER THROUGH, SHE'S THE\nNEGOTIATOR. >> THANKS.\nWHAT'S THE SITUATION? >> GOT A GUY UP ON THE ROOF,\nARMED, ONE HOSTAGE.

people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say about it this joint is pissing me off much love y'all seven likes do it do it all right go to twitch.tv link will be in the description uh go to my twitter man i'm trying to get my twitter up as well

when it comes to my kids lunchboxes I am always looking for healthy delicious alternatives to the processed stuff that's out there so today I'm going to show you guys how to make strawberry gummy snacks I'm Meg and I'm passionate about finding ways to make life with kids easier in the kitchen so here's what you'll need strawberries water honey lemon juice gelatin and silicone gummy molds so the first thing you're going to need to do is take your strawberries and turn them into your puree you can use frozen strawberries make sure they're thawed first you can use a blender or a food processor and then blend until smooth all right once your strawberries are pureed you can combine it with water and then head over to your stove start by putting your water and strawberry puree mixture into a saucepan add your lemon juice and your honey and turn on to a medium low heat and whisk once your mixture is combined add the gelatin continue mixing until the gelatin is completely dissolved and there are no big clumps once your gelatin is completely dissolved all you need to do is pour it into your gummy mold today I'm using these little gummy bear molds because they're really cute but they aren't insanely large so when I'm packing these for my kids that I usually use a smaller gummy mold if you can't find gummy molds you can also pour your mixture into a baking pan and continue on using a cookie cutter all right once your mixture is in your gummy molds you're going to put it in the freezer for 25 minutes my gummy bears are all done chilling all that's left to do is pop them out of their molds oh my gosh look how cute these are these gummy snacks are by far my kids favorite they ask for them all the time and I hope your kids enjoy them too thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe and I will see you guys next time bye guys [Music] [Music]", "PoDEhYvmUz8": "[Music] so where we help you make sense of your dispensary YouTube's first and only marijuana edible review show that might be true I don't know there might be somebody else doing it but we definitely have the most videos so take that whether what you will today guys we are taking our look at our final look at cannabis quencher at least for now we are gonna take a look at their 200 milligram old-fashioned lemonade here from cannabis quencher this is I believe the fourth maybe the fifth review we've done from them I've loved all of their products I'm gonna go and take a rest after this one if this one's great we know that cannabis quencher is a-okay and we can stick with them if they release new products in the future we might take a look at them but this will be our last look at cannabis quencher and so guys this is your first time tuning in two weeks the way our reviews work is I'm gonna drink this bad boy some bit of it in front of you let you know how it tastes I'll be sure to drink it all over the next few minutes and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours to let you actually know how it's feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review process or in this case the drinkable review process so let's take a look here at cannabis quencher you can see here this vegan gluten free product ooh-la-la we've got the gondolier on the back again I still have no idea what the gondolier has to do with cannabis glacier pieces life like most drinks these days is just too complicated take a trip back into simpler times with our old-style lemonade I intend to shake well let's go back to older simpler and more high times lemonade lemonade lemonade weed weed weed weed that's the way be focus right there oh no it's May design here to rescue somebody fire department actually get em boys I'm gonna finish this and I will see you guys in two hours let you know how we're feeling and I gotta say this might have the most pleasant and least weeds the aftertaste of any of the cannabis quencher products so far so that's good I will see you guys in two hours though to let you know how we're feeling thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I had the cannabis quencher 200 milligram lemonade and I am more than happy to tell you it's just as good as all the other cannabis quenchers all the flavors uniformly excellent do not hesitate to grab cannabis quencher if you're not afraid of trying a drink at a dispensary near you I think they're great they're a little bit pricier than the confectionaries but but they are good for a nice change of pace and they're not quite as filling as the sort of confectionaries like the brownies and cookies as well so I like them as a good alternative here and there and the cannabis quencher is the sort of drink that I now go for when I would like a bowl that excuse me a drinkable I'm gonna go with cannabis quencher so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on the next review peace I'm not gonna throw this at the camera I'm just gonna do that hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "kZjm7U_RJkc": "hi guys welcome back today I have a fun snack planned for this video I'm going to be making some healthy gummy bears so if you want to see how I made this healthy and delicious treat just keep watching so the first thing you'll need for your healthy strawberry gummy bears are of course some strawberries after washing them I'm just going to take the strawberries and cut off that leafy top part and then begin by cutting each strawberry into smaller pieces it doesn't have to be perfect because we're going to put these strawberries in a blender anyway so just make sure that each piece is small enough for the blender to puree after you finish cutting up all your strawberries you're just going to place them in your blender I'm using a magic bullet it's all I've got so it'll do and then I'm going to put the lid on and start blending so this might take a while depending on your blender but you want to make it a really liquidy consistency so definitely make sure that those strawberries are pureed after blending it is time to measure out two cups of our strawberry puree and put it in a separate Bowl don't mind that my measuring cups are Wales I caught them in anthropology and I love them so yes just make sure that you have two cups worth of pureed strawberries now we are going to measure one third of a cup of lemon juice and add it to our pureed strawberries and then you're going to add a tablespoon of liquid stevia extract to the mixture as well and the very final thing that we add are about 10 to 15 drops of a natural food coloring just to really bring out that red color for our red strawberry gummy bears once we finished during the whole mixture together we are going to grab a straining bag this is a nut milk bag and then we're going to begin scooping our mixture into the bag to strain out all of the strawberry seeds you guys yeah okay this is gross this part is gross hmm looks like I just killed somebody okay now we bring our whole mixture over to the stovetop and pour it into a non-stick pan but you are not going to turn the heat on yet so you're just going to begin by sprinkling six tablespoons of unflavored gelatin on top of our strawberry pur\u00e9ed mixture and once that's all added you're going to start stirring it together it might get kind of chunky but I promise once you turn on the heat all of the chunks will disintegrate and it'll all mix perfectly together so you're going to turn the stovetop on to about a medium high heat and start stirring occasionally at first but then a little bit more rapidly once the mixture starts to heat up once you cannot stir out the bubbles and the boiling you are going to remove all of it from the heat and yeah that's it once our mixture has cooled down it is time to grab our gummy bear molds you can use any silicone molds they sell them all over the place but of course I had to get some gummy bear ones and then you start spooning the mixture into the cavities it's kind of messy at first but that part doesn't really matter just as long as each cavity is filled with some of the gelatin mixture we can go ahead and grab another silicone spatula to smooth away all that excess on the top so then each gummy bear will be perfect once they've cooled alrighty I'm back I let these sit on the counter room temperature for about an hour and then I put them in the fridge to harden I actually left them in there overnight and today is reveal day so I did take a couple out but let me pop one of these guys out of the silicone mold to show you it's so easy you just push on the mold they come right out and look at that look at my little gummy bear mm-hmm dude ants little guy are so cute and little taste-test let's do it mmm these are yummy and it's crazy that they're healthy anyway I'm super happy with how these turned out oops they're super yummy I hope you guys enjoyed this recipe I had a lot of fun making it it's actually really simple and yeah so thank you so much for making healthy gummy bears with me and I'll see you guys again in another video bye I'm fully determined to catch a gummy bear in my mouth straight up and down huh okay oh okay here we go room two let's do this thing no one was there oh well what the heck was that oh no he's on my shoulder I let him anyway ready one two three aw stupid toss to the top I got it mission accomplished", "ORCdvawQ69w": "but now I hope everyone is having a good ass day today I plan to it's a shitty [ __ ] Monday and we're gonna start things off right it's about 950 in the morning and I got one of these to get me through the day this is a medicated nerds rope seriously strawberry 400 milligrams of THC this is going to be wild yo it says I like I don't show you guys the whole thing just like sharing hair I get from Cali it says da right there I'm in Maine so other side of the country I shoulda thought about the fact I have braces it doesn't feel like I should be eating it and like 10:00 in the morning but you get strong but no this is obviously gonna take a while so I'm just gonna eat this real quick for you guys and check back in later at some point I'm dropping little nerd [ __ ] everywhere [ __ ] sweet I like don't eat candy but actually not enjoying this I really don't like this it's like the Nerds of the sour pirate but I don't even think that that has any THC in it it's probably all on the gummy so [ __ ] not pleasant to eat I'm sorry [ __ ] it's so [ __ ] sugary like halfway there it's all in my teeth gonna be tasting this [ __ ] for like an hour bought some blackberry Kush mostly endicott [ __ ] within because if you guys ever wondering if I have like a strain preference I mean I guess it's based on whatever I want to do like if I had like a whole day planned out where I wanted to get stoned but I had to go do things I'd pick a sativa but what the [ __ ] but most of the time I smoked to relax so I do enjoy like in the car better more often doesn't taste like weed at all that's not what I mean when I say it tastes bad it's just so [ __ ] sweet it's like early [ __ ] I took a shot of whiskey like it was like a little bit of whiskey and like a glass of my my throat's been like getting sore if you ever like feel like your throats getting sore and you take like a shot of alcohol or something for like an hour I'll just start to feel better but so I have that like sitting in my stomach a little bit and it's [ __ ] tangent well I'm sorry I from choosing if I'm chewing my mouth or talking on my mouth shooting with my mouth open I might already be stoned I don't even know fully last little bite here the video and see how this 400 milligram edible hits me etc ear actually I miss that but I guess it's supposed to work in 60 minutes I don't think that's a hundred percent if that's not represent accurate everybody obviously everyone's metabolism is [ __ ] different through it you'll make it hopefully I'm making it I'll check that few guys in a little bit all right so checking back in with y'all it's about two hours later I'm pretty stoned but like I don't know definitely not a stone as I like thought it would be so I'm just smoking now but I don't know I'm just I'm definitely kind of time just like feeling a little more tired but it's nothing like it's nothing like too crazy rolled up a little Jay got the absinthe flavored papers but he'll be here left this the main live cards as I've showed this pen yet but it's got like a little different voltage options of warm that up this cart is some blackberry Kush hybrid mostly indica so yeah I think I told you guys fun at the end of coz oh yeah let's give it a rip should I turn it down a little bit right there to about like 2.75 and then we'll take a blinker and hey I hate it like it's so awkward because like the cart [ __ ] never like screws on to like match up with the button so like five buttons right in front the [ __ ] mouthpiece is like awkward Cheers now I'm pretty big but I want to try some [ __ ] like I want to have either like a few 500 milligram edible doses all at once I'm just see what that's like because I really want to see if y'all got if you all remember my own the first time I ever took edibles story - it was crazy we don't really know what the dosing was but there's a slight chance there might have also been acid in it which if you eat that with edibles just makes it like way more I'm trying to think of the word like it just enhances the effects of like both highs I think and but yeah I know I want to see if that was like if that was the case or if that feeling is like 1500 milligrams worth of edibles because if it is I'm trying to [ __ ] get there - yeah that was such it was a good day but it was like a terrible day at the same time cuz like I wasn't expecting it is there I don't know there were times I was like worried there's a long [ __ ] story you guys should go back and watch that video if you haven't thought was a [ __ ] it was a banger oh [ __ ] well battery's just about dead anyways plug this [ __ ] and I know I think you know this this is like a pretty decent edible for me I just I need to take more but now mm-hmm I hope you guys enjoy the video I'm definitely gonna be takin I'll do a video of me taking a shitload more edibles um have like a big-ass me I'll have like a bunch of different [ __ ] to eat drinks it's actually a dope idea anything but no drop a like if you guys enjoyed the video comment and favorite way to smoke away smoking from state country whatever but yeah stay lifted everybody have a good a stay in peace y'all", "SBiNwQibNzQ": "we're outside of dispenser here in illinois and we're actually going to be approaching people to let them try delta 8

guys! Welcome back to Led Fit. I'm Serein, half of Led Fit. Chris is the other half and he's behind the camera today filming. Today's video is all about how to make sugar free gummy bears. These are a great high protein snack to take with you to the movies,\non the go, for your kids. This is gonna be really easy to do and depending on the fruit juice you use, or depending on your flavoring, you can essentially\nmake this as zero sugar and low carb as you would like. This is also a great\nreplacement for your kids. If you're trying to wing\nthem off of refined sugars, at least you can replace the juice with a all natural fruit juice and at least this way they're\ngetting the antioxidants and a natural sugar\nversus a refined sugar. So let's start with what\nyou're going to need to create this recipe. You're gonna need some\nsort of a silicone mold. I got this from Amazon. It was relatively affordable\nfor a pack of three and then the little dropper\nto dispense this in. I will link the ones I purchased\nin the description box, but you can get whatever\nmold that you want as long as it's silicone\nso that it pops out easily. Then you're gonna want,\nof course, some gelatin. I do eat meat, so I have regular gelatin. It's pure protein. I bought the large box because you're gonna\nneed quite a bit of this. If you buy the normal four pack envelopes, you're gonna use the entire\nbox for one cup of liquid. We're gonna want some sort of\na juice or water, something. Um, I have these Tohi Aronia berry drinks. These have no added sugars. Aronia berry is very\nsimilar to the Acai berry but has more antioxidants. A total of 12 grams of carbohydrates for an entire can. If you're sticking to a\nstrick ketogenic diet, then I would say, don't use this, use a sugar free Gatorade, a sugar free juice that you can find in\nyour local grocery store. Because I did do a test\nrun of these gummies, and they were actually quite fun and chewy and gummy-like\nand perfectly shaped. I did feel like I was missing\na little bit of that sweet and tart factor, so I went and picked up the vitamin strawberry watermelon\nliquid water enhancer with Vitamins B3, B6, and B12. This has no added sugars. There are some sugar alcohols in this, so it depends on how your\nbody reacts to sugar alcohols. Again, avoid maltodextrin. Or you can of course\nuse a liquid monkfruit or a monkfruit type of powder because we are gonna heat everything up. So that's everything you're gonna need and of course a measuring cup. You're gonna want one cup of liquid and I'm gonna use the rest of\nthis berry juice that I have. And then I'm gonna pop\nopen the second can. (can opening) (background music) (liquid pouring) Now I'm gonna add a couple drops of this strawberry\nwatermelon vitamin situation. (background instrumentals) Taste it and make sure\nit's the right sweetness. So, I'm gonna stir it up and taste it. (fork hitting glass) That definitely helped with the sweetness so I'm gonna add a little bit more. (fork hitting glass) And remember when you add the gelatin it's gonna dilute the flavor a little bit, so you do want it a little\nbit more tart and sweet. Heat up your liquid. You don't want it to boil but you definitely want\nit to be hot enough so that the gelatin\ndissolve in this mixture. (liquid pouring) (fire flame crackling) So I'm just gonna let that heat up while I measure out the gelatin. For one cup of liquid, you're gonna want 30 grams of gelatin. It's better to have a little\nbit more than a little bit less because you want it to be nice and firm and sturdy as a gummy bear. So now that the liquid is heated, I'm gonna pour it back\ninto my measuring cup just cause I prefer it this way. (liquid pouring) And then we're gonna add in the gelatin. So we're adding in a little\nbit over 30 grams of gelatin per one cup. (paper crinkling) (paper taring) (paper crinkling) (background music) Then you're gonna wanna\nmix this up really well. I like to use a fork. (fork hitting glass) Now for the fun part, and this\nis very therapeutic for me. You're going to take this little dropper and you're going to fill\neach of these little gummies. (background instrumental beats) (background instrumental beats) I always have a little bit of liquid left. I'm just gonna pour it\ninto a glass container and then you can cut it out. - -want these in the fridge. You want to let them sit\nfor at least 20-30 minutes in the fridge and then\nyou can pop them out. And a good tip is to not have\nthem sit in direct sunlight once they're done, they will melt in heat. They do last, like\nthrowing them in your bag and kind of going about your day. Just keep them out of direct sunlight and like very hot situations. But we'll be right back in\nabout 30 minutes for me, two seconds for you, to see the final results. And we're ready to check\nout all the gummies. So cute. So it's been a little over 30 minutes and the gummies should be all set now. With the silicone molds they're really easy to just pop right out. And look how cute they are! (background instruments) Definitely much more flavorful. There's a nice little tartness to it. (background instruments) And it's quite sweet. I really like them. So all you have to do is pop them out, put them in a container or a zip lock bag or some sort of a bag. Keep them in the fridge when\nyou're not gonna eat them, but you can take them on the go. Super good, super easy. Way healthier than conventional gummies. So I hope you guys enjoyed today's video. If you did, don't forget\nto give it a thumbs up.

guys welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on this review we are taking you look at a new brand something we've never looked at before first time I've ever seen these guys we are taking a look at high five high fidelity HiFi I don't think it's high fidelity but it's just as high five high five they're medical cannabis chocolate bar milk chocolate 200 milligrams of THC on the back we've got our calories and nutrition information which I always like to see it does say that this product is lab tested but I don't think that they let us know what lab tests them which is always a little disconcerting but pretty basic packaging there I don't know anything about this product the budtender didn't really know anything about it either so I'm going in completely blind here on this high Phi bar check out this little pineapple decals we got back there aren't those cool as hell don't know why I'd let you know but you know we're always we're always changing up the wheats wheats HQ here and I thought I'd just fill you in on some of the little details how great is that okay so here we go second layer packaging you can see the cannabis leaf on these thing they're solvent free distill it I guess maybe it's made from rosin whatever it is it's whatever kind of concentrate they use they'd aren't using solvents warning contains milk and soy okay all right so let's open it up and give it a taste and again this is 200 milligrams of THC or so they say and it cost me $16 at the dispensary that I picked it up from so about in line with you know maybe a little bit cheaper than a chocolate bar normally is for 200 milligram but we'll see if it's as good as say like a ki Babar got it alright and there we've got our very basic looking chocolate bar with our hi Philo go up and down the the row go the row and or the column rather and let's give it a taste test [Music] good good chocolate I like the chocolate um yeah no real cannabis taste at all I don't think there's any cannabis taste whatsoever not really I'm not the most discerning cannabis taster but I know some out there are more receptive towards taste but nothing really here I'm just good tasting chocolate so on the taste front really good but on the more important front how [ __ ] up is it gonna get me for that guys you'll let the wait a couple seconds me on the other hand I'm gonna wait two hours and I'm gonna come back to you and let you know how exactly I'm feeling then so thanks for watching weights and I'll see you in just a couple seconds peace [Music] alright guys well it's been two hours since I had the high-five milk chocolate 200 milligram bar and I like it I like it uh quite a bit um I'd say I'm at about a six right now it's not not crazy high but I'm definitely feeling it feeling at a good level not too high not wishing I was higher and I really like the chocolate in here um it was a good good creamy milk chocolate a good taste nice and sweet and and the price was right at 15 bucks for this candy bar a little bit cheaper than like the kiva bars didn't get me quite as high as it keep a bar but in terms of and it's not quite as tasty as a kippah bar but the chocolate is good the highest good and the price is right so that's a successful first look at the hi-fi medical cannabis chocolate bar if you see it at a dispensary near you and you like the chocolate bars good and pick one up I think you'll be I think you'll be pleased that you did alright guys well that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you

Gupta I can give you medical advice or supplemental health advice but the differences are is full spectrum and isolate based the next large difference is is where the gummies are infused or whether they are coated some people use these terms not properly because they think that if it's infused with CBD that it is just CBD is on there so there's two ways of getting CBD within the gummies you can either coat them or you can actually infuse them to where it's like I like to compare to donut so I mean who doesn't love donuts coated gummy is like a glazed doughnut sort of flavoring and stuff it's put on the top and that's how those gummies are made is that they're made and they are basically sprayed or soaked with the CBD solutions and they get absorbed into the gummy and they're on the outside to infuse gummies they're more like a jelly doughnut to where the solution is on the inside the oil is on the inside and they've been either injected or it's been formulated into the actual compound of manufacturing the gelatin or the building block of the gummies so that is another key difference and between that people say were some of pluses and minuses pluses and minuses are as generally the ones that are coded on the outside those are generally less expensive so they're more budget-friendly however the ones are injected are usually a little bit more consistent so if you're buying a jar of 1500 milligram coated gummies some gummies might be a little bit stronger than the other depending on how they record or if they're touching the edges of the jar and some of the CBD mighta came off and beyond the jar so you might have to take one two more of the coded gummies - whereas some of them might be a little bit stronger so they kind of average out but if you're looking for super consistency then you want the infused got me the jelly donut because that is basically an exact amount that they put into the gummy so now with these examples let's go into you know what different types of gummies there are so outside of the full spectrum and isolate gummies and the coated and infused gummies now you have gummies in the categories of even flavoring so here we have our CBD Gold Line let's take a look at this half of the product line right here so here is basically our offering of CBD Gold Line now these are actually all isolate based gummies so these will have absolutely no traces of THC they have they have basically a total amount of milligrams that you will get per jar and we recommend that you take two to three gummies per serving so we have different textures for gummies our first one here is going to be our sour gummy which is going to be like I said these ones are an isolate based so they're gonna be the zero TAC you're gonna go ahead and open it here so these are gonna be like sour flavored gummies and they are coated with our Goldline CBD solution very clean job of openness let's get close-ups here you get several different colors and these are gonna be more sour and taste you're also gonna have a little outside sugar coating for a little bit of a little bit of extra flavor let's go ahead and take one out and get a real nice close-up if you're into the sour taste not just kind of a plain fruity taste this will definitely be up your Avenue and also sometimes the sour taste can offset any taste within to come with the CBD oils so even when you're dealing with full spectrum gummies and things like that if you have a sour bass gummy it can offset any type of you say I don't like the taste of natural CBD oil there's CBD solutions then a sour gummy might be or a sugar-coated gummy might be a good alternative for you to offset some of that taste so you get a more pleasant experience of Wired having your CBD then you have your natural gummy which is basically plain fruity flavor a lot of companies just in making gummies that aren't CBD infused make very similar gummies that your the taste will be familiar from any of the Albanese gummies and things that you can get from the supermarket except they have the added CBD and these have been coated not infused and they use isolates they have zero THC every once a while different isolate gummies have different solutions every once in a while you might get some type of you might think it's sugar it's crystal but actually the CBD isolates come in the form of CBD crystals so every once awhile it might not be uncommon to see crystals on the gummies it might not have gotten fully absorbed into the gummy or that might be on the outside when the CBDs are a hundred percent pure that they're like isolates it's not uncommon to see some crystals I don't see any on this gummy so everything was good but these are generally big fruity flavored gummies so they're there Jim a little bit more fluffy they have the fruity taste these aren't gonna be the sour gummies so let's go ahead and put this back and move along so on Goldline CBD we generally sell the gummies in two sizes we have a 12 ounce and an 8 ounce and also some smaller assortments generally it's you know more value driven to buy more but we have all the way down to I think 10 or 20 pack that you can buy or even a 5 pack that you can purchase on the website just a sample the gummy to see if you like it and then once you're a go we do all kinds of bundles and you can go up to 12 ounce which contains I think about a hundred and twenty gummies so here we did a limited run for the holiday season these are of our holiday gummies on top of being the large fluffier gummies and being you know of holiday colors which is a red white and green over here these are actually uh flavored also so they're gonna have the different a little bit more added fruity flavor into them so it is a little bit more of a premium gummy than your standard base gummy bears that uh that are used so it's gonna be a little bit of an upgrade but you're not gonna get any of the sour taste so you know what a lot of people and a lot of companies even outside of ours will do is they'll use different types of flavored gummies as their base so you can kind of know what gummy bears from going to the supermarket that you like or what type of tools you like when you're selecting your ideal CBD gummy and I hope it's a gold line but in the event that it's not look for that too when you're on the hunt for buying your gummies let's go a little close-up of these guys so you can see we have the red green and white give me a thumbs up that you got a good focus and other gummies so there you see we have the nicest Ortman they're a little bit fluffier in texture and they also have the added flavor infusion so you're gonna have a very flavorful experience with these holiday gummies and they're still available on our website I think for the whole month of January we continued producing them and once that goes away we'll probably still offer these gummies but they're not going to be holiday oriented maybe some Valentine's Day gummies so now moving right along to our full spectrum gummies these use a high quality of full spectrum oil and on top of that they are actually infused so they are injected into the gummy so each time you get a gummy these that we have here available in four flavors you're gonna get a very consistent 10 milligrams of CBD in each gummy now we used to offer a 25 milligram full spectrum going but a lot of people especially when it comes to full spectrum you can actually taste the CBD oil so taste a little bit more like a medical gummy so there's different things that you have to do to the gummy to offset the taste some people are really into it like the Colorado and California style gummies and that's kind of what it tastes like and some people would rather just have you know a flavorful experience as well so what we did was we realized is that instead of offering a 25 milligram gummy let's kick it down to a 10 so some of the oil taste is not as prevalent and we also have poor flavor so we flavor and fuse the gummies on top of it so let's go ahead and get a close-up of what's available here so we have cherry flavor fruit punch and also strawberry and an orange citrus I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to lay each one of these out here on the table so you can see they're actually fruit shaped and the different flavor is actually indicated by the different color these are really nice gummy very high qualities of very high quality full spectrum oil and they are also quality infused so you have very consistent flavoring taste and CBD oil quantity in between each one of these gummies and again like I said you can get them available in the four different flavors yeah so like we said these will actually be below the point three legal limit for according to the the hemp farm bill passed in 2018 so these are in accordance with that however they might have little traces of THC within the legal hemp limits but they're there is that there is that so people who don't want to roll the dice to get you know drug tested and things like that then generally you want to stick with the isolate based product because there is zero THC in there whatsoever those could be within the legal limits see would be fine and it's still very very small almost non-traceable but we do have to put that out there for you guys then there's also gummies that we're developing that are almost like gushers to where there are very soft and heavily infused with flavor so it's kind of like they melt in your mouth and then they have the the the flavor follows up afterwards and rolls them so it's different from kind of a chewable gummy this is this is an extremely soft chew if we could even classify that but I would say it to a gusher and we have them infused I just want to go ahead and show these because some companies I've seen are doing it we're gonna start offering it but we have not yet so these are in the shape of bear but they're extremely soft very fluffy and almost melts I even feel bad putting them putting them out here but they are and they are actually they're full-spectrum and they're infused we have some of these samples are 25 milligrams all the way down to 10 but you can see that these are more than fusion style soft to customized gummies tour these these gummy bases are actually custom made to really melt so these ones are gonna be more like a gusher and generally you can tell from how fluffy and how soft they look and if you get a real good close-up there you can you can see the difference between that and even a fluffy standard gummy you know so again those would be full-spectrum and infused and then for those people who are looking for positive hemp benefits possibly a multivitamin I've also seen we don't currently offer them but hemp will extract gummy chews that you can see here these actually have hemp oil they're CBD content isn't really confirmed but it does have 20 milligrams of a hemp extract and it's also infused with like a multivitamin tour it has like your vaults a mitten or a vitamin b-complex and also your vitamin C's and different vitamin E so if you're just looking for like a nutritional supplement and don't necessarily want CBD we don't offer it but these are starting to get really popular within the hemp community and something you probably will come across most of these because they also have the multivitamin they're not going to be coated they're gonna be infused so they are gonna be very consistent to take on a daily basis you won't each one is gonna be very consistent to the other and again sometimes with the coated stuff some of them might be a little bit strong and others but generally averaged out pretty good so in summary I hope that today's

food reviews today we have very excited about this or one of those is very we stumbled across a new energy drink in tea nutrition in Liverpool it's by commonly called Rennsport reps Awards I believe it's American yeah called Ray's energy now we came across this last week yes sir last week and we we did try sorry we didn't show you but we did try a frosted Frost watermelon flavor watermelon Frost I think it's watermelon for us and then we saw this flavor which is sour gummy worms now for those who don't know Sean Sean is a very big fan of the sour gummy worm sweets I'm a big fan so or anything pretty much yeah yeah I think you touched in previous videos that you really like the rock star super sours and stuff like that yeah the bubble bursts the other day so raised energy this is 300 milligrams of caffeine in the whole town there's no beat it's got BCA amino acids no sugar and as they say on the can't no crash so we're pretty confident this is completely directed towards the fitness market as well as being found in tea nutrition yeah and it's it's made by a supplement company young rap sports I've never had any any supplements or pre workouts from them before yeah but yes it's definitely formulated more like a pre-workout than an energy drink to the point where they went when when they say 300 milligrams of caffeine they're using to chemically different forms of caffeine they use in caffeine anhydrous which is the normal caffeine that you'll find in most energy drinks which is just essentially pure caffeine nice to your upper inner yeah so and they're also using Fein citrate which from what I've read online it's quicker it gets into your bloodstream quicker than caffeine anhydrous because it's say oh sorry that's the one to give you the initial boost and the other one is to prolong yeah I mean I think the idea is that if the caffeine gets into your system quicker and you saw you saw got a caffeine citrate which is like a salts of caffeine and sort of getting in there quicker and then the sort of normal caffeine or sort of level out that crash that you'd normally get if you have a lot of it hitting you at once and a normal pre-workout yeah well like some pre workouts not not all of them actually even have different types of caffeine yeah I think the the only one off the top mad is that rich Piana one that I can't remember what he calls it that it's got like five different forms of caffeine oh boy yeah tea nutrition you see it was my girlfriend who went to buy this one for us after we tried the watermelon one they told her in the shop that the caffeine citrate apps slower than the caffeine anhydrous so that would so you've got the normal caffeine getting in and then the caffeine citrate getting in slower and leveling out the crush which I think in terms of having no crush that actually makes more sense that that's how it be or from what I've read online it actually acts quicker than normal caffeine so it'd be the normal caffeine the sort of levels of the crash also worth noting is when it says 300 milligrams it's got 150 milligrams of each and the caffeine citrate is actually only about 50% caffeine by weight which means 50% of that hundred and 50 milligrams that's caffeine citrate isn't actually caffeine so if you comparing this to just a normal energy drink to the best of my understanding because it's not completely transparent how though their way in the caffeine book to the best of my understanding this actually will only have two hundred and twenty five milligrams of actual caffeine so they come then it's a textured camp it's not price marked well we know paid to pound fifty two pound fifty Lucca which is something from America is very good yeah it's not bad at all right well should we open it up and see what it's like yeah definitely so with what I said a second ago about to only having two hundred and twenty-five milligrams that's still more than any other energy drink you'll see in any news agents or anything and it is even even so it's twenty-five milligrams more than leaves the rock star when we did not so long ago yeah exactly and that's like the the highest one you'll see in the show also it's a slightly smaller can so per hundred mil it's gonna be an even higher concentration than that so it's a sixth American 16 ounce can four hundred and seventy three mil so whatever 27 mil is worth yeah Cheers so it's clear it was clear smells like sprite yeah that's I was thinking about what it okay yeah smells like sprite zero not getting much sour he does taste a lot like sprite mmm it's I think it is a bit sharper than sprite it's not it's not sour sour but it is sort of more sour than sprite does taste a bit like sweets though yeah it's got a more sort of candied taste yeah but you something you looks back when it's you know the flavor is named after for sweets yeah if I wouldn't say it tastes like sour gummy worms what I would say is if if coca-cola made a sprite flavored sweet ass our sprite you know why you get those sour Cola bottles if you made sour Cola bottles but so a sprite flavour and then made a drink that was sour sprite Cola bottle flavor yeah that's what that's like yeah now when we tried be watermelon frost flavor the other week it was wasn't long after I'd actually finished a 10-hour shift from 6:00 in the morning and wasn't at my peak performance levels we could say not long after drinking even half a cannabis I was back ambolyn I think that was that's quite fair to say in it mm-hmm this flavor is really nice yes when I smelt it me tastes like sprite when I tasted it I thought that tastes like kind of like sprite I thought that's a bit of a disappointment but I've been a couple more sips of it yeah and into it another if if sprite tasted more like this I'd drink sprite a lot more often it's so it's really nice yeah I think this would be maybe not every day but a very nice alternative like maybe once or twice a week to replace a pre-workout mm-hmm maybe very nice one makers sometimes unless you switch it up your pre-workout route to you every day you know where you've got two or three on the go and open you can get pretty or in currently sometimes and I know you obviously lose that that kick I know we've had we believe in switching a lot don't we because we feel like we get a better return from our workouts if we change pre-workouts yeah every so many days instead of having the same one every day you don't get that so we feel like we lose that balls don't work because you just get used to the amount of caffeine in it yeah so so I'm still a nice carbonated drink like that or lightly carbonated yeah so in assert something worth noting is it's not a heavily carbonated it is clear quite smooth it would be actually a nice alternative if you did yeah if you would do if you're working out everyday money to broaden you would you know Tuesday on a Thursday I think like in between a week pre-workout depending on what your routine is then I think that would be really good mmm I think the one more thing worth noticing before we record worth noting before we wrap it up there's this this can is has a matte finish on it apart from these textured pieces here which are a bit more glossy but having the the contrast it feels nice in your hands so if you're gonna feels like a grip yeah if you grab this from the fridge and walk to work the matte part so they can feel nice and the textured parts are nice and tactile it's just quite pleasing I feel quite happy called in Isis it's nicer than what if you get a normal kind of coke or something from the fridge and it's covered in condensation is slipping out your fingers when you're trying to walk to work or what up here it's it's just a bit more pleasing to hold I think for whatever does with I'll probably get some of them and keep them in the fridge yeah very impressed with raise the raise energy from wrap sports like we said if you are if you do exercise a lot i 100% recommend switching pretty workout routine occasionally and having one of these or even if you just have in a really bad grubby day yeah Oakey Oaks definitely something you it'll pick you up as I found after a work the shift just just the other week so yeah I probably wouldn't recommend having it so late in the day no of it after a late night absolutely yeah yeah okay yeah you've said everything you want to say you're impressed with that yeah okay well thanks very much for joining us guys and we'll see you next time yes", "tQvZcmtJXUg": "look at that you guys perfectly made 400 milligram chocolate bar recently i've really gotten into making my own edibles from concentrates i've gotten from the dispensary you guys have been asking me to make youtube videos about some of the recipes i've made so today i'm going to show you the easiest one i've learned so far today we're going to be making medicated chocolate bars it's extremely simple and that's why i wanted to show you this method first all you're going to need is a chocolate of your choice mct oil or coconut oil and either distillate or rso today i'm going to be using distillate but both will work the same for this recipe you can use any form of extract as long as it's been decarb some equipment you'll need is a heat safe bowl a pot a rubber spatula a pyrex measuring cup some measuring utensils a plastic syringe you can find these in most pharmacies and then you'll need a mold for the chocolates if you don't want to do bars you can do molds that look like anything you want there's stars there's bears you can really get creative now the amount of chocolate you use depends on how potent you want your chocolate bars to be the more chocolate you use the less potent your edible will be today i'm using a granite distillate that has about 830 milligrams of thc in it and i'm going to be making two chocolate bars so each chocolate bar is going to have about 400 milligrams of thc i'll explain how to calculate how potent your edibles are a little bit later on in the video but for now let's get started making our edibles first thing to do is fill your pyrex measuring cup with water and put it in the microwave for about two minutes after that two minutes is done take out your now hot water and drop your syringe of distillate in that water this is to make the distillate more of a liquidy consistency so it's easier to mix in with the chocolate you do not want to skip this step distillate is very thick if it's just been sitting in room temperature but now we're going to set up our double boiler by getting a pot with a little bit of water not too much you don't want the water to be above where the bottom of the bowl is going to be sitting on top of it bring that pot to a boil then turn it to low while topping it with your heat safe bowl the heat from the steam is going to be our heat source and now we're going to add just under a teaspoon of mct oil mct oil or coconut oil supposedly helps speed up the digestion process of an edible allowing you to feel the full effects quicker you let the mct oil sit for about a minute let it get nice and warm before you add your distillate and now we're going to take that distillate out of the water and pour it into the bowl just look how easy it is to squeeze out of the syringe it's going to mix perfectly now stir the distillate with the mct oil let it all get mixed together and now we're gonna add our chocolate i'm using just under two and a half ounces of milk chocolate here it melts easier if you break it up a little bit mix it while it's melting and make sure your stove is on the lowest possible temperature you do not want to burn the chocolate keep stirring until it's liquidy and now we're going to fill our syringe and transfer the chocolate into the molds you don't need the syringe but the syringe makes it a much cleaner process and since the chocolate is medicated i want to waste as little of it as possible so i feel like the syringe really helps with that this process takes a minute but the result is worth it i put a little cutting board under the mold to help them keep flat this especially helps when you're transferring them into the fridge and make sure the molds are filled completely nobody wants airy chocolate you can bag and shake the molds a little bit to help everything even out once the molds are filled you want to put them in the fridge for 30 minutes after that 30 minutes you want to transfer them to the freezer for about another hour and now it's time to enjoy got my molds fresh out of the freezer right here you guys gonna show you how good these look don't want to break it it's nice and frozen so typically they're not going to break on you oh yeah look at that you guys perfectly made 400 milligram chocolate bar bust out the second one oh yeah holy crap you guys that looks like a professional chocolate bar my plan is to cut these in half to their 200 milligram squares i feel like that's a little bit more of a realistic dose i've done this before and gotten a little bit more creative this is like a cookies and cream bar i used white chocolate and oreos since i used oreos i had to use a little bit less chocolate so i used about two ounces of chocolate to get two chocolate bars here's another one i've done where i added marshmallow and graham crackers to it so it's like a medicated s'mores bar all of these chocolate parts were made from the same strain with the same batch of distillate and the same amount so in theory each chocolate bar should have the same amount of potency and that's kind of what i was shooting for here i just wanted a bunch of different chocolate bars that i all knew were the same potency if you use two different types of distillate or rso and another one one might hit you a little bit harder than the other but since these were all made with the same amount the same strain from the same batch they should be a very consistent high and the reason why i like these little squares is i feel like it makes it easier to dose out a lower dose if a chocolate square like this has nine little chocolate squares in it and has 215 milligrams it should be somewhere between 20 to 23 milligrams per chocolate so i can either have like nine doses of 23 milligrams or an entire dose of about 200. it's super easy to find out how many milligrams of thc is in your edibles it just takes a little bit of math and a little bit of knowledge all you need to know is the amount of product you put in it and the total thc of that product if you're using a gram of distillate that has 80 thc it has 800 milligrams of thc in that gram if you're using 2 grams of distillate that has 80 thc there's 1600 milligrams in that batch so once you find the total thc in your batch just divide that number by the amount of treats you made so if you use 800 milligrams of thc in that batch and you got 20 candies each candy is going to be roughly 40 milligrams of thc this concentrate i was using had 83 percent thc in it so it has about 830 milligrams of thc in the gram personally i like to take a couple milligrams off my dose because i feel like not all of it makes it from the bowl into the edible so that's why i consider these bars 400 milligrams instead of i hope you learned something about edibles and i hope this maybe even inspired you to make your own it's super simple and all edible recipes are pretty easy if you can bake or cook you can probably make edibles and let me know if you guys want to see more edible videos

sugar-free energy drink yeah it's getting to be a bit of a trend yeah well the sugar-free ones are better than salt sugar ones yeah and we we get through them yeah through them anyway so why yeah something we drink anyway so we might as well review them we don't know how many people care but you know well we enjoy doing it so it's like might as well review them yeah yes so I call the diary if anything else you know if nothing else rather little fancier so I'm wit known for drinking too many energy dreams we can show them what we do can just show that to the GP testing I can sale if you see my youtube channel we've got McDonald's and caffeine on that it's great so this one is called 3d it's from America we picked this up from T nutrition envelope oh yeah it was to power 15 like what about previous ones the N raise the raise was together and apart from that oh and it's got 200 milligrams of caffeine bigger than normal but not as much as the Rays yeah a path through that we pretty much know nothing about it yeah doesn't even have a flavor on the cam know that the the cans don't come in flavors they come in just different colors so this is this is the lime green flavor yeah which might hints what flavor it is yeah I don't know I think at any time I've been in or tissues been in all the staff know all the drinks that they stock and they they know all the flavors so just ask them like what his green flavor and I think they said I think they said lime while they don't kids like yeah they think it's lying floor we'll see if we feed kids line there's I think there's a purple one there's a red one and there's different colors and they're different flavors yeah so a few headlines on this it was sugar-free as I said yeah if Dean color is yeah includes electrolytes yeah moons lore as well yeah caught into the ingredient chest got potassium and sodium chloride Ian so presumably that's some specific ideal amount of electrolytes but yeah yes standard sort of energy drink that it's a slightly small account with it being American it's the employer Dallas's 403 mil and it's got more caffeine so it's yeah 200 milligrams caffeine as opposed to 160 which is ordinary for a 500 mil kallithea 2 milligrams per hundred in the UK yeah yeah every time we open one and it sounds rubbish on this one oh yeah in the pandas ah he's nice it's nice sort of it's yeah it's plain cotton it's got black black lettering black info obviously a black and white barcode he's got a black flat top to it there so let's hope this kind of they're like that so you can see it and we can get a thumbnail and we can smile they'll be nice yeah yeah we haven't always with beautiful thumbnails smells citrusy it looks yeah yeah it just looks like slightly cloudy so yes it's like not the glasses is it the center in this quality yeah that's interesting so usually the ones you get from like a supplement shop like the Rays or even just any sort of pre workout or supplement type energy drink as opposed to the sort of regular and once the sort stuff that's this is quite often clear it's not it's not you know we call it I don't know if that's artificial and natural colors in there it's nice you know yeah you know I'll have a look after I've tasted it because I'm too tired to be able to read that properly nice is a line oh that's that not massively overpowering very refreshing yeah that's so it's not a very sharp line flavor like the Roses lime cordial or something like that like a lot of time you get a line puffiness it's very muted but this has a very distinct sharp yeah that tastes thrilling it's really nice not overly carbonated no yeah it seems it is carbonated but it seems quite a light carbonation definitely yeah it's not like some of the ones you fabulous like it's not even fizzy it's definitely fizzy but it's not like it doesn't something Joseph isn't yeah it doesn't seem really gassy yeah if that makes sense no it's nice to pound 50 to come nice though four-point 200 milligrams of caffeine 2.50 you can worth trying all the flavors at least once I'd say but yeah when we've already got a review of the raised watermelon on YouTube for that being the same price from the same shop in the same size count but with more caffeine this does taste nice number you see other BCAAs yeah personally I'm not too concerned about that yeah but I mean in principle it's giving you more from from the camp I would probably not get this again purely because I think the raise is just better like there you get more yeah like 400 milligrams of caffeine and that's without BCAAs value potentially be in a pre-workout yeah however someone who's obviously less tolerance of caffeine the meal you hmm this would be still a significant step up from a kind of red bull or monster yeah that raised you know could start giving them palpitations or somethin if it's someone who's not used to caffeine could just be too much caffeine that's that's almost as much caffeine is to regular cancer monster yeah someone who's not used to it that's gonna be a lot for me or you or someone actually doing a workout or something barrio drinks and if you drink on a regular basis yeah that's like if you just do yeah yeah this is probably why you served the same purpose as the race for someone who's just lost tolerance caffeine under thought the flavor is very nice I think the race for Russian it is very pleased is very clean what the come design yeah the cameras going twice it's a lot more simple than the Rays won the race one has a lot going on it's got that interesting texture that sounds kind of a nice matte finish to it but it's not like Mad Max like semi semi modern like a semi-gloss at all yes it's not no it's nice yeah I fun of it but the two-pound 50 problem take it up again yeah if it was 182 power pound approach yeah some service stations you can pick up a monster for to blood yeah so you know a problem if you lose the same crisis monster I probably picked this but if it's the same price is raised I'm probably gonna bid for raise at the time I thought I'll save you money to go a few Rockstar yes exactly yeah don't think this won't say on that No thanks very much for joining us guys it might be worth picking up because it yeah if you like it we're going to review the other flavors as well that's the other thing like this is a lime flavor I believe the red ones meant to be cherry flavor that would be much more compelling because I think cherry is probably going to taste nicer that fit for my preferences what are you doing yeah so like if that's a really nice cherry flavor like specks I'm gonna matter you know if it tastes amazing yeah so we'll have to want to see it you know what I like yeah my smile yeah okay yep thanks a lot guys see you next time", "VmYSycTuEAE": "[Music] hola mis amigos and welcome two weeks marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and today we are talking about Zen bar their strawberry waffle clone flavor I don't know much about Zen bar actually I assume it's a chocolate bar I don't really know that for sure I know it's 120 milligram edible that is flavored like a strawberry waffle cone which I don't even understand what that flavour exactly means but I am excited to try it because it does sound good okay so as you can see it's 120 milligram edible it's got this crazy packaging with this elaborate like zipper zipper like system on it to open it up this was a $10 edible so about in range for a hundred and twenty milligram edible so let's go ahead and figure out how to open this up and take a bite here okay [Music] so it tells me to well the packaging is a bit of a pain in the ass there we go there we go I got it I got it I pulled it off there pull that piece off now I assume it's ready to open we're do I have to unzip it there we go I did it and here is what the Zen bar strawberry waffle cone looks like although I feel like I still have to destroy this packaging more to actually get it open I do it I did it there it is the Zen bar very very very pink strawberry waffle cone comes in four squares has got the logo is n bar on it there let's tear off the square and give it a taste if this is the first time you've tuned into wheats the way our reviews work is I am gonna eat up this edible and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how it's hitting cuz that's the most important part of the edible review without further ado let's give it a taste okay the chocolate is not great strawberry waffle cone is an interesting flavor I did like the waffle cone chunk in there as there are waffle cone crumbs but chocolate itself is yeah it does have a pretty strong weak liver it's not terrible not dreading gagging the stem but I'm not looking forward to eating there so mixed bag but as we all know it's less about how it tastes and more about how it makes you feel and for that guys I want to come back to you in two hours to let you know how this is hitting so without I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how we're doing and thank you so much for watching wits and we will see you guys soon thank you so much back 2 weeks we are talking the self-proclaimed award-winning gourmet THC infused cannabis who is yet another company that proclaims to have won an anonymous award from somebody somewhere who knows I find that kind of irks own but you know it's a sales tactic anyways this is about as average as you get I definitely feel a little high right about in line for a hundred and twenty milligram in a bowl it's sort of I write in about a normal price for a 120 milligram in of all it tastes okay which is about average for how animals taste so the Zen bar is a perfectly fine product certainly would not win an award from weights but yeah I do I've got a couple more Zen bars to review and I'm not not looking forward to those but there's just nothing extraordinary about this it could just be this flavor I'm hoping that the other flavors are better I really actually found this just a little too cloying and sweet but uh so you know the others might be better and the potency again you know I'm pleasantly I've got a pleasant high right now which is nice for 120 milligram in a bowl so you know I don't have anything especially negative or anything especially positive to say about it if you see the Zen bar at a dispensary near you and you're looking for something with a bunch of crazy zany flavors I think they have a whole bunch maybe grab it but if you're looking for something you know in the same price range but for something a little bit more potent maybe grab like a Buddhist best if they've got it or something and that might do a little better or bang var a bang bar a chocolate bar like that but you know that are good for this review here on the wheats thank you so much for watching guys and we will check you out on the next episode peace hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment

with endurance and then we have a very long list of stimulants and nootropics or mental cognitive enhancers in two scoops you get around 400 milligrams split between caffeine and die caffeine Malley died caffeine Valley it's basically a longer lasting sustained caffeine release for the nootropics we have two grams of choline which is a very high dose we have dine amine which was a little bit reduced in this formula because we added in the Tia cream so this helps prolong caffeine half life gives you sustained energy what else did they put in there they have put in there the Tia creer he talked about and then also the huperzine a and a hundred of em CGS one other additional ingredient that you to find and make a pre white is the LP ATP so what this does increases ATP production in the system which also is good in the mega pre white as a stimulant free pre-workout to help boost energy without using stimulants so overall this is just gonna give you a synergistic effect pump power performance and long lasting energy so I have used this quite a few times one scoop 1.5 scoops and two scoops before I wanted to get on camera and tell you what I really think about the product overall if you have use mega pre black in the past you will find a longer sustained release of energy the pumps are still awesome on this with a clinical dose of six grams of l-citrulline but overall I find that my energy can last upwards whoo if you're having an 60 90 minute workout you may see it lasts another 90 minutes after or in 60 90 minutes really just depends on your personal chuckling stimulus mixed ability wise doesn't ever any issues with any of the permeable products as you can see right there so overall I'll tell it to you like this if your skin junkie two scoops rock out the clinical dosages if you're like me you like a lower stem option you can use one scoop of the mega P black one scoop of the mega pre white get all the benefits of all the pump and performance agents but get a little less on a stimulant side very flexible pre-workout product you can also use it with many other brands and their non stems so that way you need the best of both worlds now that we know about the product profile what's gone from the old what's in the new let's shut up let's get to the taste test so like I said this is kind of a blueberry lemonade spin off with a gummy bear let's see if it holds true and make a pre black with a different ingredient profile and raw actives that are flavored Cheers permeable labs and the Alliance out there so this flavor still you get that initial very strong blueberry tastes pure very tart the lemon comes in the aftertaste very minimal it's actually a little bit hard to pick up I think because of the ingredient profile in this compared to the EAA max you don't find this flavor being as potent compared to the amino acid product but overall all of the permeable products I find very enjoyable they're very dense rich flavored super enjoyable they're not ones you have to slam back and like hold your nose no not at all they take their flavoring very very seriously at this company and it shines and their protein powders aminos pre-workouts Xterra overall after using this for quite some time now about four or five uses if you're looking for a great pre-workout long sustained energy great pump give you a little bit of performance benefits in the gyms this is a very well-rounded product that will fit all those needs for even a general gym consumer a bodybuilder physique athlete whatever this fits the bill so what you're going to do hit the order link in the comment box below at the main webpage you can use Alyssa's coupon code it is a pee fit 25 that way you can support her in the company but overall very pleased with this I really think people keep taking it a step up every time they do a reformulation so hats off to them doing the research and also giving you a very well open dosed clinically dose product thanks again",

making the Huy lemon peel gummy bears this has been the biggest snack craze right now in Hawaii it's nothing new but since everybody's been home and craving all their favorite foods this has come up more than ever it's a simple recipe that you can make at home it includes the Huey the Huey is a Chinese dried salted plum you can use the Huey in the seed form or in the powder form this recipe uses the powder form this also uses lemon peel which is another Chinese dried snack and gummy bears of course now you can use any gummy snacks that taste great gushers strawberry belt peach rings anything really you can use the sauce on fruits as well it's really yummy the kids love it toss it in the freezer if you'd like make it a cool treat before I get started I'd love it if you'd subscribe to my channel by hitting that red subscribe button down below and don't forget to the notification bell so you can be updated everytime I post a new video and I post new videos every week also don't forget all the recipe instructions and ingredients are always listed in the description box below so how they might come along and let's make so many lemon peel gummy babies all right first we're going to get the lemon juice I like to use fresh lemon but if you want to use the artificial ones from the store you can roll the lemon with the palm of your hand and cut in half this will help get the lemon juice out easier then you're gonna squeeze the lemon to get the juice now I have a kabillion of different kitchen gadgets but for some reason I don't have like a regular juicer I have the full-blown juicer that you throw the whole thing in but I figure I just squeeze it here because most people don't have one anyway so if you squeeze the lemon and place your hand underneath you can catch the extra seeds that fall out if some slip away from you just make sure you get them out of a bowl when you're done [Music] next you'll take your lemon pill strips and place them into a food processor if you don't have a food processor you can use a blender we'll go ahead and grind it until you get fine pieces continue to grind it down until you get the strip's down about this size next we're gonna make the sauce take a bowl and add the lemon juice that we squeezed earlier some granulated sugar and some of the human father Meehan whey powder can be found at most grocery stores in Hawaii you can buy it online on Amazon at crack seed stores around it's pretty easy to find all these go ahead and mix that up until well combined and you're gonna go ahead and add your gummy bears toss the gummy bears in the sauce until well coated [Music] then you're gonna add the ground-up lemon-peel lastly stir it up and enjoy [Music] and that's how you make lemon lemon peel gummy bears really easy right if you try this recipe or any of my other recipes please let me know leave a comment in the comment box below what's your favorite thing to put the Himalaya powder on and until next time Hui hold thank you for watching my mom's video", "DADjyG9gOnE": "today kevin and i are going to be trying the black forest juicy bears they have juicy burst centers these are mixed fruit flavored gummy candies they were 250 at kroger and the sign on the display says that these are thick so it doesn't say that on the bag but it was on the display so they're in a resellable bag there are four flavors so that's that's everything in the bag so if you want to pick out four flavors um pick out red pink green punch uh what am i missing i don't know dark red light red i don't see a where is another light one is that a white one that looks exactly the same as that one maybe i'd need a dark red that's what i needed a dark red okay they say fat-free gluten-free colors from real sources eight pieces is 100 calories four fruity flavors we have cherry apple strawberry and pineapple these soft and delicious gummies are so juicy and so good that's because they have a delicious juicy burst center that's made with real fruit juice and colors from real sources they're also fat free and come in a variety of great fruity flavors so try our juicy gummies and delight in the magic of black forest these are manufactured by ferreira uh candy company in chicago yes they do so do you want to do uh uh cherry let's do strawberry i think it's gonna be the light one um a little liquid in there definitely strawberry it's more of a natural strawberry i love the texture of these they're very soft and a little chewy and if you wanted to you could make these last a while of course we're biting right into them because we want to try them for you but yeah these would be make great movie theater candy they will let's do the cherry except they're sticky good cherry flavor these do taste natural compared to like is it betty crocker that sells a lot of these like they'll sell trolls and yeah trolls and cars and all those i think that's betty crocker brand these do taste more natural you don't have fruit snacks or fruits fruit snacks yeah yeah i don't eat fruit snacks i don't know um these taste very very natural the ones you get in the little pockets yeah now i'm gonna go gummies and gummies these definitely taste more natural than a gummy yeah well oh yeah so i should be okay i see what you're saying so i should be comparing these to like albany okay and i'm thinking okay and i'm okay i'm literally thinking of fruit snacks okay well um because they do remind you of a fruit snack because they are so natural yes because they taste they taste more comparable to a fruit snack than they do to an all even the textures are very similar yeah yeah that's the truth then we have pineapple you really taste pineapple it's strong it's good flavor and again the textures are really good and they do give you enough of the liquid center to know that it's there yeah yeah it's not like full of liquid but there isn't there's a little touch of it this one's apple well i'm thinking like gushers that has the for the uh liquid in the middle the apple was okay that's probably my least favorite one awesome to me the flavor come at the very end yeah you got a little bit of apple yeah the apple you had to chew it for a minute and then you got it at the very end and like i said of course you could make these last for a while um i really really like these they're different than a gummy bear because the gummy bears is very chewy and almost rubbery these aren't like that these are more comparable to like a fruit snack they're they've got a little chew to them but they're hopefully they're softer so ultimately it's just a matter if you want a more candy flavor then you would want to buy like the albany yes but if you want a more natural flavor then you could buy this but they're good yeah i really do like these though i think kids will love them uh so i hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music] you", "DKyoJGC4krs": "what's going on ladies and gentlemen in YouTube I'm here to do an unboxing of cushy punch it's a cannabis infused gummy ok so at first glance you'll see that the dose is clearly stated what it's made from full-spectrum cannabis oil on the side you can see that they are allergen free and kosher so if you have a lot of dietary restrictions this might be the product for you also has ingredients organic cane sugar organic just kidding Oh probably is I don't know the whole thing is 10 doses altogether 100 milligrams and one milligram a CBD ok well let's see let's just open this bad boy up and see what we got alright oh this is upside down alright it looks like it comes in a blister pack and it is in fact 10 gummy pieces single dose is recommended as you can see this gummy does not come separated it's a little oily I'm actually getting

at bottom $20 edibles that I've split in half and like they haven't gotten me this high before a lot of $10 edibles themselves from other companies haven't gotten hi before another thing I didn't mention was the taste this actually doesn't taste too bad for being as small as it is usually the small candies taste like absolute [ __ ] this one was actually pretty good I will say I am actually very impressed because I smoke every day and this this has got me really faded you know there really isn't much else to say this product is pretty good I will be reviewing more in the future but if you want to check this out they're cushy punch calm I've got this in Southern California so yeah look forward to seeing you guys in the next one let me know in the comments why I sucked or you know just roast me for whatever let me know how I can do this [ __ ] better so I can do in the next video alright peace out guys", "osFBjWt5iG4": "hey guys so it is such a beautiful day\ntoday I think it's like 90 degrees out which is the hottest that it has been\nin a long time it is getting me all excited for summertime and all the get\ntogether 's and the parties and so in today's video I'm gonna show you how to\nmake some rummy gummy bears but as a special bonus to go hand in hand with\nrummy gummy bears I'm going to show you how to make some vodka infused gummies\nand they are delicious and they all go together they're perfect for any party\nso let's go spice things up okay so the first thing we're gonna do is get these\nlittle party cups and just put them on a pan or a tray just so it's easier to\nhall off somewhere next we're gonna get our gummies and we have three different\nkinds so of course these are the tropical gummy bears and these are lifesaver\ngummies and the flavor is basically just tangy so after we get these party cups on\nthe pan we are just going to open their little bag up and just start taking the little gummies putting them right in the party cups but\nyou don't want to fill them all the way to the brim and because your gummies\nwill expand and that fills up six I have a few more left but I promised my kids I\nwould save these for them next we are going to put the lifesaver wild berry\ncandy in the party cups and I have to tell you these all smells so good oh my\nword now you can't separate them with colors if you prefer but you really\ndon't need to and this filled up seven because\nremember you don't want to fill it up to the brim and I did have to save a few\nfor my kids so really this would probably fill up eight and this would\nprobably fill up seven for the gummies and these are the small packages but it\ndoesn't really matter and then of course we are doing the sweet tart flavor and\nnow the sweet tart flavor if you can see they kind of have a little bit of sugar\ncoating on them all they smell so good as well and then just put them in your\ncup okay so now we are gonna add our liquor to our gummies and we're gonna\nstart out with our gummy bears and our gummy bears our tropical flavors so we\nare going to do tropical flavor rum okay so you want to make sure the rum is\ncovering the gummy bears completely okay so now we're doing the wild berry\nlifesavers so I chose a blueberry vodka but you can also do the strawberry vodka or the raspberry vodka basically any berry but I chose\nblueberry and so you'll just want to pour the liquor right over the top of\nthe gummies okay so the sweet tart gummies are\nlittle tangy so I chose an orange vodka but really you can choose whatever kind\nyou want okay so now you want to put your gummies in the fridge for at least\n24 hours if you have them in longer it's good because then their bellies get\nfilled with liquor more if you don't want to know what these are these are\nmudslide pudding shots I will link the video below if you want to know how to\nmake your own all right alright guys so it has been about a day\nand a half and if you can see the gummies if you\ncan see most of the liquid is not covering them anymore\ntherefore it has gone into the gummies that is a good indicator that it is done\nand you are ready to party oh man guys can you see these I'm super\nexcited I'm gonna try all three kinds for you so first we are going to try the\nrummy gummy bears and you can just use a toothpick or you can use your fingers it\ndoesn't really matter mmm good okay so the next one we're gonna try is the\nlifesaver wild berry time so good okay now we're going to try the sweet tart\nmMmmm that one's really good but a little tang you I like that one I\nlike a mom they're so good and if you can see\nthere's just a little bit of liquor at the bottom so of course when you are\ndone eating these you can chug the liquor down and they are so good and\nyour friends will love it you will be a hit at any party I hope you guys give\nthese a try and if you have any questions just comment below and if you\nwould like to see more videos please remember to subscribe to this channel\nthank you guys so much bye and see you in the next video", "9dadHGeDI7o": "[Music] [Applause] hi guys um we're here having a little vacation and i wanted to share with you a little hack that i have um as you can hear in the background i have my twins and they're always full of energy and um a lot of play time and screaming and whatnot sometimes that could be a little stressful so um i carry these guys with me everywhere i go and i just pop one or two and then it relaxes me relaxes me but it doesn't impair me um i can still take care of my kids and do all the things i need to do so um hey someone when everybody's having a great vacation what are you doing these days [Applause] [Music] you", "uBlyb3dh02U": "good afternoon we're going to make some THC infused gummies first step is to make sure you have everything that you need out so our items are a three ounce package of unflavored jello or flavored gelatin not sugar-free I'm using two packets of unflavored as per the recipe that I posted and 2/3 cup cold water I've also got my lecithin to the side to put a little bit in because that is a nice fat protein that the THC bonds to there's a little machine that keeps it to a perfect time without having to go back and forth to the stove also has a link posted since we're doing super Lemon Haze on blue so let's again box tile I like to make sure it's very loosely powdery because it'll stick together I said it is a plant fat protein mini whisk mix all of these powders together enter water so we want to make sure that all of the gelatin is wet and separated and there are no clumps of gelatin that are still powdered the gelatin is mixed and 15 minutes has elapsed the gelatin has soaked up the water so enter the trusty little heater you turn that on I'm going to go ahead and break up the gelatin a little bit here and I'm going to wait probably about 10 minutes to come back and stir it again back quick search it's starting to look clearer for the record I'm doing blue for super-lon haze because true clear has a blue label just like I did read for indica and I did yellow for hybrid alright we're gonna let it sit another five minutes so it's been a little bit I'm gonna go with that is as clear as it needs to work because there's lecithin and it doesn't get that crystal clear like if you're doing candy but it is quite smooth quite runny I'm going to inject the super Lemon Haze truth here into it that has been so deep and warming in a cup of warm worth yeah it's tough [Music] and what i'm doing here is optional ma'am I usually pull that off but I'm going to pull some of the jello up in give it a shake and squirt that back in we all want to make the most of all of our product so I'm going to stir that in and once again I'm going to let it sit for five minutes to infuse before we put it into the molds all right we're gonna give it one more stir then because this is gelatin and not egg I'm not gonna whisk it super fast assuming it's going to stay in there [Music] smells like THC so the gummy bear molds that I put the link to hold about a milliliter you don't need to measure but they came with little droppers I'm going to hand this off to my partner because he has a much better non-payment you if you drip anything cuz it's silicone it's gonna that's basically gonna be one dose all of the little dots that end up on top of the silicone yeah kind of scrap all those at the end put them together it's almost like having an extra Bayer we use the opposite color or a different color than the jello you he's gonna go ahead and fill the rest of those up and we'll be back in a moment on to another bold [Music] we're gonna go ahead and stipple some cornstarch onto the back I put these in the freezer they've set and I've let them come back to temperature to make sure there's not a lot of moisture so this is my makeup brush there's a link to this this is the stipple the flat top that's what we're gonna stipple with so I've got cornstarch I just used the cornstarch lid they've got a little folded up foil and a paper towel in case I feel like it's getting too thick so I just went to stipple along the back of these and if you feel there's a bit much you can always go back and kind of wipe something away the nice thing about the brushes you can twist it and if you feel there's too much corn starch somewhere then you can use the edges of it so I like to know that my backs are good prior to pop them out I'm gonna pop this one out like so now gonna turn it over and show you the quick way I just stick my nail into it and pop them out and then lay them out afterwards welcome back to the final step we're going to say it's been 24 hours these will stay out overnight these have been out for 24 hours they're slightly smaller because they've now reduced down a little bit in size once they have dehydrated a bit as such I stipple them on the top with the cornstarch and I'm able to have them not to be sticky any further questions please feel free to send me a private message or post on the video however you'd like thanks", "8R4C5YZlq0c": "[Music] today we have some early treats

highly requested but i just haven't been in ketosis to be able to test it so i am going to go ahead and test my ketones now and see where i'm currently at fingers crossed finally it has been so long since i've been in ketosis so the product that i'm going to test and review is project seven so um these are the sour ones i'm also going to try the regular ones let me go over the nutrition of the [Music] the sour ones for one container it's a hundred calories zero grams of fat 39 total carbs 19 dietary fiber zero grams of protein so it does have allulose as the second ingredient so it calculates the net carbs here it says eight net carbs for the bag which is high so the ingredients are soluble corn fiber allulose cane sugar citric acid pectin lactic acid natural flavors rice flour fumeric acid sodium citrate vegetable and fruit juice for color turmeric for color and stevia let me get the other bag okay so this one is actually six net carbs these are just the plain gummy bears no sourness to it uh one bag is a hundred calories one gram of fat 36 total carbs 18 dietary fiber three grams of sugar and three grams of protein that's weird the ingredients are soluble corn fiber allulose gelatin oh it has gelatin in it gelatin pectin cane sugar citric acid malic acid natural flavors vegetable and fruit juice for color sunflower oil carnauba wax turmeric for color stevia and spirulina for color so i'll try this one first just because the sour's probably going to be more prominent so this is the yellow one hmm i don't know if that was a pineapple or something but it does have a nice flavor to it the texture is a little bit different than um regular gummy bears it's a little bit harder it's still chewy don't get me wrong but it's not like that gummy you know it's not like you really have to chew into it your teeth do kind of sink into it slowly so the texture is a little bit different than regular gummies like you can't you can't pull it you know oh that's orange that's a nice flavor i think that's because of the pectin i think that's because of the pectin um your teeth kind of sink into it they're nice though they do have a nice gummy texture to it just not quite the same texture as a regular gummy bear it's a red one the flavor is really nice it's not overpowering but it's definitely a nice little flavor it's not overly sweet too i was kind of thinking because of the um cane sugar that's in it it would be like kind of hit you in the face kind of like regular candy but it's not overly sweet it's almost like a light fruity light sweetness let me try the sour now so it's kind of lightly brushed with citric acid yeah so it's not overly sour [Applause] that's definitely sour it's not too much though sometimes when things are too sour like hurts my gland back here it's not just a little sour i would say that the sourness kind of covers up the fruity flavor though so you can't taste the fruitiness it's still there but since it was so light in the first place it's um not as prominent because the sour is more prominent the texture is exactly the same as the regular gummy bears but um it has just like that little grit to it from the citric acid from the citric acid on the outside um i like it though but i like sour so if you like sour you might or if you don't like sour you might not like this i think i'm going to finish the bag for the regular gummies because this one we might have a better chance of it not lowering my ketones so because this one um cane sugar is a little bit lower down and it's lower in carbs so i'm going to finish having this bag of the regular gummies and i'll test my ketones in an hour okay so it's been an hour since i last or so it's been an hour since i had those gummy bears so i'm gonna test my ketones now i've changed i've been uh sanding the uh cabinets outside okay so that's a bummer i was hopeful i was kind of feeling it i was feeling lethargic so i can't say i'm too surprised i'm just disappointed if you know of a good uh keto gummy let me know and i will test it in an upcoming video but that's all for this one i'll see in the next one guys [Music] you", "uiIngIkdFJw": "who it is oh it is hot

of your dispensary we are looking at today another product from MILF and cookies those big freaking lips milk and cookies edibles we are looking at there 200 milligram peanut butter cookie if you've watched weeks before you know I've reviewed several milk and cookies edibles and found them mostly to be pretty disappointing across the board I do like their [ __ ] brownie it seems to be more potent than most most seem to be lower more lower potent than advertised and they're not the cheapest this 200 milligram peanut butter cookie I believe cost me $11 which is on the higher end for a 200 milligram edible that's just like a cookie so especially at my very affordable dispensary all right without further ado let's open it up and if this is your first time joining wheats what we do is I'm gonna eat some of this cookie in front of you I'm not gonna bore you by eating the whole thing Bowie I love this cookie let you know how it tastes Leggero it smells whether it's garbage or not and then the most important part is I take a break and I come back in two hours to let you guys know how it's feeling because that's the most important part of in your review all right so without further ado here's the cookie no weed smell very basic looking peanut butter cookie I'm a fan of peanut butter cookies looks nice smells nice let's see how it tastes tastes nice hmm that's a pretty good peanut butter um crumbly a little bit on the UM a less chewy a little bit firmer but good very good I really dig it but as we all know as I said way too many times by now it's not about how it tastes it's about how it makes you feel so in about two hours guys I'm going to come back to you and let you know how we're feeling and if this is another bust missus might be it for MILF and cookies for me um it's been nothing but disappointment so far but I am hoping that the paper cookie sort of turns it around with that guys thank you for watching weeks and we'll see you in two hours thanks it's been two hours here since I had the milk and cookies 200 milligram peanut butter cookie and you know I feel a little bit I it definitely has an effect on me um I think it's actually more potent than their cereal bars which I've had of the fruity licious and god I hate saying it cocoa Luth cereal bar so that's good um but still for $11 you know it's it's a little bit expensive for what it is and I'm not as high as I am as I would be with you know some other edibles that are 200 milligrams or even less um so you've got that to take into account it does taste great though the cookie was very good I really really enjoyed the cookie um in terms of a peanut butter cookie I would eat it just as a cookie so that's this pretty high praise I would put MILF and cookies sort of right in the middle of the road of edibles in terms of taste and quality if you see it at your dispensary and Oakland cookies are cheap there stick with the brownies and peanut butter cookie avoid the cereal bars and I think you'll do okay with that guys that's gonna do it here for weeks and we will check you out on the next review thanks for watching oh wait this was to throw this at the camera that's how we do it hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "YmpPGpPUw0Q": "[Music] hi guys welcome to Diamond delight edibles if this is the first time you're joining my name is Liz and all-you-can regular guys welcome back thank you so much for your support I just popped that 10,000 market oh my god think you could not have done any of that without your support guys I really really appreciate it it just means the world to me you like me you really really like me sorry just being an ass having some fun alright so today what I'm gonna do now that I showed you how to do canna candy sugar & Canas syrup we can now make our gummies without using butter and the Gerber is an emulsifier however if you want to make them super super strong absolutely go ahead and stuff the butter back in there but this gives you far more control over how strong or weak that you would like to make them now you guys are always asking me how much milligrams etc something is and I don't generally tend to answer that very often because it is all dependent upon what you make how you make it once you're starting THC is etc so what I've done is in the description there I've included a link for the calculator that I use it's a free signup it's a little course you're more than welcome to have a look take a look at it listen to her she's really interesting and lots of information but the calculator you can use for free and that's what I use so then you can go ahead and you can make your calculations and figure out how strong etc that you want to make your candies and with this it gives you a lots of versatility so you can go all can of sugar and syrup or half-and-half which is what I'm gonna do in the recipe so I will stop babbling on now and I'm gonna get into the ingredients of course and of course what we need and then we'll put all that stuff together and make some awesome gummies there we go alright guys all right so for our new gelatin for our new gummy version here you're gonna use one box of your paper flavored jello I three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water for blooming your gelatin or what I use are these kool-aid waters so they're just flavored water so I now use these in place of water they're great because they add more flavour to it or you can kind of combine some flavors which is really cool to do so I use those things are nice they're lighter and sugar and said just adding more flavor now another thing you can do for adding flavor is juice crystals now I get these at the bulk bar and you can only get them during the summer time but I get these in all different flavors and I've got two tablespoons of those again enhancing the flavor that way if you don't want to use or have these flavors artificial flavors you can go use those which work great the other thing you're going to need is a quarter cup of your can of syrup and a quarter cup of water for our jello and then for our candy side our candy version so it's going to be like the other one where we do the cook you're going to need a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar or again you can use a full can of sorry a full cup of your can of sugar same thing with your syrup I'm using a quarter cup of canned syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup again you can go and use as much or as little of either of those as you like I like to do the half-and-half mainly for taste and not to kill people so that's my kind of my you I don't want anybody rendered completely useless and then we are going to need 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and then as well if you want to add additional colors or flavors you can add those optionally as well and as I said if you want to add your butter as well it really makes them super duper you can do that you're just going to follow exactly the same thing except the previous steps from the previous version with regards to adding the butter and the Goregaon to emulsify it now something else I wanted to say and the same thing now in this version I'm not using the clear gel however you can use the clear gel exactly the same way as you do in the previous recipe of the regular and sour gummy recipe that's a good one to follow it's the most up-to-date and gives you both those versions that you can use and that's all we need for our ingredients and now we'll get into our equipment and then we will get the best part go and we'll get all this stuff put together alright so the equipment that you're going to need just like the other recipes a double boiler I just do a makeshift I get a bowl that will make sure that your water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you will need a smaller saucepan for our candy syrup two spatulas you will need your candy thermometer and you will need a larger pot that your bought is that your saucepan small saucepan will fit into ice water water with ice in it but a little tongue-tied today and obviously your candy molds now a lot of you ask me how many candy is gum you will get out of a batch now it's all depending obviously on the size molds that you use if you use about this large size I got these from Michaels you will get about sixty if you use of this size gummy which is kind of a little bit larger than those big ones you're going to get it probably about 75 to 100 and if you use the little teeny tiny ones then you're going to get about 150 to 200 of them so that's approximately what that recipe will break down to you for you and now d'leh before we get started there is something very important that I found out from my other recipe when I started this is and I don't do this in the other recipes but when we're working with the can of sugar and the can of syrups it is a must that we oil down the sides and the insides of our pot for the candy syrup reason being when it heats up and starts boiling the oil THC oil starts to separate and it sticks to the smiths of the metal of the pot you might have noticed that if you did that with a can of syrup which is why I redid the video for that specific reason so we're going to do things a little bit differently than we do for the regular candy recipe but I'll show you all those details once we get into it but the very first thing and don't really don't want to forget is we're going to lightly grease our saucepan and hold on just couldn't dribble a little bit of oil into it and then make sure to work it all the way around make sure to get it right into the corners because anywhere that this oil is not where there's no oil your THC will sit the only thing that dissolves THC oil is oil because it is oil soluble by doing this we're going to be able to scrape anything that sticks to the sides off much much easier then seeing all your products that they're going oh what happened so you said you want to lightly grease that you don't want to have any excess oil so make sure to do that up as well as your spatulas you want to lightly oil your spatulas for the same reason when we scrape it off the sides if these are not oiled it sticks to it and it doesn't come off so you want to make sure anything that is going to be touching the THC the syrup you want to make sure that you all and that's it I'm gonna get into putting our ingredients together and get this started oh one other thing I wanted to cover is with your moles I don't spray my moles beforehand but I have found sometimes that they do stick but so what I do is I care them so I will spray them or oil them down lightly let it sit for 20 minutes in the mold and then wash them out so it still leaves that oily feel but it's not gonna leave your Piquet knees all greasy and makes it far easier for them to come as well as you only have to cure them once every few once every five or six batches or so so it lasts a long time by doing it that way all right so now I promise we'll get into the ingredients in our candy all righty so the very first thing that we are going to do is we are going to microwave our quarter cup of liquid for about 50 seconds till it's boiling and we're going to bloom our unflavored gelatin all right so you're going to evenly sprinkle your gelatin over the top of your liquid whether you use water or the kool-aid water and then you are going to stir it in now a lot of punches I explained in about whether that your gummies did not are not that they're too sticky but they're not gelatin enough that can depend a lot of power on your gelatin I just bought a batch of gelatin because I buy a bulb that didn't it wasn't blooming at the strength of it or something was not working well I did two batches and I had almost double the gelatin so a lot of it is dependent upon your gelatin now one test that I do is when I put in the three tablespoons and mix it in it should start very quickly to get the texture of apple sausage and clicking up pretty quickly now this is not so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add in another half a tablespoon of gelatin yes I've just sprinkled on another half a tablespoon and I'm gonna stir that in and now I'm getting that texture of applesauce can you kind of see what I mean that's how you know you're probably are at the great strength for your gelatin starting off if your gelatin is not right from the beginning if it's mushy I'll show you when we go to put this in but that's the texture it should be once you once we've got it mixed in now we're gonna set that aside for five minutes or so to let that bloom now meanwhile we will add our box of jell-o I'm giving the blueberries well berry blue and we are going to add in our boiling water and stir that around and get it dissolving see was it and then just keep scraping because the jello will cause the sides of the bowl are cool it's good to just kind of stick to it so just keep scraping the sides down as you go and turn your heat on to low so again we only want to melt our gelatin over a hot water bath we don't want it hot at boiling at all that's what breaks our gelatin a lot of the time is you don't even think that you've got it too hot but really past hot water probably by 150 degrees it is that's about all you need so that's that's a big mistake that a lot of people make myself included so I'm just going to continue to stir that gently until the gelatin is dissolved and then we will add in our corn syrup and our other stuff and once your gelatin and that has started to melt the sugar takes longer because the sugar melts at a higher at a bit of a higher heat so it just takes a little bit longer but once your gelatin and that is melted you can add in your corn syrup and your flavor crystals if you're wanting to add so you saw your canister your quarter cup of Kanna syrup and then your flavored juice crystals if you want to add those in as additional flavoring and again just stir that until it all starts gets incorporated and now for you guys asking for those clear gummies how do I get my gummies clear this well you can now you could have perfectly clear gummies so I'm gonna kick it continue to stir this and just gently mix it together until everything is melted and combined I'd you notice I got my nails done so for all of you those wishing that I get them done they're done and to those of you commented there you go I know I looked at the videos and thought make and those are ratty looking hands so I do apologize hopefully it'll be better from now on in the future I hope you like these a little bit better do you got a look at them for quite a long time so why not make them a little bit more attractive and also just remember to continually scrape down the sides of your bowl so that the gelatin is not sticking to the sides and just to show you this is just how hot your water should be there shouldn't be any boiling just a little bit of steam coming off of that that's as how that's as hard as you want to get it otherwise any hotter than that it's gonna break your gelatin alright so now that everything's pretty much dissolved I'm going to add in our gelatin now here's another thing if your gelatin is after 5 minutes or so blooming is mushy when you touch it then your gelatin is not strong enough so whether it's old and it's weakened or there are different gelatin with different strengths if it is nice and firm to the touch and no mushy you're good to go so I just split this up into pieces slap her in and you're just gonna let that you're just gonna gently again stir that until it completely melts and again if you start to see any kind of foaming may take it off your heat immediately it's getting too hot so I'm just gonna let them set them going to continue to stir that until my gelatin is fully melted well once your gelatin is melted and everything looks good and it is nice and translucent just set it off to the side and now we're going to start our candy syrup alright for our candy syrup in goes our half a cup of white sugar our half a cup of Candace Canon sugar our Candace syrup quarter cup a can of syrup like I said before you're more than welcome to play around with your different measurements on that as long as it equals 1/2 a cup either way it doesn't matter and our quarter cup of light corn syrup our half a cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to gently stir that till ever - your syrup till your sugar and water and everything's just combined and then once you're combined here turn your heat on to medium Cline to start and then we're going to drop it down to medium once it begins to boil and you're just going to continue stirring this make sure to get all around the edges because the sugar likes to sit there and so we're going to continue to stir this until it starts to boil now all of my and all the other candy recipes I say as soon as we start boiling we're gonna stop stirring and use our brush not in this recipe and I'll show you once it starts boiling as I said the oils yeah I got a little syrup on the burner there so the oils start to separate out with the heat and until it gets all to the same kind of temperature it will they will stick to the side so we're going to have to continually work the sides of the pot but you're going to want to be very very gentle because we don't want to spit dirt into the syrup so as I said I'll show that all to you once it gets there now you'll start to notice as as it's starting to heat up if you scrape the sides of your pot see all that that's your oil and that's what we want to make sure it gets back into our syrup so I usually have to use the two you want as I said you have to grease both spatulas here and work it off get it back into the syrup and we're gonna have to do this continuously through the whole cooking process so at anytime that you see any darkness starting to form on the side make sure to scrape it down and as your syrup gets hotter you can just put your spatula in it'll just melt it off and also make sure when you are scraping the sides of your pot hold on to the handle firmly I've done it before I wasn't paying attention and whoops and the last thing you want is molten lava being poured anywhere other keeping it in the pot so when your syrup begins to bubble starts boiling you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and remember this is normally where I say we stop stirring not this time so we're not actually going to stir it what we're gonna do is just to continually scrape around the sides of the pot but don't go deep into the syrup we just want to stay around the bubble area and you just want to keep pulling this in so this is the alcohol of the excess alcohol and stuff burning off and any impurities that are in it so see how it's gathering up on the sides that's what we want to make sure get them back into our syrup whatever is supposed to cook off will cook off whatever is good will stay in so again just gently don't go into the stirs syrup just gently keep going around the sides and you'll do behind the candy thermometer towards the end and we are going to cook our syrup - if you want a soft candy you're gonna cook it to 260 if you want a firm candy you can go as high as 280 280 is soft crack I'm gonna go to just before that I'm going to take this to 275 but you see what I mean about the oils how they just continue they'll keep going to the sides of the pot as it heats up and gets up to temperature it will it will the oils will get incorporated and once your syrup is boiling in that you want to just turn your heat down to medium just medium a little above medium I said then don't forget to get behind in behind the thermometer because it will hide in behind there I love the smell of this syrup cooking it's oh it smells so awesome oh and just as a tip for safety always have a fan either an overhead fan I've got one going or the if you've got an overhead on your stove regardless when you're ever working with tinctures even though you've working them in a dehydrated yeah most of it's cooked off some of them may not be and you just want on the safety side always have a fan going and leave don't be sparking anything up in the in the general area so you've had your gelatin sitting over on the side and you have a look and you've noticed that there's all this white inky foam stuff and you're sure positive that you didn't do it high on high heat the heat didn't get too hot that'll happen so nice if the gelatin is old and it's starting to break down so if you do see that in order to compensate for that bloom another tablespoon of unflavored gelatin and we're going to add it into the candy mixture at the end that's gonna help us compensate for the gelatin that's broken in our mixture here so that will help it so anytime that your candies come out super sticky and you can't get them out of the mold the reason is is because the gelatin is not gelling properly so there's a really handy tip there for you guys now in order to get that out because I don't want that in to go my syrup I'm gonna run this through a strainer before we put it into our syrup so now I might actually my syrup while I was babbling away there is getting close to temperature I've got my ice water ready to go and as soon as it hits temperature I'm gonna drop the bottom into the pot and once the temperature starts coming down and the cooking process is stopped I'm gonna set it to the side until the temperature comes down to 240 before we add our gelatin in just watch your thermometer till until the temperature starts coming down and your bubbles start stop bubbling and then just set it to the side and said until your temperature comes down to 240 all right so now my syrup is cooled and then it's say because I don't want that white foamy stuff into my syrup I'm going to use a strainer to pour it through that way it'll catch all the chunks of jell-o gelatin and being bad and I'm going to mix that in now I also what I did was I bloomed another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid and we're going to add that in a little bit in a little bit so right now you're going to stir your jello and your candy syrup until it is all combined and if you find that your syrup is a little too sticky and it's solidified you can put your heat on to minimum you just want to heat the bottom to get the syrup off the bottom now you can make sure that you do so that you scrape the sides and if you said if you find that it's too hard coming off turn your heat on and it'll eventually start to melt so you just want to want to keep doing that until everything is completely melted in all the same temperature all right so now that everything is all melted together and nicely mixed now this is a test that I do to determine whether my syrup is did a job correctly if I pull it up and you see how it just goes in a nice smooth syrup it doesn't really seem to start gelling or anything it stays in a fine line so that's kind of telling me that this is gonna turn out way too sticky it's gonna come out what's it like you can't get it out of the mold it's more candy than the gelatin that's what I said about my gelatin breaking there that I knew that was gonna happen so I've added it I'm gonna add in the additional gelatin that I bloomed and I'm just gonna stir that until it's completely dissolved so now if you want your syrup just translucent that nice clear there you go you've got it you can go ahead and put it into your bottles your squirt bottles or use the little eye droppers for dispensing into your molds but however I never like to keep things plain so I'm gonna do half-and-half or I've got translucent and solid and also just to give you a look to see how to go about doing that all right so now when after adding the additional gelatin in now when I do my test you'll see it's thicker and it'll start to split up and almost solidify in midair so that's how you know it's likely going to set correctly I still had to not do things correctly that's occasionally but that is a very good indication that you're safe and good to go so if you wanted translucent go ahead and put it into your bottles at this point or use your eye dropper dispensers or whatever it is that you get it into your moles however I of course need to always get fancy so I'm gonna split this into two colors so I've got half of it translucent and half of it of the solid blue whoops all right so I'm just gonna eyeball this here if you want to be exact you can pour it into a measuring cup and split it exactly however I've been doing this from this pot for quite a while so I'm pretty good at it sometimes so because I mix the blue with the green because obviously the green from our can of syrup and our sugar so it's turned out a little bit greenish and I actually want this to be blue so I'm going to add in a little bit of blue color and then on 1/2 I'm going to add in white so this one I'm mixing in a few drops of blue you can use any kind of food coloring the gel base oil-based water base for this for this particular candy recipe does not matter so we're just gonna get that stirred in oh that's a pretty color you see it on the white that's nice that's a nice kind of teal color then in my other half I'm gonna pour in some of the blue the same kind of teal but this is gonna give me the solid background as the white now if you guys have white on hand make sure that you shake it really really well if it's hot it sitting for a while it does separate and you will find that if you pour it in you're gonna get a little tiny white it doesn't go well you get little white lumps or something like that it just doesn't blend really nicely so make sure to shake it really really well you can almost hear it come back together it's like you can almost hear the water at the top and then all kind of comes together and sounds a little bit thicker so I'm gonna pour a little bit of that in isn't that pretty so again you're just gonna thoroughly mix that in until it is one complete uniform color and once I've got that i'll get it into my bottles and we'll get this into the mold there's a little trick i learned the other day find it by Occident that's on most things happen so I'm if you want to have a half and half candy where you've got the clear on the bottom and the solid on the top what you can do to easily make that happen is use your hand blender on this we whip a bunch of air into it and once you put them together the air is all I'm automatically gonna bring the solid color up to the top or if you want to do that with the if you want it the other way around then air Rach you're clear but you're gonna have to wait a while for the bubbles to come out because that's gonna make it not so clear so I recommend just putting the solid on the back you can do that it's just a quick way of doing it otherwise you have to pour one layer let it set a little bit and then pour your second layer well aren't I just a cesspool of useless information today I'm just gonna pour this into my squirt bottle this should make a full almost a full bottle or a little bit more see bang almost right on now if you guys have to haven't seen these before these are the best squirt bottles ever they just make putting it into the mould so much easier especially if you want to blend colors absolutely highly recommend these I've got there's a link for them in the description there for you to make it easy if you'd like to order them and I'm just gonna do my clear and we'll get this going all right so I said I always do two colors I always like doing that so I did combination I'll either just whoosh or if you want to happen half you can do it that way you can go this way freestyle whatever you like and that's it get them all into your mold and you're gonna put them in the fridge for a minimum of two to four hours sometimes they've got to go overnight now if you let them go overnight and they're still sticking you can't get them out of the mold put them into the freezer for a few hours let them freeze up take one mold out of it I'd add out at a time and pop them out as quickly as possible if they still if there's still stop the first you'll come out if it starts to stick throw it back in the freezer work on another mold put them into a double boiler melt them down on low heat and add another tablespoon of gelatin melt it and recast them and that will fix that problem for you and that's it enough I'll come back low will pop these out so you can have a look at them and I'll show you how to sugarcoat them not that sugarcoating is that difficult but you can coat them with the can of sugar and just show you an easy way of doing it and that'll be it will say goodbye candies upset and you can do this in a bowl or I found that doing them in a large plastic bag worked a lot easier so in this I put a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar and I put a quarter part about a quarter cup of the flavored drink crystals that I used in my recipe again the drink crystals are totally optional for you just adds that little bit extra flavor and then I added about a half a teaspoon of citric acid because I wanted these to be a little bit more on this our side if you just want to have just a little bit of a tick bite but not really sour at all I add a quarter teaspoon so I'll do those two my sweet ones and then to the sour I use a 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid I don't recommend using much more than that one it's not going to the sour flavor isn't that great and it can also melt your candies because citric acid acid is water soluble so simple enough you can actually see it oh and I also have sorry a wire a wire rack with parts line o parchment paper line line on top of it for them to dry so I just pop them out these guys are popping out nicely and I get and what I do is I do one mold at a time so I leave the rest of them in the fridge because otherwise they start to warm up and they can makes it difficult sometimes for them to come out of the mall so I just think about one at a time and once I get them on the bag I go a little bit there and I just fish them out and shake off the excess sugar and we just lay them out to dry here just like all our other candies this is just a slightly smaller mold that I use same thing now see sometimes you'll do that and you'll see you think oh no they're not gonna come out they're stuck just pull the edges away and then they just they'll just come right out now if you do that and it doesn't come out that's when you would put them into the freezer so again you see that just around the edges to pull it away and they're good to go and that's about it I'm just gonna go through and sugarcoat the rest of these guys and then I'll be back to say goodbye well guys that's my little demo there on your cannon Candace Eric and sugar gummy bears I hope you enjoyed the demo as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to ask and thank you guys so much again for your support and let's get to the 50,000 whoo all right so you have an awesome rest of your day and thanks again for watching [Music]", "e6iQWkAa9aw": "[Music] [Music] yeah what's up my peoples what is up how you doing my pretties so tonight we will be making Kenny slush y'all so yes we're back to brown liquor if you watched our previous video and if you haven't make sure you go watch it I said that I'm not really a dark liquor drinker but babies yeah he likes both but I'm gonna tell you that drink that we did last week it was so good that I have to recap what I said now I don't think I'll drink dark liquor straight you know what a chaser but in a smoothie it was it was great so tonight we'll be gonna be making steak taco okay so I'm gonna let babe pour the drink make sure you all drink responsibly we hope that you try it it's really good and we're going to tell you every ingredients that we put inside as we put it inside so right now babe is putting some mango punch from Minute Maid okay boy you trust now he's gonna put some Hennessy you got I'm gonna stop got to me stop all right I know okay I'm good okay so now we put that in already so now they've wanted to put some life savers and it's not the candy is the gummies so we're going to put that in here the flavor it up then we're gonna put some strauber and these right here the sour so I wanted to mix cuz I don't want to just put sour okay so we don't put some salad in there okay so now we're ready to blend make sure that's tight the top is nice and tight yes [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so now um test this and see if it's the right consistency that's good I don't think we need to blend anymore all the all the gummies is really mixed up in here really good okay so now we're going to take our strawberry syrup and always remember you put as much the henna scene you want to put in here as much juice it's all and what you like there's no measurements so I put some here and then I'm just gonna spin it around in a glass put some water syrup mix it around in a glass okay babe I'm gonna let you pour it about right there okay okay so now what we're gonna do is we're going to put our fruit top we have some pineapples and we have some strawberries little strawberry on the top so okay we used all the fruit so this is why we didn't put too much because we get ready to top it off your bottle Hennessy so you don't put a whole lot unless that's what you like and then we just like that somebody put it on the side they have it all right so let's taste okay mmm perfect hmm that's good [Music] [Music] there you have it so this is wine down Friday oh yeah good to go so we will see y'all next Friday or a wine down Friday well another other drink of the day this is our Hennessy slush until the next time as we always say [Music] [Music]", "1Y7hrWj9sY0": "hey everyone its James from fun foods and today I'm just going to make these Mountain Dew gummy bears now this was a request video and they turned out amazing so keep watching I'll show you step by step how to make these now the first thing we need to do in a medium pot we need to add two cups of Mountain Dew soda to it then just bring this over to the stove until it starts to boil while we're waiting for our mountain dew to start boiling get out a large pot and to that we want to add one more cup of Mountain Dew soda and then I have three of these packets of unflavored gelatin just take it out and sprinkle it on top of your Mountain Dew you don't have to mix it just sprinkle it all in there now just let that do its magic while we're waiting on our other mountain Dew to boil alright so when your Mountain Dew starts to boil we'll just turn off the heat and take it over to our work station now just pour your boiling Mountain Dew into your Mountain Dew that we poured the unflavored gelatin on and mix it in you want to mix it for about five minutes until all that unflavored gelatin has dissolved and at this stage now that all our gelatin has dissolved what I'm going to do is divide this I'm going to keep some of them this color this regular Mountain Dew yellow color and some of them I'm gonna turn green so I just want to pour some in another bowl not a lot and add a little green food coloring to it mix that up now just let these sit out for a little bit before we put them in our molds because I'm using plastic molds I don't want the heat the hot liquid to melt my plastic molds so you have to be really careful if you're using silicone molds you can put them in there right away that's fine but plastic molds be careful don't let them be too hot or they'll melt your molds now I'm going to transfer my liquid into something with a pour spout just to make it easier for me to pour them into our molds so they don't go all over the place so the little one here I'm going for the green in big one I'll pour the yellow all right so now I have my mold here and I just have this one template of little bears it's only six of them so I have this little silicone silicone mold it looks like bananas or something just use up the stuff the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna fill about half these bears with the green and then half with the yellow now hopefully I'll have just a steady hand when I'm doing the yellow we'll see and then just fill your other molds up whichever way you'd like now just take these put these in a refrigerator for a couple hours just until they set well my Mountain Dew gummy bears have been in the refrigerator setting up for about three hours I'm a bit nervous and I don't know if I used enough gelatin they are firm but not as firm as I want them to be so we're gonna try to get them out of here see if we get them out intact and that's always a challenge especially when you don't have a silicone mold so let's try this I'm gonna try with a knife gently to remove this and decapitate it the first one that's not good poor bear taste food anyway don't think it's gonna work out my friends we got to do Plan B we got to make them with more gelatin so since it didn't work out on our last attempt we're gonna try things a little different this time we're still going to start out with the saucepan and we're gonna add 2 cups of Mountain Dew soda to that bring this over to the stove and bring it to a boil while that's over on the stove boiling we have one cup of Mountain Dew in a large bowl this time I'm gonna use five of these packets of this Knox unflavored gelatin and I think that was part of the problem not all the problem but part of it I want to make it a little firmer than it was it was almost just like a jello and not like a gummy so we're gonna add five packets of this and you just sprinkle this in on top of your Mountain Dew [Music] and this time what I'm doing differently is preparing our molds a little bit different last time they didn't come out too well and of course if you have silicone molds use that because there's a lot easier but what I'm gonna do this time is I'm gonna spray this with some cooking spray gently just a little bit and then because I'm extra nervous about this is I'm going to let's wipe a little bit of the excess off it so it's a bit much not dry but just no puddles of spray now we want to take some powdered sugar or icing sugar and we just want to lightly coat this I'm just really going the extra step to make sure it doesn't stick in there now we can just fill our molds I'm gonna do three of them green three um yellow and hopefully they work out this time all right so I have pulled my gummy bears out of the refrigerator they've been in there about three and a half hours and now it's show time to see if they come out of this mold all intact I got my fingers crossed I hope it happens if not we'll have to redo this with some silicone molds so let's see how we did I'll start with the yellow one I'm just gonna kind of pull it away from the sides a little bit of my fingers before I try to pull it out hopefully that will work and see if I can kind of like push it and peel it out looks like it might work oh yes I did it so one of the other ones have come out nicely perfect well now something to taste us I'm gonna try one of the yellow gummy bears the yellow Mountain Dew gummy bears and see how taste tastes like Mountain Dew now I'm do gummy bear it's pretty good and this is the one I didn't put any food coloring in it it was just straight and Mountain Dew so really good well thanks everyone for watching I hope you enjoyed watching me make these Mountain Dew gummy bears is a lot of fun making these and thanks again for the person who suggested I make them if you have a suggestion yet you would like to see me make write it in the comment section below and hopefully I'll get around to making it also if you enjoyed this video be sure to hit that like button hit that big red subscribe button if you're not already subscribed you're gonna get a few videos a week every Saturday I do a mountain Dew video every Sunday I do my regular video every Tuesday I do a live stream and every Thursday night is a bonus video so for right now make sure you check out some of the videos I have off to the side and I will see you guys next time", "i-JX7qnWkR0": "[Music] kitty up so the ingredients that we're going to need for our gummies are pretty much the same as the original you're gonna want two packages of the um jello this is the three ounce the small box or 85 grams whatever flavor you'd like two tablespoons or two packages of unflavored gelatin so two packages of those nox unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water room temperature and a half a cup of water ice cold you have to have ice cold water to bloom gelatin we're going to want a quarter cup of light corn syrup for those of you who don't like like do not like corn syrup you can use invert sugar glucose honey or a gob you just need a syrup in there and what it does is it creates a barrier between your sugar crystals so that they don't come back together that's why it's needed some type of syrup we are going to need a quarter cup of can of butter a quarter teaspoon of citric acid a half a teaspoon of gour gum and gorgum is an emulsifier which allows us to bring oil and water together because as everybody knows they are mortal enemies so in order for them to be able to become friends you use an emulsifier and what an emulsifier will do is it takes each molecule a water molecule and an oil they go in together in a bubble and it creates a bubble around uh those two molecules so it creates its own um kind of uh it creates an emulsion that's what it does and that's what emulsion is bringing oil and water together to be a uniform liquid you cannot use xanthan gum it is not an emulsifier it is a thickener and it is a stabilizer it is not an emulsifier gum is an emulsifier a stabilizer and a thickener as well as it has a natural gummy uh texture to it which helps with your gummies and for those of you who don't use it or can't get it uh you can use soy it would be one teaspoon of soy or sunflower lecithin the other reason why i like the gourd gum is it has no flavor whereas lecithin does and i don't like the flavor less of them in substitute of water if you want to add a little bit more flavor boost you can use these kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters or basically any juice that doesn't contain real fruit if you do use a juice that has real fruit you have to use a mold inhibitor like this little the lorraine's mold inhibitor and that is a must otherwise they will go moldy in a couple of weeks then this is optional this and alcohol or um everclear the 94 alcohol or grain alcohol a really cool trick alert with this uh which you'll have to wait till the end to see it um but yeah this is an option um or if you make tincture you can use your tincture provided it is made with the high percentage alcohol it has to be the 94 ish around there for flavorings you can use the lorraine flavor oils i'm today i'm going to be making uh lemon raspberry so i'm going to start with a lemon base split it up split out half raspberry and make the other half of them and make them look all pretty gel food coloring now if you want to create a solid background white food coloring a thing with this you can only use one or two drops if you use too much your gummies will not set no matter what you can freeze them you doesn't matter what you do they will not set if you use too much very important one or two drops only and i think i've got all the ingredients here covered let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made all right so the equipment that we are going to need is basically the same as the old recipe there is one major difference we are going to throw away the immersion stick or the hand blender that apparently is a very bad thing for our gelatin so on top of creating a mountain of air bubbles so that your gummies don't turn out nice and clear it also breaks the gelatin so for any of you have this white goopy stuff on the top of your candies the silicone spatula or silicone whisk is going to resolve that issue so we're not going to use the hand blender silicone only metal will damage uh the gelatin who knew it was such a delicate little flower so silicone spatula very important silicone or a wooden spoon a little strainer or a bigger one if you've got one doesn't have a small one a small um saucepan heavy bottom is preferable and on heat transfer which means when you look at the bottom of your pot there is no discoloring um it's always one even if it is discolored in spots it means that your pot gets hotter in those particular areas and it can damage your uh your product so heavy bottom not heat transfer is the best thing to go for you of course your gummy molds these bottles are one of the best for dispersing your um dispensing your syrup into the into the molds they're by a sweet sugar bell and two reasons i like is because it uses the decorating tips which makes it nice as well as they have a very deep um lip to them whatever you call this a lip screw thing if you use the dollar store ones or ones that um have the really short short neck on them and then uh you're more likely it's the lids gonna pop off because the syrup is warm there's not a lot well the pressure on it it just pops them off so fair warning either that or um one of these candy funnels uh works great as well or the little odd dropper things that those some of those molds come with you're going to need some parchment paper and a drying rack i think i have most of the equipment covered you know me i always forget something um so let's jump right into those ingredients and let's get this made so on to making our candies so the very first thing we want to do is to bloom our gelatin so i've got my two tablespoons of gelatin here and you want to um sprinkle it onto your ice cold water and as i said for gelatin to bloom correctly water has to be i size very very very cold so we just want to sprinkle it across the top so this way it doesn't clump and then you're going to stir it into the water make sure it's well mixed in and that there's no lumps now one tip for you when you're doing this with your unflavored gelatin while you're mixing it it should start to um form into the texture of um of applesauce if it doesn't then you need to add a little bit more gelatin either your gelatin is not as strong or used a little too much water over whatever it is it's probably not going to be um quite enough so like this is just a little too soupy so i'm going to add in just a sprinkle there we go so that's more the texture that you want see like applesauce and then i usually toss mine into the fridge until i need it so i've added my um two boxes of jello to my pot already and then in goes our light corn syrup or whatever syrup you choose to use and yes you can use can of syrup and our other half a cup of water now this is one thing i learned the citric acid does not go in until the end so you never had your citric acid while you're preparing once everything's done and heated that's when you add in your citric acid the acid works like acid it melts things so it interferes with the cooking or the setting process if you add it in too early same thing if you use the cooked version make sure to only add it once you're done so once you've got your water and your corn syrup and your jello in the pot you just want to get her mixed and turn your heat onto low so we don't need to use a double board a double boiler as long as you keep it on lower minimum you're good if you start to see any white streaking take it off the heat immediately so you're just going to continue to stir this until the sugar and everything is dissolved okay so i've been stirring on low heat here for about 10 minutes we're pretty much done so you look at the bottom there and you can see it's it's nice and clear and when you stream it it looks clear so now that portion is done we are going to get our unflavored gelatin now that our jello and our corn syrup and that is done we are now turned off our heat this is when we're going to add in our citric acid uh so a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and again citric acid is what prevents your sugar from crystallizing right essentially it's an acid and it continues to melt things there is such a science and chemistry with sugar and water and acids and stuff it's like wow mind blowing so quarter teaspoon of citric acid in there give her a little gentle stir so next goes in our unflavored gelatin what i like to do is to cut it up into little squares makes it easier to melt and so we're just going to let them sit there for just a minute or so and then you just want to gently stir until your until the unflavored gelatin is all completely melted then once your gelatin is all melted and everything is a uniform color and texture that's how you know everything is melted and night skins come together everybody's being friends in the pot now we're going to add our can of butter and our gourgum so in goes our butter half a teaspoon of our gum and i use the strainer um so that it'll evenly distribute it over the uh butter um otherwise it can clump up and as well you want to make sure to sprinkle it onto the butter part and not the candy syrup because again if it hits the syrup part it'll clump the oil or the butter will make it melt it's a pretty wild uh ingredient i have to admit we're just gonna get that evenly sprinkled over our butter and we're gonna let that sit for one minute all right after it's been sitting there for about a minute we're going to start to whisk this now you don't want to go crazy whisking because as i said too hard breaks our gelatin it is going to break it a little bit but we don't want to go too gentle because we actually have to create be able to break that oil down small enough so that it can create an emulsion so it's finding that happy medium so i just kind of get it started here so we're trying to whisk with minimal air bubbles and then we have a look and take a look at the top and see if you see any kind of oil slick if you do continue to whisk it a little bit longer and then check it again if you still see some oil um coming up to the top you see some oil slicks happening we can add in a little bit more gour gum but this time you're not going to add it directly into the pot just get your bowl that your butter was in there's enough oil in there to deal with it and we're just gonna take a little bit like about an eighth of a teaspoon and you stir it into the oil into the butter it dissolves the gore gum as otherwise as i said if you just dump that in now it'll just lump up once it's dissolved into there just add it in like soup and whisk it again again have a look so here i've got some air bubbles we have a little bit of other gelatin broken a little bit but nowhere near like when we use the um the uh pan blender much nicer so now that we have this as our base here now is when we can add our flavors and our color so this said i wanted to do lemon raspberry so i'm going to split this off to half about right so for this side i'm going to add just a little bit more lemon and to this side i'm going to add in our raspberry it's probably a little too much raspberry and we're going to add in our colors so i'm going to keep the yellow which one do i want to keep clear i think i'll keep the yellow clear and i'm going to make the red solid so as i said if you've got the white um food coloring you have to shake it up really really well if it sits on the sits in your cover it has a tendency to separate so you really want to mix it well otherwise it leaves little white dots so that might be a little too much it's always let's do a couple drops a little heavy handed and i'm going to whisk this one together oh these red food coloring that's a pretty color now because i'm pretty sure i've added too much white like i said i only got to add in one or two drops because i kind of went a little heavy-handed likely this red isn't going to set but what i'm going to do is i'm going to quick test it i'm going to put a little bit into a i'm just going to put a little bit into a into a dish i'm going to throw this into the fridge for a couple of minutes to see if it sets up if it doesn't i'm going to add some additional gelatin to that side all right so my little test here it it's setting up that was just a couple minutes in the fridge we're setting no problem now if you'd done that and it was still sticky sticking to your finger then you would want to add about a half a tablespoon of additional unflavored bloom gelatin so you would bloom a half a tablespoon to three tablespoons of cold cold water and add it to that to the solid side but we're good and i went ahead and i added my yellow to my yellow side here and now what i'm going to just do is i'm going to let them sit for just a couple of minutes and allow the air bubbles to come up to the top and that white icky stiff stuff to come and we can pull that out before we pour it into our bottles so our syrup now has been sit and set for a little bit and it's cooled off and you can see kind of that layer on top here take your strainer and just very gently scoop that out so this is the kind of the air bubble a little bit of the broken gelatin but we can get a lot of that out before we put it in the bottle and then with your strainer and you just want to hold it over the bottle and pour your syrup into the bottle dead on on that one not bad and now we're ready to cast our candies so a tip for you put your molds into your freezer before you start that way they're nice and cold and your gelatin your syrup will start to solidify right away especially if you're doing two colors that way they won't all bleed together another tip for you before you pour turn your bottles upside down put your fingers over the tips and just tap them what this will do is bring all the air bubbles to the top or to the bottom of the bottles so again helps make it much nicer candy okay then and then just fill up your molds now one thing important with your molds is don't fill them all the way to the top you want to go just just below it go all the way to the top it creates a ridge that gets icky it gets hard these are guys you're gonna look so cool yellow on yellow is tough it's hard to see it especially when it's clear so this recipe will make about um about a hundred or so of this size mold that i'm using probably about 300 of the teeny tiny and probably about 60 50 60 of the larger size all right so my gummies have set get your cooling rack your drying wrap parchment paper design your rock [Applause] and just pop out your gummies now if you can stand them up if they'll stand up better but if not just lay them down and then after about 12 hours flip them and let them fully dry out i usually flip them a couple times a day i walk by and do my flip and these guys will take about 24 to 48 hours to fully dry out and you want to make sure that you have a dry place humidity will not help your candies dry out at all drying and humid do not work together so if you do have a human place um if you can get a dehumidifier that will greatly help you out so i'm just going to finish uncasting these little guys and i'm going to go into the next step and show you the little trick with the alcohol and what that does and then how to successfully uh sugar sour coats your candies so be sure to stay tuned so this is the size of the candies when you take them out of the mold and that's the size of the candies once they dry so they shrink there a little bit there all right so here's a trick that i learned a tip that i learned and um it's gonna make your lives a whole lot easier especially for those of you guys who ship and we're having troubles with your candy sticking together what you're going to do is you're going to take your everclear or your um everclear or alcohol depending on where you're from anywhere you're 94 or up percentage alcohol put it into a small spray bottle remember the equipment that i always forget to tell you small spray bottle was one of them so put your alcohol into a small spray bottle so we want to give our candies a bit of a generous spray here and then just mix them up let the alcohol get into all candy all over and again if you can do this with tincture if you've got your tincture provided you did it with the uh the high grade alcohol and once you do that just put them out rip them up and let the alcohol evaporate it takes about 20 minutes or so and that's it it creates um kind of creates a bit of a barrier it keeps your candies um chewier for a longer period of time so i've had these guys out for about four days and see they're still perfectly squishy and gummy and not dried out looking or anything and that's what the alcohol helps to do and it also prevents them from sticking together all right so the next part is how to successfully sugar coat your gummies all right so this is the really other cool thing that i learned how to successfully coat our candies so for the most part you take them out you coated them they melt it it gets ugly we're not happy because that's because we're doing it wrong well the reason is and citric acid as i said is an acid if there is any moisture it is going to cause it to uh to melt so that's what's happening is you take your candies out of the fridge it's warmer outside of your fridge you know room temperature it automatically creates moisture from cold to warm or if you just automatically put your candies in or there's any moisture it the strict acid will melt so in order to successfully coat them so they don't what you want to do is once your candies have fully dried after a couple of days and if you do the step with the alcohol coating and they're done take your candies take a drying rack and just spread them out onto the drying rack then you're going to get your pot of boiling water here and we're going to just hold the rack over the steam just move it around so our candy's getting cut getting steamed up here and we don't burn our hands so what we're doing here is we're creating them we're giving them a little bit of a heat steam melt to create a bit of tackiness and then our candies stick and they don't melt so once they feel kind of gooey a little bit gooey there it doesn't take very long just dump them into your sugar your sugar mix now for the most part you do about a cup of sugar to a quarter teaspoon or so of the citric acid and then taste that these guys didn't get steamed and give that a taste and see how you like it then just add a little bit at a time until you get the desired sourness that you would like or you can just sugar coat them you don't have to do the sour so once they're done you put them in the bowl mix them all up get your wrap parchment paper i don't have enough room ah i so need a bigger table then just shake off your excess and if there's any ones that didn't get coated just hold them over the steam and that's it onto the rack they're pretty much ready to go they take about 20 minutes to dry fully dry out and that's it you will have your sugar coating that will not melt and there you have them nicely coated sugar sour coated uh gummies that aren't going to melt on you all right guys so that's everything i have for you today i hope you enjoyed that video even though it was a do-over but good so is you did get to learn a couple of new things and that should greatly improve your candies all right so and once again thank you so much for joining me today and i hope you have an awesome rest of your day bye", "mgllweLNll4": "hey hey guys and welcome back welcome back to my channel I know it's been a minute but I'm back and this morning I'm coming to you with a video on how I made these alcohol gummy bears these are actually gummy bears that I mean they're not gummy bears that you can buy at the store in soaked in alcohol so this is the mole and these are have I just finished those I'm just I just have to be mold them and I put them in these little containers whoops I dropped one I put them in these little containers like this so first we're gonna go over the materials your than me you're going to need a mold of course these moles came from Amazon they are the the silly pops molds I will try to find a link and put it in the description one of my customers actually bought these for me um she emailed me or she texted me asked me could I make these I'm like you know I gotta find a mold and she just went ahead and bought it for me so so you get four in a pan you get two blue and two yellow and it also comes with these little you get two of these little drawers you get a blue one and the other one you will need a measuring cup so I'm probably not gonna use this big measuring cup I'm just going to use these two so I have the 1/4 cup and a 1/2 cup you need jello of your choice I'm going to use strawberry jell-o I'm you need gelatin unflavored gelatin this is in the same section as the jello I purchased this one from Walmart also with the jello make sure you don't get the unsweet because my first set that I made was with us we jello and it was horrible it was hard I tried to add sugar to sweeten it up that didn't work it was horrible you and me after all of your choice so I'm going to do mango Ciroc yeah mango Soraka I thought that was making a speech containers that I store mean these are food wrecker teeners you can buy these from michaels is 2 4 6 8 10 to about 20 tensile pack for $5.99 there 4 ounce jars and and put three of these one should be molten you can fit three of these in a jar and think through what fit but you could see it three of those in the John alright so let's get started first thing you want to do wash it again so you're gonna wash your hands and so the first thing you do is you're going to measure 1/2 a cup of your alcohol and you're going to put it in a pan oh yeah and of course you will need a pee so you're going to put a half a cup of alcohol of your choice you want to put that in your sauce pan like so okay and you're going to you're going to take one pack oh I hope I won't repeat this is my first time buying this me and a pack I don't realize it came like this but oops I wrote that myself so what you're gonna do is you're gonna put this in here and you're going to let it dissolve it takes approximately five minutes for this to dissolve ten I don't have a good angle so it's gonna take approximately five minutes for this to dissolve so I'm gonna come back once the dissolve at a better angle so you guys can see okay so I'm back in it has been approximately five minutes and I hope you guys can see that where it's dissolving okay so then what you're going to do is you're gonna put a quarter of a cup of alcohol in there yeah I know this looks a lot alcohol and then you're gonna stir it a little bit more okay now it's really dissolved okay so then you're going to turn your burner on mmm now you can you can put this in and let it resolve over heat which of course it is all faster but you don't want to cook your alcohol as much because you still want it to maintain it take because we all know once you start cooking alcohol cook the cook the drunkness out of it or however you wanna say it so I'm just going to sprinkle my jello in here and it's my burner is on so once this once this jello dissolves then there to be done so it's not gonna take long for it to dissolve just a few minutes you can do this in a microwave as well um probably quicker well I don't know if it or not but you can do it in a microwave I've made jello in the microwave not alcoholic jello but I've made your little in the microwave before you don't want it to burn so that's mine that's why I'm stirring because I do not want it to run clean once I have it on medium heat so these the little jars that I put mine in so I'll sell these for $10 a jar and yeah I think that's a good price that's a big deal because yeah I think that's a good price all right it's slowly getting hot and you can mix like any alcohol any jell-o flavors I mean the possibilities are endless last week I did peach and strawberry this one that I have in this container I mean in this mold this is lemon and Hennessy and this one here is [Music] pineapple jello and pineapple pinnacle vodka almost there guys I have made some of these for my neighbor or the lady that bought the moles and yesterday she messaged me and she wanted some and then one of her friends on it's on so I'm like okay cool alright that's almost a song i'ma let it bubble once it start boiling get a little bubble to it and then um cuz normally that's how I know it's all dissolve when when it to get a little bored sore because if I keep stirring it's not gonna do anything y'all noticing a watched pot never boils if I keep stirring it it never will boiled but I don't want it to see so which this is a good this is a good pot this is a Rachael Ray pot it's a good scent so I don't think it's gonna stick [Music] and my next thing is making labels for these because when I made them for her before you know I just made them you know that was my trial so I wasn't making them to sell and then I've made some for girl at work I just put them in like little Ziploc baggies but now since I'm actually going to be selling them that's why I got these little jars and I'm going to make some labels and put on here I'm not sure what I'm going to put on the label yet but I need to figure it out because I can't just give a customer some without a label on it it looks like it's dissolved you guys it looks like it's dissolved I think it's all design so what I'm gonna do next is I'm a messy worker like all the way around so I'm gonna turn off and then I am going to pour this over in this measuring cup okay pour that over there and change my okay so I have a cord over in my cup so what I'm going to do now you can just pour it in like this but I tried that and I wasted so much alcohol you guys like my first cut because doing it with this it takes longer so porn is so quick so the first few times I make these I can only feel one for tray and half of another one well that's because I was wasting so much alcohol but now that I started using this I can feel three complete trays so you know that's like a lot of alcohol abuse so you're just going to we all know how to work these you squeeze your diaper let's put it in there now every time I pull this out like some sport out I'm not sure why so you just um put it in there and you just failure your mold just like that very simple no it's shooting out at me I'm not sure why and these are some cute little animals on here you have ducks there's um a little monkey the bear of course a lion that's a line yeah that's definitely a lion a duck so they're really really cute so I know you guys don't want to sit and watch me do that so I'm gonna finish that off camera but once they're done you just once you're done you just sit this in a refrigerator I I left mine in for like at least four hours so you're just sitting in refrigerator and then you could just this one didn't turn out so good cuz I oh my gosh I don't know if it's because I'm I had it on top of the stove when I had the stove on so guess what you guys this one is kind of messed up okay I think it's because I had on top of the stove and I left it stove on but anyway you just pop them out and they are like like here's the worm so you just pop them out after like four hours you don't have to put them in the freezer some people put theirs in the fridge you do not have to put them in the freezer I mean I guess you could for faster results but I just put mine in the refrigerator and I leave it in there for like four hours and it works perfect so thank you guys I'm going to finish filling this up and put this in refrigerator and get ready for work thank you guys for watching if you like if you like the video please give it a thumbs up please subscribe to my channel I'm sorry I've been away for a while but I will be more consistent with posting

so today he is gonna be a voiceover because I'm calm at feeling my hair today so right now you see me porn in very blue gelatin that I got from Kerrville you can use any jello this is what I had in my pantry so you're gonna go ahead and pour it into your pot you can also pop this in the microwave and just pour it on a cup if you're in a rush so right now just pour it in and that cuz I'm going to get two packets of gelatin and pouring in my pie also if you're putting is microwave you can do it the same way you can just use a measuring cup or a regular cup so right now I'm just pouring in my packets of gelatin you can use 3 if you want to be more firm next I'm adding a cup of water and HR that painting so you can add more and sages make sure you add another packet of gelatin so it could be firm and not you know mushy negative you're gonna do is you're gonna turn your stove on to medium heat and basically you're gonna store every store ha you're gonna stir everything together until you know all the clumps from the gelatin and the jello is mixed and melted together so right now you just see me stirring it around and so it's nuts together you can also you know put this in the microwave I keep stressing the microwave because I used to salt on that dish out you could just put it in the measuring cup in a microwave for like 2 minutes and you're done but make sure you watch it because if you don't watch it it's gonna bubble up and you're gonna have jello everywhere so yeah right now you just see me stirring it together and you can see everything is starting to melt like how I like it so next I'm going to add a teaspoon of Hennessy right now I'm just stirring it together you know how you make noodles and like it's not coming to a boil but it's not cold anymore that's where you wanna you know start stirring it a little bit more and putting that extra shot at Hanasi in there because sometimes when you're cooking it it can I guess burn out if you want to use I'm Anna use noodles but I'm black Gardens there I'm talking about so right now I'm stirring it and about to put it in my measuring cup this helps me pour it in and not spill it everywhere got my stove looks so dirty but I don't care you're probably like why are you mentioning your stove but YouTube trolls be on it and I just want to let you I know I had cooked a whole meal for me and my fiance and it kind of got messed up it messed up the whole kitchen but it's okay I'm gonna clean up after this video so right now you just see me pouring in the gelatin and after you pour it in you're gonna let it cool for ten minutes you're gonna see me motion in ten minutes and the reason why are you gonna let it cool for ten minutes so it won't spill when you put in the frigerator after it cooled down place in the fridge for ten more so after you take it out the fridge it's gonna be easy to pop out so this way it looks like it's all pretty and whatnot so right now I'm just popping out all about a little blue hearts you know that's a gang all that you know oh no I'd be saying I'm on voiceover done by me so right now like I said I'm just placing it on my plate to make it look pretty excuse that blue stain I made a drink like three weeks ago and I cannot get it out if you guys have any tips on how to get like food coloring off of your tables and shelves and stuff please let me know so right now you just see me showing off my little beautiful creation and next I'm going to add some sugar on top or you can add some citric acid that's what I used to add sorry now I'm just adding sugar to make it look pretty and there you have it some infuse gummies thank you guys for watching make sure you like subscribe to my channel bye", "0QqhsGGrtLk": "I should be here welcome back to my channel today let's make some CMOS gummies yummy ok so one of my twins she doesn't really care for the flavoring of these CMOS nor the slime enos so I said how can I make this more tasty bingo gummies so today is Sunday we spend mommy and daughter day cooking and watching movies so I am doing my cooking part and I've already washed and soaked my CMOS I cut it up and I put it in their blender with a touch of water and I found these dried cherries in their sauce so I said mom perfect let's try that so here I am mixing now I want the consistency of hmm like a pancake because I did try this once before and I didn't post it because it was a total flop I don't know if I put too much liquid or not enough of the agar agar powder but here we go so we put a little bit more water in here just to get the blades going and as you can see it's thick maybe a little too thick I wasn't quite sure here so I let it blend so we can get most of that chopped up I had a couple of chunks but I'm gonna try it here at home with my ninja blender to see if I can get it a little smoother so you can see I'm pouring it in the pot it is thick and I said I don't know if that's gonna be too thick so here's my agar agar powder I put two teaspoons in the pot is not heated it's still cold so I'm mixing it in with the whisk and once I got it completely blended I had it some more water because we wanted a little looser than this because I got to remember that the CMOS will gel but the agar agar will gel it even more so I didn't want to take the risk of it being hard so I loosened it up some more and I do apologize I don't have measurements because this was my firt well my second try and I was just really playing around with this and praying that it came out right okay I don't know if you can tell that it's loose but not watery so into my gummy bear molds I left the squirt tube home so thank goodness they had a measuring cup I could use and so I had to use as you see an ice tray and into the fridge they went and within an hour this was the results and I'm so pleased with this I can't wait to do it again so if you try this and you come up with some more ideas please let me know please don't forget to Like

so crazy I know I can't believe it our family is going I'm so excited about it and I really wanted to make a yummy recipe to celebrate Mother's Day and all the moms out there there was a bunch of recipes to pick from in our new cookbook and I thought let's really make it a treat let's make wine gummy bear yes I love my and so does Moe and Moe can finally have a little glass of wine now so we are really gonna celebrate and if you would like to make these non-alcoholic you can do that right moe yeah you can make them with orange juice or an apple cider or anything else but these are really fun because you can make them with white wine red wine or Rose a or whatever your favorite wine is my mom's side of the family is Italian and we just love lying we sip wine at dinner and she cooks with wine she's his wine when she's making like pasta sauces this is just a total ode to her it's a very yummy yummy treat so if your mom likes wine she may love this recipe I'm so excited this is the first time also that we're making gummy bears on the show homemade gummy bear and they're good yeah they're yummy okay Bo since you are the new mama mm-hmm which type of wine would you like to start off with we'll make that one we'll show how to do it and then I'll make more but which one do you want to start off with let's do rose egg all day oh we do a Rosie all day make these it's the same process with all of them whether it's rosy or a red or a white but we're gonna walk you through how to make the roses I'll make more as well and also before we get started when these are made like when they're all done they do contain a little bit of alcohol it doesn't bake out there's a little bit left over I think you have to eat like 50 of them for it to even be like half of glass of wine but I just thought I would throw that out there as a disclaimer that it doesn't bake out completely but you do have to eat a lot of them to feel an effect if that makes sense yeah okay so there was my disclaimer all right mo are you ready to get started I'm ready let's get started first step in front of us we have all of the ingredients and I'll be posting the ingredients and the instructions and the measurements in the description down below so if you'd like to make these yourself you can know take it away what's the first thing we do to make some gummy bear well the first no way I eat your hand sorry it's the Bears mouth here the first thing that you definitely need to make gummy bears is a gummy bear mold and this one is actually from the rope aching line yes that's ours and I love it because it has a little detail of the little bear faces and it has the little bear paws it's a little detail this is so cute we took so much time developing and designing this one but you can use any mold that you've got there's so many of them online but this is our favorite and it even comes with a little dropper that helps you get it in the mold so just like it's still everywhere which is something I would definitely do so this is wonderful I love gummy bears but I was like why don't they have cuter little faces so we put a little bit of detail but not too much and they're like just so adorable so I'll put a link down below to that mold as well know what's the first step the first step is to take some of your rose egg and mix it with the gelatin and then let it sit to bloom and blooming is just letting those materials come together combine and it kind of gets blooming is like if it gets yellow gets a little like grainy and it looks like jello weed takes about five minutes takes five minutes all right move show them how to do it we've got a little bit of the rose a we're starting with Rosie you don't drink it you mix it oh that's the tough part mo it kind of matches your shirt actually kind of yours too okay okay we do not plan this this is just a happy accident I'm all about it and then you mix together like this and you'll see it's already getting a little chunky and that's what you want but then you're gonna let it sit I don't even know the last time I was able to have Rosie come on it's like a year it's been over your mo has not had Rosie or any wine in over a year let's set this back to the side let that blue yeah we're gonna add this blue then what do we do next next step take your sugar corn syrup and a little bit more of Rosie and a sauce pot over to the stove we're gonna heat these up together for a couple minutes in the saucepan mix together the sugar corn syrup and 1/3 cup of wine and bring to a boil over medium heat once boiling reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes then remove from the heat and take it over to your baking station we just remove the mixture from the stove I'm placing it down here be careful because the pot is hot hot and while the mixture is still hot no what are you gonna do we're gonna add the bloomed of gelatin you can see it's kind of its kind of jelly it's kind of grainy looks like jello it really sticks together it's very firm yeah the gelatin absorbed all of the rose' which is what we wanted scoop it in there mo be careful mo just gonna keep mixing that together having that melt while Lou is doing that I'm gonna add our last ingredient citric acid then mix together till the bloom gelatin melts with everything else we're almost a wine go means oh that smells nice Molly doesn't that smell like a fancy little wine night it does like we could just watch some movies curl up on the couch and like eat little wine gummy beers yeah which is what we should do today we should we should do that once mixed it's time to strain our mixture this is gonna get rid of bumps and chunks before we make these adorable little gummy bears we want nice smooth delicious yeah gummies yeah we don't want chunky gummy you got smooth oh yeah in front of us we've got a medium-sized bowl and a little strainer do you want me to hold that yeah just be careful okay I'm gonna pour it in really slowly okay and then pour it through whoa nice and slow want to get everything I like this mixture cuz it really does stick together yeah scrape it in there we want to make as many dumi beers as we can no wine left behind no wine left behind oh look how pretty color this is okay okay let me see oh look at what we got here you got some clumps get out of here awesome clue we don't want that in New Guinea yeah get out of here okay now it is all strained and while it's still warm we're gonna put it into our gummy bear mold we can use these little guys they're like little droppers little teardrop bears they just you just fill it all the way up to the top yeah so mo tell us like what it's like to be a mom now I have so much respect for all moms out there I am so obsessed with Grayson like he is probably the best part of my day waking up like seeing a smile and cuddling with him and just seeing him name seeing him grow every day and learn new things it's it's the coolest thing he's so cute he's so cute how does mom life is it like like like tell me about it well you don't sleep you really don't okay it's been an adjustment but you just you get used to it learn how to function on a lot less sleep yeah that's right that's what you're doing and that's why you deserve a delicious Mother's Day treat that's right so this Mother's Day if you're not making her one of these do something nice for Mom she'll call your mom say thank you yeah cuz now mo knows how much work it is to raise a little baby and it's a lot of work okay baby Grayson is taking a nap right now but can we see him when he wakes up yes all right the tray is full mm-hmm and it is ready to chill we're gonna pop this in the refrigerator for two hours to set and then they are ready to serve also this recipe makes about five dozen gummy bears mm-hmm so depending on your tray size you might want to make a couple trays so she'd probably you press it in here I should really I'm gonna go put these in the refrigerator and then let's go see hi baby Grayson like okay baby hey there's my nephew hello he's getting so big lady-y-y he was a new boy he was like this big you know he's this vignette he's about seven pounds now he's 12 welcome to the kitchen baby gray this is where we do all the baking it's where your very first birthday cake will be made right here oh my god it's Liberty boy little treats and today Moon's making a lottery for herself today oh my gosh mo can I hold him yeah okay what do I need to do okay you might forget let me get the burp rag this is how you hold a baby nephew okay I'm totally ready okay man step to jepty grab and put him against ya what if he wants to day in he can dance like a human you using Itt are you so baby speaks losing your beep beep beep yeah hey butI in Japan these movie in the

in the paints that's your new hit single dance the booty in the pants yeah because you're here because you feel okay you're gonna go hang out with Uncle Mike now and we're gonna finish making some gummy bears yeah okay oh my gosh I think I'm back I'm back oh right mm-hmm the gummy bears have chilled and you know it's just time to pop them out mm-hmm in front of me I just have a piece of parchment paper but you can pop them onto a plate into a bowl whatever you'd like to know in your mouth all of them you have to wait they're kind of sticky so you flip it upside down and push them out just push them yeah fish your mouth Oh oh my gosh look at that how cute they are cute I love the details like look here musta come here they stand up like it up also oh if you ever make these and you skip the ingredient citric acid they just won't taste like a gummy it's hard for me to explain but when I was playing around and developing this recipe I need it without that ingredient and it just wasn't right it had the sweetness but it just have that Oh lemony likes it like citrus that that all the gummy candies have so I went to like our favorite candy place sugarfina and they have like champagne gummy bears and all this and on the back it had all the ingredients and I tried adding the different ones and you know what it was citric acid you are just a little bit of that and it just changes the game so if you're ever making gummies and they don't quite taste right and you're not using that ingredient that could be it that's the ticket as soon as I test baked and I added that ingredient and took a bite I went what what what that's a gummy bear they're going up and not just for wine gummy bears but any gummy bear if you're making like a juice flavor or you're making a sour gummy literally anything that ingredient is so important cheers to us I got a taste test okay yeah happy Mother's Day mo mmm I love this it's light it's meat and it's got that mm-hmm that little Turk after flavor and you can still yummy used even though it's such such such a small amount of Rosie that's actually in it you know him you still get the flavors of it which is delicious most favorite all right mo let's pop the rest of these out and then that let's make some other flavor yeah we have like red wine white wine and a rose a we can make some extra for Mamma Mia our Mamma Mia oh she loved it yes she would let me oh right cue the montage [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] tada here are the homemade wine gummy bears that we made today we have our rose a blue are red and our white yep and remember if you ever want to make these non spirited you can just replace the wine ingredient with any fruit juice like you could make these with grape juice yeah like a dark grape juice or a white grape juice you can do whatever you'd like you just evenly replace the ingredient again I'll be putting the recipe down below and we'll be taking lots of pictures and posting these all over

I'm starting with a half cup of cold water,\nand to that I'm going to add three packets of plain gelatin. I'm just going to open these up, you can find\nthese in the store, they're available in the little box. I'm using Knocks but any kind will do, and\nI just want to add this gradually so it won't clump up. So just with a nice spatula or spoon make\nsure that your constantly stirring. Stir, stir, stir. You can see it's turning into a gelatin kind\nof a mess here. Which is perfect, just what we're looking\nfor. So I'm just going to stir that around and\nlast but not least I'm going to add one whole packet of Jello, because I'm really just going\nfor it. And I'm using the blue one, but any flavor\nyou like will do. Just pour it in there and again stir it around\nso nothing will clump up. So that is it, I'm going to take my candy\nand I'm going to move it to I have a pot of water simmering on this stove. And then I'm just going to heat it up inside\nthis pot of water. So I'm using a glass measurement cup and I'm\njust letting the heat from the water, kind of heat up my mixture. So this way none of my gelatin is going to\nend up burning, it's all very safe, very kind of a gentle process. You could also just pop it right into the\nmicrowave if you prefer and that's fine too. I'm just going to let that kind of simmer,\nand get nice and thick. So my mixture has melted so I'm ready to go,\nand here I have a nice cute little I have like a jewel mold. You can get any kind of plastic mold that\nyou like or any other kind of candy mold that. The little bears are really fun and adorable. But just while my gelatin is still nice and\nsmooth and liquid, I'm just going to go ahead and pour it right into my mold. You can even go ahead and fill it the way\nup to the top or as big as you like them. That is it. I'm going to let those sit up on the counter\nfor about 10 to 15 minutes or until they're nice and firm to the touch, to keeping them\nto the heat of your house you might need a little longer or a little less. But as soon as they're firm I'm going to take\nthem out of the mold and we're ready to go. So my blue gummy candy are still setting up\nbut I have some that are already done, so these are just the same just with a lemon\nflavor and a cherry flavor. The same recipe and you could see them getting\nnice and firm and chewy. Now if you want to get that kind of classic\nsour candy coating, you take a little bit of sugar mixed with a touch of citric acid. And what that's going to do is give our candies\na nice sour coating. And that's it or you can leave them plain\nor you can just drench them in sugar. Anything that you like, but anyway, enjoy.

"dTgQEOn-wH4": "[Music] hey everyone welcome back to my mexican kitchen here in switzerland the recipe today is for a super yummy sweet snack however you guys want to call it and it's the recipe to make gummy bears or gummies in this case i'm going to be making bears i already made these orange flavored ones they are super cute look but all you need are two ingredients plus water so it can't get any easier than that with halloween this year i have no idea what to expect i don't know if kids are going to be allowed to go trick-or-treating or not but it's always nice to have things to keep them happy at home to make it special for them so these are super fun it's an activity you can do with your kids not dangerous at all and as an option in mexico we have these uh sweet and sour gummy bears and also these uh spicy ones which we like a lot so i'll also give also give you the extra ingredients so you can prepare them with the extra flavors in case you like them the ingredients you need to make your gummy bears are 85 grams of any flavor jello that you choose seven grams of natural gelatin three quarters of a cup of cold water and the optional ingredients are vitamin c powder and chili powder tahin okay so before we get started um you need 85 grams of any flavor jello you want that's up to you guys whichever flavor you like whichever brand you like i'm using jello i like jello a lot but there's tons of really good brands so the brand and the flavor is up to you this particular box is already the 85 grams but they make in many different sizes this big one is 170 these little ones are 25 when i made these orange flavored gummies i used three packages of this one plus a bit more i just had to weigh it so it's not really an issue if you can't find an 85 gram sized box just weigh out your your jello and get until you reach the 85 grams you need for the natural jello what you do is these boxes usually have four envelopes of seven grams each so it's basically one envelope or one tablespoon of um natural flavored jello that's the equivalent so all you need is one envelope from this box and and and let's see oh yeah the the mold you need to make your gummy bears usually these molds are quite flexible so you have to put them on a plate otherwise when you try to transfer them to the refrigerator it's a bit tricky because it folds over and all the liquid will come out so just you need a plate if you don't have a mold don't stress you can use your ice cube tray which i made a few so you could see just don't fill it up to the top they're going to be thinner they also look nice i mean it's up to you guys what you have at home no need to worry or spend money um ice cube trays obviously come in different shapes i also have this other tray that's for jelly beans but you can also make the gummy bears in this shape and they look really cool and well basically that's it now to start the recipe what you need to do is you're going to pour your three quarters of a really cold water in a pan in a saucepan and then you're going to put your natural jello in there don't turn the stove on just let it rest for about three minutes after the three minutes you can turn your stove on at a low medium heat and you're going to start stirring you want it to dissolve well the water gets a bit less foggy it looks a bit more clear don't let it boil you just need the heat so it really dissolves once you see that the water is a bit more clear you can add your flavored jello in there and you keep stirring until it seems that it's all fully dissolved you just need it to dissolve you don't need it to boil you don't need anything extreme in heat just let it dissolve and once that happens you can turn it off you're going to let it rest for a while but while it's still warm otherwise what happens with jello is it gets hard as soon as it gets cold so you don't want it to get cold just let it cool down very slightly and then we're going to start transferring to our mold [Music] okay so um i let this cool down for about one or two minutes tops i just didn't want it to be super hot but it does have to be hot otherwise it starts getting solid and of course this needs to be liquid so that you can fill up your gummy bears or whatever mold you're using for your for your gummies um this particular mold was quite cool because it comes with this dropper so you can fill it in quite accurately you make less of a mess but you can use i often tell people with the recipes i don't want you guys to feel like like you need to buy something you can use whatever you have at home whatever type of molds you have maybe you can use a syringe a cooking syringe or a spoon or a measuring cup anything that you think will work for you use that so now what we're going to do is um oh before i forget if you feel that this is starting to get hard just heat it up a little bit and it'll melt all over again so that has a solution now what we're going to do is we're going to start filling up our gummy bears and then from there once we fill up the whole mold we're going to put it in the refrigerator for 15 minutes passing the 15 minutes you can take it out and you just push them out super easy they don't stick at all you don't need to grease this or anything they come out super easy if you're not using one of these flexible silicone molds all you do is with a toothpick you go around all the outside and then just pop it out it'll come out easily it's a very easy thing it doesn't stick passing the 15 minutes once you take all your gummies out you just fill it all over again and you keep doing that until you use up all your gummy bear mix [Music] okay so our gummies are done um i'll show you guys again i made some of with the leftover that i had i used the ice cube tray and made these cute little squares um but here's the other option i mentioned in the beginning of the video if you want to make sour gummies or sour spicy gummies they're not really spicy for those of you who don't know what tahini is this is the pocket size version like for when you go to picnics it's usually a bigger bottle but i ran out so i'm using my little ones this stuff is not spicy it's actually quite nice because it gives you this explosion of flavors in your mouth in mexico we use it a lot on you press some lime juice on your food and some of this stuff and it's magic so now going back to the gummy bear theme um what you do is i bought vitamin c in powdered version and it comes in these little packages i open one and i put it in a little bowl if you can't find the powdered version that it's too difficult here in switzerland you can also find these that are kind of like alka-seltzer so you put them in water and they just fizz up and dissolve you can just crush it with the hammer or anything until it turns to fine powder so that you can put it on your gummy bear and what i do is you can either put them in here and just grab a gummy and coat it with the vitamin c super healthy and then it ends up all coated with the powder it looks quite nice let me show you these would be the sour gummies or what i did in the other bowl is i did a mix of vitamin c with tahin there's no exact amount you guys can just add as much as you want and again we grab a gummy bear and we coat it this is just here to show you for the video if you want to be super fast and super practical just put a bunch in a ziploc bag or in a tupperware with a lid add the powders in there shake them and all your gummies get coated at once but here for the video i thought i would show you like this because it seemed a bit more practical but this would be the tahin version which is just slightly a bit more flavor but not spicy at all so kids will enjoy it just as an as an idea to put on the table the nice thing about making your own gummies is it's not just healthier but let's say you have a party for adults or for kids you can make the gummies in absolutely any shape you want so if you have a lego party you buy lego molds and you make lego gummies if you have a princess party you make them in little crowns if you have an adult party a naughty party i don't know you pick the shape and you make them whatever shape color flavor you want so that's pretty cool i like that a lot i hope you guys enjoyed the video and i'll see you in the next one", "AH2aRa4nlNI": "[Music] what's going on everybody welcome back to this episode of snack razors today is a very sour day we are going to be tasting several different sour flavored gummies that's a tongue twister yup several different sour flavored gummies and they're all easter themed too so yeah we have warheads chewy bunnies which i'm not excited about there are three flavors of that we'll go over the flavors later yep then we have a sour than sweet sour patch kids bunnies and there are several different flavors of that we have trolleys sour bright gummy bunnies which there's several different flavors of that too yep and then we have green i can't do that why are you knocking i'm sorry i broke it so we got scooby-doo sour straws so and there's several different flavors in here too so yep assorted fruit flavors it's all says so the name the names of the flavors are on the little because they come individually wrapped so that each one has a flavor name on there yep so i kind of want to save these for laughs like scooby-doo okay so like whatever you say man [Laughter] so you want to do trolleys first uh yeah we're always disappointed by them because they don't have all the flavors yeah no so let's let's see what flavors they actually have in this one package yep and then if they don't have some of the flavors well then we're crap out of luck and so are you guys because all the easter stuff at our dollar store now is pretty much gone so we would have to order these on amazon to be able to test out the rest and even then it's still a guess on whether or not we're actually going to get the flavors because you know they don't count how many they actually put in so the flavors we have for the trolley sour bite gummy bunnies is we have lemon strawberry cherry lime orange and for some reason the blue is grape doesn't make any sense they could have still made it purple but i guess they're trying to get bright colors and the calories for these uh nine the serving size is nine pieces and it's 100 calories per serving it's 270 per container yes so no was this little is this an activity says color in the bunny's ears and glasses coloring in i guess rainbow i guess oh yeah yeah did you see that it's a blank rabbit there and i guess they want you to color it in rainbow like that that's that's weird i've never seen that before so i'm gonna see what flavors they have in here real quick see they have lemon i believe they have strawberry because the strawberry and cherry kind of look the same but one slightly lighter than the other yeah yeah they have lime they have two orange so that's good and they have grapes which could have just been blue raspberry sour raspberry so they have all the flavors at least yes at least they have all the flavors so the first ones that we're going to try is the lemon ones because i'm pretty sure the lemon the cherry and the lime are going to be the most sour ones yep so uh i really got a paper cut just now on that cardboard cute yeah let me just open this real quick yep i'm good oh wow the fruity aroma is crazy with that yeah it definitely smells like processed sugar and fruit that's for sure so when i say lemon so we're going to order the flavors that is listed so the first one is lemon so we're going to try that real quick and they're cute this one looks like it had his face punched in like someone ripped out the nose and took the bone with it like all right so we'll try that in three two one not too sour no that's actually enjoyable you you have a slight little pucker but it's not you know anything like it's not crazy yeah so let me see if i could differentiate the strawberry from the cherry here it looks like i'm able to yeah okay all right so now we have two strawberry these ones have the nose fully there for some reason i'm getting random sour yeah random about the sour on like random parts of my tongue and it's making me twitch every single time i have one in the back like towards the back of my throat i have one up on the top of my jaw i have one on the left back side of my tongue and on the right front side of my tongue wow everywhere all right anyway so we got strawberry here yep i like strawberry all right there's a good flavor uh profile yeah it's not sour no that one wasn't sour at all now this is cherry which i assume is gonna be sour just because it's cherry cherries bitter so bitter and sour or pretty similar in terms of reaction so for some reason yeah yeah it's actually really light well has a bit of a sour cake afterwards but all right so now we got lime i didn't think that one was too bad no none of them are really sour no no these i actually don't mind so we got lime which could have just been green apple come on now yep that kind of tastes like the way incense smells that was weird yeah and it does pack a little bit of a sour punch a little bit now i didn't get much on mine but i tasted more out of that one than the others oh okay this one we have exactly two orange so that's good yup so we'll try that and see how this one actually has a face on it the face isn't punched in or or randomly rounded i can see the eyes and the nose and the little cheek things anyway oh that one's a little sour mm-hmm orange gummies are always going to be my favorite no matter what i say that so much but yep it's a fact my guy my grape yeah and now this this this is grape everybody grape hmm you know it's kind of kind of messes with your head a little bit it's a nice flavored grape it is a nice flavor grape but it messes with your head because normally you would see grape as purple and you know from eating a purple item that is grape no matter what like it is always grape unless you have like some exotic thing like like eggplant or something like that it's always great but then you make look at that blue yeah it's like you look at it and you're thinking it's gonna be raspberry yeah but you get grape it kind of messes with your brain a little bit yeah it did mess with mine too yeah yeah all right so the next one we're gonna try is sour patch the sour patch kids and we're gonna see how they'll see if there's a few flavors in this one too i don't think they yeah they don't list all this one well let's go by what the colors are supposedly and we'll try to figure out the flavors and the serving size is 12 pieces and it's 110 calories for 12 pieces yup or if you eat the whole box it's 320. yep so here we go and guys if i seem a little bit off from tasting these candies because i ate crabs on the m ms before doing any of these and i shouldn't add that with chocolate before doing this because it's kind of messing with me a little bit this is the red ones yeah they're little bunnies well see here's the thing if you remember what actual sour patch kids look like this is the bunny setting straight up but if you remember what a sour patch kit actually looks like it looks like that did you turn it upside down yes that's what i'm saying it looks like an actual sour patch kid that kind of messed with me a little bit i was like wait i thought they were supposed to be bunnies when i was handed it i was like but literally like from quick view it just looks like a regular sour patch kid but it's literally a rabbit upside down that's crazy because you see the guys yeah yeah exactly yeah that's more all right so this one i'm going to assume is strawberry or something like that strawberry or a cherry it's pink it's reddish pink yeah reddish pink let's do that again all right so these ones i know are going to be sour because these are always really potent i was just about all right let's go and now it's gone i'm not sure doesn't make me salivate like crazy i think that was strawberry orange orange once again my mind was messed up from the positioning oh that one was really sour oh i don't have more showed up neither do i well by the way if if you realize that we're wearing the same alphas we're trying to pile a bunch of videos into one day so we can get more done and have time to actually upload them instead of doing a video a day like we were right and then rushing to do it not making good content yeah i'm assuming green apple yeah i'm going to some green apple too i'm you ready to die mhm nice lime i don't like that flavor ah i think last one yellow which is lemon yeah i can't wait to get this over now we got warheads next i think it's gonna be even worse yeah yellow all right yellow bunny kid thing that one was horrible i need some water you want some water all right we'll be back in a sec guys okay we're back this is like this this the like one of the second times we've gone and gotten a drink in the middle of a video so i got my water so we can cleanse our pallets in between each sour candy i'm not even going to put a lid on that because i'm gonna be constantly picking it up so so this next one is the warheads chewy bunnies i'm not sure how many flavors they have for this one either it's basically like the sour patch so oh yeah good news guys too um we recently bought uh two plug-in chargers and two extra batteries so if it dies we don't have to wait about an hour to upload the video still oh only three flavors oh my god those things are huge they are what oh it felt like something was in there there's no yeah there is yeah it's green apple watermelon and blue raspberry so i already know the green apple and the blue raspberry are going to be really sour this watermelon might be sour too because it's a subtle flavor so they gotta enhance it smell smells nice sorry it does smell nice it smells it smells i smell the watermelon one above all of it so that means that one's going to be the strongest green yeah i guess green blue or pink green look at these these guys are real these things are really sticky too they're cute i like them these bunnies are really detailed i don't know if you guys can tell or not but there we go get a little bit of shadow on there so you guys can see it all right oh that was nothing warheads why you disappoint me i was expecting a big oh you know oh my gosh but they were so thick these are so thick that this you don't even taste the sourness these are some thick boys oh you you're just hit by a car all right all right now we're doing the blue raspberry i think that's what the next one was right yeah green apple blue raspberry yeah i don't know i'm looking at this for it but ready if you sit there and like suck on the outside you get i guess but i'm just getting some i'm used to that instant punch in the face yeah damn my mind mine was a test tube baby jesus look at it it got all kinds of messed up and then this one is what watermelon watermelon watermelon watermelon that one's got a really nice flavor that's a good watermelon well warheads the flavors are impressive but the sourness is disappointing for you to be known for shower candies i mean that's pretty that's that's kind of sad when sour patch kids out did you in sourness like you were the leading war you were like the leading sour candy and now sour patches got you by like a whole entire milestone this is only one thing though maybe they didn't want to like maybe crazy it you know i guess they should have though because it kind of ruins the brand a little bit well i don't know i like them though like i mean yeah they were good but if i'm not making that face then you shouldn't call yourself warheads you should be called soft heads or something anyway water yeah i mean i thought they were pretty good taste wise they had really nice like different you know different flavors yeah yeah it wasn't the same old same old no the flavor the flavors were pretty strong i'm just disappointed on how not sour they were and that's coming from a guy who hates sour did i read the i didn't read the calories i don't know so there are five pieces per serving three servings per per container and 110 calories per serving yes so and now before we forget it on these these are the scooby-doo ones that we're gonna be doing next and there are 30 calories per one pouch and i think there's only one gummy in each one i know oh it's a bunch of little gummies that's weird they're sour strawberries oh sour straws oh okay they're little sour bites yeah if you look if you look at the packaging you can see the little bites in there okay oh okay yeah so we'll try the blue raspberry they got blue raspberry i know they got where the flavors at where the flavors at i just seen them did you rip it off what did we just say earlier it's written on the package this is sour blue raspberry all right i like scooby-doo yeah i hope this doesn't destroy scooby-doo for me oh freaking the plastic was really staticky the smell is strong that's all that smells like bad raspberry though that's like kind of rancid smelling all right i'm only going to eat like two of these just because i don't i don't trust that they're really small they are they look like little ha ha fingers is easter right and they got the little rabbit pellets oh that's that's good oh they're hard and they're not even shower they're good they're like twizzlers a little bit like the texture twizzlers except a little bit harder than twizzlers they're not even sour they actually just taste sugar coated it tastes really good it's a light sugar it is i really like these yeah those aren't bad i have a weird boardwalk aftertaste but why are you dropping stuff [Music] okay so the next ones that we're going to try out are the sour strawberry so you guys let me show you these guys once again little tiny rabbit pellets so it looks like there's those looks like there's four flavors because i'm seeing we got oh watermelon i thought it was cherry so strawberry watermelon blue raspberry and green apple typical salad flavor just any sour candy really yeah scooby dooby doo these are the sour they're just strong and it takes a lot of power to eat them here we go good strawberry flavor at first still only slightly sweet huh i like these yeah they're not bad they're just like oops they're just like little bites like they're not even they're not sour whatsoever this is the kind of candy that you give the kids that you don't want to destroy with sourness i'm not saying they're gonna like it because a lot of kids like that really intense flavor but if i was skin i would love this yeah all right so now we got sour watermelon oh and we have a new sd card too so this one runs out of memory for us recording so much we could just plug in a new one yep ah come on these bags are really difficult they are i use my teeth man you want mine yeah i'll just take out of yours because it's being a pain i should have done that to begin with i mean honestly so sour watermelon yep not sour not sour fake watermelon taste very fake watermelon taste it's not bad but it's not good at the same time hot taste that one's perfumey after a little yeah that one's not my favorite yeah no all right um

because the Q's I'm also gonna show you a bunch of experiments hacks and DIY so you can do with gummy bear let's get started and go shopping safely we have social distancing let's get [Music] [Applause] like 19 of these we cleared out the store he need a hundred so we're gonna go to the next door there's two kinds of bags in this pie of 160 grams and holds approximately 70 gummies

packs so here is our Neutral 1000 gummies now it's time to unwrap these Oh easy than I thought alright guys I think we're 1/3 of the way through I'm trying not to eat these gummy bears you just ate - I wonder if cats like gummy bears really you don't like them it is not to my liking I prefer lasers yuck where is my fisherman never tried a gummy bear below you have your own YouTube channel yes I do

guys we did it a mountain of 10,000 gummi bears if I lean back it looks huge [Music] now we're gonna figure out how to melt all of these so first up we're gonna try microwaving your pup a few yellow gummies into the dog whoa the bubbly it dried up and solidified straightaway anything this is liquid enough for me to do anything with microwave didn't work out so well you know what there's like a super cool live hack that you can do in the oven let's test it out [Music] I'm gonna show you guys how to make some gummy bear lollipops all you need for this hack is gummy bears lollipop sticks and baking paper let's make some lollipops I'm going to be using the four gummy bears per lollipop then I'm just gonna pop them in the oven and wait for them to know when they're melted just please see a lollipop sticks onto the gummies we have the lollipops what I actually did was put them in the fridge make them solid and they look really good now you have a gummy lollipop it's shochu mmm it's tough this next half is so cool you can make super cute gummy bear charms using hot glue if you can't find a gummy bear mold you can make your own using some liquid silicon I just got these glitter hot glue sticks I can't wait to test them out the glue stick please your hot glue into the mold are set I put them in the fridge to speed up the process so let's pop them out to the cutest can decorate you can make jewelry out of it you can decorate your books with it you can stick them anywhere so adorable so you don't have to mix 10,000 bits to see a giant gummy bear i'm gonna show you what hack we can take this little bit right here and make him grow up fast you need a cut and then you want to fill it let's take a gummy and drop it after about 24 hours of the gummy grows in size as it takes in the water pretty cool trick right it is time to make my Ellie bear mole imagine eating a gummy bear as videos of this we there there and there that making a mold out of a soft toy is a little bit awkward but I'm gonna make it work so usually I'd use a two-pot silicon mixture but we would need so much of that mixture because he is so big kind of expensive so instead I bought a whole bunch of liquid silicon sealant from the hardware store [Music] oh that actually work be there there we're gonna make a replica of you oh why you so heavy panda bear it's my hormones can you believe that I hold you of this was only two dollars a tea technically I've tested this before are now mini-mall did earlier with the hot glue but I haven't done it on something so big so I'm hoping at home so my panda bear is ready he is definitely not happy we're gonna prepare a bowl of warm water and turn it can actually dip our hands in it and mold the silicon as soon as it hits the bear you smooth it on and make sure it takes its shape we don't have the detergent on our hands is gonna stick to our hand depending on the brand you buy this stop can smell really bad prepared myself a face mask oh it's like a snake oh that's Christ out of fungi [Music] oh it feels like clay this action is pretty good it feels very satisfying I'm just molding the silicon around mr. panda bear it's actually quite easy to be honest and you're starting to feel like it's a bit more tacky onto your hand you've run out of detergent so you should read it [Music] and a bear is fully encased in silicon it was actually easier than I thought now we wait for you to say Amy I stuck the gummy bear 100 go looks like the gummy bear two three four five seven eight oh boo my side becomes yeah oh no no - - all right guys it's been 24 hours panda has been chilling in his silicon mold ooh it feels dry it's so fancy he see that I'm really impressive this silicon hat doesn't smell too bad like from here but if you really get close he smells like your vinegar on my nose oh you see that he's coming right off that is so cool I mean and it hasn't really damaged his fur at all like peeling Elmer's glue off your hand oh yeah actually much easier that he's actually a soft boy cuz like what I'm doing is I'm pushing down and he's peeling off the silicon I finally got the mold up oh my gosh that is kind of really satisfying use unharmed I can see the face on the other side that's crazy all right let's put him down ooh that's not good we have a problem panda let himself go in a 10,000 coming bear panda bear is not holding himself up and we're gonna have to pour the gummy in while he's facing down what we need is like a little bit of support to hold his arms up let me go right and then back in the mold so that you can keep its shape while we fill Oh guys we are rescuing Panda oh all that with vinegar was so struck the mold looks really good I was time to melt outcomes alright guys so this is my yummy rainbow Roy CG this rainbow is getting worse every we are so many different shades of orange and yellow oh there's some Reds making its way in there my bad [Music] time phalanges random facts they didn't need to know but I'm gonna tell you anyways because I wanna tell me best were invented in 1922 by German candy maker Hans Reigle I hope I pronounced that correctly Oh sadly the green gummy bears are actually strawberry flavors and sir confused I guess I got a taste at home apparently the clear ones a pineapple flavor II oh okay the flavor is so subtle and speaking of giant gummy bears that we're gonna make today the biggest one money can buy is actually 36 pounds the one we're gonna make today is actually going to be 44 pounds looking at random facts and weird things if you guys want to see more of this don't forget to subscribe to react accordance with me and max actually look at a lot of these things it's time to get melting alright let's go [Music] this is the last year's save his ears so now it's time to wait for mr. yummy panda bear to set so it's been a full day halfway through I was checking up on the gummy and seeing if it was setting or some reason it wasn't sitting properly it was still really gooey put it in the fridge buzz off fridge isn't that big to kind of take him out of the ride and a squash him up it should be set by now oh no you know what he is perfectly solid but he is very out of shape oh you they're heavy oh my god oh I mean he was so cute before the guy was still really sticky I don't think Ari melted gummy sets really well now we know it's better to meet gummy from scratch his ear came out so well this is so heavy you left out for the week got on a diet and flat on his stomach bit me he ain't good abs it's kind of a bear shape let's peel him oh my god he's still kind of have a face [Music] he's actually very yes [Music] oh my gosh guys I can't believe we did it we melted 10,000 gummy bears into one giant gummy bear we made out of mold we melted it all he came through I actually didn't know if this was possible when I started the video he is adorable slightly deformed but that's okay we love a unique bear and I wanted to make like a nice different rainbow color thing but it just kinda looks Brown this is a normal gummy bear and this is my giant 10,000 gummy bear bear how's it look guys it is time to eat my goat hey Matt yeah how long

did down below and we'll be back with another offsides with series next week let me know what you want me to do and I'll see you in my next bye guys love you MA", "TLs7u0vTCjI": "hey everyone awesome Disney toys here we got some corn syrup jello unflavored gelatin so if you had to guess what do you think we're making today we're making jello gummy bears whoo all right to start we'll need 1/2 a cup of water so I'll go ahead and do that we'll need 1/4 cup of corn syrup yes I like my gummy bears sweet but who doesn't now we'll use this fork or you could use any other stirring item and we'll just mix this until the corn syrup completely dissolves okay that should be good we'll take this to the awesome stove and pour it into this pot Willy to pouring 2 packets of unflavored gelatin go ahead and do that too and then we'll leave 85 grams of jello for this part you could pretty much use any flavor you want you don't have to follow ours but we'll be using strawberry mmm this is the good stuff now I'll just get our wooden spoon mix this thoroughly until all the powder dissolves keep stirring still need a stern a bit more we could filthy a few jugs okay once you get it to look like this you could stop stirring and then turn the stove on to low heat while we wait for that let's check out the gummy tray we'll be using this one's called the 50 cavity bear mold and if you're interested in making this after watching the video and I think you will be interested we got this mold off Amazon will post a link in the description below if you want to buy it here's our gummy tray it pretty much feels like one of those rubber ice cube trays this set also comes with this dropper tool but we'll actually be using this condom it squeeze bottle it'll be easier and faster to pour into the mold so after about five to 10 minutes on low heat your gummy syrup should be ready the texture should look something like this alright so at this point you're ready to pour but you may want to place your mold onto a plate or a cutting board it'll make it easier to transfer into your fridge you don't want to wobble your mold all the way over and accidentally spill it yeah that would be bad now that the gummy molds on the plates we'll pour the liquid into the condiment squeeze bottle dude we're pouring some sweet jelly hurry some sweet jelly catchy song right just made it up all right let's put the cap back on and we are ready to pour stir with this one on the bottom left if you guys are using a condom and squeeze bottle to be sure not to squeeze too hard it might overflow you want to just gently squeeze it and if you're using a dropper it might take a little longer but the gummies will still taste the same okay so I'm pretty much doing the same thing over and over again so let's fast-forward to near the end got a few more left three two and no one whoa we just made fifty gummi bears here's a closer look at her beautifully filled gummi bears I can't wait to try one ah some of you may be impatient like me putting a lot to leave this in the fridge overnight boo and it's the next day I'm sure you could already tell just by looking at it but the liquids have turned into a gummy texture let's take one out whoa I came out pretty easily and the mold stays pretty clean well I'm pretty impressed okay so this gummy bear came out in perfect detail you could see the arms the legs and if you really take a good look at the head you could see the eyes and the nose too all right so it looks good now let's see if it tastes good mmm that's pretty good it's sweet it's chewy but softer than the coming bears I usually buy at the store and I'm really liking this strawberry flavor let's take all the other gummies out that because there's one thing I have to say it is a little sticky though while I take this out so if you guys remember from before I used a quarter cup of corn syrup and it was pretty much the perfect sweetness for me I think if we add anymore it'll be too sweet but if you have a big sweet tooth feel free to put it more since these gummy bears are sticky at least they won't fall up the plate alright we're almost finished taking all the gummy bears out got one more and it wasn't just that first one check out how clean this mold is this is definitely not one of those messy do-it-yourself projects I guess one of the other problems with this being sticky is these bears are all kind of clumped up and they do not want to leave this plate - it being sticky everything else is pretty spot on so if you want to see more jelly videos give this video a thumbs up hello mr. gummy bear oh you brought a friend and another friend and another friend just how many bears are you whoa it's raining gummy bears they're gonna take over the world well this was a lot of fun thanks for watching please subscribe to watch more see you soon also if you haven't done so already be sure to follow me on Instagram Facebook and Twitter the links are in the description

We're gonna sample them, guess them and discover, something amazing. - But before that we're gonna tell a 10 word story. - If. - Dennis. - Suspects. - Martha. - Of. - Marination. - He. - Won't. - Ever. - Love. - Oh, man. That's tough. When you just suspect\nsomebody of marination you won't ever love? There's, there's no hope in that. - No I think that Dennis\nis anti-marination and he's starting to fall for Martha but if he suspects her for marination, he won't ever love again.\n- He won' ever love? - Yeah, he won't ever\nlove Martha or any woman. - Oh, man, Dennis. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's Dennis with one S. - You know, I don't know\na Dennis. (laughing) - You know, Dennis is\nusual spelled with one S. - That's very funny if you're just reading what was written. - Well, that's only funny\nif you read what's written and you said one N. Because Dennis is spelt two Ns. - Oh, sorry one, one N not one S. (laughing) Yes, I was N said S so, Denas. (clearing throat) - Denas?\n- Denas. - Denas.\n- Do you know a Dennis? I don't think there's ever\nbeen a Dennis in my life. I had a neighbor once whose husband died, his name was Dennis\nbut I never knew Dennis 'cause he, he dies before I knew him. - Dennis? - Yeah.\n- I'm not close with a Dennis. - Her name was Bunny by the way. I had a neighbor whose name was Bunny. - Okay. - Had a son named Matthew. - Wow. (background laughs) I didn't know where you\nwere gonna go with that. - Bunny, Bunny like-- - Anybody been close with a Dennis? - [Stevie] Can you re-ask that question? - [VOICE] D E N I Z. - Nuh-uh. - [VOICE] Yeah, it's a Turkish spelling. - Oh, well that's not Dennis. - [VOICE] Yeah, it's pronounced Dennis. - Oh, it is? - [VOICE] Yeah. - Dennis?\n- So, Denis Villenueve is a Canadian/French film director. - And there's one N and one S. - Denas. - Denay. (laughing) - But I'm going to call\nhim Denas when I see him. It's Sundance. - So that's the only famous\nDenis you could find on Google? All right, so you've marinated some stuff. Let's take the first ones.\n- [Stevie] Denas - All right, so these are all marinated in the same thing obviously? It, it soaked it all up. These things are freaking, pretty giant. - Did they get bigger\nbecause they're marinated? - [Stevie] Yeah, they get big and juicy. - I'm going to use a folk. - [Stevie] I'm very distracted\nby the, the book on the, your book. - My, you don't ever, you don't ever curl up with\na romance novel Stevie? - [Stevie] Well, listen, I, I read lesbian fiction on my porch on the weekends as everyone knows. But, but on Kindle, you know how, you have a Kindle? - Um hmm. - [Stevie] You know how the cover, you have to pay for the cover\nto not be an advertisement? - Yeah. - [Stevie] They advertise me straight romance novels all the time. It's like get a hint, you know? Get a freaking hint. (laughing) That's what they look like. - Because you don't pay. - [Stevie] Because I don't\nread straight romance novels. So it's a lost ad.\n- Or maybe you should try we got one right here is\nmarinated in Italian dressing. - Italian dressing (high voice). - [Stevie] I do remember my\nmom having like a Danielle, Danielle steel--\n- These are good. - [Stevie] On the bedside table. - I don't know what they are marinated in, but they are good. It's hard-- - Have you noticed how there's a-- - It's hard to tell. - In the very middle of everyone-- - It's hard. - It's a hardness that has stayed. - Is it, is that, I think that's harder\nthan a normal gummy bear or is that a normal\nhardness of gummy bear? - That's the only thing\nI'm thinking about. Oh, this is also a smoor, which means it is a Good Mythical More that was voted on by the Mythical Society. And what you guys have\ndecided that we should do is readily, are sprayed with water every time they touch their hair or beard. This was suggested by\nGinger Snaps, not the brand, the mythical beast. - The majority of you\nvoted on that suggestion. And, but the, the, I mean-- - I don't touch. I mean, I don't, I\ndon't, I don't touch my-- - Oh, you just sprayed me. - Yeah, because anytime\neither of us touch something. - Oh, we both both get sprayed?\n- We both get sprayed. - [Voice] David told me\nto spray around there. - You sprayed me back here though on the back of my head (spraying). Oh.\n- Oh. Spray him again, he touched his hair. - Okay. That's point blank. I'm getting a trickled down my temple. If you get a triple,\ntrickle down you temple-- - You keep touching yourself. - Oh. You really out of it Jay. - Let me tell you-- - I didn't know I was touching myself until I saw Ben pointing\nat Jay he's like, there. Cause now that you, once\nyou, once you wet it, now I want to touch it. Now I want to, I want to fix it. All right, we need to guess. Cause I don't want to\neat too many gummies. - I can't tell, all I taste is gummy bears and they're good. - [Stevie] You want a\nthree, two, one on it? You really, you don't\nhave any kind of guess? It doesn't make them taste\nany differently at all? These are all sodas remember. - Oh, all sodas? - [Stevie] Yeah. - Okay. - [Stevie] You want a three, two, one? - Three, two, one. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Sprite.\n- Sprite. - [Stevie] No. No, but you've enjoyed this soda in something else recently on the show. - Squirt. - [Stevie] What? when did you ever eat, when did you have squirt? - When you weren't looking? (background laughs) - [Stevie] What? - What? - I wasn't listening to\nwhat you were saying. - It's not something-- - [Stevie] This soda has\nbeen featured on this show in a prominent way in this recent season. It's not, it's not, it's not our go-to. It's something that we featured\nin the next best thing. - It tastes lemony. - We'd featured it in the next best thing? - [Stevie] You poured it into your cereal and you named it the next best thing. - Oh, ah butter, butter soda. What's that called? - Cream soda - Cream soda.\n- [Stevie] Cream soda, yeah. - It doesn't taste like cream soda. - [Stevie] Oh boy. - Yeah, it does. I can taste a little bit\nof that. Let's, let's see, let's see the next one. Oh, I just touched my nose hairs. See. (spraying) - I kinda like it. (background laughs) I kinda like the mystifying quality. - Oh, these are, these are--\n- [Man 1] A little darker. - [Man 2] I'm going to get (indistinct) - Oh, this one is easy. I think. - [Stevie] There's something mesmerizing when you put your fork into the bowl in the closeup shot. Cause it jiggles like a jello mold, which gummies don't usually\nhave that exact kind of jiggle. - Okay. I got a guess. - Yeah. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Ruff beer.\n- Ruff beer. - [Stevie] Yap. - That was good. - It was pretty good. That's pretty good. - When I got my hair up like\nthis, I don't touch it a lot, But sometimes you gotta, you gotta do that. - I feel like a, a reprimanded cat. (background laughs) - Cats don't like it when\nyou spray them with water? - No. And that's how, that's how you're supposed to whop them. You're not supposed to beat a cat. You're supposed to spray them with, (background laugh) if you were to spank a cat,\nI don't know how you'd do it. - You think that dogs and cats have picked up on the cultural revolution? You know, people, our generation growing up\nespecially in the South, you did something wrong\nyou got your ass spanked, that's what happened. We don't do that anymore. But you also spank your dog guys. - [Stevie] No you don't know. - No, we did growing up back then. - [Stevie] You spanked them? - Yeah, if the dog did something wrong, my dad had like a roll of newspaper and he'd hit it on the back. - Yeah, you gotta-- - I'm not suggesting this. - You gotta communicate to the dog that you did something wrong. - And I'm saying-- - And, and the go-to was\njust hitting it on the back. - Culturally, we have all\nmoved on to a next level where it's positive reinforcement, right? So do you think that the\npets have picked up on this? - [Stevie] I don't know if\nthat's true for everybody. - And they're like, hey, we're staying inside now. We're getting pampered. We got it made, let's start minding. I think they've, I think,\nI think it's worked. I think it works.\n- I think word has gotten out that dogs are not getting spanked as much. I know there's some people still doing it. - What's the question?\n- I got nothing on this. - I don't think dogs\nare like sharing notes. I don't think they have a forum. - That's where you're wrong. This one is subtle. Hmm. I just bit my tongue a little bit. - While we're thinking about--\n- It hurt. - I'll let you know that, you may not know this, but you can shower with us because we put ourselves\non a shower curtain. - I know. (spraying) See. - And it's available at mythical.com. And also if that's a little\nover the line for you, we also just put our faces on a towel, which you can then touch your body with. also available at mythical.com. - Get a towel. Get a shower curtain. I got, I got nothing. - [Stevie] You're not\ntasting anything in this? This is the one of the more\nsubtle sodas I would say. - All right, I got a guess. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Sprite.\n- Sprite. - [Stevie] Yeah. - Yeah, sprite is so subtle. You can add it to something else. - There's a, there's a lemonyness to it. I do like what it does to the, to\nthe bears in general, - It makes them like jello. - Yeah. - If you wanna make your bears like jello, how long did you soak them? - [Voice] Twelve hours. - Twelve hours. - Oh goodness look at that. - Were these all--\n- That is a warm. - Were these all the\nsame color originally? - [Voice] No. - I can't even get one. - Ooh, smells like cleaner. - Hmm.\n- Hmm. - It's very lemony. Is that because the-- - That's because you\ngot a lemon part of it. - Oh, really? Yeah, let me get a different-- - The consistency. I mean, it, it's become like a dessert. - The, the-- I'd love to\nput this on ice cream now. You know how you can put\ngummy bears on ice cream and they get too hard? - Yeah. This, this does that. - You do, you soak them and\nthen you put these on ice cream. I know what I'm doing tonight. Well, I'm marinating\ngummy bears for 12 hours. - Tomorrow night, for tomorrow morning for breakfast. - Staying up all night,\nwatching it like a hawk. - I mean, this tastes like, I mean, this tastes like furniture polish. - I think I have an answer,\nbut it's based on his reaction. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Dr. Pepper. - [Stevie] No.\n- No. - [Stevie] No, the color\nshould give you a clue. - Coke. - [Stevie] No. it's a purple color. - Grape soda. - [Stevie] Yeah. - Grape Gatorade. (laughing) - It didn't stain my tongue. - That, that's, that's good now that I know what it is. I like that. - Oh, thanks. (spraying) Okay, that was, you made it, you're, you're\nmaking up for lost time, I see what you're doing. This one didn't really do\nany colorization at all. - No it didn't. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. I have an immediate guess. - Have you noticed how these don't have the hard center like the bears do? - Yeah, the, the worms--\n- It goes all the way through. - I think the worms are softer\nand floppier in general. So it-- - So they can have a little bit of a-- - Modulation. - [Stevie] Be careful you have a-- - That?\n- [Stevie] Yeah. - Oh yeah, I'm saving it. - [Stevie] Okay.\n- Okay - [Stevie] Okay. - I'm ready to guess.\n- I'm gonna guess. - Three, two, one - Hawaiian Punch.\n- Mountain Dew. - [Stevie] Yeah, it's Mountain Dew. - Oh, yeah. (spraying) Did I touch his beard? Stop touching your beard. - That was pretty good, Mountain Dew. Mountain, that seems\nlike an internet-y thing, Mountain Dew gummy worms. (clattering) - That's going to be the thumbnail. - Look what happens to the Swedish fish. Oh, my gosh.\n- Oh, my gosh. - They become salmon. (background music) This Swedish fish became salmon. - What, what kind of\nfish were they before? - I don't know. - I think we did know at one point. - [Stevie] Swedish. - I've been feeling a\nstrong call to Scandinavia. - How am I supposed to respond to that? (laughing) - I just, I've been looking\nup pictures of things. - Of what things? - Just, just the world. And I keep landing on like, ooh, what is this place? It's like, Oh, that's the coast of Norway. - [Stevie] There's an Instagram account that's Scandinavian houses\nand properties for sale. Oh, that's, that's a real\nlike wanderlust situation. - A long trip to buy a house. Don't, don't buy the house in Norway - Hold on. But listen, do you know,\nthere's only 5 million people in the whole country - But if you do, I'm going to visit it. - There's only 5 million\npeople in all of Norway. That's half as many people in just the state of North Carolina. - And what are they doing for each other? I mean, do they-- - They're also really happy. Like they're like the\nhappiest population up. - A lot of them make shoes, don't they? - No, that's the Dutch. It's a bitterly cold and a lots of it. And the whole coastline is just rocky. And then like once you\nget above a certain point, you're basically in the Arctic\ncircle during the summer, the sun never goes down during the winter the sun never comes up. - I think it sounds too cold.\n- But they're happy. - I think it sounds too cold there. - Well, I just want to visit.\nI don't want to live there. - You, do you like what's happening here? - Yeah, but I've kind of forgot. - It makes them a lot more edible, I'll tell you that. - [Stevie] Oh. - Strawberry. What was that noise you made? - [Stevie] That was like,\nooh, those are fighting words. I like Swedish fish. And I'm sticking up for the commenters who like Swedish fish.\n- The only place they stick is in your teeth. (spraying) - Ooh. - I just wiped my face\nonly to get it re-sprayed. The, there's nothing, no taste in there that's not a Swedish fish to me. - Yeah. - [Stevie] You've been\nwanting this to be a thing for the entire year.\n- Oh, coke. - [Stevie] Yeah. - I was going to guess Dr. Pepper. - [Stevie] Cherry vanilla Coke. - Oh cherry vanilla coke.\n- Oh, cherry vanilla. - [Stevie] Does this work? (bell chiming) - Yeah? - [Stevie] No, it didn't work. - I heard a bell if\nthat's what you're asking. - [Stevie] It didn't work for\nwhat I wanted it to work for. - You want us to start salivating? - There's a hiking trail\nin the North of Sweden, which I know is not Norway. - Here's some other ones, more Swedish fish. - It takes, it's called the King's Trail and it's, it takes one month to hike it. And it's just the pictures\non Instagram, mmh. You want to go? - Yeah. Are you sweating? - Yeah, I'm nervous. - You've got a lot of perspiration. He's eating the whole fish of course. - These are different. - [Stevie] I've never had the thing that these are marinated in before. - Squirt.\n- Squirt. - Gummies taste like Squirt. - Squirt is a good soda. - [Stevie] I've had Squirt. - If Squirt is like a, it's like a Sprite, but it's more lemon than lime like a Fresca. Fresca and Squirt are\nkind of exactly the same. - [Voice] kind of is. - Yeah. - I, you know, I've been missing Fresca. We, we, I, I drink Fresca. I went through a Fresca phase and, and LaCroix came along and I forgot about it. I bet you they hate LaCroix. - Well, Fresca has-- - I went through so many phases-- - Fresca has sugar. - I know. - That's what I-- But I got, but I also got diet Fresca. - I don't, I just don't like these. They're still waxy. I liked, I really liked\nthe gummy bear before. - I actually prefer Swedish\nfish without the marinade. - Yeah, it's not working. - What it did for the\ngummy bears was better. - What is this?\n- Oh, shoot. - [Stevie] It's-- - Stevie has never had it. - [Stevie] Yeah, I don't\nthink there's any way that you would guess this. It's Cactus Cooler. - What is that? - What is that? Cactus Cooler? - [Voice] That's soda.\n- Oh, hold on. We had, we had that on\nthe show, didn't we? - Probably. - Oh, no. We've never had this Cactus Cooler. - So it's a cactus. Oh, they got a nice hat. - I do like that hat. Vintage Cactus Cooler hat used on Etsy. Click on that, let's buy that. - So what is the Cactus Cooler taste like? - [Voice] Kind of orange I think. - I see $15. - You can just get it as a-- - Oh gosh. Okay. It's weird, it's itching there. (background laughs) I'd like to know how big\nthat hat is before I buy it. - Yeah. Usually you can\njust, you can hang that up. You can hang that up, man. - It says in EX. Vintage Cactus Cooler\nsoda mesh trucker hat in EX, unused condition. It looks small though. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I think, I think you\ncould pull that off. - I like a trucker hat. - I think it like a, like a, I think it's, I think that would be\npulled off better by a girl, like, like a cute chick. (laughing) It's a cute cat. - Every cute chicks out there-- - It's a cute chick hat. - Go get this Etsy hat. - Vintage Cactus Cooler soda hat on Etsy. - I can't see out of my right eye. - Get it, get it. Orange pineapple soft drink is what the Cactus Cooler is flavored. Let's get rid of this, we don't like it. (clattering) Is that it? That's the discovery. Cactus Cooler exists. - Dr. Pepper makes it. - Is that right? - And Keurig, what? - Keurig Dr. Pepper. What does that mean? - [Stevie] Did you get\nsomething in your eye? - Yeah, water. (background laughs) - Yeah, Keurig Dr. Pepper, formerly Keurig Green Mountain and originally Green\nMountain Coffee Roasters is a publicly traded\nAmerican beverage company. - Keurig is Dr. Pepper.\n- As of 2018, Oh gosh.

you remember put your answer below in the comments bye cookies woo", "Ey3xP25kuWg": "[Music] welcome to my kitchen my name is Chad Mitchell and I'm a senior scientist with Carlos North America food applications team I have been asked to talk about how we are continuing to support our customers with R&D from our home workspaces before we were asked to transition to homework I had a few projects with sugar reduction that came up they range from cereal coatings to cereal puffs to frosting and to gummies so we had to decide obviously for coating cereal I need a bigger piece of equipment so that was out but frosting and gummies hey I can do that at home so before we were asked to work from home we were able to grab a few items have a scale an induction plate a thermometer a mixer and the rest has been make it up as you go basically on some of these things so that's been fun and interesting so we're gonna talk about some of the sugar reduction hurdles I've been able to look at while I've been at home and we're gonna focus on a pectin gummy today so right away when I hear sugar reduction the first thing is I always ask is what am i comparing this to is this gonna be a brand new product and you want to compare it to something on the market or is this an existing product and you need to match it in a gold standard way and obviously if it's matching a gold standard and even if it's a new product we want to know about the flavor the texture and the appearance and many times those will have definite set guardrails on there and some of them might be it taste needs to be number one we're flexible on texture and the parents we're okay I think we'll be able to fall into that window so we always try and set a hierarchy that way another thing I always ask is what is on your in and out ingredient list what what are you looking to do do you have something that specifically cannot be used or is there something that you would really like to be used and what are some of the goals of that sugar reduction so then it would be the claims are we looking at a calorie reduction are we looking for we had a sugar reduction do we want to add fiber to this product or other than neutral nutrient benefits so that's where I kind of start there and then the fourth thing is I like to always think about is processing corn syrup I should say syrup is not syrup I mean in a powder is not necessarily a powder so therefore you have to kind of think about all those things because it may look great on a formula or nutrition facts panel they may look okay you know in the beginning and during the processing but then also how does it look in the finish so we have to take it all the way through so we're in a quick jump in here right now today I'm actually going to be looking at using some erythritol to reduce the sugar so I'm preheating I have corn syrup sugar and erythritol in here and I've preheated this I always preheat my syrup here so that I can not shocked my pectin when I put that in there my pectin has been hydrating back here in the mixer I'd 190 degrees Fahrenheit so it's nice and in its functional place all right that looks pretty good so I'm going to turn that off and grab the pectin and we'll add the pectin probably my mixer going a little bit too fast all right there we go it's also working from home we have not I don't have all the big equipment like our pH meters and our refractometers but I've designed some Excel spreadsheets so that we can know how far I need to how much moisture I need to drive off to get to the correct solid range for a pectin gummy which is between 76 and 78 solids all right so 21 27.2 so I'm going to start this heating up I got a quick write down that number so we'll go to about that range right there all right so now I'm going to continue this to heat this up and concentrate the material and while this is working here I've set a timer so I kind of know what that is I have the scale here so I'll be able to watch how much moisture I've driven off of the product here and we'll continue carry on so the thought behind this was I was in a door with rat all to reduce some of the calories and obviously reduce the sugar I also added it to my pectin to get it into a nice happy place so talking about ingredients and thinking as they've gone in here now so yesterday I actually made some gummies with some corn bran and then I also made gummy with store Batol isomalt and our chicory root fiber are liquid inulin and they all had some very different things that that I watch for as I put them into the pot so as I'm thinking about processing and seeing how the ingredients are different so Lydia my daughter Lydia is helping me out today video tape so here is a simple example of 75 grams of water and then 25 grams of the powder so here this one is sugar and you can look underneath there room-temperature water pretty well dissolved here's 25 grams of bran and kind of see it's a little bit more viscous it's still kind of global and then here's the Arista tog in it at room temperature water there's a few little crystals left in there they're pretty well dissolved so thinking about that so just that a little bit of a change there keep working this here so again my formulation of my spreadsheet tells me what a temperature and about a weight that I need to drive off for moisture and then one other thing while we're waiting it to get to temperature their syrups this one is our corn syrup you can kind of see and then here is our chicory root fiber our liquid in Ulan so I'm just going to take and dump these out so chicory root Fiber has a lower viscosity and the 43 is working its way out there so that's one of the things you have to consider when also reformulating and thinking about the process and it also affects your processing time as well because now if you have more moisture you need to cook longer or got a good boil here when I turn down the temperature a little bit keep mixing keep mixing so again so the process here so where we would at be at currently as we thought about the ingredients that we needed and we wanted to look at in reducing the sugar we kind of looked at them on the bench top and said okay I see how they're gonna line up now I'm putting them into the process of cooking them down and putting them into the place where the pectin wants to function and then we'll see how the other ingredients react in that area and once we have these deposited I'll show you some of the things that we look for and work through on the rest of the way there so we're this pectin batch is about a 5 minute or so boil kind of seen that pretty consistently with this type of a formula and we'll also see the weights here see we're at here we're getting closer about what a minute and a half away tour so it's got a good boil and then today another thing it's a great thing being at home learning to work at home you had to deal with zoom meetings school but also wonderfully great questions I've been able to actually dig in a little bit deeper and explain what's going on and then my daughter's have helped me with picking out flavors so today this is going to be a strawberry flavor I don't have access to a library but I have access to mcCormick at the grocery store our lay our colors are also grocery store colors so getting creative that way I'll show you when we get over to our starch molds over here how we've had to be creative with that as well here that's the other thing too is with benchtop space it's not quite like being in the lab you can only have so much space because if you start approaching on your kitchen table everybody else is a workspace doesn't make for happy co-workers if you know them saying all right so let's see we are just about there couple more grams of moisture loss and we should be right about the target solids they're a positive temperature see what we're at here yep we're about just a touch away in the temperature as well so it's looking all very consistent to a full sugar product all right we're at the target stalls where we need to be turn off the heat we'll let it cool down a little bit not a nice thing is I got the breeze coming in from outside so it's kind of work nice to work in your kitchen this way all right so I would say this process of the erythritol in there process very very similarly so today it's gonna be green strawberry erythritol gummies so this would be the point if I wanted to add some sweetener high intensity sweetener I would do that I won't necessarily always do it on the first try I would probably wait to the next one because I want to see how the flavor might just have packed it in general so I will just keep the high intensity sweetener out there out of there for right now here we go here's the strawberry flavor or extract that smells good good choice alright and then next I'm just gonna add our acid which will start the process of the pectin wanting to set both the solids and the acid will help it want to set here so stir this in and then you know go grab a funnel here and then we'll meet you over at the starch molds I'm also using a silicon mold because that's becoming more prevalent in the space as well that does require a little bit different solids and a little bit different temperature on the progress and there all right there we go funnel and spit in a hot oven so that way the product will flow and now we're just gonna go oh I got to move my mold there so we had to get creative with our molds since I didn't have a mold at home but I have some very resourceful kids that we're able to help me out so now we'll see again looking at this part of the process it's flowing nicely so I would say that we're looking really good this erythritol in there it's looking good try and make some of these because I will be saving these to look at in 24 hours we'll check out the texture see what's going on see how the flavor might have changed and plus they're just kind of really good to snack on they're fresh these will not be going to any customers just if anybody's curious on that this is literally I'm working through stuff here so that way when I get back in the lab I know where to start so I can continue on and moving in a fast manner and get you out samples that would meet your needs and also at that time potentially add the high intensity sweeteners real flavors from some of our different suppliers and there we go and then this is what was left in the pan we gonna make one giant gummy so where we are already so we've gone from hmm we've asked all these questions we picked up we wanted to try erythritol in there and see how that would work now we went through the process it looked good we put it in the starch in a silicone mold to see how they might react differently at this solids and then have you come over here Lydia we'll look at this so this was actually made yesterday so this was an L 90 43 de coeur and sarah sorbitol isomalt gummy so one way to check is so now that's sat in there we'll cut that and just see what does the inside look like another one that we made yesterday was this gummy worm with corn bran and gelatin and then after that I've had to go out and I really remove the starch from it just like you would in the plant I don't have a really good polish so again I've gotten creative I used some nonstick spray on the gummies that's kind of what they look like they're coming out and again we can check these since I polished them now we'll see you can see I got a little bit of air bubbles in there but I'll do the fingernail test cut and see how clear and go to set I have in there it cut pretty clean probably got a little bit of air bubbles in there because going fast here at home but there it is in a nutshell so again final recap on on sugar reduction at home is still the same thing would be in the lab I need to ask the questions of is it new is it existing what is in what is out how why are there claims that need to be made and then how is it going to process and then finally what is that final taste and texture and 22 high intensity sweetener gonna need to change the flavor out of these ingredients work with your existing flavors so as you can see it's doable it's fun working with family at home but thank you for joining me in my kitchen again my name is Chad Rishel if you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me or if you have a car you'll contact currently please reach out to them with any questions or ingredient questions we want to continue to help you drive your projects forward during this time and in the future so looking forward to working with you thank you and take care [Music]", "o9TfvoA2XAI": "    Ok it's not that easy But I'll show you how it's done! To start\nyou're going to need gelatin, sugar And of course Rose a wine! I found the gummy bear mold  online for less than ten dollars And they include a dropper to\nmake it easier to fill Measure out 1 cup of Rose on low to medium\nheat.  Cook the rose' in a small saucepan and do not let it boil Next add a half cup of sugar and whisk\nit until it dissolves slowly add in the gelatin one packet at a time into the\nmixture. Four to five package should do the trick   After whisking the mixture - pour it into\nthe molds. I used the dropper for better accuracy but a spoon works too This recipe will make at least eighty to\na hundred gummy bears depending on the size of mold you use. Let it set for at\nleast two hours and when you've done pop out the gummys. They looks so cute at first you\nalmost don't want to eat them but remember keep them away from children as\nthey may retain some of the alcohol but for the adults, rose a gummy bears make\ngreat gifts for bachelorette parties or even wedding favors! So that recipe was a\nlittle too complicated for you don't go drinking that road they just yet put it down because we have an easier\nrecipe. Take some store-bought gummies and place them in a bowl. I used\ngrapefruit flavors but any kind will do. Pour the rose' over the gummies\ncover and set in the fridge for 10 hours the gummies will expand. To serve\nplace them into a jar with a lid now They're ready to eat! Again make sure to\nkeep these away from children.

regular Prosecco and then this pink Prosecco so that I'll have two different color gummy bears but regardless of color whether it's champagne Prosecco or cava the recipe is the same in a pot combine 250 millilitres of Prosecco 6 grams of agar and 25 grams of sugar get the pot on medium heat and bring the mixture up to a boil for one to two minutes agar needs to boil in order to gel properly so make sure it hits a rolling boil for at least a minute pull the mixture off the heat and at this point I like to transfer it to a smaller bowl to prevent it from cooling down too quickly next you'll need some gummy bear molds I just got these on Amazon they were really affordable and easy to find and place these molds onto a sheet pan this just makes them easier to move later then use a dropper this one actually came with the molds to stream the Prosecco mixture into the little gummy bear cavities [Music] place the gummy bears in the fridge for 20 to 30 minutes until firm oh now I'm just gonna repeat this whole process with the regular Prosecco so again 250 millilitres of Prosecco 6 grams of agar agar and 25 grams of sugar bring it all up to a boil for one to two minutes transfer to a small container and use a dropper to fill the gummy bear molds while I'm doing that I'd just like to take a minute to thank living gin for sponsoring today's video by using their egg our agar in this recipe we're able to keep these gummy bears which are traditionally full of gelatin completely plant-based if you're looking to replace gelatin and any of your recipes or are wanting to try out these Prosecco gummy bears check out the link in the description box below for where you can purchase the living gin agar agar that I'm using here there are also a bunch of recipes on their website as well as on their Instagram both of which I'll also link to and if you're feeling competitive and are interested in getting your recipes featured by them they recently started holding monthly vegan recipe contests where people vote for their favorite recipe so if you want to submit a recipe or you just want to go have a look at the submissions and vote then definitely head over to their website once the gummy bears are set up you can pop them out of the molds and serve one thing to keep in mind is that the texture of these gummy bears is a little bit less chewy than gelatin based gummies what I found helps to get that texture is just to leave these out to dry a little bit overnight on a wire rack something about dehydrating them a bit gives them that really nice chewy gummy bear texture

with me welcome to the second video today and this is the second video that is new Earth's New Year's Eve inspired so these are some champagne gummy bears and I thought this would be so much fun they do taste alcoholic so if you're too young to drink alcohol or don't like alcohol I wouldn't recommend making me but if you want something that will give you I don't think they'll get you drunk but they're really cute addition to any New Year's Eve party or any Christmas party and they have some gold leaf in them so this is edible gold leaf kind of expensive but if you want to go all out for something special for Christmas or New Year's this is like the cutest treat and it's so fun of putting the gold leaf in the gummy bear containers I don't know why it's weird that way but yeah I think these are so pretty and they're so sparkly and just like something that you totally wouldn't expect with gummy bears and also before we get started I'm doing a Christmas chew and a soon and I forgotten many times asked you guys for questions so I'm a filling within the next few days so if you have any questions that you've ever one to ask me it can be anything um definitely ask me down below and I'll make sure to answer it in the Q&A which is going live on Christmas morning or sometime on Christmas so you know let's get started and make the coming bears so first wrinkle the gelatin into the water and let develop for 5 minutes for the champagne into a small pot and bring it to a simmer add the gelatin and whisk until philippe salt sprinkle some gold leaf flakes into the inside of a gummy bear mold and gently pour the liquid on top place them all in the fridge until the gummy bears have fully set for about 30 minutes so you can eat these as is or package them into little cellophane bags for a New Year's Eve gift or you can pop them into some champagne glasses and top with some champagne for a cute sparkly touch to your cocktail and you are done so thank you guys so much for watching I hope you like this recipe I make sure to stay tuned tomorrow for an only cookies recipe we're getting so close to Christmas I can't believe it's almost finished this is like the

recipe so last not last year two years ago you guys when I made this champagne jellies video I opened the bottle and it like exploded all over my kitchen and I lost like half the bottle of champagne and it was a bigger bottle than this so I'm quite glad that why am i happy I don't know well I'm hopeful that it's not gonna happen this year Oh the scariest thing my heart is racing so much oh my god such a baby [Music] even how you do it I don't even know oh my god oh my god Paddington I'm scared help me he's playing he's such a little turret okay all right the worst thing that's gonna happen is like I'm gonna lose an eye and that's not very good um oh my god oh well let's fight enough technically it can't go anywhere right yeah okay so please holy crap I'm trying so hard not to swear I can feel it release it oh my god sorry for nothing we're good", "qVwUhPEchho": "[Music] it's Thomas from frolic and I figured it's time for me to sit down with you and discuss a crisis that's going on we're in a lemon-peel crisis okay stores crack seed stores Long's Walmart anywhere you can find kind of crack seed they've been selling out of lemon peel and this is like the first time it's happened in forever but I feel like in the last six months eight months or so people have been going crazy for lemon peel gummies and so you know the origin of it is is a little muddy I heard it it comes from Hilo I also heard that it was probably started here on Oahu but whatever it is people are hooked on it like crack so we're gonna rank this it's a blind tasting I don't know any of the brands are that are here I've never seen the packages yet but we're gonna go through them and try some lemon peel gummies and see just one it's kind of light on the lemon peel but Asian off there where you can get the flavor of it lemon peel gummy beat there's a blue one but I want to try the red one oh so this one I've noticed the texture of the lemon peel is much finer so it's not as clumpy as the first first one mmm it's a totally different gummy it's very sweet compared to the first one that's especially on the level of the gum in the gummy I feel like the lemon peel doesn't come as through as strong as on the first one though lemon peel gummy sea hmm right off the bat it's very light on them in peel like almost non-existent I cannot taste it lemon peel gummy D Oh diva has a face this one is kind of light on the lemon peel - it's almost like a dusting mmm I don't know if I like that one I got cracker cuz we gotta cleanse the palate between gummy bears so I like the cracker where you got the cracker from okay lemon peel gummy e this one oh she is sticky okay this one this one is sticky so we know this one is a wet lemon peel Oh actually I got a double berry I got I got twins here so let's try the twins mm-hmm okay light it's light on the lemon peel favorite flavor but the sticky texture hmm okay I gotta know I get more of the lemon peel taste down this one's almost sour I think it could be the bears that are different but it's the the flavor of the bear kind of works with the lemon peel and it's this one's pretty good lemon peel gummy so this one what Oh what's a different one okay so I'm liking the coverage of the lemon peel on this like completely coats the bear the bear is much is actually smaller too I'm liking the taste of this one the best actually it's very it's very balanced compared to the others go let me lemon peel gummy bear G so last one in our taste test this one tastes like it's been marinating in the min peel for a long time it definitely has that the flavor runs throughout and the chunks are big on this one like I don't know the other ones not so much but like this one you can like definitely see that there's big pieces of lemon peel so if you like lemon peel this might be your one I think I think I think I know which how I'm gonna rank my first on my favorite one that I tasted is gonna be this one this is e F F okay let's see who made this one Oh son sunchang grocery where's that Kaneohe Oh China Town oh oh that's where you get the lemon peel from so that's why I probably tastes the best okay my second one was probably this last one that I tasted this one Oh Lonnie's Lani's okay this is this one was a special delivery - this one's from Hilo and apparently that's where Gump lemon peel gummies are from so if you know somebody in Hilo you know they can pick up Lonnie's for you and send them back but probably got to pay double okay the third one I liked was this one cuz a texture the texture was sticky and I think they use wet lemon peels so who is this one Oh family grocery Oh where's this one oh okay one windward side bear oh that's good okay that's different I like I said it didn't taste that one before most surprising because the ones I normally prefer are the dry but it was pretty good for a wet lemon peel and you know probably got to eat that one with toothpick or chopsticks because though the other ones are dry but that one is gonna stick to your fingers so gotta watch out yeah that's that's my top three [Music] you [Music]", "USXB5rmOnmk": "hey guys it's ro welcome to another nerdy nummies today I'm

out check it out take a listen you guys requested that I make a cute back-to-school treat so we're gonna be making something from my new cookbook look what we're making fruit gummies they are so cute look how cute these are I'm gonna be using our little nerdy nummies mold but you can use whatever silicone mold you have at home that you find and you think it's so cute and you want to make it into a little fruit snack they're gonna make some fruit gummies today let's get started okay so Lindsey you've been on the show before we bake together before yes we made some treats we made a cake and a little tart but have you ever made gummies like candy before no this is a first for me and they look delicious so let's get thinking and look also how simple this is I was gonna say that what the ingredients here yeah now this is for three different flavors you could just do one if you want to like if you have a favorite gummy flavor hmm do that one I can do just watch out the like like these are the examples you've given but could I do like a grape if I love grape yes you can do any make gosh yes you could do grape fruit juice but we're using grape juice orange juice and it's strawberry puree that's what I'm excited about so I'll be putting all of these ingredients and their measurements down below so if you want to follow along go ahead it's down there for you but for the grape juice we've got the gelatin and maple syrup for the orange juice gelatin and maple syrup but then for the strawberry gelatin and a little bit of honey a little extra sweet yeah and we just make them each one at a time and then we fill them into this cute little mold and again is whatever mold you want I'm just using the nerdy nummies one because it's so adorable and I thought how perfect for back-to-school has a little smart cookie yeah oh my gosh I do a little smart cookie so hard yeah a little bit hard a little dinosaur Stegosaurus all the cool things in school this mold right here is from the road baking mine and if you're interested in it I'll put a link down below and what's cool is they have these little squeezes yeah Oh new step ones a little bit of prep Lindsey hold this cute little Bowl okay and then you want to spray it because these are very detailed designs and you want to stick he want him to pop out easily all right just just move it over there I don't want to get you too bad oh geez here we go here oh oh put the tape on this okay that's done and now Lindsey which one do you want to make first which flavor I'm kind of feeling the strawberry puree okay all right so I'm gonna hand this over to you okay and a medium sized saucepan so we're gonna add the three ingredients pour it okay yep everything oh it smells so good it'll delicious smells like just pure strawberries fresh movie though it it smell is this literally just a blended up strawberry or pureed strawberry yeah that's it that's amazing okay and a little bit of gelatin shake that in there shake shake deep deep deep deep DDP and honey it's a little oh my gosh that looks so good I can't strawberry and honey I can freeze that and just do a popsicle right now we could oh no no now your next cookbook I like to stay focused ro okay okay cool so di Lindsey I'm gonna have you do this it's super easy just whisk together those three ingredients together get everything mixed in get all blended and then we're just gonna let it sit for five minutes to bloom once it's blue we're gonna take that little pot and head over to the stove I could tell that you like your advancer cuz you're like you have such good posture and you look so pretty when you're doing it I'm like it's like a little little lady I was imagining pictures cauldrons call me witches but I'll take your magical [Laughter] okay my arms getting tired I need to get on your leg at work okay I'm good good we'll let it sit let it use this this little muscle right that's how bakers are so buff I mean really though we've already got the arms as Baker's right yeah we need the core in the squat so sometimes I like to do these when something's microwaving or baking because it really helped my arms are getting a little strong from all that whisking and also I have to carry around cookie all the time like your cute little dog Luna I can tell her with my finger is cookie she's 25 pounds right now so Lunas six pounds so that's a big difference like cookies like a you-know-who bowling balls I remember when we were at Justine's birthday and we were like standing around holding hot dogs just talking and I wanted to feel like a part of the group right so I pick up cookie this huge double bowling ball after a while like am i starting to lean back just like oh oh thanks Mike see this is what I looked like at the party oh yeah same girl I mean the other day so we're I mean at all okay clean clean she just don't kiss it it really wants to kiss your face and you didn't let her I'm sorry about it all right it's been sitting for five minutes and it is only bloomed look at that it's thickened it's a little firmer now we're gonna take this over to the stove on a medium heat and we're gonna let it simmer for just a couple minutes and then we bring it right back here okay do it girl okay it's like Oh medium we hurry iris yeah here I'll go oh as it starts to warm up it it gets all liquid me again just whisk a couple minutes then we take it back over here we take the little dropper and put it in the mold done all right we just took this off the stove be careful it's really hot and we're taking these little teardrop urse which come with it and you just you suck up a little bit and then put it in the mold I love the way this smells by the way isn't this so cute so we just oh yeah it doesn't have to be perfect and you're just gonna keep doing this fill up the whole tray and once it's full we're gonna pop these in the refrigerator to chill for 1 hour and while it's chilling we're gonna make another flavor okay here we go okay here we go in Oh a G in the fridge so while those fruit gummies are chilling in the fridge this is perfect we're gonna make two more flavors and I want to eat these like now yeah this is perfect so we can make two at a time we can do these together so I gave you the grape if that's okay Fanta I've got the orange the orange juice so pour in your grape juice and I'm gonna pour in the orange juice to a pot a little bit of gelatin or the gelatin first is it important to put the gelatin in first you can put it in second but I like to put it in first so it starts reacting right away so we don't have to wait as long for it to glue and then remember for these recipes I'm using maple syrup instead of honey this is just a sweet knit some nice natural sweetener I always like cooking with whenever I can honey or maple syrup I love that about your recipes actually they've been getting more and more like that over time and even you know if you're vegan and you don't want to use a gelatin they have a lot of gelatin replacements oh nice you could customize it you can make it for you all right let's mix these up and let them sit for five minutes I feel like this is a mix challenge I know who can with faster let me get my posture [Laughter] all the squats farther go home I just learned that the farther out you put your knees like the war at burns okay let us sit for five minutes five minutes to recover okay whoo litter bloom and let her burn bloom man a bloomin bird only a witch would have this and she's trying to block it with her body you show nymphal back your apples you found me out why do all those out there like big dip in the big boys oh man they're like okay now do the same thing is before I get your low-tier droppers and just plop them in the bowl oh yeah this is a little more liquidy this makes me want to drink a huge glass of orange juice right now it smells so good oh dear Oh Wendy you're so fast well I just had an accident but you know it's nice about this dropper accidents are very easily fixable yes yeah yes you can just flick it off or once they're done setting you just peel it so don't even worry about spilling you could use a little spoon I just like the dropper as they make a lot easier but you could use a spoon okay well no rush but I'm gonna play with your pup so Q are you adorable girl what a beautiful color like she actually is like blue yeah she's like this beautiful like blue-gray color and she's got these funny Sharky want some I know it kind of reminds me of like a Rottweiler oh my gosh Lindsey how did you beat me you really did such a good job motivation to play with the puppy is like I got a hurry you think I'm moving I'm gonna go so fast that I love her you're just also I think that's what makes you such a good you know baker and so inventive is the fact that that's your process fact that you're very meticulous you're very detail-oriented it's so and it's good it's slow it's good and that's why your cookbook is amazing I know everything you do amazing cuz you don't speed through it alright lanzhi let's put these in the fridge okay oh then we'll pop them out oh look at you look at you here I'll come help you not let me go the dog okay the gummies have chilled we've popped a few out here's what they look like look at they hold the shape so perfectly you can see all the little details and they're really easy to get out because this is a silicone mold and not a hard old like a like a metal one the metal ones are harder because you can't do this the silicone ones you just push them and boom look at that I have one Rhino I want to eat a dinosaur mmm I really want to try a strawberry one me too I think the puree one is gonna have the strongest flavor all of these gummies are a fruit gummy so the flavours are light and very natural but if you would like them to taste more like a candy like the gummies you see at the store like the gummy bears you add a little measurement of citric acid it's so good it makes it a little bit more tart and tastes more like a gummy bear so it's really up to you especially for kids whatever one you'd like you can't go wrong tada here are they delicious little fruit gummies that we've made today the recipe is in my new cookbook and I'll be putting a link down below and all the ingredients have you'd like to follow along a

today I'm going to show you how to make gummy bears at home this is a great fun recipe for the whole family and it's very easy so for starters into a cold saucepan add half a cup of cold water 2 tablespoons or 20 grams of plain unflavored gelatin and 185 gram packet of flavored gelatin or jelly mix use whatever flavor you want and this will determine the color and the flavor of your gummy bears now give this a quick mix together and then turn the stove on to a low to medium heat and just allow this mixture to warm slowly for 5 to 10 minutes and just give it a stir every now and then once the gelatin is fully dissolved just pour it into a jar that's suitable for pouring and allow it to cool for a couple of minutes while this is happening you can skim off some of the foam on the top if you like this is purely cosmetic and now I've got my bear mold here you can use whatever shaped mold you want to make whatever fruit animal or shape you'd like so simply pour the mixture into the mould and then into the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes until it sets repeat this process for any other flavors and colors you'd like then just carefully remove them from the mold and you're done guys you have got a gummy bear a great variation of this is to make sour gummy bears so to do this just sprinkle over a little bit of citric acid and will make them nice and sour don't go overboard as it is a preservative and enjoy these are a great idea if you're looking to have a bit of fun in the kitchen and of course they taste great too be sure to subscribe to my channel for more great recipes thanks for watching and I will catch you all on Thursday you", "vLm9VAXFl6I": "and so I'd still take my life in it a fruit roll-up what's up guys welcome back today I have yet another gummy video for you guys and I'm very excited about this one because I think it's going to make a lot of people's lives a lot easier and it is going to be delicious today we're going to be doing a little experiment making gummies out of two ingredients store-bought gummy bears tincture or coconut oil so I just bought some gummies from bulk barn any gummies are fine and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to melt these down and I'm gonna add to some of them tincture and to some of them coconut oil and we're gonna see how they're going to turn out I think the ones with tincture will turn out amazing the coconut oil ones I'm not so sure about so let's try it out and see how it goes PS these are like the best gummies ever they're the Albanese brand you can buy them at a lot of places and they're so good they have like the best flavors the green ones and the white ones are my favorite so I'm actually not going to use them for this recipe so I'm probably gonna eat them while I'm melting them first step is to sort your gummies you don't have to smoke them if you don't want to but I want all my colors to be separate all right let's do this so I separated my gummies into yellow and orange purple and then my favorite ones just to eat while I'm doing this and we're gonna melt them and then add in our ginger and coconut oil and see how it goes I have no idea how long it's going to take us to microwave them so I'm going to start with like 15 second intervals and just check on them and then we'll find out how long it takes to melt them without over putting them I don't know so start with these great ones here there's a total of 13 gummy bears in here and they're just regular sized right there I mean they're a little bit bigger than like kuriboh gummy bears um but they're pretty standard so I was going bears and you guys can even see that okay so I'm gonna check on them in about 15 seconds and see how warmed up and melted they are so that's 20 seconds and they're starting to melt but they still need a little bit more so I put it in there for another 10 seconds okay so this is a total of 30 seconds pretty much melted and good to go I'm gonna add my tincture into here for this amount of gummies I'm going to do 1/2 a teaspoon of tincture so it's just room temperature you don't want to have it like really cold or frozen because it will affect the heat from the gummy so we'll just put that half a teaspoon in so there it is and let's see how well this stirrer is in if it doesn't stir it hopefully you guys can see that can you oh you guys can't even see that there we go so hopefully that stirs in well and if it doesn't we are going to add some lesson and lecithin into this to help combine it but I think that there's enough things and the gummy bears to start with that we shouldn't have any issues getting this to emulsify or combine or whatever you want to call it so that looks pretty good and then we're just gonna put these into a mold the same way you would with homemade gummies and let them sit and we will move on to our next batch so this is quite a bit thicker then they're coming mixtures so it seems like it's kind of hard for the little syringe to pull it up so that's one a little bit of an issue here so let's see yeah see we can't really soak it up so our options would be to microwave it more so it gets more liquidy or to add more liquid but I do not want to add more liquid so I am going to put it in the microwave for another 10 seconds okay so that was another ten seconds for a total of 30 are sorry a total of 40 seconds and I think they should be good enough to be able to put into our molds so I have about half in the mold then it's being a little bit trickier to put in that I thought it was going to be I'm having some trouble like getting the the dropper to like suction it up and that's because it is really thick so again I'm going to put it into the microwave for another 10 seconds and warm it up some more now if you had a lot more going there zero melting I'm like I did it this won't be as much of an issue because the heat will contain itself because there's a larger amount because there's such a small amount that's getting cooled off quicker and thickening faster and also like my dropper is like has a limited stuff to suck up so that won't be if you're doing a larger amount but it's not hurting anything by putting it in the microwave for just like 10-15 second intervals you just have to make sure you work kind of fast so let's throw that back in okay so looks a little different now I guess it just melted a lot more it's a lot more liquidy and put these interim moles okay so I put the purple ones into a molds now let's try some more but with the coconut oil let's do the yellow ones one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so we'll do thirteen of them just like we did last time and then we're gonna microwave this I'm going to start it with 40 seconds okay here's our 40 seconds melted they're nice and liquidy still might be a bit of an issue with the syringe dropper thing but if you have like one of those bottles you can dispense them with that'll be like way easier but let's add in the coconut oil so I hope you know what nut oil is what I expect to be the most difficult but I think that there's already less lecithin in the gummy bears so the oil should be able to emulsify pretty good but we'll find out so let's have it half a teaspoon of coconut oil okay we got our half teaspoon let's mix that in so so far it's actually mixing in really well that's all something I do for gummy bears with tincture instead of coconut oil because they I think they taste better but I know that most people you should just have coconut oil on hand the texture is a little bit different with the coconut oil I'm going to put that back in the microwave for another like 15 seconds alright so I did another 10 seconds I thought 15 might be too much all right now let's put these in their molds it looks like it's a lot harder using these so I'm gonna use one of my squeeze bottles which will be a lot you hear well I guess I should say hopefully it will be a lot easier you can see that like the coconut oil's making it like that doesn't like stick to the sides of the bottle that much I'm actually very surprised how well the cup oil mixed in oh my god that's so hot oh god it burns okay so don't touch hot melted candy because it is really hot and it hurts okay and this is cooled off a bit now that I've changed the bottle so hopefully it comes out okay if not I'll put it until I got a hot bowl of water or something look at all that gelatin or gummies sitting on the top there and I gotta get him down I'm just gonna leave this to sit upwards to get this to come down guys it's just it's it's too sticky this didn't really work that well either I'm gonna take the metal cap off and I'm gonna put it in the microwave just like this hopefully that works okay I did it ten seconds in the microwave it still doesn't look like it's gonna come out like this No okay this is not working either see another way that we can get this into the mold I mean like it's still gonna taste delicious I'm probably gonna have to eat a lot of this like just peel out of the bowl and stuff okay my plan was to cut a hole and squish this through but I don't think that's gonna happen well let's let's try see oh it's working okay I mean it's a little hardened now Oh No okay this is not working very well okay so the melting of the gummy bears and adding coconut oil didn't work very well I don't know why it seems like it almost got like harder like I now I'm just wondering if I like I microwaved it too many times like I don't know it just it won't come out really it's too thick to come out of anything so I'm gonna make another batch with the tincture just to test that out um again and see it's like it's definitely going to work or if it's user error and I mean it still I'd still take my get it a fruit roll-up it still tastes good if you wanted to you just melt them and then I mean this is really good little easy to get through oh look but you could just melt it and put it onto like parchment paper or silicone and peel it off after and just cut it into strips it's like the same thing it just won't be in the molds the actual gummy product mixed really well - coconut oil it tastes amazing of course you just they just happen to make sure it's pretty making the mold so still work very good I'll be snacking on this later okay let's do some more with the orange gummies and let's put some more tincture and then this time 1112 where do we do 13 or 12 I remember 30 I think and you don't have to do 13 so it's just the number I'm doing I don't know just - just what it is I'm doing and yeah you can just use whatever amount you want obviously you're really good okay let's microwave this you've got 30 seconds we're gonna do double the tincture so one teaspoon instead of half a teaspoon see this looks like it might have been too much tincture too much liquid and they might not set but you could always add more gelatin but I have a feeling these will set they'll just be a lot softer but if you want them to be able to firmer you could just add a sprinkle of gelatin a little more liquidy consistency as will definitely be easier to put into our moulds hopefully this one works a bit better I think it will we just got to act fast I mean using a dropper I probably would've been fine I don't know why decided to use this because it's such a small amount coming out already there we go oh yeah that's perfect oh and also just FYI if you buy these bottles which are really great for gummy making when you're making larger amounts not like this much died by making the tape it comes with like this I don't know if you can see that it's really really small and the gummy mixture is usually too thick to come out so I just put a different tip that's a little bit wider on there to make sure it can get through this was really difficult to use with such a small amount that I had so use a dropper if you have one this is usually my go-to option to squeeze things into molds but because there is such little amount when I squeeze it it's not really doing anything whereas if there was like this much gummy make sure when I squeeze it the pressure would push it out but because I made such a small amount obviously it's gonna be a little bit trickier I will just eat this out of the bottle later I'm just going to put the gummies that I need into the fridge probably for like 20 minutes alright guys I'm back but it hasn't been 20 minutes it's been two days so I took the gummies Oh after 20 minutes and they were not nearly hard enough I couldn't even really get them out of their molds so I put them in the freezer for a little bit like about half an hour and once they were hard enough I popped them all out of their molds and just left them on some parchment paper but they still were a little bit too squishy and too like corn syrupy so I left them out for a day and they were still a little bit too squishy Tomo for another day which is where we are now so it's been two days and they are perfect so if you guys make these just leave them out on a piece of parchment paper for a couple days depending on how humid it is wherever you live it might be a little bit different like it's not very humid where I live at all um so they dry up pretty quick but if you live somewhere very humid they might take a lot longer to dry or they might even not work for you in the first place so I'll show you what they look like so both the purple and the orange ones turned out very well you can see they're sticky obviously because they are sticking to my fingers so they are a little bit stickier than like a regular gummy but they're they don't really stick together in the bag because I've let them dry out for a few days so the purple ones had half a teaspoon of tincture in them and the orange ones had double that amount so they had one teaspoon of tincture and I thought they were gonna have a lot of issues but they're totally fine yeah they turned out very well and they taste just like the gummies did before I remoulded them last thing just to clarify um my gummies with the coconut oil didn't turn out only the ones with the tincture worked for me I don't know why the coconut oil ones didn't work if you guys know why please let me know because I'm very curious so yeah guys these turned out fantastic I'm super impressed with the results I definitely am gonna use this method many times in the future um going forward what I would do is for every 10 dummies I would do half a teaspoon of tincture so you can just multiply that by however many you want to make in total but based on what I've seen with these with half a teaspoon and the regular teaspoon they both turned out so you couldn't probably get away with using a little bit more but if you're looking for a starting point I would go with ten nine bears and half a teaspoon all right please let me know if you guys try this out I hope you enjoyed the video and let me know if there's any videos you would like to see I hope you guys enjoyed this video please comment like and subscribe thank you guys for watching have a wonderful day", "dFp1fTRlKtk": "what's up panda nation peter von panda here hey something you may not know about me is I love gummy bears love squishy chewy delicious these are the Haribo called gold gummy bears I'll put a link to in the description if you want to pick these up but one thing that I'm distressed about in the gummy bear world are the albanese candy sugar-free is sorted through gummy bears particularly the 5 pound bag available on amazon.com check it out I'll put a link to in the description but obviously some of you probably know that many of the reviews have been very critical of the Albanese gummy bears and I would just stop you know I'm deeply pained by it deeply pained and I want to read to you some of these descriptions in all seriousness and we're going to treat it with the reverence that it deserves because they can be disturbing and I'm going to get through it and we're going to we're going to be serious throughout the whole thing because obviously this is a heavy heavy subject so let me just start by reading you you know 390 reviews on these gummy bears and I think though the reviews speak for themselves oh man words cannot express what happened to me doctor genius the gummy bear cleanse you are someone that can tolerate the sugar substitute enjoy if you are like the dozens of people that tried my order run first of all for the taste I would read these a five so good soft true to taste fruit flavors like the sugar variety I was a happy camper but or should I say bought dutt not long after eating about 20 of these all hell broke loose i gastrointestinal experienced oops like nothing I've ever imagined cramps sweating bloating yawn my worst nightmare I've had food poisoning from some bad shellfish and that was all like Schiphol apart compared to what's going on inside then

I get into it I will say you are going to need some gummy bear molds I got this off Amazon for like five bucks you're also gonna need a saucepan a bowl to dump it in some gelatin just the Knox packets

shred fam here on YouTube thank you for doing that also hit that like button below but other than that let's get into this recipe so first things first you're gonna need 1/2 cup of warm water you're gonna take that warm water you're gonna dump it into your saucepan then you're going to take one scoop of your pre-workout hopefully you're not taking one of those big pre-workouts got a bunch of filler in it with a massive scoop because it might be a little it might not mix right but one scoop of this pre-workout works perfectly then you're going to take three NOx packets of the gelatin rip them all open dump them in there mix it all up then we're gonna take that and we're gonna go put it on a burner so we're gonna turn the burner to a low heat and you basically just want it to heat up slowly and the gelatin and the pre-workout and everything is going to dissolve completely you're gonna wait till it's dissolved completely and once it is and it starts to thicken so you want to wait until it starts getting more of like a syrupy consistency once it gets there and just figure that out by taking a little spoon in there and seeing how easily it dumps off the spoon you're going to take it off the burner you're going to pour it into just a little Bowl once you have it in that little Bowl I have a little dropper that I use to get it out of the bowl and into the little mold gummy bear molds if not and you're just pouring with the bowl that's totally fine too if you want to search amazon for the ones with the dropper I highly recommend it because it makes it a lot easier but basically you're going to get it out of the bowl you're going to take the dropper fill up as many gummy bears as it takes take that mold put it into the either the refrigerator for about two to three hours until it hardens or put it into the freezer if you're trying to get this done quickly take something like 15 to 20 minutes in the freezer you're gonna pull it out you're gonna be able to squeeze them out onto a plate you're gonna have little delicious gummy bears and the cool thing about it is this is probably with these little molds I got right here it's gonna make probably 20 to 25 different gummy bears so you get to eat 20 to 25 gummy bears all before your workout because this was just one scoop of the pre-workout and one scoop of the pre-workout is obviously fine to take before a workout so make sure you're eating all of them not just eating a couple of them because you're worried that you're eating gummy bears because these are healthy when you do it exactly how I showed you in this video and again if you're looking for the pre-workout that I'm using the pre-workout that I take every single day to take my workouts to new heights check out pre workout by sculpt

welcome back so today we're making some vegan gummy bears which means that these are going to grow us but they don't use gelatin so if you're vegan or if you don't need gelatin for any other reason this recipe is perfect for you so let's get started so you want to pour some juice and sugar into a small pot and bring it to a boil over medium heat then add some powdered agar which we are going to be using in place of gelatin and simmer for one minute then pour the mixture into a gummy bear mold and pop this into the fridge until set for about 20 minutes so you can just use juice as in or you can add some coconut milk to the juice and it gives you like this obviously like delicious coconut flavor but it also lightens the color of the juice so it's not like a pastel color that's an awesome option or route to go down I googled and try to see if we going with vegan and the answer I got was it isn't so that's why I didn't use any food coloring in this recipe so yeah so if you want to add coconut milk what you want to do it for the juice and sugar into a small pot and bring it to a boil over medium heat then add the powdered agar and simmer for one minute and then add some coconut cream and mix until it's fully combined if you don't want to use coconut cream you can always use almond milk then pour the mixture into a gummy bear mold and pop this into the fridge in full set for about 20 minutes then just unmold the gummy bears and you are done net so thank you guys so much for watching I hope that you like this recipe if you would like more vegan recipes definitely comment what specific recipe you would like down below and I will get on that ASAP and make sure to stay tuned until next Tuesday because we are making a fidget spinner recipe and it's so cool I'm actually making it today so haven't made it yet but it's gonna be really cool so make sure to stay tuned and I love you guys so much and I hope you have a fantastic weekend thanks", "5-gIY7HuJNo": "they honestly turned out so good and I'm also going to show you guys how to make a coating on them that's like sour and fizzy kind of like on like the root beer ones you can buy at the store so these are actually like legitimate gummy bears instead of just like Harding jello like a lot of recipes have let me just show you them so you can see the texture of this is like really sticky this is what's making your gummy bears actually be like real store-bought guy bears and not just jello so here's the texture of the gummy make sure when it's still warm so you can really see that string yes this is just like candy nothing like just hard jello that you see recipes for so you know this is gonna be a good one so chewy just like the ones you buy in the store like they're so stretchy just like a gummy bear and like they're fizzy when you eat them so good hey guys welcome back today I'm going to show you how to make Mountain Dew soda bottle gummies I'm going to be using coconut oil to infuse mine but you can use butter or a tincture all three of those options will work for this recipe you're going to need some soda you don't have to use Mountain Dew you can use whatever flavor you like you'll need some jello I chose line because it's the closest to Magic Mountain Dew without like over powering and I'm do flavour some gelatin citric acid corn syrup lecithin potassium sorbate mixture which will keep your products shelf stable so you don't have to put it in the fridge you can just keep it in a drawer or in your car or whoever and I'll post the link for how to make this and some coconut oil you can also use butter or a teacher I actually would prefer to use a tincture for this but I don't have any right now so I'm just going to use coconut oil I made them last night and they turned out really well with the coconut oil I feel like you can taste the coconut oil flavor a little bit more than if you were to use like a tincture but whatever you would like to choose you can use because I made quite a bit yesterday for this recipe I'm going to do a smaller amount in the description box below I'll put the measurements for what I'm doing today but you can make whatever amount you like just multiply the recipe I have it below to make this recipe we're going to have to reduce our soda so that we can get the flavor without too much liquid we need half a cup of soda and then we're going to reduce it to a quarter cup alright we have half a cup here we're going to put on a stove on high and we're going to move let this cook for however long tanks to do half of the mixture so I'm just kind of going to have to eyeball it and see where it is and when it looks like it's a little bit lower I'll pour back my measuring cup and see where I'm at so we started with half a cup so we wanted to be 1/4 cup this will probably take about like 15 minutes now that we have our soda on the stove reducing we're going to prepare our gelatin so we're going to put 1/4 of a cup of our soda into a why dish dish so 1/4 cup and we'll just pour it into a dish and then we're going to put our gelatin on we need one and a half tablespoons of gelatin alright so we put 1/4 cup of soda into this bowl and then we're going to sprinkle a tablespoon and a half of gelatin on top so we're just going to sprinkle it lightly over so we can get as much much coverage as possible so that's one tablespoon and then we're going to do half tablespoon for a total of one and a half tablespoons then we're going to add 1/4 to 1/2 of a jello of flavored jello pack so yesterday I made these with more regular gelatin and no jello pack I need these ones here and while he turned out good I felt like the flavor wasn't strong enough and it needed like a little bit more flavor so I thought this time around I would add a little bit of jello so it can be anywhere between a quarter and a half of this depending on how much flavor you think you want so you can always take this out and measure it but I can just eyeball it we're going to sprinkle this on top so it may be like a third of it and then we're just gonna leave this we're not gonna stir it in we're not gonna do anything with it we're just going to leave it here and by the time you get back around to it most of the gelatin will have absorbed absorbed into the soda now we're going to add an a quarter of a teaspoon of this potassium sorbate mixture again I'll put a link down below this is gonna help it so you don't have to keep it in the fridge you can keep this outside in the fridge it's just like regular got me to buy from a store and then we're going to do a quarter teaspoon of citric acid the citric acid is not necessary it's just if you like them a little bit more sour if you don't have citric acid you could crush up vitamin C tablets and those who work as well so we're doing one quarter teaspoon and then we're gonna add in a teaspoon of lecithin I only have the pill capsules cuz that's what was cheaper for me to buy but if you can buy the liquid kind it would be a lot easier because it'll save you from having to bust these open now my coconut oil already has less of shin in it so I'm not going to add too much this mixture but if your coconut oil doesn't have less its it lecithin in it then you might want to add a little bit more of this so I'm just gonna do one for mine if I had the liquid kind I could just pour oh I probably would just do a quarter teaspoon so this is gonna help bind the coconut oil together with the gelatin liquid mixture so that our coconut oil doesn't separate from everything else and like I said I have more of this already in my coconut oil so I don't need too much in here but if you don't have any in your coconut oil you're going to want to add a bit more to your jello mixture and I barely even got out any with the pills really actually just by the liquid all right now let's check in on our soda we started with half a cup and you need to reduce it to a quarter cup so I'm just going to pour it directly right back into my measuring cup and see we're at all right looks like we're exactly a quarter cup which means I probably should have checked on this sooner that way I couldn't have reduced it too much but if you do end up reducing you too much just throw it away and do it again soda can always be replaced all right so I'm just going to pour my reduced quarter cup of soda back into the pot and then I'm going to add a quarter cup of corn syrup now this is the most important thing for your gummies to be like a real store-bought gummy so corn syrup helps but will helps the most is having the sugar heat it to a high enough temperature to get it almost to the softball stage so I'm gonna use a candy thermometer for that I know most people aren't going to have one of these but if you are planning on making gummies often I usually just purchasing one they're probably like something like ten dollars and they can be very helpful with making your dimes so I'm trying to put it on here and we're going to try and eat this to 230 degrees Fahrenheit now because you guys most of you guys won't have a candy thermometer I'm going to try and see if I could help you out by just telling you the time so I'm going to turn this on high and I'm going to set a timer on my phone or a stopwatch so I started to now and we'll see what time rats when this is got into 230 degrees Fahrenheit all right so we're four minutes in and we're at 180 degrees Fahrenheit and we're waiting for this to go to 230 degrees Fahrenheit so it looks like it's starting to thicken a tiny bit but it's still pretty much all liquid it will started thinking a bit when it gets closer to 30 now you want to be careful to not go over to 30 that's why having a candy thermometer it's good because if you don't have one you can easily within 30 seconds to a minute go over temperature and then it becomes too hard so while having it to that higher temperature we'll give you that real kind bear consistency if you don't have the candy thermometer just ear on the side of not too long because you don't want to ruin it but luckily this is just sugar and soda so if we wreck this mixture and just throw it away and that's why we add the coconut oil after so that we make sure that this mixture is perfect before we add our coconut oil or a tincture or butter that way we're not risking wasting it all right we're at 210 degrees and it's moving up fast so we got to keep an eye on it now now I'm not gonna leave I'm not gonna leave this unattended I'm just gonna watch it up until the moment it gets to 230 Thunder 8 minutes and we're at to 3000 or at 2:30 so we have to take this off now take that off the heat immediately see how fast that happens holy yeah eight minutes on high heat okay this is getting a little too hot so I'm gonna go hold it by the fridge so it doesn't heat up anymore all right so we see how fast the temperature can go up so if you don't have a candy thermometer be very careful to really not let it get too hot you do want it to get as high as you can safely without your candy thermometer because that is what gives a texture the gummy bears but it is hard to do it with other thermometer so I just took this off the heat and left it for about like five minutes so I can demonstrate to you guys what happens here so you can see the texture of this is like really sticky this is what's making your gummy bears actually be like real store-bought guy bears and not just jello so this is the key out this they're just going to be like hard and jello so that's kind of like what it looks like and this is gonna melt back down when we put it back on the stove and mix in our coconut oil now I'm going to turn the heat on like medium I'm going to add two tablespoons of my coconut oil so have some medium heat and stirring in the coconut oil with the soda and corn syrup mixture that we just brought to 230 degrees now we don't want to add in the coconut oil right after it hits 230 we want to take it off the heat we want to let it cool for a little bit like I would say five minutes is fine because we don't want to be adding the coconut oil for something that's 230 degrees because that's too hot all right we're just stirring this in and you can see that it's not actually combining so there's the oil and there is the corn syrup mixture so we're going to need to get a whisk to combine this a little bit better now we're just going to try and stir like this we don't want ki to be too high medium or medium low is good now we're gonna add in our gelatin mixture which is gonna help bind this okay this is getting too hot you can see so I'm gonna turn the heat down to low just take that off for a minute so don't have that I'm too high I would say medium low will be perfect now we're going to add in our gelatin mixture so clearly I had that too warm I should not be bubbling that much so I know I said to put it on medium heat do not put it on medium do medium low or low okay now we just have to be patient and let it melt a bit more so this is the hardest part is getting this all to combine because the texture of the corn syrup might stay chunky and then it won't mix properly but if we keep it at a low enough heat and mix it in with the whisk we should be able to properly combine it and you do want to make sure you have the lesser thin to help emulsify it so this is going to take a while probably going to take about five minutes with me stirring this all in make sure you're patient and you don't turn up the heat trying to melt this fast because that just won't work out well so just keep it at low or medium low to stir this in and do it slowly and by slowly I don't mean whisking slowly but just take your time you can see the chunks are less stuck together now it's starting to combine now you want to make sure before you do this you have your molds prepared so just lay your molds oh and put them on a tree that way as soon as this is done you can pour them in the difference with this and most of the gumming recipes you see online is that this one has a different texture using that corn syrup and heating it up to that own soft ball point so it does harden really fast it is really sticky so once this is done and we're going to want to put it into the molds as soon as we can so I've been stirring this for close to 5 minutes now and almost everything has combined just a couple chunks left on my whisk so I'm just going to push those out with a spatula she's looking really good you can see it has that stringy texture it's not just like liquidy so it looks like it's just about all mix perfectly - that one little chunk there and this took about ten minutes of slowly stirring incorporating on low heat so now we're going to put this into our molds I'm using one of these to put it into my mold but you can also use the little droppers that works fine I just find that this is easier and if you're making a lot of gummies this is really useful overtime to spend like five dollars or whatever it was now I'm going to turn the heat off and pour this mixture right into my little squeezy container if you're going to use the little dropper you can put this on a hot pad and do it directly here whatever works for you okay now use ones I guess that's just a snack for me so that's alright so here's the texture of the gummy make sure when it's still warm she can really see that string yes this is just like candy nothing like just hard jello that you see recipes for so you know this is gonna be a good one so chewy just like the ones you buy in the store alright so I just wrap a towel around here because it's a little bit hot and it's right off the stove and I'm just going to put these into all of my molds you can also just use any molds going bury molds or find you now let's just put these into the fridge it shouldn't take too long probably about 10 minutes all right now we'll just take them out of the mold they were in the fridge for about 20 minutes you can see how they're kind of different than regular jello gummies like they really have that like that sticky gummy bear texture and that stickiness will go away after they dry out for a bit and we put their coating on you all right so now for coating on them I did in three different ways I did one with sugar coating one with a fizzy coating and then some with no coding so the ones on the top here I was just sugar so I just shook it in a container of sugar and put it back on the tray and then for the fizzy coating it's one third of a cup of sugar one teaspoon citric acid and then I'm going to say 1 teaspoon baking soda but that was too much baking soda so do half a teaspoon baking soda instead so here's that teaspoon of baking soda but like I said we're going to use half a teaspoon not a full teaspoon like I did you could taste it too much and I'm just gonna mix that up quickly once I just shake that up I'm gonna add the gummies into it shake it again and put them back on the tray the one thing I do want to mention with this recipe is you can put them in their sugar or citric acid mixture as soon as they come out of their mold whereas with some of the jello recipes you need them to drive it first these ones you don't need to do that so you can put them on right away in that way you can make sure they really stick whereas if they get too dry they won't the sugar won't stick to the outside of the gummy and if that does happen to you you can just spray them with a little bit of water and just wipe them off so they're a little bit damp and that stickiness comes back and that should work for you quite honestly I kind of enjoyed them with nothing on them the most but I really did enjoy the fizzy sugary coating anyways that's all you guys I hope you enjoyed this video please comment if you try it out and if you did enjoy it please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe I hope you guys have a wonderful day", "Z9jrHoPJb3k": "[Music] [ __ ] enemy how y'all feelin did they mention it today we don't be talking about some [ __ ] kind of nanos these are some edible gummies these shits or Varmus [ __ ] but before we get into that [ __ ] of course you know I gotta ask you where the [ __ ] is another [ __ ] guys please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always say it cuz always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that so you can get a notification anytime so don't forget the follow up [ __ ] over on Instagram this cannot underscore me cannot under [ __ ] score me alright so if you don't like the word [ __ ] mother pregnant you should probably go to another [ __ ] sample I'm gonna just tell you that [ __ ] right now alright so hitting my little uh my extreme cubing dad my weed man came through the other day I want to say you sailor sunday driver I'm not 100% sure but the shade is bomb and any other boy with a little ounce of shape for Christmas so that's dope what kind of lead man gives you Christmas yes what kind of nanos Matt he's [ __ ] right here I ain't gonna front they probably the dopest they're probably the dopest edibles in my opinion that I've had that's on the market that I've had sorry he's gonna need no booze on the market I'm saying it was on the market that's I've had okay so I really like them it's a hundred milligrams and the whole thing and it's five milligrams each dummy now a lot of [ __ ] be like oh 100 milligrams etting she got it had thousand milligrams if you got a thousand [ __ ] from the [ __ ] shop it probably wasn't a thousand milligrams I don't give a [ __ ] what you say or what you think it probably was not a thousand milligrams now some people can't take that [ __ ] don't get me wrong but most people can't because I've had a lot of people that has say a hundred that ain't [ __ ] I ain't got I'd do a thousand I'd do 500 and then they'll take like 10 or 15 of a real actual tested gummy and number uh gonna be [ __ ] up so I don't want to hear that [ __ ] so you know but don't get me wrong some people's tolerance is stronger than that [ __ ] you know cuz I also know that because my tolerance is like probably 40 54 where I like my high to be and if I wanted I could go 60 70 and still be like oh I wouldn't like out there but I could see people being over 100 but my point is you give them up like as a try on the dole singing it yo [ __ ] is to hide I think you need to take a month like a break if your tolerance is too goddamn much so anyway in Tunisia's ah let's see you got twenty gummies in here so I can say it's 100 milligrams one gummy is a serving and so you're looking at 23 servings in this [ __ ] no I'm sorry so many free calories per gummy okay when you're looking at the fat to zero fats about six grams of sugar and I mean six rounds of carbs and four grams of sugar so if you're on a keto diet this definitely is not the one for you and if you are vegan this is not for you or vegetarian this is not for you and the reason for that is because this does have gelatin in it which is weird though because the main ingredient is going to be agar but then they put gelatin in it so you could have just stopped with the agar instead of putting the gelatin in it and this is why I say this for companies that'll do this I give you when I come into the dispensary and they'll ask hey do you have any vegan gummies right that's understandable I've never remember you might have had a [ __ ] come in and say do you have non vegan gummies even make sense so the average person I'm talking probably 95 plus percent of people do not know the difference between a vegan gummy and when it comes to the taste so if I was a company I would just make all my [ __ ] vegan because it don't matter who will eat it because now it can get to anybody because no one's looking for the gelatin the market is not looking for the gelatin so I would just change that up if I was you [ __ ] because they have some that are vegan and those are good and there's no difference in the taste so to me they might as well just do all of them as vegan so I don't know why they only do a couple of women beginning some of them not but that's that so the other dope thing with this company is that they do them in sativa indica and hybrid so I like that because now you can get a little specific with your filling and your effects of [ __ ] and some companies stick to just doing this shit's hybrid which i think is it I think it makes sense because you know if the person walks up and that's the only gummy there some people would not [ __ ] with it if it's in the car and not [ __ ] wouldn't fit sativa but if it's hybrid they're like all right let's go [ __ ] it let me get it so I see the positives of that however the ones who are able to beast like specific admission I see there should fly off the shelves way quicker then a hybrid ones so this one right here is a cran a crammed pomegranate punch weird [ __ ] I don't know but it did taste good and the other cool thing with this is that it's enhanced nano molecular technology that they put in here in gummies and what man no molecular means whoa I don't even understand how that makes it react faster because it makes it react faster but what that means is that's just like a way of like I guess you could say measuring like how the speed of your molecules changing inside of your body so I think what's happening here is that they've sped up the process somehow of making the molecules in your body change for you to feel that humming um it's scented at two hour waiting game these [ __ ] is like probably 20-30 minutes if that like I got to give it to a one what was it last weekend for some reason I couldn't sleep welcome to 1:30 was up like a [ __ ] and I had to go rock climbing at like 10 o'clock or so I was tired as [ __ ] didn't want to go because I hadn't had any sleep whatsoever so I took ten milligrams of this [ __ ] and this [ __ ] was like a six hour energy drink like it was dope it really worked there was no crash I was like goddamn that [ __ ] is pretty bomb and so I like that versus that two hours you don't know when is gonna kick in type of filling cuz I've had that [ __ ] happen before once and some edibles cup but god I took the [ __ ] because it took so long for dumb [ __ ] to kick in I'm sitting there and I'm like mm-hmm hey y'all see that leprechaun run by look how things are turning out of nowhere you forgot you took some [ __ ] so uh I like these because they react a lot quicker so I definitely say give these shits a try now let me show you what they look like they like in little coin shapes and they are gluten free for all you gluten-free [ __ ] out there so it's a little sugar sprinkles on top of it mm-hmm so I'm fine and taste of them are really good no no she was bomb man actually there's really really good so it says that the candies Awards I never saw this really the winner most accurate formulated edible I guess that you mean it's pretty consistent and what they're doing in it I guess it's on mark of what is supposed to but yeah I got a really say my Anisha it's a pretty dope and another thing is some people don't like it we on 5 milligrams per they like oh how come I can't get nothing stronger it's still a hundred milligrams in the package whether I gave you 10 10 milligrams or 25 milligrams it's still the same [ __ ] amount and I personally like when they can chop it down like that because first of all some of these gummies are just good goddammit and I like that [ __ ] so I like to be able to eat more than one and that's one thing the other thing is you have more control over your dosing so let's say you want to go 25 instead of going 20 or 30 like 20 is not enough but 30 is too much so you just want to be at 25 I ain't the one for biting the [ __ ] in half and then putting that [ __ ] back you got me [ __ ] up I don't think that smart I don't think that's a sanitary I think this is like a nasty bout [ __ ] you put that [ __ ] back into the bag with the rest of my fingers now you'll slime it and touch the other ones he you nasty so for me I like to go put five milligrams and so I can like micro dose my [ __ ] and I can have more than one I will say this does give you a little bit of after cannabis he tastes but who gives a [ __ ] it's [ __ ] candidates like I hate when people be whining over to flavor like my Adeline fat and in my mind I'm like I would like to taste the vodka but I'll still take a shot I know you know like oh I just love that case well you say you like the taste of survive that is because it was smoother than the dog [ __ ] you started on back in the day so get the [ __ ] out here so you don't get a little cannabis taste just you know manna lemon woman up and grab you chronic leaves and [ __ ] take the tents guys damn it but even with that being said it's really just a good good gummy but you do get a little bit aftertaste a little bit weak but anyway so definitely I say [ __ ] these if you find these [ __ ] I say get them I'm gonna ask the the company when I see them why they don't just do it all it just you know Eggar and just make them all plant based versus doing the gelatin I say this ain't no like oh go on and be vegan and about that this is literally just to me from a company standpoint it'd be like if I was only in the company I would just make it where I know everybody can get it but I wouldn't even promote them as being safe vegan I would just put them out on the shelf and let them be what they are so that would be me if I was the one doing it but anyway that's the end of this video I hope you guys enjoyed it like I say have you seen these [ __ ] make sure you get them and before you get out of here make sure you subscribe and hit that peace you can get that [ __ ] notification alright and go follow me over on Instagram so anyway I'm out of this [ __ ] y'all keep the love going y'all love each other y'all keep the peace going and be peaceful too each other and I would see our [ __ ] a [ __ ] slated piece the one I want to hit the sequel we in the jungle smokin we in a jungle smokin", "1dld8NFfnB4": "hi guys so cuties today we're gonna draw a gummy bear so let's get started to draw this gummy bear working the first time I drawing the nose and mouth area so I'm just gonna come right here and draw a curve so this is gonna be a center of the bear so it's just a nice little curve and we're gonna round it off on both sides it's nice and even and we're just gonna draw a little curve that comes in to the center and back so it's kind of like a jelly bean so towards the center and come back down and then at the bottom we're gonna add a curve so they're just going to do the mouth area okay and then right here in the center we're gonna draw a little oval for his nose there okay so then we're gonna come to this side right here and give it a draw circle for the eyes it's around the top right on this corner let's sit here about right here I'm gonna start a hand same thing on this size about right here just try to point across [Music] [Music] there now let's make them draw sec UI someone come in here with two small circles for highlights and the curve line at the bottom then shade in the top [Music] and the lines at the bottom so same thing on this side [Music] okay so we have the nose and the eyes in let's come over to the side right where the eye is we're just going to give it a little bit space and we're just gonna draw a curve right here so but right here I'm just gonna draw a slight curve just going to right drag this point right across that bub right here so same thing and then from there we're gonna come up here you can draw the ear so from right here come in a little bit or you can start right here just imagine this line going through so whichever way is easier for you I'm just gonna imagine that going through and about right here I'm just gonna give myself a little gap and I'm gonna draw a curve all the way over so if you're using a pencil you can just go all the way across and then you race that part later that's easier so we're just going to draw a curve right across so now we have a space for the ears and it's down a little bit more so in here we're just gonna draw a curve for the ears and same thing on this side all right there make sure about the same level and we got a little ears in now we're gonna come over here and tuck this curve in a tiny bit just to define the head area in the neck where it starts ok so then now we can come down a little bit more so we're gonna start to draw the arms so just pop it out a little bit more not too much because gummy bears are pretty compact so from there now we can come and straw the hands so I'll just do this side first so then we can now draw the other side a little bit later so I'm just going to bring this in and curve and come in so let's just same thing on this side so let's see here come down so let's give ourselves appointment drag this right across and above right here in the center area so I'm gonna aim for that point and then once again round it off man I'm going to end at this point about right here then connect okay so now for the body area right here we're gonna come in a little bit just trust slight curve on both sides so we're still keeping it pretty compact and then from there now we can draw the feet so come out a little bit and right here we're just gonna ground it off all right there start to bring it in and go all the way around oops okay and then same thing on this side there's just some days my hands don't work everything goes wrong so high right here okay and then I'm gonna bring this up just like the other side [Music] they're now in the center right here we're just going to add a little curve all the way across and then because this is my Dras acute gummy bear and we're going to come right here and add a little heart and that is pretty much it for this cute little gummy bear hope it inspires you to give it a try and thanks so much for watching if you loved it please give me a thumbs up and share it and remember to subscribe so you won't miss any new drastic you videos see you later you [Music]", "ppi0khS0s_8": "you want to taste this at your gas in it's pretty sour okay oh my god you better water everyone I'm Claire I'm in the v8s kitchen and today I am making gourmet sour patch kids this is not my best category of candy but I like sour okay that this will look like children that makes these more disturbing than I remember well I remember mmm they're good they they just crossed over into being not good it's like person was pretty good second one's pretty good third one would probably still be okay and then a four hundred bad I love the like mouth salivating sour coating it has a very chewy texture the coating I'm 99.9% sure is an extra sugar and citric acid and that's it so there's no flavor in the coating the flavor is the gummy part itself they once oh they're hugging same thing deserve it sighs fire I don't love sour and flaky these are really weird I don't hate it but they don't like it wow this is a big bag I don't know what these are these are watermelon sour patch kids but they're not in the shape of kids they're in the shape of watermelons they're good I wish they were more sour not really sour extreme sour I'm super excited about this I love sour oh wait okay now it's happening oh it's good no no what red is you don't like that I love that oh you are not gonna like the final one then don't have the only flavor than that Oh what are you kidding Delaney oh my god you did the best one the watermelon wrong I read love codes via regular ones you eat a whole bag cut your toe oh yeah like sandpaper example yeah just keep going up it's like a chemical exfoliator here ones last time you had one not that long ago actually so my younger child Cosmo is actually coming to work tomorrow because it's summer and camps are done and he is a sour aficionado he fancies himself like a real sour like he'll eat a whole lime oh wow the most important thing about it is the texture it's right now perfect chewy I know perfect it's very hard say that right now can we just talk by the shape real quick yeah I don't like that they're in the shape of first I mean they're supposed to be the shape children yeah why why are they called sour patch kids there has to be some character what what do you want in the shape of watermelon that's your job all right we're gonna clear this off and I'm gonna take a closer look how I used to carry through this when I worked in a restaurant I always get yelled at so you at least line them closer thank you all right we got some we got a Roy Roy Roy jib you've red orange yellow green blue I'm gonna know that yellow is lemon and orange is orange but green blue and red tick who knows could be it's anyone's guess I have the best idea ever let's trace Cosmo and use his shape I think will be very fun also I don't know how I'm gonna do that I want to taste each of these components separately it's really only sweet there's no sour flavor at all and some vague fruit flavoring I'm gonna taste another crystal coating I can say definitively citric acid and granular sugar that chewy texture I know it's gonna be difficult but there's really just one task everything else is just kind of assembly and is not so challenging time for my favorite part reading the ingredients sugar shocked invert sugar corn syrup modified corn starch are Taric acid citric acid natural artificial flavoring yellow six red 40 yellow five blue one sit yeah we gotta do some research to the computer this has they were originally created under the name of Mara's men in 1885 they were renamed to Sour Patch Kids likely to capitalize on the popularity of Cabbage Patch Kids makes sense oh my god okay this wait this would be a article from two years ago how to make oh okay how to make citrus candy tastes like sour patch kids candy so this is basically about a pastry chef who was candied such as peel and then tossing it in a sugar citric acid mix and candy peel does have that kind of chewy texture it's a really interesting idea a method that I'm thinking about in my head to take a combination of citrus peel and green apple and that may be the dehydrator and like create something like a pet a flea which is a natural like fruit gummy and see if I can get something close to that texture I don't know that's gonna work but it might come close enough and be so radical that we are just impressed and well it just kind of what Cosmo says but it could work I don't know what the process is gonna be yet in my mind I'm thinking of two main components one is candied citrus peel and one is green apple jelly which is what I used to start gushers and I'm gonna start by making the green apple jelly I need three and a half pounds of apples I and now I need seven cups of water I'm leaving the peel seven feet all intact the first step is to extract the pectin from the apples so I just simmer them in water all right I can't make green apple jelly on account of there's no gasps it's me bitched out to get me okay I need thin sheet metal like real thick okay let me back up I need to make my own cookie cutter yeah I'm gonna no no I'm gonna take a strip of metal and bend it into the mold that sounds great to maybe be an angle these have been cooking for 40 minutes the idea is that the pectin has been released from the fruit so I'm straining out the solids because I don't like clear jelly I just want the clear liquid with all the pectin in it that's what I should do is let this sit overnight and this will keep straining in the fridge and tomorrow when we come back add the sugar cook that down and then don't move on to the citrus peel but I have no idea that's gonna work and it might be a complete failure so I don't know I'm gonna reserve judgment until tomorrow I feel like it's day 1.5 yeah thank you I'm thinking that I can make like a patch of flee from the pith of the citrus which is very very very bitter but through a series of LAN ching and cooking in a sugar solution it becomes soft and also sweet and that some of the bitterness is taken out the question is how to get something that is the texture of citrus piss into something smooth and punchable I don't know I don't know I'm not gonna work but let's try it in this pot is that apple mixture that ice cream last night and now I'm adding sugar and this is cooking down and it will feel very firm while the apple jelly is cooking I'm going to break down my citrus and start to take cream peel off oh my god hi hi Cosmo when's the last time you had a sour patch kid for me it's been a little while oh yeah this is Cosmo your mom told me cause one that you really like sour so I'm gonna try to make them even more sour than sour patch kids one thing I think would be cool with a homemade version is if we really make the shape more lifelike so I thought maybe we could use your outline as the shape to cut the sour patch kids too and I don't have a plan yet it's just an idea so might not work you were just doing now all right so that's good one that's good there's a profile [Music] the ball awesome this is my apple jelly I'm gonna do I want to do a test on this I have some plates in the freezer cuz that's on your test for this set so when I run my finger through it it's supposed to wrinkle see it wrinkle it's done and now I'm gonna focus on my citrus I think that I would do I might do a lime flavor a Meyer lemon flavor and the lemon I might do cherry cuz we have some cherry juice I'm gonna try that what I need to do now is blanch all of these separately three times in boiling water three times three it's kind of a process this whole thing might not work and I might have spent the entire day of working on it for nothing [Music] click so once it's boiling I'm gonna bring it over to the sink drain the next step is to juice the citrus fruits that I've left over and use those as a flavoring Cosmo give me a hand punch and hop up right here you know there's a little step store for you so you can just start throwing the limes at the top right there then this oh now I know I'm ready three yeah I didn't know you have to do all this this thing is like a real high-tech kind of gadget I'm in against two-thirds of a cup I don't know I feel like I'm doing it wrong awesome that was fun thank you for your help let's see where we are I have all of my blanched peel and I have my juices and zest feeling it very organized at least I'm going to get this in a food processor and chop it up into little bits it smells so good I'm adding the lime zest I'm gonna add all the juice that we have and now the equal weight of sugar so 160 grams sugar okay now I'm gonna get this over onto the stove as I cook it the sugar will dissolve they become sweet and translucent and softer I have no idea what's gonna happen I don't know if it's gonna work best-case scenario is I get a very set very firm very delicious paste that I can spread into a layer and it sets and I've like made sour patch kids this is a wild stab in the dark hot-hot let's my nephew boom mmm oh my god but ashes good right like it's bitter but it's a nice bitter sweet tart balance it's very limey good right all right cool all right I'm gonna add to this some of the green apple jelly what a pretty color right who knew this gonna turn into this color I do not it hasn't fully set that you can see even now it's really really thick so I feel good about adding this as just a boost this is already getting very very thick that's one drop of leaf green gel a mint green yeah it's not that far off the texture is like it's rubbery in a good way and I think it's because of that it's gonna set up pretty firm so we have to just wait and see oh just like a lonely chicken hanging out excited to check out the green the green slime it's just like those discrete pieces of Peel so it's a little granular soothing minute toss this in some citric acid a city so sour to sour oh it hurts my teeth oh I'm gonna try cutting this into pieces and then dehydrating the pieces Bragg got a new dehydrator that he told me I could use but he had something in there so I have to make sure is he here what's he even got in there oh he's making fish jerky I didn't want this to be in with the fish it smells we have to get the old one I think Ivy's in here on I guess medium high just where it is now this is like old reliable this dehydrator it served us well and gourmet meats it does its job it's just bulky and clunky while this is dehydrating I want to try I want to try actually the cherry batch that I'm gonna make with the lemon but I'm gonna use a different assembly method where I basically blend it first before I cook it at a server solution to try to get it very very smooth all right it's pretty it's pretty smooth it's obviously much smoother than before so before I did 50 grams of jelly to about 160 grams of the toilet link it matters whatever this is on its way this is to really reduce down I don't know if Lucario is gonna do anything it's not gonna be the same this is cherry flavor that we've used it's not the most natural I'm more concerned by the texture which is still pretty bit see but definitely get cherry lots of good lemon flavor and not really terribly sweet at all this is going going to go into the fridge thank you so everything is sticky and it itself off and what I have left is the Meyer lemon peel the issues so far our taste and texture which is all of them but now I have to address the toughness of the texture so I think I'm going to pressure-cook it in some water to try to soften it to the point where I can really puree it she's gonna go on high [Music] I'm gonna feel these now cut I think that actually worked really well now I want to blend it to get it really smooth very hot so they try not to burn myself looks pretty good I mean it's a puree there's a little texture to it but other thing looks better than before oh no something got in it what is that oh what's happening I also have another idea I know I was talking about how I don't want to do that cooked sugar thing but this texture this is something you get from cooking sugar to a certain candy stage what I might do is add to that like a cook basically cook the corn syrup and combine them and let it set this is nice and thick I like made caramel okay taking this out oh god oh god I need floss okay okay so the sugar got too hot the corn syrup got too hot and then there just isn't a lot of volume in this bowl and so it the paddle was picking up the sugar before it could hit the fruit and start to incorporate but I think more than anything is the temperature issue Oh God okay I want to try this again basically and incorporate a couple of changes to mess it overall as a parting thought let's check on our lime mixture in here Oh a little bit of Bounce do you want to taste this yeah you can just you don't have to eat the whole thing don't ya right it's like sweet bitter sour the textures kind of weird it's like there's lost like little pieces in there I don't know about that math but but yeah thank you I think if this works it's like true innovation and that's exciting but it's also big if I'm proud of my method overall if not the result it's day three two and a half technically you it's really wet it's not really super elastic it just is it's more brittle I do have to work on the texture significantly today the flavor I like so I have to obviously come up with a different method this time last time I finally graded the zest juice them so I'm skipping all that to save time and I'm just going to do the citrus hats whole [Music] here's all my plants citrus when a pressure cook them one at a time so first I'm going to start with the limes I'm gonna go 15 minutes and the pressure cooker on high sorry you know someone needs a step look at this on high okay it's very fluffy just does that work a lot of air into it you can see how smooth it is but there are still some particles in there so I'm gonna force it through a fine-mesh strainer into a saucepan this is called a chinois this is a really useful tool for straining thick mixtures like this should I taste it real quick it tastes really bad it's gross but there's no sugar in it it's like eating a whole lime that you blended so I want to add fresh lime juice because I wanted to have a fresher lime flavor and then I'm going to add sugar cook this down like I did on day 2 I could be spending hours on this and have it not work it's not an ideal while the lime mixture is cooking down I'm going to pressure cook my remaining citrus here's everything I'm gonna just set this aside here is my cook down lime mixture it's very like congealed split pea soup that's good the sweetness helps balance it out a lot going to do the cook sugar and mix it together so the sweetness will increase on day two I cooked only corn syrup I'm going to do a mixture of corn syrup granulated sugar and water this time because that didn't go so well I'm gonna cook it to 260 Fahrenheit so I'm looking it we're close it's okay that's ready all right so I'm weighing out 200 grams actually we're gonna add some of this oh wow oh yeah it doesn't look fully incorporated maybe try adding a tablespoon of corn starch see if that does anything sometimes corn starch is just the answer is the cord search will help absorb some of the moisture honestly I do feel like that looks better I think the corn starch sort of found it and like not emulsified it but just brought it together I'm surprised the mixture doesn't seem to be firming up I expected it to start to harden much faster okay well it looks pretty weird it's not as smooth as I was hoping I'll check back on it in 10 minutes or so just to see what the texture is okay so it didn't I wouldn't say that it's set I would say that it stayed very goo like some help adding hard sugar to a firm mixture it became wetter it seems like I've defied the laws of physics here I really don't get it I didn't really think was gonna work so in some ways it's what I expected but I was hoping that it was gonna work so I am also disappointed so now I don't know gelatin code the gelatin route and see what happens I think I might have to do some research yeah well I think I'm gonna Google so one thing I've found on this website a little bit down the road when I have an actual thing to perform into Sour Patch Kids once you have the cut pieces of in this case paddock we this just soak them and enough Everclear to cover before you roll them in a coating of sugar is that ever clear desiccates the candy forming a leathery skin on its surface that will keep the rolling sugar from turning sticky and syrupy for several hours I guess I wasn't aware that Everclear is the brand of alcohol I just know it's a very high proof they sell basically just grain alcohol which is 190 proof that right Everclear enjoys tremendous brand recognition and a loyal and near cult status following that's the description what are they gonna do like give like tasting notes like the grain alcohol that was the only tip I've really picked up from that let me do a proper test with corn syrup the fruit the fruit juice to get everything to spin and and the apple jelly because I want everything really well incorporated before I start to cook it down so this one I'm going to try lemon instead of water I'll use some that cherry juice and the new plan is put everything in the blender and then cooking I like this plan better all right I'm going to take this over to the stove and once it reduces down I had a thermometer in this mixture it cooked down a lot and then I turned it up then I walked away and then it kind of burned and it also never got up to the right temperature so I think it is a failure let's just see so I want to pour this out of the pot so that I don't scrape any of the offensive burnt pieces with it it does not look good this thing will be soaking for a while Asha is kind of pretty I want to quickly try to whisk in a little bit of food coloring I'm gonna put in just like a drop of cherry flavor do a 1/4 teaspoon of citric acid smells very cherry Oh remember next time not too hot what is it he's burnt what a tingle okay made me feel like I was gonna pass out for her sighs I think there I put I put too much cherry flavor okay maybe that's it I also burned it a little but the bitterness is also that it's whole lemon in there oh that explain it does that make you feel better that makes me feel better but maybe it's gonna be great you know maybe like dust it with sugar stamp it out call it a day call it a day [Music] texture is not right rota help me but I'm afraid that I'm reaching the point where I have to scrap three days of work and start over how are you gonna shape it I'm so far from having decided on how I'm gonna shape it so it's more sugar no no it's not very sweet so bitter and sour sour bitter it tastes like cherry cough medicine kind of doing great though you're definitely on the right track don't show this part dude I just don't think it's gonna work I think that this whole thing is a huge waste of time it's so hard don't whisper I mean I'll do you want to trade can we trade do you want to smell like this it's not that bad well so where are you at right now what's going on I seem discouraged son I have no I have nothing to show you it's just one failed batch after another are you doing wrong I couldn't even tell you oh I'm so sick of eating steak it's so great to have a little fruit there you go you're gonna feel great okay I will try really go in there and fries can we if I try it we'll see what happens okay yeah what we you're oh you're on deep fry I don't really want to do that what's the next one [Music] we're trading places yeah there you go [Music] couple to talk to yourself I'm a lefty juice they're gonna know oil all right ready Oh God Oh God thumbs up okay ready it's hot over there [Music] thank you thank you [Music] I'm feeling like brakes are very important when you hit a road block and it was good to go over there and be a meal for five minutes but then I came back here and I still don't want to do it so it didn't really help the texture is so wrong with pureed citrus it's like maybe that's just not the way to go I think I have to just scrap this plant even though I did spend two days cooking with citrus and try a version I don't know try version of just juice just lemon juice I have limes here already cut I might as well try lime so maybe what I'll do is juice apple jelly sugar corn syrup let's start at 240 and we can always increase okay try to pour this out onto the parchment certainly the texture is smooth and they slide it onto a tray up in the fridge I feel good about that actually all right look at this mixture it's definitely different than before I mean this is the opposite the problem I was having like this has a dramatic sort of pull texture will try pectin I kind of forgotten what that texture of like stretchy sugar is like and it's not what we're going for I'm innocent mineral let's see they goo [Music] no the goo is still goo you said you were about this okay well after nearly a week in the fridge it has not firmed up at all it's still mush I don't act I don't want to look at it this new method using mostly sugar and corn syrup but then also gelatin and pectin in combination it sounds like a generally sound method to me but it does involve drying them and some of the resources I read said you can do that in dehydrator so we'll try that and we're also going to try that grain alcohol idea to really dehydrate the outer coating what's not ideal about this method is that it does rely on flavoring agents like flavoring oils not a more natural fruit derived flavor but it does let me introduce juice so that's that's a bonus Oh Concord okay that could be fun yeah you know a great flavor a sour cherry flavor and then I can do the other the citrus flavors red yellow orange have to get a mixture of sugar and corn syrup into a saucepan this mixture is just sugar and corn syrup and a little water to encourage it to dissolve and that's it then my Petri net gelatin measured out and I want to start hydrating the gelatin in the fruit juice I think I'm going to start flavor-wise with grape so this one this one will go completely solid it's already on its way all right where our 270 I'm just gonna pull this off you we can keep talking this just has to sit here what is this just some cooked sugar oh very good it is happy birthday that's the gift you can give me yes my gosh mytilini have fun happy birthday so I'm adding my citric acid by gelatin mixture jeez and now my food coloring I'm gonna add a little bit of eggplant and a little bit of the other purple so the idea here is that the heat from the sugar syrup is melting the gelatin okay now I'm gonna pour it out onto my parchment you can see it's definitely starting to set up already Oh God okay [Music] I'm very glad I greets this parchment I'm just trying to cut strips approximately whatever this is by whatever this is I can't I can't remember what the sizes were these I'm going to put in the dehydrator I shouldn't see what's happening in here what happened so that happened what happened was they melted because of the gelatin I think we have to put do it cold but put them in front of the fan in the fridge in the walk-in it's all up here maybe if I put it yeah yeah this is a good spot so the other thing that I want to try is I want to see what happens when I put some of this mixture in that grain alcohol that we got so this is Everclear 190 proof grain alcohol it's going to pour a little bit of this and I'm not exactly sure what the chemistry is unclear if it drives it out just on the surface to create kind of like a skin or if it really dries the whole thing out but let's let's try it I don't know the dream of a sour patch Cosmo is going getting further and further away there are certainly no kind of prefab silicone molds that fit the bill we're better off just punching them out look no do you read math man it's huge if you look at overall area yeah this one's bigger but it's not crazy this one is the best one so far this one is maybe perfect it already looks like me a little person I just have to thin out those arms really does little your ghost the only thing left to do is make more of our sugar mixture so I think I'm starting with lemon orange maybe I'll just it's like hockey puck of pectin and so basically I want to bring this up again after I add the gelatin into the saucepan and agility I have a feeling it's not fully dissolving all right citric acid maybe one drop of cherry flavor one goes to super red food coloring that looks pretty good let's look at the cherry such a firmer now so I just popped it out I want to try punching out some of the shapes oh my god it's so bouncy I can't even press this down into it oh there we go let's do that a thousand more times it I made it it's the sour patch penguin oh it's not that bad well what if I hold on I have such a good idea well I just figured something out which is the reason sour patch kids have no arms is because all of these limbs want to stick to themselves and each other really bad so I think if I continue to make these I have to start soaking them immediately in the green alcohol so that the outside dehydrates and then they become less sticky so I'm just gonna go ahead and make a couple extra flavors to have around me to taste this will now go into the fridge well it's still doing that lemon is good this one's good well this is coming down let's go into the walk-in and just check on the ones they're drying okay I'm gonna try they are very chewy they still you know they're still pretty springy but overall I think I think the step of drying it is a good one and maybe I should leave all of these batches in the walk-in with the pan on them overnight thank you all right it's now been several hours in the grain alcohol they're really not sticky at all on the outside so this is a great technique I think for making sure they don't stick together once these three new flavors are set I'll pop them out of the pans I've put them on a sheet tray and get them in the walk-in to really dry out and then tomorrow the plan is to cut them so if them in alcohol I think and then coat them in the citric acid mixture and then we're right and then we're done all right so it's hard to tell if they've really tried out or if they're just really cold they feel very firm more I think the orange more than the others I want to taste the orange the orange one looks really good I think maybe the best one yet and it is doing a little bit more of that whole flavors good it seems like the most successful batch yet the flavor is better and then this is the first one I made the sour cherry you get a nice pull but not like a crazy long stretch I don't think that I would gain anything from making anything over again I'm really happy with these so I want to focus on cutting out shapes you want me this is Cosmo as I can get we did this like weeks ago when I thought I was gonna be better at this so we're going to just take a few liberties and say that this is the shape I don't even like the shape though I'd almost rather do this one and make them really big it's just so much easier to punch out something this size you know I forgot to grease it it's not bad I think it's kind of cute it looks more like a baby all the sour patch kids are just gonna be the larger kind more like this one all right now I'm going to into production mode cutting all the shapes getting them in here - as I cut out each one I want to start soaking them in the grain alcohol because it will prevent them from sticking to each other so while these soak I can at least put together that's our coating so that's one part citric acid let's try two parts sugar know that I think it's good we're gonna go with this I'm just wondering if I should try to flavor the coating for each one I feel like I haven't done my best work so far and maybe this is my only opportunity to to impress alright so I'm gonna make three different flavors of the coating lemon orange and cherry I'm just gonna get everything in the dehydrator in small bits and then once it's dry I'll pulverize it in a spiced friend hopefully nothing bad happens try enough I think I'm just going to add all of the lemon to one here's orange give it a little taste but really so I'm ready to start the coating Oh [Music] these little guys it is an enormous size [Music] do they need double coats well done that was orange anyway okay finally done with all the coating I my three flavors I think they're done and I think they're done because I was told they have to be done because we don't have time to let them dry for a week so Oh Cosmo will love these they're extremely sour not even that sweet on citric acid there in the end I am proud of the relatively clean fruit flavor of each of the colors maybe those are that's like at your own risk it's quite sour the only thing that's left is to have people taste them hopefully they'll be kind and not too harsh yeah they're huge this might be like the resurface I think of the more than that you want to weigh I'm in sea nine point eight grams that's a lot all right let's see what one of the big guys 55.8 it's like you're getting a deal yeah exactly I love a deal now I've had a Linea a cheerio sour yeah it's really sour too much on the coating this is like a little sharper okay like adults hour this feels like good I'll take it big sharks are the flavor of this is fantastic thank you no I did the best I could you really I just wish I'd done better that's how I feel every literally every day oh they're done but they're not good they're very very welcome Oh so to send one home to Cosmo with our sincere apologies tell them that I struggled so hard when it came time to cut them you delivered on her on the more sour but yeah yeah yeah actually not a bad texture I like further to service you do really they have like a gingerbread man oh that was the cutter I used good to make them nice shape nice color great job thanks bro - thank God for rota okay final thoughts trying to keep it positive next time we have to do a gummy candy I do feel like I learned a lot this was just sort of like very repetitive and I wasted kind of three days of time on that weird citrus peel idea so this one was frustrating but now I know more for next time I think Cosmo is really gonna like these because they're so so her and maybe I should have tempered that citric acid coating but I know that I at least have one true fan and then as Cosmo and that's the important things to have pleased the people who already love sour patch kids is great I never want to see them again here's how you make gourmet Sour Patch Kids combine 1 cup sugar 3 tablespoons of water and 3/4 cup corn syrup in a small saucepan and bring to a boil starting to dissolve the sugar stop stirring and clip a candy thermometer to the side and cooked at 290 degrees Fahrenheit meanwhile bloom 50 grams of powdered unflavored gelatin in a half a cup of sour cherry lemon or orange juice then stir in 15 grams of pectin stir this mixture into the sugar syrup along with a pinch of salt then stir in one and a quarter teaspoons of citric acid and the corresponding fruit flavor oil or extract until smooth pour the mixture into a greased parchment lined pan and chill until set punch out shapes using your cutter and soak the cutouts in grain alcohol to dehydrate the surface place on a rack and chill uncovered in the refrigerator until very firm and chewy dehydrate lemon zest orange zest and dried sweet cherries in a dehydrator on high then grind into a powder combined with citric acid and granulated sugar to taste coat the sour patch kids in the correspondingly flavored sour sugar are you ready to try the sour house mom kids yeah this is really good would you say to sour nothing in six hours", "gy47dkoOlU0": "hi I'm Shireen the founder of my pain centre your number one research or tried and trusted CBD products all the products we sell I use my parents use and my friends use we don't sell any product that we haven't tried or that we use in our daily lives so visit us at my pain center calm hey one of the questions we've been getting a lot lately which makes sense due to cove in nineteen is i'm new to CBD where do i start and that is a great question there's so many products right now out with CBD in it it isn't hard to know like what is the best place to start do you start with gummies do you start with an oil do you start with tea do you start with honey do you like there's just there's so many things there's coffee there's bath bombs there's lotions there's shampoos there's soaps i'm gonna give it to you real easy if you are new to CBD and you just want to try to see if it helps you whether you're struggling with sleep anxiety stress or pain I will recommend gummy bears start with the gummy bears or any sort of edible so chocolate almonds peppermints but make sure that the product actually has CBD in it meaning if it is being sold on amazon.com technically they're not allowed to sell products with CBD in it so just be careful where you're purchasing your CBD from now if you are having pain I'm just gonna caveat this from the gummy bears if you are having some sort of pain in your body that's like localized so you're just hurting like right here in the back of your neck or on your hand like just right here this is hurting I would suggest a cream you don't really need a CBD gummy unless for some reason that pain is keeping you up at night then you can also in conjunction use the CBD gummy now you're probably thinking okay well on my paints intercom there's like ten different types of gummies where do I start so all the gummies are pretty similar we just offer different taste profiles to fit our customers need so we have a five milligram gummy a 10 milligram gummy 20 and then 25 the most popular place to start is a 10 milligram gummy now here's the thing with CBD there is no set dosage that I can tell you is what you need everybody is so different it all depends on your weight your body genetics what you just ate what you're using it for how out-of-sync your body is so for example our bodies are like cars and we have to tune them and if you haven't tuned your body in a while you may need a little bit more CBD in the beginning to tune your car but it really doesn't matter about you and your you could have a partner and one of your partners could take a 10 milligram gummy and feel the same effects that you would need to take a 20 milligram gummy for it just varies like that so I'll give an example like I'll take a 10 milligram gummy during the day like if I'm about to like step into a really intense meeting or I have to get on the highway right I mean right now it's not as bad getting on the highway but I'm in Florida and we have a highway called I 4 and it's just a hot mess and so if I'm getting on i-4 I'll take a 10 milligram gummy I have a customer that's 280 pounds and if he takes a 10 milligram gummy he falls asleep he gets drowsy and that is a side effect of gummy bear or any CBD if you take too much of a CBD product like it's too strong for you one of the biggest side effects is drowsiness so when you first start with CVD I was highly highly highly recommend you tried in the evening before you go to bed and not when you're operating any heavy machinery like a car so I start I usually tell people start with a 10 milligram if you do start to think you're feeling drowsy you can always cut it in half I take ten milligrams during the day for random things and then I'll take a 20 milligram gummy at night for sleep if I really want a really amazing sleep I may take a 25 milligram gummy so I'll just show you quickly like what the gummy bears look like so you know so these are these are our 10 milligram gummy bears this is just like a regular gummy bear that you would find like Hasbro gummy bear the ones at the movie theaters we sell these in a regular flavor and a sour flavor sour bear flavor as well and those are really good they taste like sour patch kids our 5 milligram gummy is also a sour patch it's a sour patch kid that's a 5 milligram gummy we've had some parents use those on their children for like a DD or anxiety I'm not advocating that you should use them on your children but I'm just saying that if you do want to use them on your children start with the 5 milligrams you'll also see like we have watermelon gummy bears and these are these are 10 milligram gummies as well just like the regular bears but they taste like watermelon so like I said each gummy bear just has a different flavor profile and then we have a 20 milligram profile gummy bear and then these are our 25 milligram gummy bears so these are apple rings tastes just like an apple ring smells like an apple ring we also have these in peach rings those are delicious too those will put you out I shouldn't say that they put me out I don't know if they'll put you out so it's just all about trying and testing so like I said I suggest a 10 milligram one see if it works if you're feeling more relaxed but it's not really putting you to sleep then take 2 at night you can take 3 at night if you want to as well and then once you figure out how many you need then you can come back and get a 20 or 25 milligram gummy as well so I hope that helps I didn't bring them here but I should have but we also have chocolate almonds those are 20 milligrams so if you prefer something sweet at night or something sweet during the day just be careful you don't have too many and then we also have a peppermint and our peppermints are actually butter mints and those are 50 milligrams and they have a little melatonin in them too so those are really great if you really really struggle with sleep and you really want to be knocked out but I'm gonna caveat all of this CBD doesn't work on everyone everybody everybody is different right how they react to CBD so I could be telling you a 15 milligram peppermint will put me out for like 6 7 hours it may not work on you and that's just something you're just gonna have to try CBD and see and I can't I can't tell you if it's gonna work on you or not so give it a try though I mean you have nothing to lose everything is 15 percent off on our site right now during the coronavirus chaos because we understand everybody is very anxious and stressed out right now and having trouble sleeping I can attest to that and just yeah let us know if you have any questions hit us up support at my pain center calm you can send us a DM on Instagram Twitter Facebook my pain center and we'll talk to you soon take care of have a good weekend and stay safe guys stay safe I don't know what I'm doing I'm sorry", "yYZH7B498gE": "[THEME - \"GUMMI

I like using scissors for this saves a little bit of time. cut the tops off, pop that all in there now the citric acid you got to be really\ncareful with this okay you definitely don't want to put too\nmuch though like any dish you can adjust it for taste so that's all the dry stuff in what you're going to do is carefully mix this up, picking up the powder from the bottom until it looks \nbasically even the liquid hasn't come to a boil yet what I'm going to do is prepare the pan in the meantime for the pan I use tin foil cake pans\naround 7-8 inches something like, and I get some plastic wrap so what do you do you tear off enough of a long piece so that you will have some overlap and make sure you do this away\nfrom the stove heat okay you definitely don't want this near an open flame, it will melt pretty quick press the plastic wrap into the pan like that so on either of the short sides nearly up and that you've got a really good overlap on\nthe far sides take that away for a bit it's nearly reached a boil at this point if you're going to be\nwatching it constantly, yes it is safe to turn the heat right up now what's important is that you do not\nsplash liquid up the side of the pan because if you do it will stick and it\nwill burn which is what you don't want alright.  so what I'm going to do is carefully nudge the heat up here okay so this is the stage of boil you're\nlooking for you'll notice on the far side of the pan a \nlittle bit did splash up and burn but as long as I don't pour the candy out through that, it should be okay if you want to test it what you do is gently move the spatula through the bottom of the pan and it comes to a full boil.  that's what\nI'm looking for turn the heat off put that to the side. get your dry ingredients ready and basically just pour them right in like that. set that to the side and now turn the heat back on right down to low heat though the purpose is this is to keep just enough heat going under this\nthat the gelatin dissolves completely before I put it in the pan it's been two or three minutes at low heat and what I've been doing is I have been\nscraping down the sides avoiding the burned patch to get the mixture back down into the main mass of ingredient here. it's very important\nthat you stir gently because even with that you can see that there are air bubbles that have been put into the gelatin and you\nreally don't want that it'll clear up when it settles but you still may have some on the top okay for this part I do get a glove because the pan has become pretty hot. and I'm going to pour very very slowly and if you'll notice the burnt piece is\nnot in here there you go now for those of you that don't like those\nbubbles on the top I'll show you quick how to do this like I said all you're going to do is lose\ncandy and once it's cold no one is really going to notice and no one is going to fault you for having an air bubble in things that taste this good, and if they do well just don't give them any, alright. there you go. pick that off, scrape it into a bowl and go again and if there's some that just won't quit you can just nudge them off into a corner I'm going to let this set on the counter top basically until it doesn't jiggle see that, there is way too much motion and\nwhen it's nearly set, I'll pop it in the fridge for a few hours and I'll show you how to cut it. so the gummies have been in the fridge for a couple of hours that's what it looks like now. this should come out quite easily. you just grab it on both sides there pull it right out of the pan, put the pan on the side that's clean. you can give it a quick wipe if you want and definitely use that again. before you turn it over you want to make sure that the plastic wrap is not stuck in too bad it looks pretty good so it's going to take it quick, turn it over, then giving it a tug from the sides you want to make sure it's all clean that edge is up, that's good see what I'm doing there, hold it flat that came off all in one piece what you're going to do is start cutting. make sure your hands are clean it's still a bit sticky. you're going to cut it in pieces like that. you can either use a small knife like I've got if you want to get fancy and do worms and stuff, you can do that actually I think I will get a larger knife, it's a lot easier and I'll show you, just a minute if you get a nice French knife and after you cut one strip off what you do is get there kind of rock it through what you want to do is pull off strips like this once you've got your strip pulled off, I would do them all in strips like that first so once you've got enough room, then you want to start cutting them up like that in little squares that's what I have that bowl there for see on the other side there you might have a few air bubbles and who\ncares. I think those are pretty good treat size I'm going to finish chopping these up there is today's recipe, sour gummy\ncandy I really hope you guys try this out,  it's\njust awesome, it really really is look at the color of that and if you wanted, you could if you\nwanted get a cookie cutter or something and maybe do little shapes or stars or whatever\nyou felt like if you could get a small enough cookie cutter for this.  personally once people have tasted these things, they won't really care what they look like so once again thank you for watching my\nstuff and I'll see again", "jZYpZTfWLmA": "today's video is sponsored by raid Shadow legends in today's video we're going to see what happens if we try to freeze-dry a one pound gummy bear [Music] [Applause] since you guys are aware a 1 pound gummy bear is 11 servings I say it's like maybe 2 for me but according to this the back of our 1 pound gummy bear it should only be 11 servings but a 319 carbs 1,300 calories this is fantastic it also says it's equal to 280 standard sized gummy bears so we've got two of these 1 pound gummy bears you may have seen that these are not the biggest gummy bears in the world but we figured that this was a pretty good step up from our standard size they don't stand up real great by themselves but we want to see what happens when we freeze-dried should be kind of interesting now we don't actually know if it's gonna get all the way through a gummy bear in the past we have freeze-dried dubbing bears when we have freeze-dried gummy worms got some really cool results they puff up they turn into kind of like a crunchy cheeto that goes gelatinous it's very different but because of what Callie was just saying that we don't know if it'll make it all the way through we've got two gummy bears and we tried two different ways one of them will just be on the tray and we're gonna see what happens - I need your other one few times the other one we're going to slice up into smaller pieces so that poor gummy bear will not be all in one piece we just want to see if that's necessary to get the whole thing to freeze-dry and it might be freeze drivers aren't really designed to get through like this is almost 2 inches thick in some places so we can set our freeze dryer on a little bit higher heat and I think we can set it to go for extra time and we may just have to run it through a second time even after the first time through but we're gonna see what we can do to have the best chance of getting this gummy bear to freeze dry entirely because if it does that'd be cool and we've had like the little gummy bears have like we pulled inside so not these particular governors we did have some trouble in the past with Albanese gummy candies I believe I tried gummy worms from them and while the trolly gummy worms they puff up beautifully the albanese ones for some reason didn't I don't know if it's just because it's a different recipe exactly but I do love these they are the best I got this bag for my birthday and I'm halfway through it so I do want to throw some of these on the tray as a control as well right here we have that just like that and then this one you're just gonna slice up maybe not quite a quarter-inch but not much more than that I want to try a couple like paper-thin slices okay so see what happens of course that requires being able to slice through gummy bear before we load the freeze dryer with these colorful gummy bears though we want to tell you about something real raw dark epic and awesome oh are you referring to rage shadow legends of the massive multiplayer

them are you winning I'm playing hey winning are you we're not going for a glowing red that will just burn the dummy instantly see how that does haha you didn't want the joint you always want the torch Nate you always want the torch I am corrected so now if I put this back it's just gonna burn instantly so this is not a perfect solution you could have just burned it until it was char and let it come off that way and now if I try and cut it's just gonna back that burning there that's as thin as you're gonna get I think I'm so impressed almost wow that's gonna stay right there and this is now going to go this direction okay so we've got our gummy bear sliced up we've got our mini controls and we have our giant gummy bear we're gonna run this up to the freeze dryer it may take more than one day I'm betting it will but let's see what happens all right fingers crossed hopefully in a day and a half that we'll have done something if not we'll probably just set it for another cycle and run it again may go and it's possible that like the stuff on the bottom will freeze dry and the stuff on top won't we may flip it over if we have to do another cycle to get from the other side they'd see how that works we've also had it before where they have melted in the drying process if it's a soft enough material I don't think these are because we've never had that problem with the gummy worms in the past it's some of our chocolates good so we'll see what happens fingers crossed well these are things we freeze-dried them we did I did come in and set it for a new cycle at that point I flipped over the giant gummy bear it hasn't really changed much since then this is basically what it looked like except now it has fly spots on all the protrusions yeah yeah and you know I bet it the middle of this is still not completely freeze-dried but we got much better results than I thought we would especially on the blue one that we cut into pieces these look very puffed up yep well okay and we've mentioned this in the past even this is a denser material than you get out of like patrol Ebro gummy worms so this is Albanese and Albanese are sort of a thicker recipe we think we're not sure why but they don't puff up the same but even these have puffed up the decent about now I want a cone open okay start from these small and so this is just a normal sized red gummy bear what what exactly remember how hard it was to cut through yeah full sized I'm gonna try the spine of the knife and see if it's any harder no pretty much exactly the same okay so we've made cheeto dust with gummy bears again yep that's bizarre I just revived the process let's check out the inside of the biggest rat you pick it up fate has decided for us that it's time to see the inside of the big one and look at that that looks changed all the way through sounds pretty cheeto ewwww no no I was right oh yeah this does have more chew to it so what Albanese always does there's a little really chewy gummy in the middle yeah that red one was crazy [Music] and this pink one I was pretty crunchy we didn't actually weigh it beforehand to see if it was accurately 1 pound we were just going and supposedly about what the box said what case we've lost point 1 yeah 6 maybe pounds off and it is still like there is absolutely still a weight to it it absolutely doesn't feel as fluffy as they normally are this is still a dense I am going to measure all of the blue parts together to see if more weight has been lost from the one that we cut up it feels like it that's if we can get everything to stack and balance nicely on our scale new strategy okay new strategy a bowl uh-huh we're professionals 13 points that's actually more what and we ate ears off of it dude I bet the ear off of it so all right all right okay our blue one that seems to have puffed up more to me actually has more weight to it still it's crunchy like it's not soft and cheeto we like these ones normally are where they break in little pieces it's just sort of snapping like if your finger nope I couldn't I tried to get a slice that didn't quite work broke or too much for that but we might have invented the loudest food in the universe you know how people are like movie theaters are a place where people want silence let's make the loudest treat possible popcorn and give it to them and put the ball in a dark room together we've made something louder [Music] it's pretty crunchy I'm gonna cut open this one living is our biggest piece what the inside is like and pretty grungy all the way through I'll give it this so the flavor is so much stronger we find that a lot can we do this even though it has expanded I feel like the flavor condenses without the liquid in it like before you eat it and you're like like the first thing that hits you is this is a gummy texture next it's okay sweet and then you can kind of get the aftertaste of bluegrass right first thing that hits you here is I have blue raspberry in my nose that's interesting [Music] [Music] I'm now going to be tasting artificial cherry in my mouth until I die I do regret that blue raspberry that concentrated is good cherry that concentrated is cough syrup okay so I put this gummy bear in the water to see if it would do anything and it's just kind of slowly dissolving while it floats to the top now I've got water in the microwave to get really hot I don't see what happens to it in hot water instead of cold water oh wow I'm so angry about that I think it just air is escaping fast enough that it's like bubbling and I can smell it smell the lemon so warm water way faster I'm just gonna take a piece of our giant bear and throw that in there too I'll the steam the lemon ones and then I just took a big chunk of blue and drop it in and it was all the way gummy bear teeth [Music] what did you have today alright gummybear team now the deal [Music] how cool is anyone not as flavorful as kool-aid here's the weird part guys this is super bizarre that is delicious and I'm really upset about it all right guys we have freeze-dried yet another very odd thing what else do you want to see because you know that freeze dryer is gonna be around for a while let's go in the comments below thanks again to our sponsor rage shadow legends click the link in the description to get playing today guys that's not all you know we've always got more for you see hit that box up the top to check out the most recent video and we will see you in the next one talk to you then [Music]", "pptDV899P6E": "feed your students craving for understanding ways with the colorful gummy bear wave machine with simple and inexpensive materials this I catch and demonstration is great for the classroom all you will need is duct tape bamboo skewers ring stands clamps and of course some gummy bears use ring sense to elevate the tape and keep the setup Bridget be sure the tape is quite tense next place the skewers with gummy bears at roughly even intervals across the tape get your wave machine moving with a single pulse like this we can observe the propagation moving down the Machine due to the energy we insert by pushing down on the tape the gummy bears add mass to the system and slow the motion down so it is easy to observe show your students how waves reflect at fixed ends and even simulate the change in speed of a wave as they propagate through different indices of refraction have fun with this activity and let us know if you have any questions or any fun activity ideas we love hearing from you you", "db3sIVwDbUM": "- I feel like CBD is for people who do not have a weed plug, and can't afford a psychiatrist. (upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually.

a streaker so how come I haven't seen the blower on top in a while yeah do you guys not needing like in the beginning I remember yeah we we use it on Oreos like but most of the stuff does need the extra you know the extra push to get more drop it off yeah yeah and I'm sure the people at home but hey I don't care if I can't see the details I just want more chocolate yeah I was just gonna say I

times have you guys done this unmanned Rover before a couple time maybe turtle this is at least a second is it slightly less tedious doing it this way plus tedious we've been doing it by hand oh well it's a lot faster I'll tell ya yeah this board I mean still not really that fast is it just cuz there's so many yeah they're so like it'll still take you forever to do a whole bag yeah is that all one bag over there yeah that's okay awesome yeah they yeah it looks like line them up on the back is the way to go my dad you can do it it's suffereth we're getting there there I got to hurry up dummies thunk OH holy gummy well the gummies Batman so I haven't had gummy bears in many many many years so do each color have different flavors or they all taste the same yeah beacons can't eat bears yeah I think they're actually I think they have like gelatin in them or something oh yeah yeah I don't know jenos Swedish Fish well they're all red so it's probably won't taste red taste right yeah the red tastes a threat to me but the Scandinavian swimmers from Trader Joe's all the different tastes when Max get to it before it plops on the rug taste that was a close driveling drunkies very strong places like chocolate factories yeah that's how the old saying goes anyway yep can he do it has it ever actually fallen off yet yeah that's how I know how much time I have left yeah trial and error I just haven't been down here error and error yeah well how long has it been since it fell down it's been months okay so just in the beginning yeah it's good need adjusting the temperature dad [Music] [Music] to second they dumped abomination neck's is too thick I'm trying to lose weight right oh I was talking about like thick-headed I'll talk about thick-headed you know you could be like ethan klein thick all right so this is gonna be kelly's second bag ohh dummy bears yes yeah yeah you have any tips and tricks for people doing this Ellen well I don't really think many people are doing this at home hello are you I'm good you need any help let me know yeah because I don't think everybody would have proper equipment yeah we don't have the bags at home which I understand because I'm the new girl hmm so I understand that the orange scale is pretty famous I came over from the old country yeah so it's and it's it's very reliable so we like the orange ghetto and I can't imagine there's a lot of people who have machines to cover gummy bears but if they did if they did yeah then sure they should they could totally do this at home so you just pick them up to put them in the bag and blame on the scale all right pick them up and I put them in the bag and then I weigh them on this case in that order yeah yeah unless I'm really close because if you have all right let's let's add a few more do it okay so and you know I think that dark chocolate is lighter than milk chocolate hmm I think I've noticed that like one pound a one pound of dark chocolate is lighter than 1 pound of milk chef it no but if you're covering stuff I think it weighs different that make sense this is all in my head but that's ok ok so when it see then you got to be like oh we need one more it has to be accurate because nobody wants to get gypped on the chocolate mm-hmm that's not fun No so yeah I I got the dark chocolate ones and I have never tried chocolate-covered joiners gummy bears yeah I had before they weren't my favorite but some people are crazy about them right so what do you do what do you do after have you put them in the bags well after I get them wait because I'm really organized so I am like a system mm-hmm so what I do is I'll get a whole bunch together and then after that is I'm gonna weigh them when they're always on a label so should I come back when they're all waiting yeah and then we can like label them and state bloom and then barcode them and then we can get him on the Shelf that's totally fine sounds like fun what is this part 2 and part 3 part 3 we already know so this is part 3 and so what we do is we take the bag are you gonna get all the air out cuz nobody likes stale candy mm-hmm so get all the air out I'm gonna burping oh we burped the bag burps to being everybody and then we fold it nice and snug and then we have to put a label on mm-hmm see cuz presentation is everything how you determine which bag or which color goes on with bag well decision getting necessarily for color but you want a variety cuz nobody likes boring either yes we need a variety of colors and then we need to make sure that we have the right weight on it because if I put this out and I have the 4 ounce label then that's wrong we don't want to do that because you know it's the whole thing not corpse breathing down your neck that's right I mean like because then I'll get fired and I like just started here so I kind of wanna keep my job labeling is everything yeah you gotta have great label with the right weight and you gotta have it pretty and nice and snug because nobody likes that's a lot of things you're under all ones yeah needless to say I had no idea how much detail goes into being a candy wrapper yeah it's it's a little crazy and I also am just scratching the surface to what I'm going to learn yeah so Karen's teaching you the ways Karen is teaching me and your mom is teaching me so I am learning from the experts gotta get I've got to get it right because you know people are used to consistency too when you change something you don't you don't want them to be like aw I can tell Kelly wrap this in yeah and that would be my luck somebody wrap this wrong it doesn't look right I'll take Karen's handiwork we need to we need to repackage the whole thing alright so I know you're gonna keep doing that but can we show the people what you do next after that well then I got a barcode it okay so and oh yeah I have it right here oh boy so we have the dark chocolate gummy bears and half pound because we're doing a half pound and hey careful where you point that gun this yeah sorry all right where's Bowl see I hey that thing's loaded I haven't done anything today so I'm a pointer sorry no he's also had your thumb up - oh did look kind of like a guy yeah I'm not violent I promise I'm a non-violent individual I'm family candymaker that's right you know cuz candy makes people happy so why would you want to be violent mm-hmm so we're gonna paste I was wrong got a piece the barcode in there and do did you do gotta pick the right label and I gotta count how many bags because we don't want to waste labels or barcodes so I've got four five six seven 12 13 14 yup 14 bags those and we're gonna print out the labels so after all of these get packaged up all nice and pretty where you get the barcode on them and then we're gonna get best by dates that's my date yes it's not like the store see that's why I wasn't sure it is a sticker so we know that when you buy the candy it's fresh cuz you're gonna have fresh candy too so I'm gonna pull all of these I'm one have one perp cuz if I did that see any labels there are there would be no room by you might have Best Buy later so one of these I'll give you an example yeah what can you do that again case I missed it slow motion Wow I think people really got that in there and then we need Best Buy sticker but I don't know how long these last so I look that up too because everything that we have is different depending on what the product is dairy okay this is the only gun we use around here man all right so is that the last thing you do other than put it out there well no then I gotta write it on the handy-dandy clipboard so we know how many we have because then when we have the stuff we can put it online for the people mm-hmm and put on the shelf for the people so the people can come to all of the people and buy the candy and the chocolate-covered gummy bears which are ready yeah oh we're so where'd we put it out on the floor and they all have their little spots Olivia's gonna go here we've got our dark chocolate gummy bears and soon we'll have the four ounce and I think later I might be doing some of the milk chocolate gummy bears so that way we'll have these all back to replenish our stock from Christmas because everybody just loves us and just keeps buying it so yeah you know gotta get it out there for the people so it come to a very unfortunate decision this is gonna be our last shoutout video because there's so many shoutouts that people are requesting and we can't get to all of them so we feel really bad for the people who who asked and then never get it and they might be asking like 10 times but if we never see it we can't you know we can't do that shoutout because I used to answer every single comment and you see every single thing on every social media and then we got way too big I was a good thing I'm glad we're getting somebody comment so they can't get y'all I'm glad I'm glad we have so many people asked for shadows and we can't get to a mile but it's unfortunate for the people who are asking all the time so we're instead of leaving a couple people out or a lot of people out in the cold we're gonna leave everybody out in the cold warmer clime yeah so that's that's our solution to that problem it's gonna make the same thing for live streams just because when we do live streams everybody like almost everything will come and just ask them for a shoutout so if we were to do a live stream it would just basically just be us standing here just giving shoutouts and I think people want to see us making candy so if you do want to shout out if you do a super chat then we give you a shout out but other than that we'll we will just be answering questions and stuff for free so anyway to shout outs I have four four I have three ish okay is the an Alexander from Elizabeth New Jersey mm-hmm Keegan Graham from Lowell Massachusetts Carol and Leonard from Calgary Alberta Canada and Jennifer sinkovitz she didn't actually ask me for a shot up but she sent a note a thank-you note saying thanks for your YouTube channel I'm gonna subscriber I like it so there you go Jennifer and I'm not unasked-for shout out the way I'm ending this thing and I have a couple I have to take off my gloves so it's sanitary yeah I can't be touching ears I mean you can't take them off after using the camera to what you want clean candy-making okay it's just that hammer doesn't care about my camera they just care about the candy okay so Jules almond I think on how you say her name happy birthday to Kailyn Brown whose birthday was on December 5th yeah so we're telling you we're a little behind Angeline merger see from South Africa living in China and so she want me to say so that is all the the shoutouts for Hercules candy hope you enjoyed him yeah cuz it was good while it lasted this is the end my only friend hmm this is the end was that from a song I think the doors song probably yeah I'm sure our people will tell us probably [Music]",

Nutella if you didn't know a fresh jar to tell us and that means we are gonna be reviewing some gummies that's right guys we're back with more gummies I always know I'm telling you to be wary of gummies I'm weary of gummies and I'm wary of these gummies so this was a 500 milligrams worth of gummies don't worry I'm not eating all 500 milligrams today we're just gonna do a test to see if there any potent whatsoever I picked these up for 30 bucks at my dispensary so a very good deal if these are in fact 500 milligrams worth of gummies I doubt that that is gonna be the case this is the canna MX brand taste innovation only the finest quality there are 50 gummy bears in here in total with 10 milligrams per gummy bear so we are going to do 20 in total for 200 milligrams and we're gonna do our review on 200 milligrams of the canon mix in total canna MX canna mix I'm gonna go with canna mix is how you say that it's spelled canna MX all one word unless so again 30 bucks for 500 milligram gummy edible is a great deal if in fact it works but there are a lot of red flags chiefly the price you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles second the packaging this isn't cheap easy to make packaging it's just a sticker on a ziplock bag always a bad sign to we're almost always a bad sign I've had a couple of good things come in cheap packaging like this but not a lot um and just the fact they're gummies that's also usually a bad sign I have bad luck with gummies there are a lot of people unscrupulous folks out there making gummies that aren't worth they're a damn and I'm hoping that isn't gonna be the kids that can of MX we're gonna give him a totally fair shot so I have Nutella just to uh turley completely boost my of getting any kind of tolerance she's taking a little bit of extra fat with the gummies just to help process that THC so here we go let's open them up give the taste test the smell test all that fun stuff so you can see the gummies in there they look like pretty plain gummies they don't have any coating on them they don't have anything additional on them it smells both intensely fruity and intensely cannabis ewwww so here we go nothing on the outside they're not sticky or anything like that I'm just gonna grossly dip it right in Nutella get some fat going here there we go mm hmm well I didn't really taste any cannabis but that might be because I've got the Nutella on it but Wow okay a little bit of cannabis taste on that one okay let's just try one clean here there's a slight cannabis taste to them but really these are on the less cannabis II and of gummy taste that I for gummies or less cannabis II tasting gummies that I've had also a bad sign this is not gross tasting like the etta pure infused creations which I find really hard to stomach although I don't find those to be any good whatsoever so I'm hoping that doesn't mean that these are gonna be bad but we'll have to find out so I've eaten four already I'm gonna do sixteen more and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review you don't really care about how these can be Bears tastes you want to know if Kanna MX is something you should be buying in the future so guys I'll see you in two hours to let you know for sure thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I had the canna mx-5s quality 500 milligram gummies I only had 200 milligrams of them but there's not 200 milligrams of THC in there i am i high at all i'm like a - maybe somewhere in there don't feel pleasantly stoned I feel like I had to join an hour ago yeah [ __ ] Ken MX and their gummy bears it's a load of [ __ ] these aren't potent at all another crappy gummy and another crappy gummy company all the telltale signs were there that she priced the sticker the she packaging oh and all kin of MX no do not spend your money on these guys if you see them stay far far away I do have some of their chocolate bars to review maybe they'll be good I have seen where chocolate bars are still good and the gummy brands are bad where when people have both like um we get a flavor ex their chocolate isn't bad but their gummies are terrible so we'll see but as right now just pass on the gummy bears don't waste your money and [ __ ] these guys for you know where's the lab tested result where's the nutrition information where's all that good stuff it's not here because they don't want you to know because it's just gummy bears they bought off the shelf and infused maybe some cannabis in there possibly who knows maybe I'm just high because I smoked like two hours ago and that's what I'm still feeling not feeling anything most boy I this is like our sixth dud review in a row or something maybe we've had a string up they might not all come out in the order of duds in a row but I have reviewed a bunch of doodoo back to back to back I am really looking for a diamond in the rough a pleasant surprise I was hoping Kevin MX was it gonna be it I gave him a fair shot but definitely do not gonna be the gummy bears from them so final conclusion if you see Kanna mx4 now avoid everything I'll review their chocolate if their chocolates good I'll be sure to let you know we'll assess them fairly but for right now there's no reason to buy any of their products because if they're gonna rip you off with this it's more than likely they're gonna rip you off with other things so sorry to be a bummer guys I really wish we could have had something more fun for you but at least we know not to mix it up with Kanna MX or something so guys thank you so much for watching this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see on the next review peace", "JOc2ux2daIg": "hey everyone I just wanted to let you guys know that my online chocolate shop is now carrying dark chocolate truffles with the most delicious whipped dark chocolate ganache filling they're so good oh my gosh they're only available for a limited time and we do ship internationally so if you would like a box definitely check out the link in the description box down below hello everybody welcome back so as you may see I have a little guest here today that enthusiam camera and so today we are making some gummy bears for dogs and this is part of my little Paddington's pantry series because this if you look at the camera is Paddington my Pomeranian and every so often at me makes and dog friendly treats so today we are making some coming ears and I didn't know that dogs could eat gelatin for the longest time and once I heard that that was possible I'm like oh my gosh this needs to happen for you too so we are making a lot of element gummy bears today but actually not bears they are a little like bone shape how cute is this mold I'll have them will link in the description box if you would like to check it out and before we get started I'll someone let you guys know that I have a member the only exclusive Facebook group that'll give you guys access or will allow you guys fix - um actually dictate what videos I film and give you guys a lot of creative control over this channel and over my chocolate shop on Etsy so if you wanna learn more about that I'll have that link in the description box below but without further ado let's get started and look at me bears and also in that group you'll get like behind-the-scenes photos and videos of Paddington's okay let's get started so first what you want to do is place two cups of fresh watermelon in a food processor and pulse until smooth show you to remove any pulp and then measure one cup of watermelon juice and so I'm using waggling in this video just because it's safe for dogs and it's like a nice kind of flavor for gummy bears that I recommend be using fresh fruit and it kind of this way versus using store-bought juice just because there's a lot of additives in store-bought juice like for humans and you don't necessarily know if there's an ingredient in there that could harm your dog there's a sweetener called xylitol off it on the screen here and that is so toxic three dogs so you definitely want to avoid anything with that and any kind of artificial sweetener so just to be safe I'd stick with fresh fruits or dogs safe beef broth beef broth I've purchased um beef broth powder from the pet store and it's safe for dogs there's no onion or garlic in it which is also toxic to dogs so before you decide to make experi dogs just do a quick Google and make sure that the ingredient that you're using like for the juice is animal friendly or dog friendly um one thing to really stay away from is any kind of juice that contains grapes or grape juice obviously those are so toxic for dogs oh my gosh so definitely stay away from that but I just recommend like call your vet or do a quick google before but watermelon is safe and paddington like I was sitting on the couch the other night and I was eating watermelon and he saw me and literally like dough onto me because he wanted it so badly so and you want to kill some gelatin into some water and microwave for 15 to 30 seconds or until it's liquid and it regards to the gelatin there's a lot of chatting in this video but you want to make sure that you that you're using a Knox gelatin which is plain unflavored unsweetened gelatin and don't use jell-o that like the job of box dip powder um that's because there are artificial sweeteners in that too and those aren't safe for your dog so just to be safe I'd recommend using thin box gelatin and I'll have that linked in the description box below and Amazon if you want to pick them up they want to pour the liquid gelatin into the watermelon juice and mix well or they make sure enjoyed gummy bear or Minnie bone mold and but into the fridge until it's set for about one to two hours let's unmold feed them to your puppy and are done that is so if it guys so much for watching these yummy should be stored in the fridge will probably last you around like four or five days just because gummies don't tend to like last as long as like the regular kind of like hard baked cookie and when they're at room temperature they soften up pretty quickly so I definitely recommend storing the fridge if you guys try these out please please please send us photos and take us at pink open e & pennington underscore calm on Instagram we would love to see what you make and always makes me so happy to see your creations and yeah please subscribe button entering the notification Bell so you notified on the upload because I upload every day from Monday to Friday and you will see a lot of Paddington so if you love dog friendly recipes and you like something some creative ones this is definitely the channel for you so yes thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you tomorrow for another video", "BpKYde5BXHI": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you how to turn regular Cola bottle gummies into you guessed it infused Cola bottle bellies here's what you're going to need two tablespoons of warm water four ounces of Cola flavored gummies one-and-a-half teaspoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon of potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below one to two teaspoons of a herbal tincture if desired and a soda bottle mold the first step is to sprinkling a gelatin over the warm water there's no need to stir it just leave it to sit for about five minutes so it can bloom now you can take your Cola gummies and cut them so the lighter color is separated from the darker color place the lighter colored gummies into a dish and add about a quarter of your gelatin mixture then place it in the microwave for about 30 to 40 seconds until it melts once it's melted pour in some your tincture and then stir it in I'm going to be placing my mixture into a squeeze bottle and then putting it into a cup filled with warm water to keep it warm and liquid until I have everything ready to go now repeat this process with the other half of the gummies you'll be using your remaining amount of tincture and all of your gelatin my tincture is having some difficulties binding to the gummy mixture so I'm adding in about a teaspoon of lecithin to help it emulsify now I'm going to pour in both mixture at the same time putting the light color on the top and the dark color on the bottom once that's done I'll place them in the fridge or the freezer for about in half an hour so I can take them out of their mold [Music] I want some of them to be coated in sugar so I just filled a little bag with some sugar and shook them around and then I will leave these to sit out for about 24 hours so any excess moisture can evaporate that's it now your gummies are ready to be enjoyed [Music] thank you guys so much for watching if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and

mini reviews we take smaller size edibles this is a 200 milligram edible and review them in a smaller format than traditional instead of our 30 6120 I just come back with you guys at two hours later and let you know how we're feeling so today we are reviewing something that we have never reviewed before a new brand this is from mcclenney confections quality you can taste and feel we shall see as you said this is a 200 milligram edible handcrafted cannabis nougat and caramel dark Belgian chocolate and it's the dark sneakers I guess kind of like Snickers except dum sounding all-natural ingredients whatever that means 1 to 8 servings we're just gonna have one serving and it says at the top the portions of a portion of donations go to animal shelters in need which is great ok it's got kind of this fancy plastic packaging just sort of unique I've never seen packaging like this for an edible nicely sort of floral rounders just got this odd plastic packaging let's open it up see how difficult is this it's not so bad inside maybe the slightest slightest hint of marijuana smell but nothing that's gonna get you busted that's for sure more of a dark chocolate aroma as it says but let's go to try okay and it's pretty good you can see the nougat and caramel inside there wow that is pretty tasty it tastes kind of like a dark chocolate Snickers bar without peanuts it's good it's very good um I'm eating it refrigerated so it's a little cruel but I like it that way I could get it and suggest you try it that way so in terms of taste Wow those consumed excuse me this gets high marks for taste but the proof is in how high this is gonna give me this this family at 200 milligrams only cost me I believe seven bucks is pretty affordable but we will check back with you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling thanks for watching Leakes hi guys I'm back it has been two hours since I had the dark sneakers chocolate bar from mcclenney confections I've really enjoyed it this bad boy only costs me six bucks maybe seven bucks can't remember exactly which but it's a hell of a value good tasting really enjoy the taste no discernible marijuana taste whatsoever I'm pretty quality chocolate I think and over two hours later I'm still feeling pretty stoned so if you see a dark sneakers at a dispensary near you go ahead and grab one you're not going to be disappointed thanks so much for watching wheats we'll check you guys out on the next review", "KuADqkCoK84": "me Erica again we're here gonna do a tutorial about how to make sour worms and gummy bears with Lucas into white this is how you're going to need a little bit of lemon juice you're going to need a weekly stocking or any kind of chili pepper that you want and the turmoil and a bowl and a spoon so first I usually just put in a little bit of the lemon juice when I squeeze a bunch of the Chum wing and then I put looky there then I give it a little stir but more of the chili give it a little stir do it - it gets a little a little bit not too thick because when you after you're done adding your snack st. and you put you're going to put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes and this gets hard like not super hard to get Louise that's good ye up in the feedback my mom's messing up my video very she's leaving after the gummi bears are in you mix it in again and I want some worms I already have the lemon juice I think I got this at the Family Dollar for like a dollar I am I got this at HEB I got this one at on na Michoacana and I got all the candies at Walmart as 98 cents a bag or you to go to the Family Dollar and get the candies also but third daughter I really I'd rather get the 98 cents I make myself laughs our people oh so you mix and the worms you should have a little texture like this I'm gonna put some more of the Lucas a little more chewy mix it in there I throw in another bag will do the another one we're going to get crazy I'll see these were my kids York mr. cameraman Rene I'm going to eat one myself we're days continue stirring not be my crappy in my video all right hi everybody here just saved you a warm day hi everybody hi my son ready he's cute March annoying since I added more worms I wanted to be covered more Lucas mix it in there and we're done folks put it in the fridge or freezer for about 30 minutes and I'll come back and show you the result by this is a final product this is what your gummy worms chamoy worms should look like after being refrigerated see how it's kind of thick kind of sticky and I'm going to have my kids try it and see if they like it Marko's mmm-hmm they're good Peter you want to try one Peter does his own videos y'all want to follow Peter out of Peters movies how do they taste Peter this is oh thank you and that's it folks you want to make your kids happy by those gummy worms the dollar store and that's it bye", "6BxcporGcC4": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] did i ever tell you about my main man justin me and justin used to do hoodlum stuff together justin used to make violent stick figure animations and post them on the internet justin also had a band he called the band mentally justin is now marine there's a lot of things that make up a person many different elements that come together to make the delicious core of who they are gummy bears are no different you can't just do one gummy bear flavor and expect to be the bee's knees you gotta do multiple you gotta do this you gotta do that you gotta do the other and you have to do it all with military precision today the albanese world's best gummy bears look to take the crown from haribo themselves and man it's gonna be good the only way that this game advances is by people being bold and people being brash and the only way you do that is to make a statement and man did all bananas ever make i love the arrogance dude i love the arrogance of the soul you're gonna have a hell of a pair of peach pits and a couple of large dangling mango seeds clacking together to make a call out like this the world's best hell yeah dude from a flavor perspective it appears the albany's gummy bears have already won with 12 flavors of theirs and only five from the hairy bow now okay you could say oh but you could do five flavors really well and twelve really badly you could but what this shows is a creativity and a moxie to really go out there and break the status quo dude i want it to be better show me how much better it can be i mean who wouldn't want a better version of the harry well i know i certainly do let's find out just how good it is and crack this bad boy in half hold the phone hold the phone before we even get into the actual chewing aspect of it bro already albanese is winning with the resealable package right there look at that i could just seal this puppy right back up and with the hairy bow i don't get that i do not get that same sort of a distinction that convenience that i like okay albanese you're getting the point for that that's nice we've got the haribo gummy bears on the left and the albany's ones on the right and you can already tell the size difference is is monumental i mean come on now hold the phone for a second there's no doubt about it the albany's packs a lot more gummy into their bears homeboys obese talking about major thyroid problems and all that of the smell though that's where really the difference comes in because you can smell a lot more fruit flavor coming off the albany's bears as opposed to the hairy bose ones where there seems to be a bit more of a i don't want to say a plastic taste but it's a lot more muted and subdued whereas the albany's ones are a lot more explosive and more in your face it's very pleasant but it goes even deeper than that with the textures themselves also being wildly different the albanese is a lot squishier a lot more gummier a lot more malleable that kind of thing i'm decapitating homeboy here i apologize with the hairy bow being a lot firmer and a lot harder as well now whether that results in a chewier chew or anything like that i think it's gonna result with the albanese right here being a lot more chewier but we'll see if that's a good thing but before we go ahead and have a taste i have to give a big uh thank you to today's sponsor this long-nosed dog be the person he wants you to be [Music] which well i guess would just be somebody who feeds him or something i don't i don't know but let's go and go and have a taste oh please i can hardly bear it my dude this is a very close match because they're both doing their own distinctive things the same albeit a bit differently the flavor of the albanese is way fruitier i mean like you can taste every inch of that fruit every piece of juice everything that's coming off that thing you get the full experience right then and there but the hairy bow themselves while they aren't as fruity they're also not as sweet which is where the albanese kind of has a little bit of a borderline problem because it's almost too sweet it's almost on the borderline where it's like you eat more than five or six of these things and you feel like you're sick to your stomach or something like that you know it's going in between that line but it doesn't quite hit it whereas the hairy bow you can eat as many as you want these things never get tired but the question is are these better are they better than the gold standard well yes you know what i'm going to go ahead and say yes now not because the flavor is so much better than theirs but really it's because of the amount of flavors see i can have a bunch of haribo bears and get something consistent and delicious every single time but the spice of life is variety and the fact of the matter is these are on the same level as harrybo but there's way more flavors to go around making them i guess by process of elimination they really are the world's best but i mean it's so close i know it can be a bit confusing like how justin's mom would let me hang out with them anymore because she said i was a bad influence whatever that means anyway tune in next time for my next review the anarchist cookbook [Music]", "t2Pd-13M20g": "- I'm cosplaying as a gummy bear! (beep) (classical music) All right friends, Halloween is just around the corner and I have some issues with Halloween. First and foremost, a lot of gummy candies, which is like my favorite thing, are not vegan! I still think it's weird that strangers are giving out candy to children. So, (laughs) I wanted to see if I could make my own vegan version of gummy bears at home. Flip It is a series on my\nchannel where I take one thing, and make it into the vegan thing. So I'm going to take gummy bears today, substitute out the gelatin, which is not vegan, and substitute in agar agar, which is. (claps) So let's see if we\ncan make vegan gummy bears. (whirring) (pouring) (mellow electronic music) All right, what is agar agar you may ask? It is a seaweed or an algae. It has a little bit of a taste, but not much, it's very mild. But it acts the same way\ngelatin does, almost 100%. The only real difference is that it doesn't quite get as hard\nas traditional gummy bears, which is fine, they're just gummies that\nare a little bit softer. We are going to naturally sweeten them and also naturally color them. We're going to make a blue-purple color, we're going to make an\norange flavor and color, and we're going to make green ones. And I'm going to use\nspinach to turn it green. I'm going to use an\norange to make it orange; and taste like orange. And I'm going to use\nblueberries to make them purple. If you guys are new here, I'm Candace the Edgy Veg, and you should hit that subscribe button 'cause I make new videos every single Tuesdays and Thursdays. And if you like this series, give this video a big thumbs up 'cause you know it's gonna rock! Also appropriate that this\nis my Halloween video, that I have a new hair color. Oh, if you guys want to know where to get these\nlittle gummy bear molds, and then I not only have gummy bear molds, but also little bears and little robots and little dinosaurs. I'll leave a link to the\nAmazon thing that I used, just in the description box. Well, this comes with a dropper. All right, to make these\nas super, super simple, depending on the flavor\ncombinations that you want, and the color combinations that you want, really the possibilities are endless. What I like to use is just apple juice. It has a pretty neutral flavor. But you can use any sort of\njuice that's your favorite to achieve different flavors. Another think that I am going to do is just color them naturally as well, by blending different ingredients to get the color that I want. So if you want like red, you can use beets. If you want purple, you can use blueberries. So all I'm going to do is\ntake the apple juice... You could also do this if you want cocktail gummy bears. You can do this with wine as well. I've done ros\u00e9 ones, they're so good. But you just wanna blend whatever\nyou're using for the color together with your liquid. So whether it's water, whether it's apple juice, orange juice, wine, blend that together in a blender and add it to a small sauce pan. Bring that liquid to a simmer and add in your agar agar and give it a good whisk. Now you can taste it here\nto see if it's sweet enough. If you want to add extra sweetness, add some agave in there\nuntil it's dissolved. This will also make it\na little bit chewier, making it closer to the texture\nof traditional gummy bears. I find between maple syrup, agave, and regular sugar, the regular sugar sets the most naturally. It does get a little bit chewier than the agave or the maple syrup. I opted out of maple syrup just because you're always\ngoing to have that maple taste. Sugar and agave are a bit more neutral. All right, so I brought these to a simmer and then let them simmer\nwhile stirring constantly for about three minutes. And now I'm going to take\nmy little eye dropper and fill in my bears, my gummy bears. These are like little piggies. I thought they were\npiggies when I bought them, but they're little panda bears, gummy bears and robots. So the green is looking a\nlittle darker than I would like. I would prefer it to be more vibrant. I think you could probably mix in a little bit of spirulina but I just picked something that was more neutral like spinach, spirulina does have a taste. But the cooking and oxidization\ndefinitely made it brown. So I'm just going to take my dropper and then fill in the little molds. (mellow electronic music) All right, so I'm sticking\nthem into the fridge. I popped up a couple just to test them. I have some here, some up here. My freezer's pretty full, so I also stuck some in the fridge, but I'm going to let them set. Now a lot of websites\nsay just 10-15 minutes. I'm gonna leave it for a\ncouple hours and come back. (classical music) All right, I've popped\na couple of them out. Look at that little guy. A little teddy bear. I mean obviously this\nis a tiny little mold, but you can get bigger ones. Like I said before, the texture is different\nthan a gummy bear, it doesn't have that\nsqueaky gummy chewiness, it's a little bit softer. But they're really tasty. I was thinking, if you wanted to do sour versions, you could probably add\nsome Vitamin C powder or citric acid powder, which is just Vitamin C, and then you get that tang.

Bye.", "lAguCOu_Nmk": "hey everyone its Laura from our oily house calm and today I'm gonna show you how to make immune-boosting gummy bears [Music] as we go into the cooler months we are doing everything we can to keep those immune systems high and just last week I showed you guys some of my favorite tips on boosting the immune system and I shared my elderberry syrup recipe and today I want to share with you how you can make elderberry syrup gummy bears so to do this recipe you're going to need some elderberry syrup so if you miss that post where I shared my recipe I will link that up in the cards in the description below so you can check that out for this recipe you're gonna need a cup of your elderberry syrup so I'm just gonna pour it in here and then I'm just gonna put half of a cup into my glass bowl for right now and then we're going to add in some gelatin and this is some unflavored gelatin from grass-fed cows and this is really adds a lot of protein and has tons of help in if it's for you and this is what I'm going to use to make your gummi bears set up do you need 1/4 of a cup of this gelatin and I like the kind I use in the description below and we are going to whisk this together pretty quickly gelatin doesn't harden going to whisk this together until it is completely mixed into your elderberry syrup then you're going to add in 1/2 a cup of hot water you don't want this water to be boiling but you want it to be hot to kind of help dissolve the gelatin into the mixture then you're just going to continue to whisk this together you're gonna smell it kind of has that jello smell because of the gelatin and then after it's you know well mixed you're just gonna add in your other half a cup of elderberry syrup just keep whisking it together so it's well incorporated once it's all whisked together we are going to put it into our mold and I have these cute little gummy bear molds that I found on Amazon that I just love and I'll link them in the description below if you don't have gelatin molds you can make these just with a 9 by 13 pan and you can just pour it in there then just cut it into little squares that's totally fine too but my kids think these are really fun and then before we pour our mixture in there I'm going to grease them with just a little bit of coconut oil just to prevent them from sticking so I just grabbed some coconut oil just kind of rub it into my bears a little bit here I'm gonna use a dropper to drop them in and this came with my molds if you don't have one of these you can use like an old medicine drop or anything just kind of makes it easier to put into your mold so I'm just gonna fill up all of my gummy bears after you have your molds completely full we're just gonna pop these into the refrigerator and because my molds are so small these will be hardened in about 20 minutes but if you're using a 9 by 13 pan you might have to leave it in there for about four to eight hours once it's all set up you can just pop your gummy bears right out of your mold you can take these daily to help boost the immune system I like to give these to my kids five days on two days off just so we don't get any type of immunity to them they really just help to boost the immune system they are loaded with vitamins A B and C they're completely healthy and the kids really love them and you guys can use this same recipe to make all different types of gummy bears so I have tried this instead of the Alpha berry syrup I'll use an orange juice I've used grape juice we've used strawberry juice these are super fun my kids love them we can make all different flavors in colors I shared some of my kids favorite recipes for gummy bears in the description below and also over on the blog I have some free

[Music]", "dsxcqshvH34": "hey guys welcome back for another video so if you saw my video from last week we learned how to make elderberry syrup which is high in antioxidants great immune boosting properties and just overall really great health benefits so this week we're going to be doing a recipe using that elderberry syrup and we're going to be making some immune boosting elderberry gummy bears for the kids take your one cup of elderberry syrup put it in your pot and turn it on medium heat once that starts to warm and you can feel the temperature change in the liquid you can go ahead and actually turn this off you don't want it to come to a rolling boil it's going to take that much longer for them to set up [Music] because it's only one cup of liquid it usually heats up pretty quickly so there's a couple variations that you can do for this recipe so you can just use your elderberry syrup that you made last week and add your gelatin in and put it in your mold and that's totally fine for me personally i like to add the gelatin a few drops of my young living thieves because this really has a lot of health benefits to it as well and an eighth of a cup of honey just to make them a little extra sweet so again i'll have both variations written over on the blog so you can decide which ones you want to make so now that your elderberry syrup is simmering you can either add your essential oils if you're going to use some if not that's fine too then you're going to take a quarter cup of beef gelatin now this is grass-fed organic unflavored beef gelatin if you're vegan you can also use a vegan gelatin and that will work just as well so you're going to slowly add that to your pan and just continue to stir so after your mixture started to thicken up a little bit at this point you could add your eighth of a cup of raw honey you'll want to stir that up until your honey is completely dissolved if you're adding honey so now that all the liquid is blended together it's time to add the liquid into our gummy bear molds so these particular molds i purchased on amazon they came in a set of two and they also came with this dropper now you don't need a dropper to fill your gummy bear molds but i did find that it made the process a lot faster a lot cleaner and a lot easier if you don't have one of these you can use an old like medicine dropper from a kid's prescription or a kids medication that you purchased over the counter droppers are just really handy to get these molds filled so if the molds you have at home you find you're having issues getting your gummy bears out of you can take a ghee cooking spray or a coconut spray and you can spray in the molds and that should make it a lot easier to pop them out these particular ones i've never had issues getting them out they always come out really clean so now you're just gonna take your liquid and you're gonna start filling up your mold so another good thing to do if you're intending on putting these directly into the refrigerator is to do this on top of a cookie sheet you don't want to have this really warm liquid in your gummy bear mold and trying to pick this up to put it in your fridge that could also get really messy so putting it on a cookie sheet will help luckily these set up really quickly so just having them out on your counter for about five to ten minutes after you put all the liquid in your mold will help set it up before you put it in your fridge so once you remove your mold from the refrigerator this one has been sitting for about 30 minutes it's time to pop out the gummy bears i like to store mine in mason jars with lids and just keep them in the refrigerator and then in the mornings my kids usually remind me to get out their elderberry gummies so i have elderberry gummies here and then i've also made a batch of ningxia gummy bears and my kids love them both so these pop out super easy do so again check the description box down below i will have a list of all the things that i used here today and where you can find them as well as substitutions for the beef gelatin if you want a recipe card you can head over to the blog and print that out i will also have a couple different variations for this recipe over there that you can have as well i hope you guys have a wonderful weekend and i'll see you next time", "MzD_sZgXKGc": "hey guys i'm

hitting the board a gambling show congratulations to those guys so do you think with the time that they're spending on the blog they have time to be on the radio show well that's a question for them i i don't know but to be on the radio show it does require attendance in the office uh on monday hitting the board or bending the board or something like that uh there's a couple of butt hurt people that are allowed to come to the office and aren't coming to the office i can be on a certain radio show called pick central they didn't decide to come in and be on it and uh yeah i don't know what to tell you they came out with a show at 11 45 with uh real gambling stats because everyone comes to barcelo sports for the statistics and speak my point of view but it's not safe hello it is pick central brussels fake gambling show we got rico bosco we got big cat marty mush is here hi everybody how's everybody's weekend i'm bored are you yeah this show's boring yeah trying to hit the board somewhere else i i you know what i don't know if i like words to the people at home i don't know if i like being on the show with the two biggest personalities at barcelona i don't think so rico and brandon mr 90's gotta go to 100 you got to go 100 hours a week i don't know if you'll be able to do it you might die i said one time during an argument with dave that i worked 90 hours a week i didn't mean it i just sort of said you was playing defense anyone who's been around this office knows that mr mr90 likes to talk about how hard he works i'm not worthy of responding correct you were not worthy of so i worked 90 hours a week here dude every [ __ ] show i'm not worthy of a [ __ ] response eight through three eight five stool is the number two call and give us some picks anybody else out there that wants to call and get a picture will be on the show they can if they work at barstool that's fine um it's the thing that you gotta do a little petty show that's what you do when you're five years old your arm is throwing me off the stairs this morning new socks uh we responded that hey we have an entertaining show uh the office is open you're allowed to come bar still doesn't work where it's like hey i have to wait to be asked to do something and you go and do it i'm here at the office i go on the show that's how it is i mean what they did was petty paula duca keeps saying hey keep me out of it but you did a petty thing what what what are we doing we work at barcelona we talk about things but you know what it doesn't bother me i went 7-1 are they going to put it out every day right before pick central is that what the deal is they're trying to that would be hilarious i don't think they're capable of being hilarious i commend whoa i i don't that's why you don't have live shows why don't you have one of them call in let them call in maduka blackjack yeah call them talk about your show someone called don't call it oh they're like blackjack's it's interesting so blackjack called and he told us that uh had nothing to do with pick central and he wasn't mad that i chose rico to be on the show a couple of weeks ago even though this is clearly an answer to me choosing rico sorry guys i know there's beef there between blackjack leduca and rico but rico is here i've seen him and he's very entertaining steve dave asked me to do an entertaining gaming show rico bosco's entertaining love him or hate him that guy knows how to entertain so i grabbed him had nothing to do with them they start their own show whatever it's an interesting move let out the real words yeah just say it okay just [ __ ] saying these guys are these guys have got their feelings hurt because i let rico on the [ __ ] show well guess what rico's entertaining so he's here he's also willing to [ __ ] be in the building and you guys aren't so what do you want me to do you gotta start a new show rather than come in here and do your [ __ ] job you're gonna start a new show this is [ __ ] what are we doing all right welcome to the first episode of hitting the board new gambling show here at barstool sports where uh in a novel concept we are actually going to spend our time talking about gambling on a gambling show i know that may be strange to a lot of people but that's what we're going to try to do here pick central is better than uh jerking the board because it's literally no one comes to like if you really think you're they're good gamblers they're just not i mean the best part about us is we are bad gamblers but when we win it's awesome because i went 7-1 almost i was looking for mariachi band i booked them for an hour but i lost one game it's just i mean that's what we do we first out we talk about sports we have serious sports talk but then we get into some crazy topics and then we gamble i mean that's what we do do you feel a little bit more pressure me yeah no i'm the winningest gambler on the show but do you feel a little more pressured knowing i forgot about morgan do you feel a little bit pressured knowing that if riggs and leduca and blackjack have winners i'll tell you what if the 25 people that listen to their show also listen to pixel i hope those 25 people are able to see i'm not worried because i'm a shitty gambler no matter what correct that's right right we're not going to get here my reputation isn't on the line of being a good gambler but yours no it isn't there's not a person in this there's not a person in the studio who's here because of his prowess as a gambler do you think anybody in this company was hired because they're a good gambler you think i was i went over eight my first night i know i bet all of them i still think i'm a good gambler but well you shouldn't you shouldn't think that i'm shitty ass i know hold on we got to step in here i'm a piece of [ __ ] every bet i put in yeah this episode of stool scenes is brought to you by owens craft mixers i'm not a mixologist i'm not a bartender i'm not tom cruise and cocktail when i want a little craft cocktail for myself i just pick up a bottle of owens and then i mix it with a little bit of liquor and it's that simple for example this mint cucumber and lime will make you a delicious mojito a little bit of rum a little bit of owens craft mixers and there you have a night you don't need to be tom cruise and cocktail to enjoy the lifestyle of tom cruise and cocktail get some for yourself today at owensmixers.com it's fresh [Music] can you draw money well maybe i already have that off what company do we work at that doesn't work no what is this for or is this an anti-scale drawing yeah of course what are we doing just setting some things up look at this look at the attention to detail [Music] jeff have you uh drawn a line in the sand yet for what the boys jeff's a guy that's one of my guys oh full with rico yeah that's not even a question he's drawing wine right now rico you mean the guy who picked [ __ ] morocco to win the pga championship damn right i think you look slim then just do it so what are you diagramming what what are you diagramming here we're just doing a scoreboard gambling is scoreboard dana asked me to comment on some things scoreboard is what matters we'll set up a little scoreboard here so you're going to illustrate it visually yeah i got some stats without the emoji yeah we go with the emojis make it simple looks like a mushroom what about the origin of skel orange scale that's like a very much new york city thing i definitely didn't come up with it but it's like uh i mean you kind of know what it is i do but i've never heard of it before i met you yeah well i made it popular i should have trademarked the [ __ ] thing well like i don't know you're a skill like you're [ __ ] you know never the guy who has the money you don't split the cabs like just comment decency type [ __ ] and then from twitter twitter skills i have a hot clip of dave doing actually twitter skills let me see if it's a hot clip like uh it's in my favorites i put it on the like hot clips like hole [Music] that's your copyright yeah it wasn't a [ __ ] [ __ ] he didn't know who he was i don't look like a [ __ ] [ __ ] you look scary i try to first of all what do we have on the board it's going to be on squabble i'm a visual learner my friend martin mush co-host he's a visual learner so we'll just do some uh some visual learning today right now it's a nationally broadcasted show and uh kind of like an off-brand uh shoprite version some would say our show is uh plus 36.13 units bonnie for the people at home a unit is what what you bet right okay so that's a lot yeah what i'm hearing is the record is 20 25 and 1. tough edge boss goes to the different markers they're on there's no use the blue one who's the blue one walker is fresh that one's stressed hold on oh oh boy no it'll work it'll work all right we are as a team because i'm a team guy 36.13 units okay not bad now i would know but what i'm hearing is they're 20 25 and one so you do the math there let's say roughly five edge team guy edge pixel all right and what about uh overall chemistry and entertainment value let's get away from numbers for a second one for every host and actually probably two minuses so that's a big you know kind of running away with it viewers you like the numbers viewers followers i should say 48k 353 followers again page pixel combined i think we have i don't know when you get into the millions i don't understand how it works so it's like i got 190 dan's got 1 million uh rico's got about 50 and brandon's got 130. what's that 1.2 pretty good for uh you know pretty good so scratching and clone the 50. so listen like we say you just you want to evaluate us equally then it's the scoreboard settles itself so if there's any other kind of question mark i guess you could just look at oh is that the hammer set triple hand off that's a dribble he takes it here he flashes up screen here as he clears the lane this guy goes we're going to kick it out to here martin for the three that's a [ __ ] hammer set hey [Music] [Music] how do you like have designated practice time without learning the opponent yeah why don't you just go yeah why wouldn't you i'll go i don't need to practice actually i played smitty and let go somebody asked me to play warrant this when he's playing uh the first so i said okay played smooth now he's freaking out because he doesn't play anyone it's like he can't just walk in there and do it himself there's no rule against it i've played smitty for 10 minutes um we started to keep track and i was up 29-9 on him had the head but i think like every single one of those games is like right down to the wire but somehow i have the edge over him i have like mental edge um you'll see it's gonna be really close really tight i mean a lot of yelling at each other but i'm excited i think it's the best game of the day by far have you played jake yet i heard jacob i've beaten jake oh really but he i mean well he no no he's beating me way more times than i be him but i have beaten him and it was like one of my greatest accomplishments in like sports because he's ridiculous he plays like he's in tennis he's playing a tennis game but he can't play right now right there's that that's why like hank chosen the plays he wants the ew where he wants the the chance to beat beat him against he's playing against a scooter no he sprained his ankle yeah but he's been on a scooter like that's he can't walk playing cake [ __ ] marsh cakey cake uh it was lined up before he sprained his ankle uh someone was saying that it was intensive in me i was there when he spread his ankle and i was called insensitive for asking him this was like a week and a half ago he sprained his ankles on the ground rivering in pain and i was like do you think it would be good for next wednesday uh like girlfriend has to walk after i did ask him if he was okay first i was like are you okay and he was like yeah and then i was like are you gonna be good for next monday so some say that's incentive i'm just you know trying to make sure i have an edge i'm not gonna be like billy football right now but we've all had ankle injuries that's the first step yeah let's go i'm not i don't feel terrible like he'll be fine people have played through a lot worse thanks to bully we're out playing tennis my darling jake twist his ankle nearly snaps it in two hank runs over to him first thing then he says it's not jake are you okay jake can i help you up jake did you break anything first thing hank says is oh no you have to play ping-pong against me in a week and a half wow that's a real shame immediately first reaction it really depends what percent he's at i think he's at like 80 like an ankle injury is the ankle's a lot farther from the heart from the heart the ankle is a hell of a long way from the heart okay i'm excited i'm like i said if hank beats me i'm no excuses i'm ready to play ready to win i i played some scrimmages with pft yesterday it made more of an impact than i thought but i don't think it hinders me from winning i think i can still do what i do um it'll play a factor but i'm going to have a good chance to win what's your confidence level uh what's less than zero absolute zero somewhere in between that and zero look i'm an above average pink one player in the office i would say my level is above jeffy low a little bit but below the humps and i have not touched a paddle outside of today and shooting promo stuff since quarantine pft one of the best players in the office before quarantine and has played all during quarantine so hence the uh in between absolute zero and zero yeah but we'll see you'll probably get waxed you know not prepared i'm in a win-win situation here i'm not supposed to do well i'll be victorious me trying to do anything over the top will only not only hurt myself but it will be unnecessary best revenge is victory alongside jeff dilo i'm jake marsh thanks for taking some time on your monday afternoon for a new week of stool streams very hard ah [ __ ] oh on the app store oh ah all right i oh oh delicate flour back to you guys oh all right yep hey leave beforehand the old henry come on [ __ ] me henry now you stole the chance playing [Music] oh [Music] yeah i mean it [ __ ] me up like i poured milk on my

bears was the worst one and this was our first episode back in a very long time and i don't know if people will do next week's episode like we're going to think of something very easy like i'm

about it broadcasting yeah favorite announcer of all time mike tarika and what do you feel about michael k i grew up the yankee fan like big hat mentioned so i've grown to love him um i could see how some people have an issue with him having a talk show and offering maybe too many opinions as a play-by-play guy on the call but i like him and jack buck i mean joe buck love joe buck okay what's your question so on that note as a analyst what are you looking for as a play-by-play guy to make your job easiest ah great question i i think we're looking for just first of all chemistry uh in someone who is selfless that wants to put you in a position to win it's like anything else in sports what made magic johnson so great i mean he will just pass the ball and you would dunk it he'd put you in a position to win um i think that's what uh joe buck or matt vasquez does so well kevin burkhardt thanks man that was fantastic awesome that was fun really good question great question yeah you guys ate

billy you and the interns i didn't say you're going to be in charge of the interns i was like you and the interns because billy is an intern so i thought it was going to be like a group project uh so you and the interns go in the school stream studio build the marble racing uh and like test it out make sure that it's like evenly done or whatever and then i told spider who is not an intern and is somewhat of like a you know overseer i was like just make sure you know everything's going well uh i came in to the studio and billy and spider were just screaming at the interns they they were talking in the mics like it was a live broadcast interns were like reacting like there's a live broadcast and then i don't know her name what's her name dev dev was like oh my god i'm so sorry like i

absolute menace uh he has no supervision he's just gonna who knows what's gonna happen with that kid i'm side to side i'm just terrible and this will be the start and then we'll connect two towers from here and you can incorporate and why don't we get something so it all connects back here you need to connect these to this right um this is so high let's just assemble one this is gonna take way longer let's just assemble something solid and then from there we can add clusters this is gonna like you see how it's like we're totally yeah we're chilling yeah and we heard some of the intros for uh our contestants today why don't we continue there's still two to be introduced [Applause] ready oh oh [Laughter] [Music] i mean this is a this is a obviously a trial like this probably won't be uh i mean no they're recording this but they're testing out the angles you know so you're actually serious you guys are standing like like we're not gonna do the real one jake we also wanted to test the integrity of this and also the camera like where's ashton kutcher like i feel like actually it's gonna come out yeah i'm so sorry we thought that was fake what do you mean when we kept laughing like you were saying that i was being [ __ ] annoying you", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "1EtbenDg0YM": "Oh again everybody and welcome back to the channel in today's video I'm gonna be sharing my super simple gummi recipe but first if you wouldn't mind hit that subscribe button if you are new here to the channel and if you already have subscribed thank you very much and if you wouldn't mind please give the video a big thumbs up to show your support so today guys I gotta tell you to get to this point to share this recipe with you has been a long road by far this gummy recipe has taken me the longest to develop in the kitchen I have tried everything under the Sun on the internet to make gummies and believe it or not the simplest of recipes is the best and easiest way to make gummies at home now today I am just going to be showing you my plain-jane gummi recipe if you are interested in infusing those gummies I encourage you to check out my video on infusing gummies and I can leave that link in the description below go ahead and check it out but for today this is just a three ingredient gummy recipe that you can make at home now the cool thing about gummies is that you can buy molds on Amazon for anything you can have Star Wars gummies you can have worms you can have bears you can have anything you want it's a really just a family fun event that you can make in the kitchen and it shouldn't be that complicated one of my biggest critiques of the internet on these recipes was why is everybody making it out to seem so complicated it's not it really is not three ingredients go to your local grocery store and you can find them and I'm gonna show you when we get into the kitchen and you could have gummies within an hour this whole recipe takes about 15 minutes total it's crazy easy but I gotta say to get to this point I did a lot of convoluted recipes with bloomin and cooking and God it was just awful it was awful everybody had a different take on how to get to that point where it was a nice gummy and it's just not that hard guys I hate to break it to you it's not that hard whoever is making these recipes make him seem hard I got to assume Heather don't know what they're doing in the kitchen or they're really just trying a roundabout way to make it seem harder than it is so that most people don't do it which you know it is what it is but today I'm gonna share with you the easy 15-minute three ingredient gummi recipe that you can have and share share along with all your other friends and then again guys if you want to infuse them go ahead and check out that video I'll leave that link in the description below so let's jump into the kitchen let me show you what we're doing in there and then let's start making some gummies alright folks before we get started on today's recipe I want to make sure that you have everything you need to get started so first you will need a small stove pot a Pyrex measuring cup definitely highly recommend the Pyrex measuring cup a fork for mixing and of course gummy molds and a big thank you to magical for sending these gummy molds so the ingredients are as follows and these are the three simple ingredients unflavored gelatin flavored gelatin and fruit juice now with the fruit juice you want to make sure that it's refrigerated you want it to be at a cold temperature and that's key for this recipe so the first thing we're going to do is we are going to measure out our fridges and that's going to be 1/3 of a cup so that's right about there sorry for the mess there let me clean that up ok so now that you have your 1/3 cup of fruit juice and in this case we have pineapple fruit juice now it's not from concentrate and I think that makes a big deal I did experiment with concentrate and it just doesn't come out as well it's not as flavorful it's still gels fine but the flavor isn't there but the next thing you'll need is one package grams of just unflavored gelatin and so once you add that you want to mix it around now you can use a spoon I just prefer for cuz I feel like it breaks it up a little bit better and you want to make sure that most of the chunks of the gelatin are out and this is very key all right so now that that's mixed around I'll bring it up to you and show you there's no chunks in it all the gelatin is dissolved now you're gonna take your flavored three ounce gelatin and put it in there now in this case guys this flavor is just one of the flavors I like I like the orange pineapple it gives it that very tropical flavor and you can mix and match with fruit juices and flavors this is just one that I really like and so as you can see it's starting to dissolve and get going so now we need to let this sit for 10 minutes okay so we just let it sit for 10 minutes and while that's going on what I like to do is put water in the pot and get that up to temperature so when this is done we can get it right into the pot so right now I'm gonna go fill this with water and get it up to temperature meanwhile this has to sit for 10 minutes so I'll see you guys in 10 minutes all right folks welcome back it has been 10 minutes our timer has gone off and so right now this is the blooming stage of the gelatin so now that that's all set our water is nice and warm we're going to lower this into the water and we're going to mix it around now this process takes about anywhere between three to eight minutes depends on how hot your water is you don't want to boil it you just want hot water now you could microwave this for like two to three minutes and then bring it out but the last thing you want to do is burn the gelatin it will not come out correctly I have tried it in the microwave it is super simple but you have to be very careful so you have to check it about every 30 to 45 seconds once it gets past a minute thirty because every microwave is different so that's why I like the stove but feel free I will leave the instructions on how to use a microwave in the description below so for the next three to eight minutes depending on how hot my water was when I put it in there I'm gonna wait for this to get ready and meantime make sure that your molds are clean and ready to go so I will see you in a few minutes and again guys if you're looking to use the microwave I'll leave those instructions in the description below so I'll see you in a few minutes all right folks so it's been about three minutes and the gelatin is now a very liquid consistency now this is really what you want you don't want to really boil it or do anything like that you just want it in a nice liquid form and this is why the Pyrex is so important because you can put it directly in to warm boiling type water on the stove without having to worry about any issue so that's why I say folks that you really want to use the Pyrex measuring cup again you can put it in the microwave I just you know don't prefer it and I don't really like and I really don't like giving instructions on using a microwave because everybody's microwave is so different with the wattage and stuff and how powerful it is so that's why I lean towards using the stove now as you saw guys in the time-lapse video I added a cutting board and the cutting board is just so it's less mess it's not necessarily required but it definitely creates less of a mess when you go to bring it into the fridge so this looks like it's all ready to go so I'm going to turn our stove off here and I'm going to pick up our bottle and we'll just dry off the bottom real quick so that no water leaks in to our mold next thing I'm going to do is I'm just gonna pour all the molds it's as simple as that so I'm gonna pour these and then we'll go have it set in the fridge all right folks so now I'm just gonna have these go into the fridge and sit for about an hour meanwhile while that's occurring you're gonna want to make sure that you wash out this Pyrex it will become extremely sticky so you're gonna want to make sure that you rinse this out and get all that gelatin out of the Pyrex disk so you can reuse it and it's not a pain to wash so I'm gonna go to let these sit in the refrigerator for about an hour and then I'm gonna show you the final product so I've taken the gummies out of the fridge and I popped a few out of the molds to show you here they are they look great you know some of them have this like like a bubbly back that's normal you can cut that off if you really want just for presentation purposes but overall to get that you have to just get rid of that bubbles you have to just kind of like take a spoon over it just to take the bubbles off of it but I didn't really do that for this process these are for my own personal consumption yeah they pop out of the molds really easy you just go like that and off they come so yeah real easy recipe these were in the fridge a lot longer than I normally do is I just got busy here at the house and you know forgot about them so they were in there for about 12 hours you don't have to leave them in any longer than two hours but for this time we just you know left them in the fridge I had got busy but if you guys have any questions about this recipe feel free to leave a comment below or send me an email on that information will be in the description below and as always folks you can find me on Instagram and Facebook those links will be in the description below also and I really hope you enjoyed this recipe but until next time take care and I will see you in another video", "CYUcoFmFx-Q": "hi welcome to 'angels anything show and we're back on another great butt hole of a February day but there is one shining light on this February day and that is this video and what we're about to do that is we are making weed gummies whoa that's right we've made brownies we made cookies we made chocolates we made maple syrup which that was questionable I think that worked but we have not made the quintessential lead food which is weed gummies now I'm a little nervous for this video because when you're  around with candy there's a lot less room for error and there's you know big risks on the table here this is quite a bit of weed so we're here I have the setup of what we need but really we're going to be going back there for the majority of this video to the oven I'm assuming you have a whisk I'm assuming you have a little pot I'm assuming you have water that's it those are the things you probably already have now hopefully you also have weed and hopefully you know how to make it into cannabutter because I'm not about to go over that with you I have my fancy towel here that my sister got me for Christmas it says the food has wheat in it and in this house that's probably true you're gonna need sunflower lecithin I think that's how it said this one is like a heavy all national cold press Papa bah a link to this specific one in the description box in fact all of this info will be in the description box below because I'm not a reliable source now on to the slightly grosser ingredients gelatin this is basically like horse hooves sorry and then jello which is more horse Hope's exciting but this will give us the you know candy flavor the recipe I'm using is from this place called the canna school and then their recipe they say use a half cup of water but then in the comments people were like it actually works better or tastes better if you use a half a cup of fruit juice just has a little bit of a flavor so let me show you what I got so fruit juice is definitely not my area of expertise so first I got power eat fruit punch in this tastes like medicine so I don't want it and I'm gonna have to like throw it out this isn't nobody's gonna drink it and so then I went and I got v8 splash berry blend I just want something that's like a nice sugary drink that's not like gross you know but it's actually really hard to find let's see that's exactly what I'm going part  Dan we were at the store yesterday and I was like trying so hard to pick out a juice that was good and I'm not well-versed in juices like I said and he was like that's gonna crop sex to me gross no Michael what about this he's like what are you grandpa like it's not the tomato based ones they're her bunch okay so oh and the final thing that you need is obviously mold no you don't actually have to use gummy bears you can use whatever you want but I want to use gummy bears because if I'm traveling with this I want to go to disguise them as I get a candy this recipe makes about a hundred gummies small ones weak ones I want big strong ones so I got the cutest gummy mold it's like the medium size so this is by the modern gummy and they had a small size of medium size and then a larger size and there are like 36 of these in here or 38 so really all that's left now is to go over to the stove and mix all this together and the reason it's a little scary is because oh and I have to heat this up too but the reason it's scary is because we're cooking sugar and candy and if you I have to do whisking it as I mean as I'm squirting it into this so time is of the essence you know so let me get us all situated over there and we'll begin alright guys I have everything all set up my station is ready because once we start this process you really got to keep it moving I have to whisk this liquid for like 15 minutes non-stop as we go so I'm gonna do my best to kind of like show you guys but this might get intense I don't know and I don't know I'm trying to make this video funny but it's probably not gonna be funny because I don't want to joke around and then up my edibles that ain't gonna happen so we're gonna stick to the script today okay I'm attaching you guys to this which is actually um for the car but it works on the oven so we're getting creative here and you're gonna see a little aerial view of what's going down my dog is like you when you're gonna take me for a walk well we need to medicate first little Jimmy we need to medicate hey it's a girl Angie KB I'm gonna tell you what I'm doing step by step so first you turn this stove on to medium low add in the cannabis butter add in your soy lecithin powder and start stirring rigorously and then once that's combined you add in the fruit punch as you're choosing and then you add in the gelatin and you've got a like whisk a lot as you're doing this or else it'll get all clumpy kind of like cornstarch you know and you know just whisking away whisking away oh then you add in your jello powder you can see in the background my dog licking his dick so that's nice it's getting a little clumpy okay so then you just whisk for like 10-15 minutes and then I started filling up these molds which took a while I ended up switching to a spoon which is easier but yeah that's basically it [Music] all right guys the deed is done I don't know how I feel about the fact that I got some of this on me and you literally can play with it like special effects makeup and it's not coming off but tasty sense so mmm horse hooves that was pretty easy it did get a little tricky with the hardening but they acted online as if like oh my god it's gonna harden in like two seconds so I know I think that I did all right I lost the dropper like halfway through it just got too thick and it like clogged and it didn't work and then I just ended up using a spoon from my cabinet which made it a little messier but I think ultimately a lot faster so now these are just gonna set it says to put them in the freezer but then I saw people saying that they were better left out so I think I'm gonna do what you would do with normal jello and just put them in the fridge I don't know I'll let them set for a few hours and then I guess we'll taste test one right I guess so all right guys it's hours later and these things are set they're dumb this is how these came out they look pretty legit and then I had a little bit of excess left so I just pour it in here you know I haven't popped any of these out but let's see I'm impressed with myself these came out really good like normally I do a really bad job with this stuff but let's do the taste test so I'm just gonna eat this big one because yeah mmm mmm all right little gelatin II I mean it doesn't taste awesome cuz I can taste a lot of the coconut oil but I mean you know I'm not eating this cuz I  want candy you know I mean this cousin trying to get my rocks off so if you're trying to get your rocks off try this recipe you try one of the you saw I mean yeah boo tastes awesome cuz it's like very coconut oil II it's not bad it's just like you kind of want to get it over with is it a fail I don't think so I mean I guess we'll find out if it gets me high it's not a fail you know it's edible thank God we use that fruit punch stuff because I don't know how it tasted without back umm-hmm right no all right guys but that's it what do you think it was actually really easy hopefully very effective we'll see I'll let you know remember the recipe link will be below I'll also link where I got the soy lecithin powder stuff and follow me on Instagram if you want Angie Kb thank you for watching this episode of 'angels anything show and I'll see you next time good bye [Music] alright I'm here to report that the gummies worked thus laylee to gelatinous gummies did indeed work I am hi and also I have a pimple between my eyes which I've had for this whole video so you guys already know that anyway it was a success so definitely make them alright also Dan just up a Hello fresh alright guys more time has passed and they feel they need to tell you that I'm even more up now as you can probably tell because my eyelid is even more closed and my pimple is even more red so I'm not sure what's happening - then no okay don't do try these at home do you tres know Dan's rolling a great bodysuit [Music]", "_XVNvnQLo44": "hey thanks for joining me today I want to show you how to make gummies a lot of people ask about hey do you have a gummy bear mold well essentially all of our chocolate molds are gummy bear mold so you can really make any shape that you want to so what I want to show you today is you're doing this from scratch we're not using a box mix of any sort so the powder gelatin that we have here at sweet wise is a really great deal because you can get a whole pound and then we're going to be using some of the sweet wise flavorings those are all natural and then the citric acid that we have here as well so the recipe is pretty basic I'm just going to use a cup of water and two-thirds of a cup of sugar and then I'm going to use four tablespoons of gelatin but before I get the rip to the rest of it like with the flavor and color and everything I want to give you a few tips on mixing this what I did I went ahead and did a cup of hot water with my sugar because when you pour the sugar into the cold water then it takes a little bit more time to dissolve that granulated sugar and you really you know want to dissolve that before you get to the gelatin it just makes it a little bit better so I went ahead and this hot water that I mixed with the sugar and I also went ahead and mix my color because let me show you this if you add the color I'm going to do red in this one just to show you the difference if you do the color in here then it can be kind of gloppy and it's a little bit hard to mix into cold water as well you have these little spots that don't mix as well so when I mix it with the hot water this is essentially the same thing with a different color okay so you can see how much clearer it is when I use hot water mix the color in and the sugar that's all I am right here 1 cup of water 2/3 cup of sugar and the coloring and then it's cooled back down to room temperature now we can add the gelatin and I've got 4 tablespoons of the sweet wise gelatin and I'm just going to go ahead and sprinkle this slowly on top and I'm not going to stir it quite yet I wanted to start absorbing all of that liquid and you'll notice that it starts to bloom is what it's called it starts to absorb that liquid over time and once that's all absorbed then we can melt it so that'll probably take a minute or two so we'll just leave that alone and come back to it okay so my gelatin is all dissolved so now I'm just going to add a teaspoon of the lemon flavoring now this is an actual lemon oil so if I was going to use like this cherry flavoring over here in the red I would probably want to do two teaspoons in that but the lemon is so much stronger I'm just going to do one teaspoon in that give it a little stir and then I'm going to take it over to the microwave should take about 20 seconds and then it will probably be ready all right so I'm going to check it give it a stir I think this needs a little bit more time I'm going to give it about another 15 seconds you want to make sure that you don't overdo it on the first round because you you can scorch some spots you don't want to do that so this is ready usually I have a lot more foam on the top and this this batch turned out really nice but what you want to do before you start using this is just kind of skim this off just kind of gather it off to the side and take a spoon then just kind of discard it off to the side that way you can have a nice clear gummy okay you don't have to have every single particle out of there but just having the bulk of it out really helps now you can pour it right out of here it has a nice funnel but that really only works well if you have a bigger cavity like this if you're doing something more finely detailed like these teddy bears or these little gems I really like to put it in a squeeze bottle so let me just go ahead and pour that in here and since it's nice and warm that'll go quickly if this does cool off you can pop it back in the microwave for 10 or 15 seconds and it'll be a lot more fluid again you may have a few little leaks in this but I wouldn't worry about that too much okay so let me show you about preparing these you really don't need to oil these or anything but it does help but come out a little bit more easily I'll show you an example these have not been oiled they sat at room temperature about 20 minutes this one was oiled and this one was not so you'll see I'm just gonna take a toothpick and I'm going to kind of start the edge and then get my finger under there and pull it out that one pops out really easily this one will come out easily but not as easily as the oiled one this one does have a little bit more shine to it if you'll notice but what I want to warn you about is if you do add like a spray in here and we just do one of these down here like a quick spray like this all these bubbles that are here we'll come out in the surface of the jello so you want to avoid that by just kind of brushing it around or maybe taking paper towel and get that excess out of there so just to show you how to fill these I want to fill this one just to the edge these bigger ones I pop in the fridge for like 20 minutes and they're fully set if you left it at room temperature I'm guessing this would be at least an hour these take about 20 minutes these little bitty cavities they take about 20 minutes at room temperature and then they pop right out and I'll show you one of these as well you see how easy that comes right out and then of course the rubber Ducky's it which is why I did the yellow with the lemon if you want to do that for a baby shower again this is a little bit bigger cavity so if you want to pop that in the fridge for about 20 minutes that would come out as well but you want to avoid like over filling these you can take like a bench scraper or something to clean that up but if it forms on there then it's just a little bit ugly and then you can always go back and trim it up with scissors but that's just more work so I just say use the squeeze bottle and make it a little bit easier on yourself one more tip if you want to make the sour is to use citric acid now this is very very strong so don't use it straight you're going to just really give somebody a heart attack I do like 5 or 6 parts of sugar just granulated sugar to one part of citric acid so if you're using a teaspoon measure I have two teaspoon measure whatever that's fine too but what I like to do so like these already done you can put this like in a little salt shaker if you want to but I don't like to sprinkle it right out of the container because it'll just be too heavy so just put a little bit in my hand and then I also don't sprinkle down close to the piece I'm doing it just kind of it sticks too much in little globules if you'll raise your hand a little bit higher and just kind of sprinkle from up high then it gives you a little bit more even coating and it's also not quite as strong as if you did it really really close so there's a really great easy way to make gummies you can make them the regular way or the sour way I really like that you can kind of customize your color if you do want to like for a baby shower for a wedding or for a birthday you can kind of make the colors and flavors work to your advantage rather than just buying something that's pre-made plus just having the custom shapes and different sizes people are really going to be impressed that you made these so give it a try thanks for watching have fun with it you", "44xxADymYbg": "hey everybody welcome back to another asmr gaming video today we have some rainbow six siege we have two games for you guys today they are pre-recorded gameplay from the past ball this one this first game is from today the other game also we have gummy bears just so the first game is i gave my plate today on the 20th of september and the other game was um um it was actually in the youtube membership video so if you guys saw that it was the background gameplay for that but i did want to include it in this video just because i really wanted to make a siege video tonight with these gummy bears and i didn't really have any other siege gameplay that i like really wanted to share with you guys so i have recently started to play ash more and actually really really enjoy playing at i'm trying to learn some of the different operators that i can use so if you guys have any suggestions for good operators for beginners i'm pretty sure i already got it kind of figured out but if there's an operator that you see me not using that you think i you know could be good at then feel free to let me know also you guys all noticed that i increased increased fov to 90 and also i didn't realize that the game settings wouldn't automatically update when i got my 144 arts monitor so i also updated that in the graphical settings and it is beautiful beautiful i love 90 fov thank you guys so much for the tips and also the 144 hertz refresh rate and this game is really really awesome so hopefully you guys are all doing well i really am enjoying making videos for you guys and hopefully you are all enjoying them we are moving up to three three uploads as i commit suicide three uploads per week on monday wednesday friday so i hope you guys enjoy the new and increased upload schedule i think my phone was like interfering with the microphone i got a crazy triple kill there you guys all seem to do really like the gummy bear video the last one that i did that was on minecraft so if you guys enjoy the gummy bear eating be sure to drop a like on this video and i will definitely make more videos similar to this so be sure to um oh excuse me if you have any tips for me i would appreciate if you guys share them with me down in the comments nicely of course but i am trying to get better at siege and i'm getting better slowly but surely but i would like to um really increase my skills at this game i'm slowly learning the maps and the layouts and everything but um any other tips would be great i do need to um go into these maps and like look at like camera placements and where the the walls and the rooms are and stuff so i'm trying to get better at um rotating more and trying to switch up my positions just so i don't um you know sit still all game and get caught off guard i was playing a lot of doc and ash today i just kind of realized that instead of a sledge or thatcher and capkin because those are the operators i normally play although i did play talk in the last video i think because he was like the cover the last two of us is actually me and one of our moderators here on the channel until we clutch up this 2e3 to get our team the flawless actually clutch it up with the uh the cap can trip but still nailed it we got uh we did not get mvp this game however we did go five and zero which is pretty nice i'll take it so here is the second game this is an ongoing match and we came in and we were down to zero so um i kind of expected to just lose either we would lose the third round or we would like come back a couple of rounds um but you'll see how the gameplay pans out i thought it was a pretty cool gameplay so so so so um i just want to drop a shameless plug for the channel memberships here have you made it this far i really appreciate you watching we also have channel memberships available on the channel and a few people have already signed up for the gold deer which includes the benefit of being able to play games um with me and i will you know record and maybe we can get some cool gameplay for the channel um so if you guys are enjoying the content and you'd like to see or see extra content as far as like um like backgrounds um there's exclusive um emojis and exclusive badges for you in the comment section if you are a member of the channel and the silver tier also has access to um videos that are like not bloopers but like got left out videos that i won't be posting and the gold tier has the option to play games with me um monthly which is very exciting uh very excited to be able to play and record some gameplay with you guys so that's all if you are interested in any of that feel free to check out in the description if not no worries i don't want to make this too long so let me know what you guys think of the like hand sounds and the cupping like the the whispers with like the cupped hands like this let me know what you guys think of it i've just kind of been including it in the videos recently and i feel like it would sound good but i'm not entirely sure i've made some videos with the um the candy box and you guys seem to really like that i don't have a candy box tower just have the um the pouch with the gummy bears in it but maybe that's enjoyable who knows so so so i need to get some more gummy bears out excuse the sounds unless they're enjoyable then you're welcome i guess these gummy bears are very very good you can't go wrong with some gummy bears let me know what you guys think of the new siege operator i almost have 25 000 renown and i kind of want to know like if he's worth getting and like showcasing he seems pretty cool um just i don't know if it would be worth it for you know because i still have let's dive enough i could probably get two you know like 10 000 renown operators or like a 10 000 renown and a 15 000 renown um instead of getting him but if he's truly that good you know then maybe i'll uh i'll jump on the hype train and make a video for you guys so so all right everybody there it is that is the end of the gameplay i appreciate you guys watching this video i hope you enjoyed it and i hope you sleep very very very well good night", "LMD5aAC9wAk": "hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is liz if this is the first time you're joining you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much i really do appreciate your support i really do mean that i love you guys so today i'm going to show you how to do the sour version of a gummy uh gummy candy so this has got includes the gelatin and a cooked syrup candy syrup you combine them and we then apply the sugar sweet and sour sugar right afterwards so we don't have to wait for it uh to dry uh or to figure out when we need to add it we add it right afterwards and um all right so i'll just get right started we'll get into the ingredients the equipment that you're gonna need and then how to put everything together all right well thank you so much for joining and i hope you enjoy the video okay so this recipe is done in two stages well technically three because we cook in two different stages and then we combine everything so for the first gelatin for the jello half you're going to need three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of your favorite jello flavor a quarter cup of light corn syrup a half a teaspoon of citric acid a half teaspoon of gour gum and a quarter of a cup to a third of a cup of your can of butter and for the liquid you're going to need um a quarter cup that we're going to heat up to boiling and then a half cup that we're going to be using to bloom our gelatin and you can use any liquids that you like i like to use these um kool-aid or the kool-aid jammers these ones are good because they're a water-based and they're clear so you don't have to contend with color and they're also half the sugar so again you're not going to it helps cut back on the sugar since we got a whole ton of it in it that totally up to you though you want to definitely stick to a clear type liquid those powerades if you like those type of things those vitamin waters if you like them i don't like them they do not add the greatest of taste but if you do add juices like with it have real fruit juice in it then you're going to want to use a mold inhibitor because mold will develop very quickly and if you want to add additional colors or flavors uh we can do that i'm going to be adding 2d fruity and so i'm going to kind of make it pink and purpley i don't know tutti frutti colors and if you want to have a nice solid uh background you're going to need white food coloring so that's for the gelatin part the jello side gelatin side for the cooked candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water so for the equipment that you're going to need you're going to need a double boiler so you can use any pot and metal bowl i like to try and use a thicker thicker metal so that it doesn't get too hot you're going to want something to disperse your candy i love using these bottles they work great and they've got the piping tip which makes it really nice or you can use an eyedropper now this recipe is a little bit thicker so i'm not sure how well an eyedropper is going to work with it you're also going to need an oops timber you're also going to need a smaller pot for your sugar syrup and a candy thermometer two spatulas you're also going to need a hand blender and if you're going to be splitting your syrup either by doing different colors or flavors you're going to need a measuring cup to split that out if you're just doing all one you don't need that or in in lieu of a hand blender you can use whisk in a very strong forearm so the first thing that we want to do is we are going to bloom our gelatin and we are going to heat up that other quarter cup um you may need a little bit more liquid if you do you can just add it in later on if needed so we're going to heat this up in the microwave for about a minute and 20 seconds and we're going to sprinkle three tablespoons of gelatin unflavored gelatin onto our half a cup of liquid you want to kind of evenly spread it and then you're going to mix it in so that it is thoroughly mixed and that there are no lumps so you want it to kind of look like light up you want to look like applesauce and then you're going to just set that aside for five minutes and we're gonna add our boiling liquid to our jello mix and you're gonna stir that oh and you're gonna start you're gonna put your heat on to the lowest setting we just want our water to get hot we don't want it boiling gelatin melts at just hot water so we just want a hot water bath and we're going to stir that in and we're going to add in our corn syrup that's our quarter cup of corn syrup and we're just going to stir oh sorry and we're going to add in our half teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to stir that i said until it's dissolved it takes about five five six minutes or so for all of that to melt and in order to get this stuck gelatin off the side you can use some very hot water and a brush and it'll just you can wash that off otherwise if you don't it won't it doesn't melt and then it you'll get bits and stuff in your jello then you also want to make sure when you're stirring is to rub your spatula across the bottom because the sugar and the gelatin can stick to it and you don't want that so you want to make sure you'll feel it you can feel it smooth on the bottom if there's stuff stuck you'll feel it kind of rough you just kind of want to work it off scrape it off then once your gelatin or sorry your jello is fully melted we're gonna add in the gelatin and what i do is i just kind of cut it up into smaller pieces just like this and just in she goes and you're just gonna gently stir that until it's melted and if your water is hot now if the um your pots nice and hot you can turn off the heat you don't gelatin required doesn't require much heat at all to melt and if it gets too hot the gelatin will break which means it's not going to have that it's not going to your candies aren't going to set that well and the sign that you'll know that it's too hot is if you start to see white foaming stuff white foamy stuff happening on the top of your mixture here on your syrup now that everything is melted we are going to add in the can of butter and our gour gum and the reason that we have to use gour gum is it is an emulsifier and it is going to allow your oil and your your water to come together as one as one liquid versus being oil and water you know don't mix together an emulsifier allows them to come together as one solid solidified unit in short it basically mushes the oil and the water together to live happily we're going to pour in the our can of butter and i've used a third of a cup so as you can see adding you're adding the can of butter or oil to our gelatin you can mix and mix and mix until the cows come home no matter what those two are never going to blend together now you might get the appearance if you kind of whisk really really quickly you have the appearance that it's combined right that kind of looks like that's all combined however if you go and you set that and if you want to set that up now all of the butter would raise to the top of the mold now if you've got one of these little strainers or a strainer it's great for doing the guru so we're going to use a half a teaspoon of gargum and you're going to gently sprinkle evenly sprinkle it over the top if you don't have a strainer you just want to make sure to try and get it evenly over the top there this will adhere to the oil and allow it to mix in with our with the jello and i'm going to let that sit for a minute and now we're going to get our trusty hand blender [Music] and you'll continue to mix that until it is completely all one color all one unified color you don't see any kind of streaking or any kind of any difference whatsoever that's when you know it it is fully blended and emulsified and you're gonna be how about that texture and once that's done we're just going to let that set to set aside and leave it on the hot water but turn off the heat and then we're going to do our candy syrup all right so for our candy syrup we're going so for the candy syrup you want one cup of sugar a half a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water you're gonna mix that together until it is blend till it's all mixed up and your sugar starting to dissolve and we're going to turn the heat on to medium-high and you're going to stir the syrup until it begins to boil so as soon as it starts to boil then you are going to stop stirring that's when we add the candy thermometer and we don't stir it again and then you're also going to want to grab a jar of hot water about whatever something of hot water and a brush so you can wash down the sugar crystals off of the side and that'll prevent your syrup from crystallizing once it begins to boil there we're going to add our candy thermometer i'm going to try to add the candy thermometer now if you ever wonder why i kind of have this weird looking thing the one that i have said it setting on it that thermometer doesn't always work for me it occasionally will fail um this i like the digital but the digital um doesn't have any way of holding on to it it's more meant for just kind of sticking it into checking a temperature and then i have to use the tin foil to protect the digital from the heat so that's why i kind of have this weird makeshift candy thermometer and we're going to cook this syrup to 208 280 degrees soft crack now you can go a little bit if you want your candies a little less chewy you can go a few degrees less you can go to about 275. if you want them a lot chewier then you can go to 300. i seem to find the 280 is perfect for it well for what my liking anyway so we're going to continue to cook that syrup until 280 degrees just remember to wash down any crystal any sugar crystals that may form on the sides just to let you know you're doing this at the medium high it will go fairly quickly so don't leave the kitchen normally you do the sugars at a lower temperature so you have a little bit of time this doing it at the higher temperature it will go very quickly so i'm traveling you don't leave your kitchen and then you also want to get a pot of just cold water or a bowl of cold cold water stand by uh we're gonna put the bottom of the pot in that to stop the syrup the cooking process so we're at 276 270 see how quickly it starts to go 278 279 280 leave the candy thermometer on because we want to bring this temperature down to 240. you can turn your heat off leave it in the water until the temperature starts coming down and then we're just going to set it on the side here until that temperature comes down to 240. so once your temperature comes down you can remove the candy thermometer and we're going to add in ow be careful the syrup is still very very hot you're going to get your gelatin mixture and you're going to have a look and you're going to make sure that you don't see any green or anybody butter separation now you might see a little bit of cut like see how that color there difference that suggests your jello that the air is coming out of so don't worry about that what you care is if you see any kind of green or oily looking so that's good we're going to pour this into this candy syrup and be very careful when you're stirring this now your gelatin is going to be a lot more liquidier than the liquid liquid ear i know i come up with my own words uh then the candy syrup is going to be thicker it's also going to start to solidify as you can see on the spoon that's why you're going to gently stir it and we're going to turn the heat on to bury it to the lowest temperature and you want to make sure to take your spatula and go all the way around the edges the syrup will has a tendency to stick along those edges see so i like to use the hand blender whoops to make sure that everything is fully uh mixed together and blended and emulsified [Music] and then you're just going to gently stir to make sure that it's all nicely mixed so now at this point is when we're going to add in our flavor and additional colors if you like or as i said if you want if you're not doing that you can just go ahead and put this into your bottles right now and get ready to distribute into the molds so i'm going to be adding one of my newest favorite flavors tutti frutti love this flavor i usually use about a cup and a half and again you just want to gently get that all mixed in now if you are going to be splitting uh if you want to do two different colors this is this point you're going to put it to the transferred over to your measuring cup and split it in half or if you wanted to do two different flavors then do that before split it in half add your different flavors but i'm just doing one flavor base two colors okay so i have got now whenever you look at a um a measuring cup always look at it straight on get down at the level and look at it straight on if you look at it from a down level you see you don't get an accurate reading that looks like two and a quarter cups however it's more like two and a third cups so for this one i'm going to do i'm gonna add some more red and i like to use the no taste red i hate the taste of red dye i can always taste it and everything so i like the no taste red the one thing about it however is it doesn't have quite the intensity of red that the regular does but i'd rather forsake a little bit of the intensity on the color versus the intensity on the flavor there we go that's a nice red and the other side i'm going to do purple i'm going to add in some pink i want a more pinky purple versus a dark purple and a couple drops of blue now mix that up see what we get now right now because we did i didn't add the white into it and it looks like it's a solid color it's actually it'll come out kind of still a little bit translucent so if you want to get a solid background and that it's not going to lighten up or get that kind of clear or translucent look you want that solid opaque then you need to add in the white so i'm going to add a couple drops into white on both sides so we have here when we add in the white it's going to dull down our color a little bit so that i'm just going to add in a little bit more of the red and add a little bit more to the purple purple i think i'm gonna leave i like that color but the red i wanna looks kind of orangey and see how much nicer that color is now it's a lot richer and gives you more that solid background makes it opaque versus having that translucent look to it and now i'm just going to get ready to pour it in the bottles and distribute it into the molds all right so now we're ready to distribute into the molds and you can go do half and halves now don't fill up your mold all the way to the top if you do it ends up leaving a sharp edge on your candy that dries out and it doesn't make your candies very pleasant so don't fill them all the way up to the top and it's also when you're trying to pour try and keep it to the middle and just let it distribute it out once you have your mold set up while all filled up you put it into the fridge for uh two hours sometimes it may take a little bit longer basically two hours or until they're set all right so it's been a couple of hours and our candies are ready to come out of the molds and we're gonna make up our sugar sour mix so you're going to add one cup of sugar and to that you're going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid cut it and you want to make sure to thoroughly mix that in so you're going to get even citric acid on everything not just get like a big hunk of it on one candy that's kind of gross so you want to make sure to thoroughly mix it in now the nice thing with this recipe is as soon as we take them out of the molds we're going to put them right into the sugar this sugar mix you don't have to worry about waiting for them to dry or partially dry before we can add it and the reason for that is citric acid is water soluble so when you do the other gummy recipe when you just take them out they're still wet and gummy bears are essentially water and gelatin so as soon as there's any moisture on them the citric acid will begin will automatically begin to melt it doesn't do it on this because you have the sugar coating or the sugar candy syrup in there that helps protect the gelatin and that's why they don't melt as soon as you put it on and that's why this recipe is way better for doing sour or sugar coated candies now these guys are going to be a lot stickier than your regular gummy recipe so you just kind of pull it and they'll start to peel out and then you just work them out and then just pop them right into your sugar sour mix and as they warm up a bit uh they will start to get a little more tacky so no worries as long as you can pull them out of the molds they're good and they do stick to your fingers they do just kind of put it down into the sugar you can just kind of rub it in and it'll get them off that's nice once the your sugar or your sugar sour mix is on they no longer stick together see look at that and then you just put them on the rack to dry as per usual now what i like to do is i like to put holes in my parchment paper so that way you're getting air from both sides it helps with drying the other nice thing with this recipe is it doesn't take anywhere near as long for these to dry as the regular gummy recipes they're pretty much dry in a few hours to overnight now if they do start to get a little too warm and too hard to get out of the mold just put them back in the fridge for a little while if you actually keep a little bit of sugar on your fingers once they get a little bit sticky it'll help with them not sticking to your fingers a little aid with them coming off see if they stick they will fuse just pull them apart now if you're taking these out and they're just not coming out they're way too sticky um they're too gooey you can put them back in the fridge for a couple of hours or um and if you take them out and they're still not going to come out what you can do is uh put them in the freezer for about an hour take them out put them back in the double boiler on low re-melt them and add a half a tablespoon to one tablespoon of bloomed unflavored gelatin and that should add enough a little more gelatin there that'll fix that right up and if you find that they are too gummy oh sorry not if they're too gummy if they're too chewy they're like rubber bands again same thing just put them back on the double boiler on low remelt them and add a couple of tablespoons of um liquid to it and mix it all in until it's all melted recast them and that should take care of that problem if you've taken them out and there's um your butter is all risen to the back same thing just put them into the double boiler re-melt them add a little bit more gargum and re-emulsify make sure to use the hand blender or your whisk really really well like i showed you earlier so again if they're stuck like that uh check first to see just gently work around if they come away then you're good you can pull it out of the mold but if they're doing that they're not coming it's not coming away at all then they need to either go into the longer go into the fridge longer or to add some more gelatin to them they are a little bit more work but they are definitely worth it in texture and flavor in everything i've pretty much abandoned the other gummy bear recipe personally i just use this recipe now i'll just do either sugar coated or the sweet or the sugar and sour mix option is if um they are being really sticky um they are kind of coming out they're set but they're just really sticky um that can happen because it gets it picks up a little bit too much moisture in the refrigerator you can just let them sit in the molds for a couple of hours on the counter before taking them out that'll assist in drying that out a little bit now if you can stand your candies up it's a good idea some of them won't stand up though too small to whatever decides so if you can stand them up great if not you just want to flip them over every couple of hours until they're dry and as i said before this recipe and the drying time is it's a lot less time and that's it for them so just leave them out and enjoy some awesome sweet and sour gummy candies so that's my tutorial on sweet and sour gummy candies these are the little bad boys they haven't dried yet but you can see they're really nice they're little that little squishy now because they're still wet tastes awesome so i hope you give this recipe a try whether you want to do just sugar coated or the sugar sour it's a great recipe i'm sure that you'll love it if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments i'll always get back to you and i think that's everything i've got for you today well thank you so much for joining time diamond delight edibles wish i could get that straight um thank you for joining diamond delight edibles it's been a pleasure have a wonderful day [Music] you", "DGbITXSfySg": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz and this is the first time you're stopping by and the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much for joining so today I am going to show you how to make real fruit gummies yes made with real fruit so you can use frozen or real arms not frozen fresh fruit that would be the word fresh or frozen I prefer the frozen however like I said you can use either and you can make these yummy yummy cannabutter and fruit snacks now your kids would love these too - the can of butter obviously but if you want to make a really nice candy for your kids just follow the recipe along it just exclude the can of butter and the guar gum and you've got a great relatively someone okay you're sticking fruit in it so we can call it somewhat healthy candy for your kids alright guys so let's jump right into those ingredients what we need to get started and yeah we'll get these made oh one thing I want to tell you if you are because we're using real fruit you do need to use a mold inhibitor lorraine's makes one so it's called Lorraine's mold inhibitor I however do not have it if you do not use a mold inhibitor you will need to keep these in the refrigerator you won't be able to keep them out for like two three weeks on the counter because they will get moldy if you do use the mold inhibitor however you will but I do not have it so I'm not using it but I just wanted to let you know that piece of information so with mold inhibitor you can keep them out and we'll have a lot much longer shelf life without it you're gonna want to keep them refrigerated and get the meat and fairly quickly alright so for our gummy fruit snacks what we're gonna need is about two cups of fruit so I use frozen fruit I just find it's way easier you so you can use any favorite any favorite fruit that's you like I'm using a mixed berry combo so it's blueberry strawberry and blackberries the only fruit that you cannot use is pineapple and I think also mango because it has they contain an enzyme that will not allow gelatin to set but other than that you're free to go so it's said you can use fresh fruit or frozen fruit and I said you can buy one about 2 cups we're only going to use about a cup the extra you can always freeze and save for later then a for our candy syrup you're going to need 3/4 of a cup of light corn syrup 1/2 a cup of granulated sugar and a quarter cup of water now if you have a can of syrup or can of sugar you can absolutely use those as well so again you want to split part of it so quarter cup quarter cup however you want to split that up you could absolutely use those but today I'm just demonstrating with cannabutter now for the rest of it what you're going to need is a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/4 cup of sugar granulated sugar another quarter cup of granulated sugar that we need to premix our clear gel with you're going to need instant clear gel now you don't have to use this if you don't have this you can eliminate it but what this adds to is makes that candy a little softer instead of being so gelatin like it makes it that softer that real candy texture loves of fruit snacks so this is an optional if you've got it if not you don't need to if you do not need you are not using the clear gel eliminate 1/4 cup of the sugar you're going to need three quarters of a cup of ice cold water or blooming your gelatin you're going to need three core three tables sorry three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin so it was three and a half tablespoons on a flavored gelatin and a half a teaspoon of citric acid 1/2 a teaspoon of gore gum now this is our emulsifier this is what's going to allow us to combine our butter with our water because that's a water oil mixture and you need an emulsifier in order to combine those two to become one so that they become friends instead of mortal enemies and that is it I believe so for this we don't need any extra color or flavor and that's what's really nice and now another side note for those of you who do not like corn syrup you can make a substitute called inverted sugar which is 2 cups of granulated sugar 1 cup of water boil it to 234 degrees as soon as it hits that temperature removed from the heat put the lid on the pot do not touch it again until it hits room temperature once you're at room temperature it's stable good to go if you want more details about how to do that check out my canna syrup video its basis in its making inverted sugar but with candy syrup just avoid via the can of sugar part that's all ok so that's all we need for our ingredients let's jump into our equipment that we need and we'll get going all right so for the equipment we are going to need two small sauce pans a whisk spatula the hand blender this is for emulsifying if you don't have one you can use the whisk it'll work you just have to want with really really hard but these are definitely an investment if you are going to be regularly making Jam and things like that you're going to need a candy thermometer now check this said I got this off Amazon it's a dual so let's pop the probe it's got that probe and then it's got a probe that you stick in the side which is awesome so I can just slide it in my pot and keep it on the side oh it's great remember the issues I always had before problem solved and you're going to need your distributing bottles these are a sweet sugar or bell I believe yes we took about I got links for all these equipment if you want just to make life easy you can check out what it is in the description there and then just a cup of hot water with a pastry brush or washing down the side of our pot that's pretty much what we need I'm sure I'm gonna throw some extras in there Oh obviously your bowls now a trick that I've learned with my molds is because this is gonna be a loser syrup and I'm gonna do two colors as always put your molds into the freezer that way wouldn't you put as soon as you squeeze it in it kind of immediately starts to solidify that way your colors don't bleed all together so it's a really cool little trick for you all right so let's get all those ingredients put together and let's make some fruit snacks so the first thing we want to do is get our gelatin bloomed and we'll be set aside and waiting for us so we're gonna add our three-quarters of a cup of ice-cold water and three and a half tablespoons of our unflavored gelatin and you just want to sprinkle it kind of evenly over the top or it'll be four envelopes of the gelatin approximately and then you wanted this to mix that in until it is well mixed and there's no lot and then while you're mixing this well how you can kind of tell that your gelatin designs your gelatin may not be thickening as well is while you're mixing it it should start to feel like applesauce the texture of applesauce now I'm feeling this is a little bit thin it's all dissolved and it's still not quite as thick as I'd like it so I'm gonna add about another half a tablespoon to that that's better so that when you mix it up and it's all dissolved that's the texture you want it to be so like a like an applesauce and then I'm just gonna set that aside we'll let that bloom and you need at least a minimum five minutes but it's okay it can wait longer okay so the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna prepare our berries or our fruit whatever fruit that you're using so we are going to put our heat on to medium high okay so the first step is our berries now what you're going to need to do is to prepare your berries ahead of time and we eat you're going to be to macerate them then what that means is I'll whether you're using frozen or fresh put them into a bowl instead about two cups you're gonna add a quarter cup of lemon juice and two tablespoons of sugar mix that all around cover it with saran wrap and put it into the fridge for a minimum of two hours if you are using frozen fruits if they're going to be about four hours or you could just leave it on the counter that's no problem and you want one you get will create this really nice syrup and everything will be defrosted dissolve whatever defrosted not frozen anymore do that ahead of time so the first thing I want to do because I've got a lot of seeds and extra stuff I'm just going to strain off the extra juice and those seeds now what you can actually use that juice for don't waste it is if you're a baker you can make a simple syrup with it so add about half a cup of water a cup of sugar boil it for two or three minutes and and that's it letter B and you've got a simple syrup that you can then use on your cakes to cope your cakes with you know those Decorah the american bakers and all that stuff hot they're always putting those things on youtube can do the thing so I'm just getting a little off that excess juice here well obvious I'm not going to get the seeds that I'll get those out after when we when we mush it down when we purify it so I'm going to add a quarter cup of sugar to that get my spatula and we're going to turn our heat on to medium high and you're just gonna mix that around we're just going to bring this to a boil for about two minutes my berries are coming to a boil here don't have better angles so you're just gonna continue mixing that like I said we're just gonna boil that for about two minutes and then we want to get our hand blender ready all right so my little berries and then boiling here for a couple of minutes this is just a soft in the month so that we can purify them puree them not purify puree them a lot easier and if you're using fresh fruit you may need to go for about five minutes and you're going to get your hand blender be very careful cuz it's gonna be hot and be careful if anything splashes up so we are going to puree okay so you're going to continue to blend that until it is completely purified all your fruit is completely blended and there's no major chunks and I'm just going to strain our puree to catch all the seeds and any fruit chunks that did not that did not get liquefied pureed [Music] and then you're just gonna work your puree through your strainer takes a little while just scrape off the bottom a little bit of a pain but you inside necessary to catch like I said if you're definitely using berries or fruits with seeds and also to make sure like I said any fruit that doesn't get purified if you don't want any chunks in your candies so just continue that until you can't get anything nothing else is uh working its way through the mesh and you're just gonna have kind of a puppy puppy mutt mush left okay then once you've got all that we want to measure out about it we're going to measure a cup of our fruit puree a lot worked out pretty even all right okay so now clean this off quickly it's a rinse off your blender because you're going to need it again and we are going to take our pure heart root puree put her back in the pot and we are going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid citric acids help key things to help bring out the fruit flavors the tartness and the fruit flavors as well as it helps prevent crystallization just mix that in and now we are going to you're going to premix up here our clear gel so we're taking a quarter cup of granulated sugar and we're going to take one tablespoon our cereal and it needs to be the instant clear gel the cook you have to cook it for five minutes boil it at a vigorous boil for five minutes and we can't really do that with our fruit so you wouldn't want to use the instant if you are using it they're gonna cut together we're gonna set that we'll just leave that there for a moment so now we are going to add our can of butter to our puree work fruit puree say that ten times quick so first drop in your melted can of butter let make sure to get a roll and sprinkle in a half a teaspoon of gorgeo and you want to try and get that kind of mixed all around not mix like sprinkled even kind of evenly around like so can't really see there that doesn't help sorry and I'm gonna actually angle the camera because I want you to see the emulsification okay so we're just gonna kind of just stir that in a little bit to begin with make sure it's not stuck to the sides and we are going to get our a hand blender [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] now this can happen sometimes because I let that gourd sit for a minute or two while I was setting stuff up it started it started to clump if that does that you end up with any lumps in your mixture don't worry about it just run it through a strainer and it will catch those lumps and you're always good [Music] which I am going to have to do here so watch doesn't always happen if you actually mix your gore and your guar gum into a little bit of your butter first it will melt and you won't ever have that issue I kind of forgot that step okay now if you're using the clear gel you need to do this last step if you're not using clear gel just set your puree aside and we'll be moving on to our candy syrup so you're gonna put your pureed back into the pot on medium low heat after you can turn it up to medium we just need to get it keep it up and get it started boiling now this see what an emulsifier does you can see that there's no oil separation between your water and your and your oils the sudden it makes them friends and yes you can use soy or sunflower lecithin you could use about a teaspoon of that I'm just gonna get my wrist candy and once our mixture comes to a boil turn off your heat take it off the heat and we are going to whisk in our sugar and clear gel mixture so I just do a little bit at first get that way now let's get the rest of it in so that what this creates is a softer texture to your candy versus that being more of a gelatin okay so we are going to let this we're going to set this off to the side and now we're going to cook up our candy syrup all right so to our pot we are going to add our half a cup of sugar 3/4 of a cup of corn syrup and our 1/4 cup of water you can just stir that together and turn your heat on to medium high but you're going to stir this until it comes to a boil once it starts to come once it comes to a boil we'll have our candy thermometer and cook it to 275 degrees and this one you're gonna want your cup of hot water and that pastry brush to clean down the sides of your pot Thanks so my search beginning to boil so at this point I'm going to stop stirring and we are going to cook this to 275 degrees now for those who will cook syrup for the first time yours your temperature will come up to around the two 2223 mark and it's gonna sit there for a few minutes this is when a large when your large majority of your water is starting to boil off so it is not uncommon for it to sit at that temperature for a while then once it does start passing that the temperature will start to increase fairly quickly so I've had a few people comment saying but it doesn't get higher than 220 you just got to be patient it will and again just wash down any sugar crystals that are from a farm on the side all right so we're getting there or almost a temperature all right so candies of temp I'm gonna move it put it on the stone here that will help take away the heat quickly so I'm just waiting for the bubbling to stop now we're gonna add in our few fruit puree okay so our bubbling is stopped or it's starting to subside there it's going to a syrup now when you do add to puree it is gonna bubble up again don't worry about that he may bubble up again and we are going to mix this stir it until everything is completely mixed together we're gonna stir this for a couple of minutes until our fruit and our syrup and everything gets combined and that extra sugar gets melted yeah if you find that the syrup is starting to solidify on the bottom no problem just put your heat on to low and we'll get that get that melted and you just want to eat it up and Toba candy from the candy syrup is melted and become syrup again we don't want to start it boiling and I'm gonna use the hand blender on that so that we can get every leave emulsified because we do have the oil you've just dyed it in some more water to that we're gonna use the hand butter to get that all also 5 now have a look if you see you can see it butter any butter rising at the top so you'll see like a little bit of an oil slick I'm gonna add in a little bit more gore gum to get that most of Isis what will happen is that will rise to the top of your candies and you won't have a nice mixture okay so what I'm going to do this time is I'm adding a little bit of oil and I'm adding about a quarter teaspoon of the Gorgo to it just mix it together I see how it dissolved this will avoid any lumping and now we're just gonna add that on to into our candy we get our handy-dandy blender now our last step is we are going to add in our gelatin so we've got our bloomed gelatin this will be warm enough for it to melt we don't want to have it on heat because gelatin will break very easily if it is too high it melts at a warm water bath temperature she's gonna break that up into smaller chunks and you're just gonna can stir that until it is all melted I'm just gonna give it one final mix here with our hand next blender and there we go now I'm just gonna let this sit for a little bit so that we can go so the air bubble isn't that can work out and we can have a clearer syrup mixture so instead of having it like this it'll become clearer so we're just gonna let it sit probably about 15-20 minutes or so and if it does stiffen up too much you can just turn it on low heat to remelt it and then bring the right on one nuke them then when the air bubbles rise up to the top settle at the top here you can just use a little small strainer just as scoop them off or you can also stir gently kind of break them but they're a little hard then as it cools if you help remove some more of those air bubbles is just going circular motion gentle circular motion and see how it'll pull with bubbles kind of all together in the middle then you can just take your scoop and just skim it off the top yeah I'm gonna get my bottles fill up my large one and I use a strainer to help to catch anything else or any extra seeds that mean snuck through or if it's gum if it's become a little too solidified you can just put it up back on the heat low heat or just a couple of minutes just to warm it up a little bit now half of this I'm gonna do is the translucent and the other half I'm gonna add a couple of drops of white to give create a solid background but with the same kind of color so it looks really cool gives you a nice contrast I'm just gonna give this a real quick heat up here so I just heated it up just a little bit you don't want to go heat it too much because you'll break the gelatin so just enough to make it a little bit more syrupy I live my technical terms so I'm just gonna add a couple of drops of the white food coloring mix that in and so see how I create that solid background alright so I just took my molds out of the freezer nice and cold chilled and I'm gonna get my two colors my solid and my clear and just pour yeahjust both together and you can kind of do any design you want what let me get that in a minute or just go half in half or a little marble effect and that's it just fill up your cavities and then you're gonna pop these into the fridge for about two hours and then we'll come back and take them out you can see what they look like alright so it's time to pop these puppies out let's have a look-see there we go nice and easy they pop out now these guys do not get sugar or sour coated these are just the plane the plane kind their regular fruit snacks with a little kick alright it's gonna get the rest of these guys out here you go haven't got clothes so check that out yeah I got the two-tone solid with the translucent they look pretty cool eh let's check out a dinosaur there we go whoa check that one out whoo-hoo all right so I'm just gonna pop the rest of these guys out and yeah so I hope you enjoyed this no sorry so what you're gonna do is if you have used the mold and immature you can let these dry out on the counter for a couple of days if you have not used the mold inhibitor you're going to put them into the fridge for about 24 24 or 48 hours to dry in the fridge then take them out for 24 hours but for the pretty much you'll want to keep them in the fridge in a sealed airtight airtight container I would not keep these out exposed if you haven't used the inhibitor for more than three or four days yeah because you don't want anybody getting sick and because you're using the real fruit and if they will likely get mold on them very quickly all right so that's everything if you have any questions at all or any comments that you'd like to leave please don't hesitate and thank you guys so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "qMOFwO6hWgQ": "hey guys it's Lisa from the blog farmhouse on Boone comm and today my kiddos all four of the older ones not the baby are going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears so I've mentioned it before on this channel but my kids have a little channel called hey crafty where they do kids crafts and recipes and occasionally I like to share some of their recipes here because I think it'd be helpful for you guys too so if you want to follow along with the crafts I'll link their channel below but today they're gonna show you how to make gummy bears with just juice gelatin and honey so what's great about this recipe is you can use healthy protein rich gelatin I will link the brand that I use below you can get it on thrive market which is where I get mine but you can also get on Amazon it uses grape juice or really you can use any type of juice that you want also if you want to make them something that is an immune booster for the winter season you could add the elderberry crystals that I talked about in my immune booster video so you can follow this exact same recipe but then just add several scoops of the elderberry crystals so that's another way you can add some superfoods into this and make them even more healthy [Music] [Music] first pour a cup of grape juice next pouring two tablespoons of honey [Music] dad your mom heat it up until just Underwood on your stove now we're gonna for 1/4 cup of gelatin into human journey while stirring you have to do so does nothing set make sure to pour it and very thoroughly [Music] now we're gonna put this mixture into our mold we use a dropper or funnel dropper [Music] now we put them in the freezer and let them stick [Music] watching videos five heads you can stop by the blog I'm gonna leave a link below for this resource I'm gonna give you a free printable that will show you some optional add-ons that could make these even more healthy also I will link below the source for these gummy silicone molds that they use if you are new to my channel please hit that subscribe button I make 2 videos every week on food from scratch naturally and it had me home thank you so much for stopping by our farmhouse [Music]", "L2EvOegVsN8": "hey guys welcome back today I'll be showing you how to make peach ring gummies I am including a recipe in this video but you can use any recipe you like you could even buy orange and yellow pre-made store-bought gummies and just melt those down and that will work just as well and this video is going to include some troubleshooting because I had quite a bit of issues making these I had to remould them multiple times I'm gonna show you guys how they started which was like this but eventually I got to them to come out like this here's what you're going to need 1/3 of a cup of water three and a half tablespoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below 1 teaspoon citric acid 1/2 teaspoons of peach flavoring oil 1 tablespoon of Tincher 1/4 cup of sugar 1/4 cup corn syrup 1/2 a tablespoon lecithin white food coloring and yellow and orange food coloring the first step is to bloom your gelatin so just pour your gelatin over your dish of water as well as your citric acid your potassium sorbate mixture your flavoring oil and the lecithin no need to stir this just leave it to bloom for about 5 minutes now pour your sugar and your quan syrup into a saucepan and heat that up once that begin to melt you can add in half of your gelatin mixture and then stir that in you're going to add in a candy thermometer and you want to keep stirring and heating up this mixture until it reaches between 200 to 210 degrees once it's heated up to that temperature you can add in your remaining gelatin mixture and stir that in then turn off the heat now I'm just going to pour in my tincture and stir that in and then because I'm going to be doing three different colors I'm going to separate this into different dishes I'm going to be coloring one yellow one orange and this one here is white and yellow I filled up a pyrex dish with very hot water to keep my mixtures warm while I'm not using them and then I'm going to pour my first one into a plastic bag that I have sprayed with cooking spray so it doesn't stick and then I'm going to fill up the first half of my molds alright so you can clearly see I'm having a lot of issues pouring the mixture into the molds it's too sticky it's making a mess and not coming out smoothly so I try to warm it up again and that is not working so I am just going to have to figure out how to fix these and what I decided to do was to take them all out and remelt them with some more water and a little bit of gelatin so I added a couple tablespoons of water a few for the microwave for about 30 seconds and then now I'm going to add in half a teaspoon of gelatin and just mix that in I decided instead of a plastic bag I'm going to put it into a squeeze bottle so I'll have better control of how much is coming out and you can see how amazingly it's coming out it's absolutely perfect I was very happy I also added a little bit of water to each of my yellow and orange but not extra gelatin as there wasn't a large enough amount for it to matter I wanted to try and see if I could put the yellow and orange directly on top obviously I couldn't so that means I needed to leave it in a freezer to cool down for a bit and then after all of that work I realized something very unfortunate and that is that I did everything in the wrong order so the curved part of this mold is on the bottom meaning that I needed to have the orange and the yellow on the bottom and the yellowy white color so once again I am pulling them out and going to warm them up and remould them and then I just threw it in the microwave and poured it back into my little squeeze bottle and everything looks like it's gonna be perfect third time's the charm right let's hope so well after this was done I put them in the freezer for about half an hour and they were good to come oh they look beautiful well after all this hard work I am happy to say they came out very nice they have a beautiful texture they look wonderful hopefully if any of you guys try this out some of my mistakes will help you guys not make them and then I want something to have sugar on them so I'm just gonna throw the ones that have a little bit of imperfections into a container of sugar shake them up and then lay them out to dry and just a reminder that before you cover your gummies in sugar you need to make sure you have let them sit out for at least 24 hours so any excess moisture evaporates otherwise they will become watery thank you guys very much for watching this video if you enjoyed it please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe also let me know do you guys prefer shorter videos that I don't include any troubleshooting or errors or you prefer videos like this where I kind of talk about things that can go wrong and how you can fix them let me know in the comments below", "Volp_2cRilA": "hi guys welcome back to summertime mama I hope you have a sweet tooth because today's video just might get your sweet tooth going I'm going back to my roots why he lowed us why I am gonna attempt to make what is the latest craze in Hawaii right now and it's called lemon peel gummies I'm gonna be using gummy bears you can use in this recipe your gummy candy of choice but what it's made of is gonna be very interesting it is such a popular thing right now that I had a hard time finding the ingredient to do this but I got my hands on something that I think will work and we're gonna give it a try my mouth stay watering already okay cuz I'm super excited to eat this so this interests you this is a local Hawaii snack any local kid in Hawaii knows about this they've bought it they've made it but I'm here in Montana so let's see how this Hawaii Montana girl does making lemon peel gummies all right so here's the dried lemon it's an entire lemon that's been dried now lemon peel strips would have been ideal for this but again it sold out everywhere so I was only able to find the entire dried lemon whole lemon dried which is okay we can work with that then we need juice of a lemon so either from a fresh lemon or bottled lemon juice some leaking whey powder some granulated sugar and then your gummy candy of choice and I went with Haribo gummy bears cuz they're my favourite so the first thing we want to do is extract the lemon juice again if you have bottled lemon juice that would work just fine I just happen to have a fresh lemon on hand and this lemon juicer so it gave me an opportunity to use it I was able to get about three to four tablespoons of lemon juice I'm really bad at measuring you guys I'm more of a cook by sight kind of kind of person so I'm really just guessing put that into your mixing bowl and then we add the lehigh powder and again maybe one to two tablespoons of that now we want to sweeten it up a little bit more because the lean way powder is sweet but it's also very salty so we want to add some sugar mix it up pretty well not pretty my mouth is watering just watching this [Music] all right set that aside now we're going to prep the lemon peel now again I mentioned the strips would have been best for this recipe but I couldn't find them everywhere is out of stock so I'm cutting up these entire dried lemons and I'm also picking out any seeds that I can find because the seed will add unwanted bitterness to your candy I'm going to throw it in a blender and blend it up we want it to be more like a powder or granules or something more fine that you can sprinkle over your candy I know it doesn't look very appetizing but I promise you it is delicious hey give that a stir again once more we want to make sure that the sugar is well dissolved and start adding your gummy candy and mixing I did four bags of gummy bears because I had so much lemon juice I really didn't think I was going to be able to get that much lemon juice out of that lemon but that was quite the juicy lemon mix in the lemon peel hey I'm gonna taste it hmm [Music] sweet sour salty perfect for carrying my craving yeah a tunnel [Music] so which flavors your favorite out of gummi bears mine is white pineapple that's my favorite and then it's the green one which is strawberry better package this up before I stand here and I eat this whole bowl alright guys so that was it that was my little experiment of making lemon peel gummies for the very first time here in Montana making a Hawaii style snack here in Montana and I think it wasn't a success it's not gonna last long in my house that's for sure and I'll see if I can give some to my nieces because I'm sure they're gonna love it too but yeah this

be slower I don't know guys exercise the first time doing this song if we're having some technical difficulties I do apologize we're gonna try to go through this gummy bear keto gummy bear cook along and do it as a live if you guys have any tips or suggestions about doing lines let me know this is the first one I've ever done and I don't really have a whole lot of information about it I just kind of jumped in hey what's up we got a first person in here how's it going alright so Lindsay's making some coffee because she's kind of tired been a long day we've been ripping and running all day long but we are getting ready to do this keto gummy bear cook along I'm just waiting for some people to get in here so go ahead and comment and let me know where you guys are where you guys are from and I'll shot it back up out actually you guys can go get these from Amazon they're just like silicone molds what were they called in the package you know so just get on Amazon and search gummy bear and what and they come with these little droppers so once we get done we'll show you how they work and these are going to be our molds for the gummy bears these are the ones that the actual bears but we got like an assorted cat that came with all kinds of different ones all right I think it's just what water for liquid and your sugar free jello from the store I go with the jello brand because it's the it's like zero carb I don't know why guys but a lot of times when you go with the store brand like the cheap brand there's usually carbs in there but if you get the name brand there's not usually any carp in it so sugar-free jell-o is whatever flavors that you would like and then some of this gelatin powder you're going to need as well and I think it's just water right just loosely thing okay just water the gelatin and the jello packets it comes with these drops like I was telling you before and once we make our little jello we're gonna suck it up through in here and then form into the moles let them cool off and we're gonna have some keto gummy bears they're pretty good actually I mean well ten calories in a box we were cooking dinner and they ate like a whole bunch before dinner and they said it made him feel full cuz obviously it's a jello but hey what's going on wait why did it say message reject it Oh retracted so anyways we're just gonna try to get some people in here and like I said just comment where you're from and then we'll start to go ahead and cook these things that they don't take very long at all by the way guys it's like we're doing like ten boxes we I don't know if we'll do all 10 boxes on this live but they get enough gelatin my dad Florida what's going on in Florida is weather good out there it's been kind of cloudy here today and humid but still got a good running it was good you also at the latest for days were right yeah I don't know okay so you need these are like just extra gelatin it's not flavored or anything they come in boxes of four and you're going to need one packet two one packet of jell-o no it's raining all day over there I'm sorry to hear that man it's about staying here too yeah we could see the clouds coming in all right I'd like to start with the lightest color first because then I don't have to clean my pan and I hate doing dishes I start with the lightest color we have lemon we have lime we have strawberry we have strawberry banana that's my favorite the strawberry banana man I could eat all of them that's very cherry and then sometimes we like to like layer them and the bigger ones so we'll put like yellow down and let it cool and then put like a red on top and then they come out kind of fine yeah they come out looking real cool they're like layered jello so one of these and then one pack of the gelatin and it goes in your saucepan and then you dumped out our water I did it sorry for water you need 1/4 to 1/3 cup of water definitely no more than like 1/3 cup of water and you want your saucepan on really low and you're just putting it in there long enough to make it melt so it's not granulated anymore you don't bring it to a boil or anything right so you want a really low heat right okay all right so she's just adding one packet of the gelatin and one packet of the actual jello into the pan with the what was it 1/4 cup to 1/3 cup of water we're gonna dissolve it and show you what that looks like in a second just keep it stirring so you don't burn it up again you're not bringing it to a boil or anything like that you're just kind of heating it up enough to dissolve it right hopefully you guys can hear me all right I'm not sure and I'm just gonna try to post this later on even if we don't get any people any more people in here I'll just post it on my channel so you guys can go and watch it for those of you who weren't able to get on the line I don't know about you guys though I'm pretty excited about some freaking keto gummi bears I'm late and it takes really good like the texture is obviously a little bit different they're not exactly like gummy bears but they will really satisfy that kind of candy craving if you're having that I guess you can really do some cool things with these jello packs guys like if you wanted to you could get like a raspberry kind and you can make some keto ganache and then like use the powder to coke the ganache in and maybe like a chocolate raspberry ganache I'd be really good you can really get creative with it and use these the flavoring packets for lots of things how do you go back and see what just dissolved it a little bit but it makes [Music] you take these guys and you suck it up and you just drop it into your molds and start filling them up and then if you want it to go faster you put your gummy bears in the freezer for five minutes and you can pop them out yeah I didn't wait until I get a whole tray and then put them in there and we do have tons big we have like what's five or six of the molds so like if you only had one and you had to do it that way you were making the next batch right but they're pretty quick and easy you guys saw that didn't take very long to dissolve that and now we're just gonna we're getting quite a few actually out of that so yeah you know how faster oh right some of the stars like a plate it is pretty fun something that you could also do with like if you got kids or nieces or nephews er I think some of these are actually chocolate mousse so like if you got chocolate molds in at home oh dude you guys could get those a silicone cupcake molds and make like a huge one I wonder how that come out I the girl who taught us how to make these also said that you could take like salts and take your gummy bears and dip them in salt and then you have like sour gummy bears but I have oh yeah that's outside of it the powder is the sour part of lakes our commutes and stuff yeah the inside thoughts our see you roll them in something sour maybe not pretty cool so I filled up a whole tray of gummy bears now just one packet yeah just one packet push your stars that you've done yeah so yeah it's way more than thing we were wrong about yeah these are like a little bit smaller ago then like average gummi bears they're all the time here I'm gonna do some shells yeah see the comments cuz I don't yeah but how do you get back to them as my question okay so the first batch is pretty much done first batch in the book [Music] strawberry banana so John really loves strawberry banana so I'm gonna double this one cuz it just goes faster yeah use our phone and watch the red comments oh that great idea thank you it means my face these new technology on the phones they need your face I'm already gonna rinse this out bin yeah okay way too late for that all right awesome I know where the chat part is okay so this one's gonna be two packets it's a two packets and then we have double the recipe so then that means you need like 1/2 to 2/3 cups of water so don't forget to like multiply your water as well all right you got it yeah thank you so much that's a great helpful tip I really appreciate so that's how they do it all right I got a little lazy last time and didn't let them all dissolve and like worst cases you're like gummy bears have little air bubbles in them and like little granule it's of extra flavoring so it's not like the end-all if you don't get it perfect not a science basically you know it's still gonna taste good guys last time we made them we had some that were kind of greedy or whatever but we're not very picky picky people especially if we're getting candy on kudos or tricking ourselves into thinking we're getting candy on Keita so she's throwing the ones that we just did in the freezer so they can try to harden up for the next batch before the next batch is done yeah if you guys do try this out let me know how it works out for you guys in the comments go out and get some jello and give it a try make sure you get the sugar free jello yeah sugar free guys that's got the zero carbonate let me see [ __ ] I'm focused ten calories and the whole serving and then zero zero carb one gram of protein anyways keto friendly gelatin comes from are you I don't know it's not vegan friendly well we're not vegans no offense to those who are if you're vegan that's perfectly fine with me with that I just couldn't do it myself I love medium we're very scientific on this channel if you didn't know just kidding I'm pretty excited about this guys we've we've made these before and they're so good and I can actually just throw them into a little snack size ziplock for her throughout the week for lunch and it's just something that gives her like that sweet tooth because that worked she's got this vending machine it's like an evil vending machine full of crap and that has Mike and Ikes in it and that's what she used to always go to before she got on key toes and so this was kind of like our way of finding something for her to have to get ripped to satisfy that craving what she wants to go and get a bag of Mike and Ikes she hasn't done that since it's been really good probably all right so this one same thing this one came out all dissolved and syrupy now we're just gonna do the same thing we're gonna suck it up oh my god it smells so good I feel like I could drink this right now media platform is yours give me this they're crazy okay look like porno but these ones are kind of small and that's a waste of some gummy bears if I mean we don't waste around here guys I may have caught Lindsay licking her plate before because I make food that's so good I'm just saying that was you oh yeah just kidding she doesn't really like her plate guys see they're just little silicone molds of different shapes we got stars and hearts and see shows and all kind of stuff where if any of you have actually tried this or knew about this or heard about this and I hate cooking like if I have to use more than one pan it's it's fine and then all these silicone things I think are dishwasher safe yeah I put them in the dishwasher because we don't I don't like washing dishes so I'm fairly certain they're dishwasher safe thank survived the last round so I'm gonna go in and put some red on top of some of these stars oh I don't think we've waited long enough oh well cool well yeah if this is easy enough to wear my girlfriend's willing to do it then you know you know it's super easy because she's very impatient when it comes to cooking yeah my leftovers because that takes too long I think that's the weirdest thing everywhere I could never eat just cold food I'm hungry I mean let's it's supposed to be eating you cold obviously day two pizza is supposed to be cold oh agree with that microwave pizza is not the same no matter what I'm like oh my leftover is reheated yeah but you also like your food scorching hot and burning your mouth I suppose that's my sister my sister could not eat a meal without her being burning ark she cooks it and then she records it afterwards just to make sure couldn't you use the jello mix with heavy whipping cream and blend it to make like a whipping talking absolutely that's a great idea like a flavored whipped cream like like I was saying you can use it for ganache that's a really good idea I'm actually gonna have to try that and maybe you could even take it and use it in like a frosting you know like a cream cheese frosting to use on some keto cupcakes or some keto mug cakes or something like that so that's a really good other suggestion I might have to do that hopefully we'll get some done ones here we can show you what they look like oh they're starting to freeze actually staying in 200 that was quick pop now you keep on sporting says you've done that with the heavy whipping cream and it was delicious that's a really good suggestion I'm definitely gonna try that out you gotta get creative on keto baby oh man you got so if you haven't if you haven't tried the keto meal replacement shake by American metabolics I'm not sponsored by them or anything like that I just really love the product and it's perfect keto macros and it's delicious and so I tried to make the keto meal pudding and it came out really good it was delicious and I actually put it in the freezer and it turned into ice cream so now I found a super keto friendly ice cream cuz yeah I do like a low top and it's good but sometimes you know there's a lot of carbs in it and sometimes it's hard to just eat half a serving of that thing you want to eat the whole thing and so with the keto meal it's like you could eat the whole thing you probably wouldn't be able to though because it's so much fat in it you'd be satiated I see why you aren't answering texts Tina says what's up sis yeah we're doing a live and uh hopefully you guys are enjoying it oh I'm not sure what you said on the text but I'll get back with you soon if you have keto Mel mix two scoops with heavy cream and it tastes like heaven right that's what I'm talking about them I made made pudding essentially with it actually my god who I've really got a lot of inspiration for from goodie beats the one that I'm sure if you guys are keto friendly you probably know who he is he's pretty awesome and he's going to told me or that's where I got the idea to do that the ice cream with the keto meal I've actually got to order some more of that stuff and getting pretty low on yeah you got that from him also yeah he's pretty awesome guy I love him I think it's called kita with is that the pudding your talk about that they call it that oh he called it pudding and then he called it ice poquito ice creamy all I know is they should call it deliciousness cos it was freaking good man yeah for sure it's really good and these are kind of taking forever to push you out here to it that's probably because I'm just not very good at this so you guys were probably doing much better than me all right so this is the lemon ones you can see that they look just like tiny little gummy bears really good oh those came out really good the texture is pretty spot-on yeah Wow those are delicious I was even better than I remember them being before tea I want to taste the chocolate one - I've got the vanilla cake because it just sounded so good and it's been really good but I think I want to get more of that before trying the chocolate maybe I'll just get both next time safe forget it it's a little expensive but you can use this discount code it's not any more expensive than finding a good protein powder I mean we spent we used to get gold standard before we were on keto and a big thing of that would be like $70 great if you do try the chocolate one man let me know hit me up with some comments and so I don't want to buy it if it's not good making me hungry it's in the fridge right now I'm get ready to go you probably want to rinse out if you use bread before the ring if you want to be super green yes [Music] mom well I suppose living in pasta here they nothing I'm not to eat them all for real they're good guys mmm strawberry banana yeah no I broke my fast if you guys follow me on my channel I intermittent fist my intermittent fist i intermittent fast on Sundays and I love to workout fast we just got done doing that but I came home and broke my fast with a bulletproof coffee he just had 1 tablespoon of MCT oil and 1 tablespoon of heavy whipping cream and so I'll just usually break the fast with something really simple like that and let some time go by like 45 minutes to an hour before I ingest anything else so we're good to go now I do suggest getting like different flavors and colors otherwise you end up with most of them are red you end up with a lot of red gummy bears and it's kind of boring yeah if you want it to be a good visual mix it up mix the colors up that way they look assorted just like you would get a bag of gummy bears at the store they come with assorted colors so you guys definitely have to go out and get some of this sugar-free jell-o's and try this out because this is this definite success good keto hack for those of you who like candy who miss can do on the keto diet this will definitely give you that satisfaction plus I love the sugar-free jealous the ones that come already made they're really good hack for when you have that sweet tooth especially when you're trying to cut and you can't have you're like I'm doing a keto cut right now guys if you haven't been following my mini keto cut series we are on a keto cut and I can't have the sweets that I could have like the keto sweets that I would make I'd make like keto brownies or keto cookies on keto friendly desserts but when you're cutting you obviously want to try to cut all those out and so the only thing that I allow myself to have for like a little sweet tooth is those sugar-free jell-o so I really enjoy those see so we got a little bit of a story color going on we're gonna put the green ones in there when they get done and we'll have a nice color mix we're a little behind on the next batch that gives you time to taste test your product don't you just open a packet of jell-o exploded us you gettin hailed it good for you here so maybe we should have a caution be careful when you're opening your jello pack is guys it might explode inhaling she doesn't share very well so I got sneak sneak a drink I think they're puppy friendly I don't know yeah my wife is Filipino and I have made a lot of her Filipino a lot of her you know that she used to make Kido oh yeah I've never it I don't think I've ever actually had actual Filipino foods but I'm sure it's delicious looks like your favorite Filipino dish dozens of sugar-free jell-o have mellotoxin I'm sure that it has something in there that's probably not great for you and this is probably not going to be something that you eat all the time but you know it's better than putting a bunch of real sugar in your body and eating a bunch of carbs or going off the keto diet this is just trying to find ways to keep yourself on the keto diet and staying keto friendly yeah it does have that ingredient you were talking about but yeah like we just said it's probably way better than actually eating like gummy bears or Mike and Ikes and I'm not a doctor I'm not telling you what to do I'm just telling you what we enjoy the things that we do to help us stay on keto little longer instead of noodles I use cucumber and use it to make noodles absolutely yeah I did that with zucchini also I used miracle noodles as well you never tried miracle noodles I really like those she doesn't really like the texture of them but I really like them and they're zero calories so you can make like a real fatty alfredo sauce with them so the bigger ones I like to mix different flavors in so I'll do half will form flavor and then half with another flavor in it because most of time you're kind of gonna fight those on half anyways and it makes kind of a cool coloring effect alright careful bro it has a higher glycemic index it it's nice to have has a treat but people are even more sensitive to that than sugar in some cases just an FYI I love your stuff hey thanks a lot brother I appreciate it keto home and you're right that you just gotta find out what's gonna work with your body differently for me I've already I've had these before and it didn't have any effect on my ketones or I didn't spike my insulin or anything like that so obviously everybody's different but from what I've researched it's not and this is just my opinion it's not gonna spike my insulin or kick man to ketosis or anything like that so and you are correct like it's not something you probably wanna be eating all day every day but every now and then for a snack to have is perfectly fine in my opinion I use the beanie for noodles as well I got a spiral ER and that thing was like amazing because I used to have to freakin sit there and try to cut him real thing when I was making noodles and they didn't really come out like noodles at all but now I have the pseudo maker that's that spiral things spiral or whatever you throw and then I have a mandolin that I've actually made some really good keto lasagna yeah it's good to change it up sometimes I mean that's how you sustain the diet you know I've never tried to do cucumber noodles though it sounds pretty cool you like a cucumber salad maybe with it I mean like real refreshing for summertime good evening Cindy thanks for tuning in so she's just still over here uh squeezing these out the mold the double batch I'm gonna go ahead and check the ones we got in the freezer yeah pop um we've got some parts here I'm getting pretty excited you know only I think the only thing that we I would change is I would buy bigger mold whatever you call these things silicone molds so that you can do more at one time oh no yeah I should probably clarify that like silicone molds with more molds in them does he it is somewhat of a lot of work for a little bit of product I guess yeah it's not easy it's just like I think to pump out some real volume but I mean you probably don't even need that many anyway to be honest yeah my fingers are getting all sticky [Music] well okay so the green kind of came out like purple it's like a super dark green well they still taste like lime it's like yeah as long as they taste good that's what I care about like I said we're not picking people we don't stress too much about that kind of stuff if you want them even more flavorful John did two packets to one gelatin the texture was a little they still set if you want to do to jello packets so one gelatin but and they were way more flavorful but this was like these are pretty freakin potent already hey so I think if you want like more chewy like if you want that real chewiness you could probably add some more of the gelatin yeah or you can freeze them I used to do that when I was a waitress we'd freeze our gummy bears say it lasts longer in our mouth when we had to let go table table so you could read your gummy bears and they need them alright so in the freezer I'm gonna grab this yeah so the stars are ready and these are gonna be pretty cool here well that one didn't come out different color you know I did that one different color look at that look how thick it is it's awesome and so this guy is layered you can see well it's supposed to be we didn't wait long enough for it to set on the bottom but if you let it set then the layer and they'll be really pretty like that like I said man this is like a really fun activity to do with your kids or your niece or nephew well yellow and red though you know just real fun kid-friendly activity but she we're like kids in heart man because we'll do this on a Friday night you know hanging out I have some dinner and make some gummi bears hey you got I mean if you're into that you probably could make these alcoholic adult gummy bears I guess you can maybe soak them after they come out maybe soak them in some kind of car you like obviously like a spirit without sugar in it you know keto friendly if that's you think all right so all the stars came out really good they're thick ones these ones I like because they're bigger hey I thought you were supposed to be no this was what I'm saying that I can have the sugar-free jell-o except my only thing I give myself when I'm cutting and if you don't know guys we are doing the mini keto cut and I am down and I was this well I'm not gonna spoil that but the last time we

These delicious,\nbite-sized treats came in a medley\nof fruit flavors and soon had every man, woman,\nand child hopelessly addicted. In the early 1980s, experiments\ninvolving gene splicing and cross breeding led to\nthe birth of the gummy worm. But the masses were\nstill unsatisfied. Since then, scientists\nand engineers have been working around the\nclock to devise a solution. Something, anything to quench\nthe global gummy craving. That solution has arrived. Introducing the giant\ngummy bear on a stick. It's enough gummy bear\nto feed a family of six. Research shows this prodigious\npiece of candy tastes just like an\nordinary gummy bear. A regular sized\ngummy bear weighs about a tenth of an ounce. The giant gummy bear on the\nstick weighs over half a pound. That's about 88\ngummy bears in one. Beta testing revealed that\nthe prototype giant gummy bear was too unwieldy to\noperate with bare hands. Thus, engineers designed\nthe portability beam, known as the stick,\nto assist consumption. It aids in preservation,\nallowing the bear to be easily wrapped\nup and saved for later. With the implementation\nof the stick, the giant gummy bear has become\na mobile, mess-free delicacy. And the rest is history. Feed your massive\ngummy addiction with a giant gummy\nbear on a stick. Made in the USA and\navailable now at vat19.com.

make homemade fudge levels I'm gonna share that recipe with you guys today I'm Meg and I'm passionate about finding ways to make life with kids easier in the kitchen let's go through our ingredients you're gonna need chocolate chips a combination of whole milk and almond milk cornstarch cocoa powder vanilla coconut oil sugar and a pinch of salt this is a really easy recipe all you're gonna need is one saucepan put your chocolate chips in the pan add your milk sugar cornstarch cocoa powder and a pinch of salt turn your stove on to a medium low heat and whisk until your chocolate is melted you're gonna want to continue to whisk for about three minutes until the mixture thickens turn the heat off and add some vanilla and coconut oil then whisk to combine once your mixture is thickened all you need to do is pour it in your popsicle mold so I've got these really cool ones but you can use any kind of popsicle molds you have I like the fact that these stand up give it one more quick stir in pour it right in once your mixtures in there wipe all the evidence off of your lips that you had any tapes and put your popsicle sticks right in then put them in your freezer for at least four hours preferably overnight until they're ready to enjoy once your popsicles are frozen all you have to do is unroll them and I'm gonna be honest with you it is not the easiest task so if anyone has any tips for that leave them in the comments below but you unmold them you give them to your kids you have one for yourself they are a delicious snack and I hope you guys love them bye guys how come my face is like fudge it's a Fudgsicle yummy you", "0gsvUuwBZVo": "hey everybody welcome back it's Master\nBlaster we're back at Johnny's green extractions and today we're in the\nkitchen we're gonna make gummy bears today and we're gonna infuse them with\nshatter we're gonna make 100 gummy bears here we're gonna use half a box of\njell-o two packs of gelatin maybe a tablespoon or two of our vegetable\nglycerin and we're gonna use our shatter here there's seven grams in here this\nshatter has to be decarboxylated which means it has to be heated to change the\nform of it from a THC a to THC so that you can get a medical effect from it and\nwith that being seven grams that will break down into point forty five\nmilligrams of shatter in each one of these gummy bears so they're going to be\nquite strong because they are for our own personal use and basically a medical\nused to help you sleep etc I just want to stress the point here that these are\ngummy bears and if you do happen to make something like this it is so important\nthat if there are children around whether it's grandkids your kids nieces\nnephews friends that have kids any kids that come over you can't just hide this\nstuff you actually have to lock this away because if a kid did get into it\nand they do seem to find things they will be hospitalized so everybody keep\nthat in mind and that's with all all edibles that you make that are THC\ninfused okay so our first step here is we're gonna decarboxylate this shatter\nwe're gonna put it in the oven at 200 and\n50 Fahrenheit for half an hour all right that's our first step here all right everybody we decarboxylated\nour shatter we melted our jell-o mixture it's warm remember everything's in low\nheat now we're just going to melt our shatter right into our liquid here slide\nit over to the heat pretty sticky   okay go we're gonna mix that in here now ok we got our hot liquid here we\nadded a teaspoon and a quarter of food glycerin just to disperse the shatter\nin here now this is a little tricky to do so we've got to move quick here here\nwe go and basically that is it okay everybody this is master-blaster\nsaying thanks for watching give us a thumbs up subscribe peace and we'll see\nin the next video bye guys", "7E4h_jZAoII": "we love gummy bears and this time we're freezing them in Sona popsicles of course when thinking of sweet

"hi welcome to dive into light edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and to the regular subscribers thank you so much and welcome back new subscribers thank you again for joining I'm so excited this channel is kind of weirdly taking on a life of its own it's it's really really exciting but a little overwhelming I'm not gonna lie it's kind of cool when there's like you know a couple thousand people seen it but now we're getting into some not large numbers for me um that I never expected and it's like what oh but it's super cool and thank you guys so much I couldn't do this obviously without you so today I know I've got another company recipes up there and I'm always working to refine and make things better so in this recipe this is good for regular gummy bears or regular gummy candies or the sweet and sour there's really only one difference in the change for that recipe whether you want to make regular or the sugar sugar-coated and so I wanted to go for that as well as a little bit a little bit of change in the method but any one of those recipes will work so kind of how I'm gonna how I would list it is the regular gummy bears that I put is more like a condensed jello realistically it's jell-o and gelatin and you harden it up that's condensed jello and then the other candy this the sour one with the the sugar-coated sour ones they're more like a real candy so I know also how the gummy that's more like a real candy versus just condensed gelatin and I will stop babbling on now and also I've got a recipe at the end there if you want to stay tuned on how to make inverted sugar which is a replacement for corn syrup so if Kourt lake corn syrup is difficult for you to get expensive just not available in your local grocery stores you can actually make your own at a fraction of the price and it's super easy to make however it is very very finicky but I go over all of that at the end there about the inverted sugar so I hope you stay tuned for that and and check that out and I think that's all I've got for us right now I'm gonna get in as I usually do get into my ingredients the utensils you're gonna need we'll put everything together and we'll get some candies made we're getting started what you want to do is to get a pot of either ice water or set up a pot of cold water and put it in your fridge or freezer about an hour before you want to start this very important you need the really cold water to start to stop the cooking process for the syrup so just get that set up ahead of time and now we'll get into your ingredients and the tools that you're going to need all right so I'm just gonna go over the ingredients now the ingredients for the gelatin side are exactly the same whether you want to do be regular or whether you want to do the sugar coated it's exactly the same the only difference is whether you're doing the sugar coated or the regular is in the candy syrup and the difference there is if you're doing sugar coated you're gonna use one cup of sugar actually I'll go over that when I get into the sugar part you never mind about that right now we'll start with the gelatin side so you're going to need a one box of jell-o three envelopes of gelatin or three tablespoons you are going to need a quarter cup of corn syrup or you can use what's called inverted syrup which is a substitution for corn syrup I have a video at the end of this to show you how to make your own inverted sugar which I use quite often which I'm actually using today I'm just showing you the bottle for what you've got what you need in the light corn syrup you will need a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/2 teaspoon of gore gum a quarter cup of liquid now I tend to use the kool-aid jammers or the or the kool-aid waters they're great or the Hawaiian punches are great to use as well or you can just use water you're gonna want a half a cup of liquid again you can use your juice or your gelatin I'm sorry your juice or your water for the gelatin and for this you need it needs to be cold so for your gelatin it has to be very cold and for our jello portion we're actually going to boil that and the only other thing is if you want to add some additional color and additional flavor we can do that as well and I think Oh sorry and we also need a quarter tea store sorry a half a teaspoon of citric acid I apologize almost missed that our half teaspoon of citric acid that's everything that we're going to need for our gelatin side and now I'm just gonna when we start the syrup I'm going to go into the ingredients in that for the syrup side and then if previously I talked a little bit about clear gel for the regular gelatin gummies you can actually use this now for either one and again we're gonna do all the work on our gelatin side and add this in so with regards to the clear gel if you want to use it what you need to do beforehand is you take a cup of the clear gel and you mix it with a quarter cup of sugar and you keep that to a side mix it thoroughly so that the sugar and the starch are thoroughly mixed the reason for that the starch will clump if you do it on its own or doesn't have the sugar properly mixed these starts will clump up in your mixture so that is why we add the sugar then you are going to use two tablespoons for your gelatin for your gelatin mix now this is an option now what this does is it takes your candy to that next level that more professional candy like you get in the candy store so it's not as gelatin like it's more it's a little bit softer it's more of that gummy candy versus just like concentrated gelatin and I've been using this ever since I first since I tried it I used it in all my candy now it's I love it it's not that expensive you get a large container of it and it lasts quite a long time so if you do make candies more on a larger scale or on a professional level you might want to give that a try it's excellent it's a little pretty pain to work with but I'll go over all that adding that in so for the candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar okay laureate let me back up here if you are making the sugar-coated gummies you are gonna use one cup of sugar and a half a cup of corn syrup if you want to make regular gummies that are not sugar-coated you're going to switch that you're going to use one cup of corn syrup to a half a cup of sugar but it's to a half a cup of sugar so the recipe is exactly the same this is the only part that'll change regular gummies one cup of syrup to half a cup of sugar sugar-coated gummies one cup of sugar to half a cup of corn sort syrup and the water remains the same half a cup either way you go that's all you need for the candy syrup side temperature cooks to the exact same we're gonna cook it to 260 all right so the equipment that we are going to need is a double boiler you don't have one no problem just what I do use a metal bowl that fits into a pot you want to add water into the bottom to the pot you just don't want it to touch the bottom of the bowl you're gonna need a second pot for your syrup you would let you want to use a heavy bottom pot it works it's better for even the heat distribution for your syrup that way your syrup cooks evenly you don't have any hotter spots you're going to need a candy thermometer a hand blender a whisk a couple of spatulas and a strainer if you've got one handy and I think that's everything that we need for our equipment I usually end up finding something that Wow's that we need but this is generally the majority of the equipment that you're gonna need so next I'll get into the ingredients for putting our gelatin portion together and then we'll then we do the candy syrup and then we combine both of them alright so give me a moment to get everything together here and we'll get started all right so let's get started with our recipe so our very first step what we're gonna do is our quarter cup of liquid we're gonna heat up in the microwave for one minute we want that boiling then with our half a cup of cold liquid we're gonna bloom our gelatin so add that to a bowl and your gelatin you want to evenly spread it over your liquid and again water or the juice I'm actually using kool-aid jam or yes or sorry I'm using the kool-aid waters you know if you do use real juice with real fruit all you need to do is to add a mold inhibitor laureen's makes a makes one and that's what you need to use if you if you use anything with real fruit in it otherwise they will mold very quickly but if you use fruit jammers Hawaiian Punch they don't have anything real in the sugar content they don't go mouldy I literally have gummies that last for months I've never seen mold on them so with regards to your gelatin you want to sprinkle it evenly and then mix it up to make sure that there are no lumps and then you're gonna set it aside for five minutes to allow it to bloom and meanwhile I'm going to microwave this for one minute so you're gonna add your box of jell-o to the double boiler you're gonna set your temperature to low and we're just gonna wait for I'm just waiting for my liquid to boil all right so we're going to add our boiled liquid yeah it got very hot I'm gonna add that in and we're gonna stir that around let our gelatin let our jello get dissolved you might need to add a little bit more liquid to it if you find that it's not fully dissolving but it takes a few minutes anyway and you want to continue to scrape all the gelatin off the sides otherwise it will harden up and we're just gonna stir that and let our water get warm now it's really important with jell-o and gelatin is the heat jello and more gelatin sorry I apologize the our unflavored gelatin melts at just hot a hot water bath if it is too hot it breaks the gelatin and what will happen is your you'll notice it'll start to get very foamy if it starts foaming immediately remove your bowl from the heat and let it cool down you also may need to add about 1/2 a tbsp more of unflavored gelatin because you've kind of broken the the you broken the gelatin a bit so it may not be as sticky or it may not be sorry gel as well so you may I need to add in an additional half a tablespoon to compensate for that so I'm just gonna continue to stir this on the low heat until it is till it's pretty much fully melted until the sugars all fully melted so now that my gelatin is pretty much melted we're gonna add in our quarter cup of corn syrup and get that thoroughly stirred in and we're also gonna add in our half a teaspoon of citric acid we're gonna let that all mix in and melt together again try and keep the sides of your bowl as clean as possible so now that our jello is all melted we're going to add in our gelatin and your gelatin is bloomed when it is nice and spongy if it is squishy at all then either your gelatin is it's not strong enough because gelatinous do have different strengths or it's old and the gelatin is just broken so you want it to be nice and firm and just break it up into pieces and scoop it in and then we're just gonna stir that until that's melted and again remember you just want to warm hot water by at this point you don't want the water underneath boiling at all otherwise your jello your gelatin will break and again if you see it starting to foam up at all take it off immediately now once your gelatin is all melted and everything looks nice like so we're gonna add in our can of butter so you know it in a quarter to a third of a cup of can of butter I'm doing a quarter cup they have dogs and cats behind me [Music] cats trying to trip me up here and then I'd in the Gerber gun this is when you want to use the strainer throw it on there and you want to evenly sprinkle it all over the top and now we're going to get our handy dandy hand blender and so you're going to blend this until it is completely all one color one unit alt one texture and that you're not seeing any kind of oil separation [Music] all right so we've got that all what we called emulsifies so what Gord got gorg um is an emulsifier what an emulsifier does is it allows oil and water to come together essentially it creates a little bubble so when we use the blender it breaks the oil particles up into tiny little part into little pieces and the emulsifier acts as a bubble and holds the water and the oil together in little bubbles that's how it all comes together and your water and oil live happily together otherwise your butter is going to separate and come to the top if you don't use that now a lot of people have asked me if you can use zanza zantac xanthan gum no you cannot it is not an emulsifier it is only a thickening agent so geurim is an emulsifier it is also a thickening agent and a stabilizer that is the other you can use lecithin I prefer Gore gum because lecithin gives it a flavor that I really don't like and I find that the Gore gum works awesome with you don't need the lesser than now at this point if you want you can add in your some additional flavoring I add in about a cup and a half full and if you want to add in some additional color I do it on this side as well I use the no taste red if I'm doing red color so I'm doing raspberries so I use the no taste red reason for that a red die has red food coloring I mean has a tends to have a bitter flavor to it so I like the no taste rent the only downfall about it is you don't get quite as an intense red as the regular ones but I would for rather give up a little bit of the color for than the flavor so I'm gonna mix that in and I'm gonna use the hand blender again just to get it full all mixed together the color comes out much nicer when you use the hand blender [Music] and when you're riding a clear gel you're gonna want to have your whisk ready and coupes and we're going to add in a tablespoon at a time and you want to evenly spread it over the top like so and then use this too and then you're gonna have to whisk it for about a minute or minute or two you're gonna notice it start to thicken up it's just kinda like cornstarch you know when you're making gravy you have to keep mixing it a little while for it to up for it to thicken up and do its thing we're gonna do and you can see how it's starting to thicken up and now we're gonna add in the second tablespoon same thing evenly over the top whisk and you're gonna repeat the same thing we're going to whisk it for about a minute or two until it's all to look pick it up so you can see how it's thickening up here I said you want to continue whisking for about two minutes and it should look nice and smooth and again all one uniform texture and color alright that side is ready is finished now we're gonna do the candy syrup side alright so for our candy syrup side because I am doing sugar or sour coated ones I am going to be using one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and a cup of water now remember if you want to make regular gummies our only difference is you're gonna use a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of regular sugar that is the only difference there you're gonna mix that together until it's up until it comes up together and your sugar begins to dissolve make sure to go all around the edges because the sugar likes to hide on the edges all right so and once your gonna have that all mixed up you're gonna turn your heat on to medium medium-high and you're going to continue to stir this until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you're not going to stir it all right the other one of the things I forgot is you want a pastry brush or a paintbrush clean paint brush so that you can clean off the sides of the pot to use a cup of hot hot water and that'll melt any sugar crystals that you've got and you want to get those off the side because any sugar crystals can cause your syrup to crystallize later on and just continue to stir it until it begins to boil Oh once your syrup begins to boil stop stirring and you're going to add in your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook this until 260 now if you want a firmer candy you can cook it to about 280 so anywhere between 260 280 you can experiment on your firmness if you want a softer candy cook it to 250 but I found 260 seemed to be a really good temperature for it and we're just gonna let that go until we hit the proper temperature now you also want to get your pot of cold water handy and the only thing that you'll do drink the cooking process is if you do see any sugar crystals form just wash them down and now while your candy while the candy syrup is cooking you just want to consider this because stir your jello side because the top part of its gonna start to solidify and the bottom is gonna be liquid because it's closer to the heat so you want to continue sure to mix that up and it all stays nice and smooth and keep it on keep it on low temperature so you have the low hot water bath keeping it melted all right so I've hit 260 take your pot and submerse it in cold ice water turn off your heat and you want to wait until the temperature begins to come down on your thermometer then you're going to place it on the counter until the temperature hits 240 well once your temperature reaches 240 you can remove your candy thermometer and we are now going to add in our gelatin or our jello and our gelatin mixture right so now we're gonna get our jello we're going to get that added in and then you're gonna very carefully stir this until it is fully mixed together your sugar the sugar syrup and the gelatin come together but be very careful because this is very hot you're going to pull it from the bottom and again make sure to get the edges and then it's this is up to you it's an optional step I do I like to use the hand blender on it and the reason I like to use the hand blender is just to make sure that everything is all mixed and blended thoroughly together [Music] [Applause] well see you like that be careful I'm gonna clean up my little mess here and then we're gonna get lit gonna let this sit let some of the air bubbles come out of it we you can work them out by just gently stirring it let it sit and then just look gently stir it again we need this to cool down a bit so you can do that and I'm just gonna clean up a little all right so my mixture is cooled down a bit and I'm going to pour it into my to my bottles my squeeze bottles that was one of the things I forgot in the utensils or tools you need is your squeeze bottles or eyedroppers and I use these squeeze bottles they're by sugar sweet sugar bowel and they've got their nice because they've got the piping tips for them which makes it really nice and easy as well as they have a wide bottle and a wider thread if you use bottles that have too thin of a thread if your syrup is hot or really thick it'll pop the top right off if after you filled your bottles if you still have syrup left just keep it on the lowest temperature just so that we can that you it'll stay so melted there otherwise it will solidify all right so now we're gonna get ready to put this into our moulds all right and then when you're filling up your mold you just want to fill them up just a little over halfway you don't want to go all the way to the top because that way it makes a rough edge on them and it makes your candies not very nice so you just want to try to make them as clean it's also you want to try not to get any jello on the edges there and you're just gonna fill up all of your molds and then once you've got them all filled you're gonna put them into the refrigerator for a minimum of four to six hours I found its best overnight so if after four hours or so II go to try to take about there knock coming out just leave them for overnight usually that usually works if they're still not going to come out of the mold you can put them in the freezer it means that you've got too much syrup the gelatin isn't working too well what you can do is put them into the freezer get them out of the molds remount them at about a tablespoon of gelatin and recast them and then if you find that you take out your candies and they're far too gummy too sticky you can remount them and add a little bit of liquid to it means that it has more too much gelatin you can add up I probably say about two or three tablespoons of liquid to it remelt it and just recast them and this recipe makes about sixty candies if you use smaller molds and if you use those little tiny bear molds you're gonna get about at least a hundred to 150 all right so these candies I had in the fridge overnight and I made lemon yesterday so you can see now I did I have found that they do stay there are better if you leave them overnight then just leaving them for a few hours and they'll come out and you pop them right into your sugar sour mix now your sugar sour mix should be one cup of sugar to a half a teaspoon of citric acid don't use any more make sure to thoroughly mix it in and that'll make a nice sugar sour mix if you just want sugar just use sugar what I usually do is for the sweet ones I will use a cup of sugar to about a quarter teaspoon of citric acid just a little bit because it brings out the fruit flavors so you just mix them into your sugar shake off the excess and lay them on a a rack with parchment paper to dry overnight now these guys also dry a lot quicker and then the other recipe and just pop them out now if you find that they're getting too sticky like this you can put them back into the fridge sometimes they do the when you leave them out they get too warm so as they get a little bit too sticky so what I usually do is take out one mold at a time and do them and that's it you'll continue doing that until they're all are all coated and just lay them out on the rack to dry overnight and those are your sugar or your sugar sour coated candies your sugar soda yeah cannabutter gummy and I just want to go for also a couple of things with regards to molds when you get brand news if you get brand-new silicone molds what I recommend to do is to cut to season them so I use a spray the spray cooking spray I spray it on let them sit for 20 minutes and then rinse them in hot water I don't use soap on them again but I want to rinse off all the excess cooking spray and then that kick that that cures them which is nice I found that red silicone mold do not work well for some reason they're thicker and I can never get anything out of them so I tend to stay away from red silicone molds I found the blues Browns and that work great but red mm-hmm does not work Oh to make inverted sugar replacement for corn syrup you need two cups of white sugar one cup of water and a quarter cup or sorry a quarter teaspoon of citric acid you're gonna need a pastry brush or a clean paintbrush brand new one will be better in a glass of hot hot water we're going to need a pot you want your pot to be super clean there cannot be even a speck of dust or dirt in your pot because it will cause your syrup to crystallize now you want a spatula and your candy thermometer that's pretty much all you need so to get started we're gonna get started in just one moment all right so we are gonna combine we're gonna put in our sugar or 1 cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're gonna stir that till the biggest sugar begins to dissolve and any sugar crystals that are on the side you want to make sure to wash down we'll do that in a minute and if I change you see anything in your sugar at all any dust or any little particles whatsoever make sure that they come out because I said anything at all in your sugar will cause it to crystallize and sometimes things happen you get little little dust or little pieces of stuff I said then wash down any sugar crystals off of the side and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high you want to make sure that your pot is always in the center of the burner so that you're getting proper even heat distribution not where your sugar is cooks prop evenly and so we're gonna continue to stir this until our syrup starts to boil the moment it begins to boil you're gonna stop stirring it stirring once it starts boiling will actually cause your syrup to crystallize and we need to avoid that at all costs so just continue stirring until it begins to boil and wash down and in between keep the washing down the sides of your pot for any sugar crystals whatsoever like literally one crystal will cause your your syrup to crystallize so although it's really easy to make it is very finicky when you're stirring it's also very important to take your spatula and go right around the edge of the pot the sugar likes to settle in on the edges so you want to make sure that nothing's sitting because otherwise if it sits to the bottom it will will stick and cause you problems so the reason why inverted sugar is so finicky and while any crib one single crystal or dust will cause it to crystallize because what we're making is a what's called a supersaturated solution so I don't know if you remember science class see that science stuff does come back to you if you you made saturated solutions and supersaturated solutions where you add a saturated solution is where you have water in salt you have us salt to its maximum saturation point in its water once you go one crystal beyond that it becomes what's called a supersaturated solution and that is what we're making here because we start out first of all with a saturated solution the two cups - 1 cup of water tea cups of sugar - 1 cup of water creates a super create a saturated solution by cooking off the water we are now gonna have more sugar content than your water which then creates your supersaturated solution there you go science for the day you've learned your something new you're done oh sorry one thing I did forget is you're going to need the lid for your pot mine as you can see this one is too big for it if you don't have the right lid no big deal just use them flipped over they work just as good so you definitely need the lid to your pot because once we stop cooking this we're gonna put the lid on it immediately now as soon as it starts to boiling you're gonna stop stirring it you're not going to stir it anymore from this point on you're going to add your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook the syrup to 230 for between 234 and 237 if you want a little bit of a looser syrup then 234 if you want it a little bit thicker than 237 but you're not gonna go beyond that and the only thing now that we're gonna do through the cooking process is wash down the sides of any sugar crystals form that it's the only thing you want to make sure that's equal that's it that we're going to do through the process so keep an eye on the thermometer goes fairly quickly don't walk away don't go be hitting the bong or anything silly like that and as I said as soon as it hits 234 you're gonna wash down any crystals that may be on the sides and then we remove it immediately from the heat place the lid on it and put it on your counter or a stone block and you're not going to touch it again until it's room temperature it is very important that it doesn't get agitated or moved in its cooling process because any agitation again can cause it to crystallize now if your sugar does start to crystallize at any point not a big not a huge deal put it on low heat re melted and it should be fine so as it's boiling while it's boiling into all the sugar melts the crystals can splash up onto the side so said just keep a very close eye and if you've got which imma call it screws here normally there's little bolts here on your pot where the handle make sure to clean around there because the sugar likes to hide in on those and the sugar also will gather behind the thermometer but I only tend to move that one time near the end of the cooking process because as I said you don't want to be agitating your sugar at all so when my syrup gets close to to 29 to 30 is when I will gently move the candy thermometer and wash the crystals off in and behind mat and then gently move it back all right so my temperatures now at 234 I like to actually let mine go to about 237 I like it a little bit thicker so at about 236 I'm gonna pull it because your sugar does still tend to and continue to increase once you pull it off the heat so we're at 235 236 I'm going to remove the candy thermometer turn off my burner remit place it over on my back burner here cuz it's nice and cool wash off any crystals that may be there for the last time be very careful and then you're gonna place your lid on it and you're not going to touch the syrup again until it reaches room temperature as soon as it reaches room temperature you can use it you can either store it on your counter or you can put it in the fridge for up to six months and the one thing is you can transfer it to another container however any time I've ever done that I have it ended up crystallizing I guess the agitation of moving it from one container to another so I just tend to leave it in the pot that I cook it in so I always recommend if you're gonna do that use a pot that it's not your favorite so that if your it's off to the side for a couple of months you're not gonna miss it so I basically designate one pot for my syrup so I'm not gonna miss that pot if I'm if I need it for in the next couple of months and that's it for inverted sugar making your own corn syrup so this said this is I use it quite often in place of my corn syrup it's great if you do not have access to a corn syrup easily or like places in the UK that you really don't have corn syrup you've got I think it's called a golden syrup I'm not sure but now you can easily make your own well I hope you enjoyed that little tutorial there on how to do your own inverted sugar thank you very much for watching you have a great so that's my little tutorial there on a regular gummies and sugar sour coated gummies I hope you enjoyed that as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll get back to you as soon as they can I do apologize I do sometimes have a bit of a delay there I don't mean to but some life takes over sometimes but I do try to get back to everybody as I can and then here's our little of my little lemon and I did lemonade and or sorry kind of turned out like lemonade so there lemon and raspberry and these are there were little little puppies aren't they cute well good luck with your candy making and I'd love to hear how your how yours turned out and if you have any questions about the inverted sugar let me know and I hope you have an awesome rest of your day thank you so much for watching and if you're new here and you like the video I really do hope you subscribe take care have a wonderful awesome day [Music]", "Rasb-rz1Hts": "- I love pot but, the people\nthat are making edibles need to slow the fuck down. (audience laughing) Oh my god, what're you\ntrying to do to people? (laughing) I had a pot gummy bear the other day. (chuckling) I think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldn't be able to steal your soul. (laughing) Right? What the fuck are these people\nmaking these things, man? (laughing) They're not consistent, that's\nalso part of the problem. You don't know what you're getting, 'cause they're not making the same place where they make Tylenol. (laughing) Now there's some greasy dude with a Grateful Dead tee shirt\nand a gray ponytail. (laughing) He's got a bowl of ingredients\nand he can't remember whether or not he put weed in yet. (hearty laughing) This dude's time traveling,\njust back and forth and just keeps chucking\nweed in there 'til it looks like lawn trimmings. (laughing) You eat it and that's not\nwhat you're looking for. (laughing) It's not regulated, you\ngotta ask questions. I ask the dude at the pot store, I go \"Hey man, how strong\nare the gummy bears?\" He goes, (laughing) That's not a unit of measurement! He's like El Diablo, El Diablo. (laughing) Fuck, man. How much should I take? He goes, just the leg. (laughing) Just the leg? Why you selling whole bears? (laughing) The fuck you tryna prove man? (laughing) They just watch you leave\nwith that bear they go, \"Oh shit.\" (laughing) They know, they know you're not gonna die. You gonna think you're gonna\ndie, but everybody lives. (laughing) Learn some shit, you learn\nsome shit from the scary trips. (laughing) See the thing about\nedibles, one of the problems with it being illegal, is that\na lot of us don't have a lot of information that we could use. Like there's a difference\nbetween smoking it and eating it. When you smoke it you get\nTHC, but when you eat it, it's processed by your liver, and it produces something\ncalled, 11-hydroxy-metabolite. That's five times more\npsychoactive than THC, and it lets you talk to dolphins. (roaring laughing and clapping) This is a real moment\nthat changed my life. (laughing) I was in Hawaii and we were\non a boat and we were fishing, we're pulling these lines behind the boat, and I was so high, I\nwas trying to figure out which way the Earth was spinning. (laughing) 'Cause then like the\nboat's going this way, and the sun's up there, I'm like, (long droning humming) (laughing) For like 20 minutes, I'm paralyzed. (laughing) So, while this is all\nhappening, these dolphins just show up, and if you've\never been around wild dolphins, they're very trippy. It's very different than you expect. Because, they look at you. They like check you out, they\nlike pop out of the water and they like look at you. (laughing) Like a person, not like a\nfucking deer, a woodchuck, they look at you like another person. Granted, I was so high I\nthought I was gonna die. (laughing) But, I'm making eye\ncontact with these dolphins and I start thinking, \"How\nsmart are these fucking things.\" (laughing) Because we're fishing, dolphins eat fish, but you never catch dolphins. (laughing) Ever. (laughing) No one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin. (laughing) And all I could think of\nwhile these dolphins are like hopping through the water\nand looking at us and shit. (laughing) I was thinking if people\nlived in the water, you fucking catch them all day. (laughing and clapping) They wouldn't even have\nto live in the water if cheeseburgers just\nfloated down Geary Street. (laughing) At least once a week a guy would be like, I'm taking a chance! (roaring laughing and cheering) And you see them get\nyanked up to the clouds. Fuck, we lost Billy, the\nbottom of his sneakers and a puff of cloud. (laughing) You don't caught dolphins on\nfish hooks man, that's weird. They're around fishing all\nthe time and like, psht bitch! (laughing) They're fucking smart, how smart? Well I watched a dolphin\ndocumentary, and it said, they have a cerebral\ncortex that's 40% larger than a human being's. I don't know what that means,\nbut if you say it right, and don't fuck up the\nwords, it makes you sound smarter than you really are. (laughing) (funky music)", "UcQnm95hO0o": "[Music] hello what's up today I'm going to be doing an edible haul because I just stopped up like crazy but first a DAB or three probably three [Music] this is actually one of my favorite strains it's called the green crack the flower is super good it's a set to you but I think right now it's a whack so you can't see it sorry [Music] [Music] I think I'm gonna do one more because those last few hits sucked okay now I'm ready I just look like that meme have y'all seen yet the cat where they said that's how little kids cough because that's me that's how I cough anyways onto the hall so this is our little goodie bag actually this is a really big goodie bag and then we're actually gonna start on this cuz this didn't fit in the bag it's called give me some mores it is a marshmallow a chocolate-covered marshmallow with graham crackers on it it's by hon ooh there's ten pieces ten milligrams each so 100 milligrams total those are hopefully gonna be good I'm not a big fan of chocolate really or at least THC chocolate just because I feel like with like brownies cookies and chocolate you can taste the weight a lot more and when I eat an edible like of course I want weed in it like THC but I don't want to taste it I want to just be like I'm eating a snack I think that's the point of an edible or maybe not I don't know that's not the point of it but they're better to me when I really just taste like a regular food but then [Music] it's you hard anyways I wanted to try belts for so long I don't eat candy generally but I really love those sour airheads the belts are the strip's whatever the extremes I think is what it's called are having out of it forever but those are my favorite candies and I found these I don't want their sour but these are mango belts there's ten pieces two milligrams each oh they are sour sour ribbon candy and then I got the rainbow belts which hopefully are similar to the extremes lemon strawberry and Apple and these are by Flav I've never had this brand so I'm gonna have to look them up but excited and then I don't know if I mentioned the chips that I got from blue roots cannabis but they were nacho cheese and they were so good they taste a lime Doritos they were better than Doritos and I got him again they had four different flavors BBQ sour cream and onion ranch and nacho cheese and all four they were a 30% off they were only like four dollars I got yeah I got to barbecue these are a potato chip let me read what it says potato chips infused with barbecue seasoning sauce and a Southwestern mix of herbs and spices the nacho cheese ones tortilla chips seasoned with cheddar cheese and a zesty blend of Latin spices and herbs the reason I say that they're better than Doritos is because they have these little spices I don't know exactly because it just says Latin spices maybe it says yes chili pepper paprika and cayenne pepper is probably what makes them taste better like I said in my video about me I like spicy food so maybe that's why I like these more than regular Doritos these are the ranch these are don't eat chips seasoned with a blend of ranch seasoning paprika salt garlic and onion delish I bet these are like Ranch Doritos cuz they look just like it then the last ones are sour cream and onion potato chips with the dollop of sour cream and dusted with savory onion and garlic seasoning these all look pretty good the nacho ones like I said 10 out of 10 I keep talking about them but I can eat those as a regular snack and not know that they have lead in them [Music] they have a little kick whole bag is 10 milligrams so it's sort of a lower dosage because you got to eat like all the chips but they're good then the last atta boy I have in the sugar packets these are by hot sugar which is a fat Panda company fat Panda is pretty known over here they have like edibles flour all of that there are 10 packets 10 milligrams each the guy at the pawnshop said you can put it on peanut butter and jelly and your coffee and your juice really like anything so I'm excited to try these I don't know what I'm gonna use them with but I guess you'll see the retie about all of those edibles is because me and my husband are going to Cape Flattery which is the most northwestern part of the continental USA so that's exciting we have to take a ferry and everything it's going to take us about four or five hours to get there so as you can tell by the title of this video I am going to eat twenty ten milligram edibles I have ten packets of the sugar which I'm going to put in and then I'm going to taste test the other ten edibles that I got in that hole [Music] [Music] I actually just realized I forgot how [Music] [Music] they live [Music] [Music] [Laughter] crack cocaine [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] to collect you [Music] [Music] really excited to try these [Music] [Music] [Music] as I said before I took 20 edibles ten where the THC sugar packets to chips for of the rainbow sour belts two of the mango belts and two of the chocolate marshmallow things my honest opinion on them was that they were really good none of them really tasted like weed so that's a big thumbs up on them on all those brands both of the chips were really good because like I said before I would eat those just as normal snacks definitely recommend those as a lower dosage of edibles to start out with the sour bills were good the main goal lines in the video you probably saw me make a really funny face it has a weird aftertaste but the mango ones do taste like Mexican candy so that's good it might have just been the taste I was in my mouth at the moment but I don't know it was really bad the rainbow ones were good they tasted just like the extremes the chocolate-covered marshmallows were super chocolaty I had to wash my mouth out with a lemonade really good because it was a lot of chocolate which I personally don't like that much but it was pretty good the THC packets I really couldn't taste them I just felt like I was drinking a regular old toasted white chocolate mocha as far as like what I was doing we were in the car for almost five hours so I just played on my phone I played a fun run I talked to my husband I was really sleepy then once we got to Cape Flattery we did the trail which was about two or three miles I really don't remember but it was fine the view was really really pretty [Music]", "gZTWR5_hXVo": "damn let me just squeeze on in here yep there we go him welcome to the show hey it's me mr gibbs do you remember this thing that's

give them gold double barrel shotguns that's what i'm gonna do let's just put down a bunch of those let's see how they like oh yeah that's good okay give him a couple of these yeah there we go let's see what these guys can do against uh i don't know maybe a trevor henderson maybe a cartoon cat maybe one cartoon cat 8 000 health uh they have gold shotguns and they have 100 health seems like a fair fight to me let's go ahead and let them loose all right look out for the cat oh god oh geez oh he's just going through him he's eating them as as one would they are gummy bears come on get him get him there we go very good all right so the shotguns didn't help i'm gonna need to buy a house here we go now this place looks nice this is gonna be a good place for them to settle down and live happy gummy bear lives let me just get up in here okay let's put down a gummy bear he'll put down a mad one there you go all right how's that okay so here we are in our destructible fortress here very looking very fragile um why is there a skull in the fridge what whose house is this okay i'm gonna put down a cat outside all right here he comes now just stay calm don't shoot the floorboards i see you thinking about it it will break okay don't do that oh god i hear him okay be careful just stay in there okay stay in there and you'll be safe i promise oh geez he's breaking things down there he's he's pulling on on stuff oh god hey don't back off the cliff oh you're exposing your butt crack you're exposing it oh jesus don't shoot me guy all right he just put a round in my back hey cartoon cat's given up oh wait he wait what uh the gummy bear just went through the floorboards oh god he he is noticing now there goes gummy bear see i told you i you should have stayed up here and he's dead gummy bear got eaten damn it clearly wasn't a good enough uh structure there let's try this one this one looks much more safe yeah there we go okay um let's open ah there we go okay yeah this is gonna be good all right so we'll put one gummy bear in here bang okay now you stay there look at that cold dead eyes that he's got on this weird stare i just i can't get over i god does he remind me of shrek now there's no way that anything's gonna be able to take this gummy bear this is my last gummy bear all right and i'm not sharing let's go ahead and see let's see if this uh let's put down i don't know let's put down a country road creature oh he might be oh god he's climbing i didn't know country road creature could climb that's news to me i'm gonna go inside and see what's going on in gummy bears head he's shooting the floorboards oh oh he's trying to get him actually maybe if i just crack the door a little bit you know let in a draft oh i opened it all the way okay hold on let me close that just a bit there we go he was getting a little the air was a little stale in there so you know i just want i just want to freshen it up no i don't think there i don't think he can even get in oh that's too bad well it's safe to say this is actually a really safe place to be this is oops oh god as long as i push the right buttons that is there we go all right close that up all right one gummy bear safe uh this guy's having a seizure on top of the roof all right let's see if we can we can get one more safe house out here what is this a rocket can we oh oh all right wait can we can we launch this to space let's see fire oh my god there's actually a rocket in there why did it just peek out and then go back in can we put a gummy bear in there one gummy bear i put him in where is he oh there he is all right it looked oh he's going down to the bottom all right we're launching this gummy bear to space guys here he goes oh jesus oh that's whole that's this is the worst thing that could have happened i thought it was just like a space shuttle i didn't know it would blow up i wonder if the gummy bear being in it just kind of threw it all off maybe that rocket would have been fine if not for the gummy bear hold on i kind of want to see this now there we go we got to open the top first that makes sense now fire now fire come on why is it having such a hard time getting out of there is it constipated what's going on troon one way troon the other way i guess we'll true that way it just peeks out it's prairie dog and it won't go all the way up and then it blew up it's the worst worst missile ever all right well once this radiation goes away oh god it's killing me oh there we go hopefully nothing no funny business happens hopefully there's no zombie gummy bears or anything like that oh god oh geez he's got a sword look at this massive thing some some about his expression is even worse but the most terrifying part is that his ears didn't get any bigger he reminds me even more of shrek now all right well let's see if we can put something down um can i make him i have these things where i can make them more proficient what if i make him perfectly proficient okay he is now perfect if you couldn't already tell yeah he's now perfect all right maximum health 5 000 health um i'm gonna put down one cartoon cat actually no not a cartoon cat cartoon cat's too strong i'm gonna put down one bridge worm let's see what happens here if he gets him with that big sword all right now it doesn't seem like oh god oh what's going on here guys um hmm not not what i thought okay he died he has this big old sword but he didn't even use it hold on let me see if i can let's see how long it takes to kill this thing with this sword one hit it took one hit it took one hit to kill it and he couldn't do it they're not good at hand-to-hand combat or or anything of the sort they need guns they've got a bunch of star wars guns now that'll do them that'll do them well all right gummy bears gummy bears on an army of gummy bears bang there we go small small ears big smile big grin on him god he's terrifying why why who made this god okay let's go ahead and put down um i don't know let's say one siren head ah there we go all right the siren heads loose on the gummy bears now i've got a really good feeling about this uh well actually no they're all right it seems like they're trying to get inside but the fat one's clogging it up oh he made it through okay um siren has just gone wild on him but he is taking a lot of damage they are shooting him that's good guys i think they might actually kill them and kill him as they retreat inside they're all going inside it's i don't know they just they they require shelter i suppose but they're gonna get him real close and then then nothing then nothing oh can he get inside it seems that he can't get inside let's go on in and see what it's like for them in here ah yes okay that's uh they just see a bunch of legs and hands coming through i think siren head can get in if i bring him around this way can he get in oh oh nope still can't still can't get in they're smart i'll give him that the gummy bears they came in here and it seems like they're making their own civilization now uh they've got they're setting up i bet they're getting tomorrow they're gonna have jobs the next day they'll have prostitution bet right that's just how it goes with intelligent beings such as gummy bears um hold on i'm gonna give them some people to rule over all right let's get some citizens in here oh they're shooting at them they're throwing grenades at the citizens they they weren't built for this they're they're kind of mindless i made them that way i took out their brains oh jeez oh no there's a lot going on in there now i really stirred the pot by putting those uh putting those people in there it's really not good there's gummy bears dying they're killing each other i think the gummy bears are afraid of the people they're afraid to be eaten they don't realize that the people they don't feel uh they're not they're actually not real people all right i'm gonna have to take out the siren ad them i'm gonna have to finish them off they really can't do it on their own you know this is wrapping itself up really nicely jesus oh god oh he ate their head but not their ears he didn't eat their ears because they they had already had a bite taken out of their ears that's gross he only wanted the heads god what's what kind of sick freak just eats the heads off the gummy bears come on you got him big gummy bear you can do this okay you're weird ew what's going on with his stomach that's really gross get in there yeah big gummy bears getting them watch out all right i'm gonna say big gummy bear guys i'm gonna save him oh die couldn't save him well a lot just happened here guys you know that's just the way it goes you you get your gummy bears then all of a sudden shrek shows up bugs bunny siren head it's just a lot to unpack um i'm still processing what just happened i think siren had his too he's almost dead he's got a lot of battle wounds from uh from all this from whatever just happened um i think it just goes to show you things that uh the gummy bears aren't they're not very good in a fight you know give them a gun and they can they can stand on their own two feet for a little bit but eventually they're gonna be face down with their butt cheeks showing yeah i really don't know what else to say here all right rate my flip", "ia0fiogJKRs": "[Music] these are gummies

you'll check the Amazon reviews which we will they are actually more like super laxative so what turned these innocuous cute little gummy bears into um the diarrhea it's called maltitol blame maltitol which is a sugar alcohol it's why it can be sweet but not actually made of sugar is this what's we're seeing a lot in sugar-free like sodas and candies and it's a version of it you know and and they specifically used it in this case and it basically messes with your digestive tract on the way down it kind of confusing because most of the time as sugars are going through your intestines they're getting taken out into your bloodstream right but these sugars stay inside your intestines and through this power of osmosis basically you're trying to it's a little complicated but basically the liquids are trying to equalize and get equal amount of this of the sugar on both sides so all the liquids flood into your intestines and then they need to go somewhere so they uh they exit and which is really cool it's really unfortunate what this deli it's really unfortunate for the people who have eaten too many gummy bears but the fact that this was this was initially meant to be you know a good thing you want less sugar and less sugar is in some ways a good thing but it's sitting there in your stomach cuz your saliva hasn't broken it down and it's forcing all this extra water into your sort of digestive system and that's how you get diarrhea too much water in your digestive system so these reviews are out of control if you want to read them there are hundreds if not maybe a thousand what's weirdest made they vary between being five stars and one star because on one hand it's a great cleanse y'all on the other hand oh my god there's one I have here let's see I'm just gonna skip right to the juicy part Jimmy no pun intended okay a little intended what came out of me felt like someone tried to funnel Niagara Falls through a cop straw I swear oh my god I'm gonna skip that line 100% liquid flammable liquid napalm and it went on for hours I had five pounds of these innocent-looking delicious tasting hell bear so I told my friend about what happened to me and thinking it had to be some type of sensitivity I had to sugar substitute and in spite of my warnings a graphic description she decided to take her chances take them off silly woman all the same for her and a phone call from her while on the toy you telling me shed wish she had listened I think she she probably was crying yes so much of this is safe for a person if teen gummy bears 15 not five pounds so if you have more than 15 gummy bears like have like the safe dose is something like a third of a gram of maltitol per kilogram of your weight right so on average for the average adult it's 15 gummy bears for kids it's obviously less you think you can eat more because they're sugar-free but you need to eat less who eats 15 gummy bears gummy bears I usually like 25 or 30 I don't know you're twice as many as you awesome that's why I'm sticking to the sugar ones I'll take the sugar over the other but do you know what this reminds me of do you guys remember olestra the olena potato chips potato chips yeah Wow chip 20 years ago which kind of dating us yeah those wild potato chips were yeah those Doritos that basically it was this artificial fat called olestra and the idea was you don't get any fat but what it did was cause diarrhea really bad and they actually had to put a warning label on it saying this will cause loose stools and when you see those words together loose stools you just don't really feel in the mood for potato chips Oh on the plus side if you ever want to dress up like for Halloween as a sea cucumber all you have to do is eat a whole bunch of these and then like a sea cucumber you too can expel your entire insides it expels its guts out of its very own Ring of Fire so do you think the problem here is what's inherent with a lot of diet foods is like oh well if it's low I can eat more I think the problem is that scientific illiteracy basic you know nutritional illiteracy people need to know more about what they're putting in their bodies and and and some basics about how they work and sugar-free seems like a good sell and like I said sometimes it is a good sell especially if you're like diabetic um but you need to know how many you're eating it's not that you should stay away from sugarfree gummy bears oh I think you should always it's that if you're going to eat them you need to eat fewer than the amount that will make you turn into a sea cucumber this is a it's a dangerous path you walk my friend so I think the lesson here is either keep your portions of the control or avoid multi tall and that is why those gummy bears are the worst sight in

this is vegan gelatin but tell us a little bit about normal gelatin what that's used for and then where the vegan gelatin comes in so we'll kind of go over how normal gelatin is used normal gelatin would need to be bloomed in water if you're using sheet gelatin you would bring it out and then add it to something and heat it up or if it's a gelatin powder you would sprinkle it over the water bloom it again I'm sorry bloom it so that it hydrates and then add it to your that water to your mixture heat it up and then eventually after you heat it and cool it it will make a gel so that's the basis of what gelatin does now this works in a similar way as it does make it gel but you need to use it in a slightly different way you don't just you know bloom it if I were to sprinkle this over water it would start to clump up because it loves water so much so I'm actually going to do a demo right now because I need people to see just the difference between it because if it is a one-to-one replacement for regular gelatin but it's not a one-to-one replacement on the method of those recipes so if you just take a recipe that has gelatin you you wouldn't be able to use this in the exact same way you would get a very similar result but you wouldn't be able to use it in the exact same way so what I'm gonna do and the biggest thing you should do with this is if you have a lot of dry ingredients so here I have sorbitol super-tall is a sugar alcohol it's going to help sweeten our gummies without your raising the calories through the roof so oh okay so I have the vegan gelatin here I'm just gonna pour it in and then I also have right here is a citric acid so it's going to help with acidity and an in flavor I will talk about that a second about why the acidity yes and then this is sodium citrate and sodium citrate acts as a buffer because vegan gelatin it's not the biggest fan of acid and I know I added asset to this for flavor right but I need to add this to my water to help buffer that to allow the vegan gelatin to actually work so and I think it's kind of important to point out that you are dry mixing all your dry ingredients first whereas normal gelatin you might just lose so the reason why I do that is that I'm dispersing that vegan gelatin into a large amount of sugar or sorbitol or whatever you're mixing it in it can be a small amount too it just helps break it up and evenly mix it with the water now this looks like a lot but if I take this here and this is just some liquid that I have that sodium citrate in there and you'll see it just mixes in very easily and it won't clump the last thing I have to do is have a little bit of flavor we're just making vegan gum so if I were to make this and then pour it into a large mold as you can show them right there we're gonna have a giant gummy bear and you can see one that I already have made through the magic of television or internet television the magic of Internet is so so very simply and you can see it's a nice fluid here yeah and I'm just gonna pour it right into a pot and I'm gonna bring it up to a simmer the reason why we bring it up to a simmer is that it needs to activate so when I heat it up it's going to hydrate which it pretty much just means dissolve yeah it's going to dissolve all those little bits of vegan gelatin and then when I cool it it's going to turn into a gel now temperature-wise am I looking for would be looking for a different temperature than we would be looking at it's a a traditional gelatin recipe like is that a modification to watch yes oh absolutely when you're using vegan gelatin it it gels just like gelatin sure but the properties are slightly different so it's going to up here a little bit it's going to gel a lot quicker than regular gelatin if you ever made it like a gel of desert you take it you pour it into the glass molds and he put it in the refrigerator or the kids would stare at him for three to four hours before they're even ready they start to or or until the end of the episode in this yeah so you can snack all you want okay with this once it hits 140 degrees it could still be pretty warm to the touch it will still be warm to the touch but it would be gelled yeah so if this happens a lot faster so you can have dessert ready you can make this almost album new you can make it and have it ready at when it hits the table so it's pretty good as long as you're doing it in small amounts like I'm making gums or what yeah like this you know mold this big that that'd take a while but yeah not really this took what like 20 minutes in the ice bath if that yeah as long as it was set up and I could pop it out yeah see it right here I made one this morning and that's when you go with like the aggressive giant gummy bears and you're doing the little drop since we yeah that's all how long it takes that that the cold temperatures to get through to the centers that are very easy so we can just see it heating up right now no this works with a lot of different recipes it doesn't just have to be a gum or like a jello style dessert this can replace and I know you get the recipe when you actually order this product gelatin that's usually found in marshmallows yes that's how I met this product and you were like look we get marshmallows I was like wow life change they're not dense the only additive that you add is a versa whip which helps with the kind of the fluffiness of the marshmallows but you get a beautiful vegan marshmallow that tastes just like a normal marshmallow I wouldn't yeah if you have a friend like the freeze dryer like we have it was the world's largest Lucky Charms Marty absolutely about five pounds so one of the things you'll notice well that's kind of getting yeah well it's doing its thing is we've got our mold in an ice bath that's not necessarily a recipe thing that's a you know these these aren't a modernist pantry mold this was just something we picked up you know it's the plastic molds not the silicone molds that was a learning experience yeah because it's the first one we it looked like a pug yes so this does heat up quite warm and if you see it on the overhead you can see it I'm coming up to well over boiling temperature there's so much sugar alcohol in here that it's going to need to come up a little bit higher so I pour it into the mold and the first time I ended up with the almost nothing so I just put it in a little bit of ice bath and that's gonna have really helped it set almost immediately yeah now if you happen to have a silicone mold these ones do come from mana dispensaries yeah I did actually yeah I couldn't be one-to-one it's what you used for the small gummies right yes definitely want to treat yourself to the silicone mold over a cheap plastic mold you'll just have a much better time with it you won't have to worry about the mold melting on you plus super super super reusable for all of your things and one thing that's different about these is you don't have to dust with cornstarch or anything like that you can it helps get them out but I was able to just pour it right in there very easily and then pop them out within maybe 10 minutes because they set up so quickly yeah so it's good because we wanted to show people how to use this product if we had I think a few comments last week about a again do a demo and yeah we won't be able to do one every single week because some things are a lot more difficult a lot more time-consuming but this is so simple we want to show you how simple it is that you can make it gummy now it won't set up unless we want to sit here for about you know 10 20 minutes Francois yeah so but we'll show you that once I get it in there and then yeah give it about 10 20 min so you could have a giant gummy bear to show off for your friends for those of you playing at home yes this means that we will have access to two giant gummy bears so if you're in the area I don't know so if traditional gelatin is made from from animal based products this is actually made from red seaweed so it's whatever gives the seaweed its its structure you extract that and you start at phones ringing yes a little bit yeah so whatever gives the red seaweed its structure its extracted and it gives the gelatinous structure and as we can see right here I'm getting a nice boil on our vegan gelatin gums so I'm just gonna stop but I'm gonna let it cool down just a little bit before I pop it into the mold I don't want to pour it in directly because it's so hot at this point I don't want to melt any bit any bit of this mo because I do want to reuse it will have another puggy bear yes um so yeah you would say it comes from it comes from in this case it's a red seaweed if there are other seaweeds and if you just like where to Google vegan gelatin agar agar is kind of a commonly used one this one's not well one it's easier to use than they are certainly yeah it's about the same it's just all dealing with the texture yeah because we want the texture that's going to simulate traditional gelatin as closely as possible if you want to just just show them that the jello desert the wiggle of this so it's it's crystal clear yeah and it jiggles and but it has a nice creaminess that is very similar to gelatin yeah and that's one of the things I really like about this is that it's not just for items that have gelatin in them yeah I like to kind of replace a little bit of like eggs that are in custards for vegan custards and things like that because you get that texture if you mix it with it with soy milk you really get like a beautiful almost you know creme brulee kind of flan which you've had and yes like that you can make some really amazing things so it's not just a one-trick pony it doesn't just simulate joked and it simulates a lot of different things in it I think the testing will really show over time is like well how versatile this is yeah and just the big big big things to look out for is make sure you try mix it first no matter the recipe I know we're gonna keep hitting on that a lot it's because otherwise as soon as it hits water it does like clump as long as you try mix it even with the sugar that's in your recipe or whatever it'll so I just want to show everyone that it sits nice and fluid it's not clumpy if if it does clump up for some reason it may be that you did the the recipe wrong or the recipe ratio is wrong that you got we do have a few recipes that we are you know putting out there for you guys if you go to vegan gelatin if you search for vegan gelatin on modernist pantry com you see this exact recipe right below it so it has all the links to the ingredients and a very base recipe that you can make any flavor that you want yeah super simple I'm use myself as home kitchen hot mess I do mean it I even I pulled off this Gumby recipe no problem yeah so I'm just gonna actually pour it right in I'm just gonna fill the base no I made a half gummy for you to take home that's fine yes two full gummies is a finish it great I don't want to look like the vegan gelatin um all right so you know to kind of play around with it and get going with it vegan gelatin just to do the quick break it's $15.99 for this four ounce to put that in perspective for the home cook that's sixteen packets of traditional gelatin is worth so you do get quite a bit of playtime out of this whether you're going for confections it's also kind of good we were talking we were chatting about shallots and uses about including it in your stocks right this is something you do even with traditional stocks to add a little bit more of that mouthfeel yeah so so if you get like a canned veggies stocker or whatnot from the grocery store and you add a little bit of this and obviously I would dry mix it with maybe a little bit of salt or something or if you want to you could put it in a blender and then slowly sprinkle this in if you're not adding any other 3d in so that's another easy way to add it so I'm do that and then heat it up it will add a little bit of viscosity to it when it doesn't hot this is usually done in very small amounts so you don't want it to turn into a thick jello because jello no veggies dog is never gonna be thick jello it yeah it sounds awful yeah exactly but for that nice little bonus and mouthfeel that you typically lose this / - I make my own stock it's it's watery but because it's all veggie stuff it's quite it's alright so this is gonna set up before a little bit while we stare at it longing Leigh we always in these WTF stalk about not only where we transform food but what's the food we talk about what's the food babe better what's food possible you may have noticed this in our last episodes this one's probably gonna be a little bit different because with vegan gelatin it's all about what's the food made possible and in this case it's everything would traditionally rely on that gelatin that animal-based gelatin was just a reliable one just one replacement so here's a little thing is it each one of those packets from like if you bought a powdered gelatin it comes in packets now each one of those packets is seven grams so this is exactly seven grams I believe it's a teaspoon that's in one of those packets as well so if you see a recipe that says add one packet of whatever gelatin powder gelatin if you take seven grams of this or a teaspoon and you add it in and in just the way I showed you I went in bloom if the recipe says the bloom disregard because you're using something slightly different so if you add this in you're going to get the same thickness as you would in the traditional recipe because it is a one-to-one replacement yeah and now that you've kind of seen it done you'll know what to look for when you cook it but I got to tell you because I don't have the poly science wonderfulness an instant-read thermometer goes a long way especially just for your first time working with it and so you get used to the feel and how it looks when you're whisking it through the pan so an insta read thermometer the Druids grow vegan gelatin is if you can see it on this side here it is organic non-gmo gluten-free and vegan so that checks all the boxes for making amazing amazing things and this is a really really fun ingredient all right anything else we want to say all right no I to be honest I think it's one of my favorite ingredients as well just because it's so versatile and I've been able to make a lot of really great vegan alternatives to many items so awesome alright so

Oh you want somebody", "cFwlIAzxTGc": "[Music] hi welcome back to Diamond delight animals my name is Liz and this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular welcome back so today I am going to show you how to make these awesome Jolly Rancher gummies from actual Jolly Ranchers that's right so I make these with canister up you can also do them with the can of sugar if you want to know how to make those I do have videos they're made from textures there is a specific one can of sugar and then the other one for the can of syrup is can of flour powdered sugar and syrup not well show you how to make the syrup if you'd like so from the actual gummy art from Jolly Ranchers I've made these gummies and I'm going to show you just how to do that so it's usually I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need to put that together and get it all put together for you so you can make these awesome candies well one thing I did I want to tell you so in the recipe I used three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I would recommend using four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin to the same three quarter cups of liquid so I I will put the correction in the ingredients in the comments I do sorry I'm they turned it a little bit softer than probably what I like so I would go with four tablespoons of the unflavored gelatin all right so now we'll jump into those ingredients and get right to her alrighty so for our Jolly Rancher gummies what we're going to need is about twenty of your preferred flavour of Jolly Ranchers so I'm going to use the blue raspberry and peeled of course take off graphics you're going to need a quarter cup of can of syrup that we're going to mix with this then for our candy syrup we are going to need one cup of white sugar regular sugar and 1/4 cup of can of syrup and a quarter cup of regular light corn syrup 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and a quarter cup of water for syrup then we're going to need three and sorry three and a half tablespoons to four so if you've got the packages of the gelatin you can just use the four packets they got a little bit off one you'll be good and 3/4 of a cup of water for your gelatin cold it needs to be very cold and then for our equipment we are going to need a candy thermometer a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler just use a pot where another heat safe Bowl will fit on top and that will suffice another pot for your candy syrup a couple of spatulas and then your bottles if you've got the bottles for dispensing your syrup if you don't have these guys these are great things if not you just use your eye droppers you've got those and of course your molds and that's everything we need to get started so let's jump right in and get it going alright so our very first step we want to do is bloom our gelatin so you are going to take your three and a half tablespoons and you're going to sprinkle it over your liquid you want to kind of get it all mixed around and then you're gonna get that you're gonna mix this in your gelatin into your liquid so you don't have any lumps and while you're mixing this this is a good yet to know whether your gelatin is a good strength or that it's not too old while you're mixing this it should already start to gel and while you're mixing it it should how to get turns to about the consistency of applesauce and that's how you know your gelatin is good and then we're going to just put that aside to bloom or total ready to loot till we need it now we are going to melt our our Jolly Ranchers and our corn syrup so we are going to melt our Jolly Ranchers and a quarter cup of our corn syrup all on our double boil just don't forget to put water in your bottom of your double boiler I've done it how come I plug it in hold on alright so we're gonna turn our heat on to medium medium or medium-high and we're gonna get our candy put your Jolly Ranchers into the pot mine got a little stuck in the bowl here got a lot of humidity too don't want to give it up gotcha and we're gonna put in our quarter cup of corn syrup our can of corn syrup and that eats up everything will begin to melt the Jolly Ranchers will start to melt you just want to try and get the candies covered and covered in the syrup just start getting things moving around but just going to continue to stir and this until the until your candies though the Jolly Ranchers are completely melted so it does take a while for the candies for the Jolly Ranchers to melt just be patient it does get kind of goofy and glumpy don't you can see that but just be patient it will all nose what I do is I let it sit for about a minute or so let it get heated up and then I stir it around breaking trying to break it up mush it down you just don't want to really overwork it does that just continue to do that your lumpy mess will turn into a nice syrup will see very shortly all right so now my candy start my Jolly Ranchers are all melted so you can see that a little better so we're just gonna set this off to the side for about five minutes to let that cool down before we add in our gelatin because if we add in our gelatin now it'll be too hot and it can break through gelatin that's a lot of problems that happens with with it so the next stage I'm just gonna let that cool down and we'll add in our gelatin and get that melted in and then we'll make that by the candy syrup and get it all put together so now that my syrup is cooled down it's time to add in the gelatin and I like to just do this and cut it up into smaller pieces and then we'll just plop we're all in and get that melting now you'll find if it's not melting you can turn your heat on to low put it back on the double boiler auctioneers probably enough heat from the water still from the double boiler to to melt the gelatin if it's not hot enough right still Cece was started melting because we have the cold temperature and the warm you can kind of have a separation here but once everything comes to the same temperatures and everything will mix together so you may find that your candy is kind of is starting to solidify getting a little clumpy well the gelatin is not really is not fully melting if that's the case then turn your heat on to low or just want to gently heat the reheat that up you just have to be patient with this because it is gonna take a few about five or five minutes or so for everything to come together properly you might think oh no it's not working but don't worry be patient so you're going to continue to gently stir this over the low heat until everything your Jolly Ranchers and your gelatin of all melts together in one even uniform syrup and there's nothing sticking to the bottom of the pot yeah once everything is melted together and everything's one uniform texture and color and there's nothing sticking to the bottom and now if you find here you may want to add a little bit of additional food coloring because the blue with the green it's gonna muddle that blue a little bit so if you do want that with more intense blue like your Jolly Rancher go ahead and add a little bit more blue food coloring it's just exactly what I'm gonna do here so you took the one out of much just one drop will make one to two drops at the mouth you can see the difference there with one drop me get that mixed in so that's a much nicer blue how well you can see that so I skip it too much then it's gonna I'm gonna spill it and not like we haven't seen me see me do that before so we want to see what the color is gonna look like you just drop it onto something white there and I'll just see what it looks like so I'm happy with that color goody-goody I'm just gonna set this off to the side and we'll get our candy syrup started alright so for our candy syrup part portion we're gonna pour in our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of cannister up our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our quarter cup of our sorry our half a teaspoon of citric acid and our quarter cup of water and we're gonna get stirred together so you just want to get it mixed together so the water and Evert the sugar in the syrups are all incorporated and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high forever this pillar so we're going to continue to stir this until until it begins to boil then if you have any duty sugar sugar sugar sugar crystals are so acceptance I just want to scrape that off or get a pastry brush and hot water and just wash down the stop then as soon as your syrup begins to boil you're going to stop stirring and we're going to watch your candy thermometer and we're going to cook the syrup to 260 degrees Fahrenheit and that's it just the letter go now periodically don't forget about your jelly the gelatin and your candy syrup you want to go around and stir that because it we can do start to solidify around the edges if it's like to pull off too much solid once once go around and just make sure that it's all still doing good but don't worry it'll get remelted once it gets out we added into the hot candy syrup whose life my candy almost up to temperature once you hit 260 you want to remove it from your meat immediately keep the candy thermometer attached because you want to wait until the syrup comes down to about 240 before we add in our other mixture the best is that you have a stone or marble surface to put it on is the best thing it draws the heat out quickly and and it doesn't get the surface doesn't get hot at all if not just put it off to the side burner and wait until your heat comes down to 240 all right so now my temperatures come down remove your candy thermometer grab your can you stir up your gelatin and your Jolly Rancher syrup and now we're going to gently pour it into our candy pot candy syrup here it'll probably bubble up a little bit and then you want to gently mix this and and continue stirring until it's all combined and you want to try to stir it gently to incorporate as little air MIDI as little air bubbles as you can but we need to make sure everything gets stirred there we go and once you're all good with air we're gonna get this poured into our bottles or you're just gonna use your dispensers your little eye droppers so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pour it through a little strainer this isn't necessary if you've got one great if not don't worry about it so because it gets so hot these gelatin may break a little bit you get that little bit of whiteness I can't really turn the pot that way for you but if you do you can run it through a strainer just so that doesn't get in and if not no worries it'll all kind of go up to the top I'm just gonna pour this in I don't want any left in here now one thing you can do is you can fill up if you want to know if your gelatin it's gonna set correctly is you can just set up one or two cavities in your in your candy mold put it in the fridge and it should start to solidify very fairly quickly within about five minutes or so it should start to set so you'll know if it's still really gooey and tacky then you may have difficult study let it leave it for twenty if after twenty minutes it's still not setting then the gelatin has gotten too hot or it is not it's not some notch Ellington's are all the same strength so it may not be strong enough you can remelt you can add that back into the pot and add in about another half a tablespoon more of gelatin so this way it saves you a lot of time and this has got to cool down anyway because it the bottles are too hot to handle even if I use the oven mitt you don't want to do it when it's super hot because what will happen is it'll warp your bottle and it'll screw them up so one of those will end up leaking on you so you don't want to do that so while my bottles are all that while I'm waiting for my syrup to call I threw a couple into the fridge so I'm gonna see how they're gonna set up now I wasn't setting you may find your bottles because the bubbles will start to come to the top and instead if any gelatinous broke them out White's gonna come to the top as well so what you can just do is get a little spoon and just scrape that tops kind of skin right off of there oh yeah that way it's not gonna end up into your candy and make it muddled want to have a nice clearer looking syrup all right so I did check my candies they are starting to set up nicely because the syrup is hotter it's taking them longer and I don't want to leave this get too cold so yeah so the velocity is really you just distribute it into the molds if it's still a little hot for your hands full you can use paper towels on it which is exactly what I'm gonna do cuz that's too small just hold up some paper towel to put around it I thought I don't go with the oven mitts because I find that they're heavy and clunky and that's it just disperse it into your molds and put them in the fridge for about two hours for them to fully set and I'll come back we'll pop these out to see what these bad boys looked and chase like I tasted the syrup and oh my god it's so good it tastes just like a jolly rancher now if you find that your candies don't set you put them in the fridge for two hours they come out and they're still sticky you can't get them out of the mold don't panic put them into the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours let me get good and frozen and then pop them out so I don't you have to do one mold at a time take them out one at a time pop them into a double boiler remelt it add another half a tablespoon to a tablespoon will be good enough bloom gelatin and that will fix that problem and the same thing if you you've gone you've made them set them up and they're just way too jelly they're very very jelly to sick you can still you remem and add in a little bit about a quarter of a cup of liquid and that should take care of that all right so I will be back when these are set and we'll pop them out and see how pretty they look all right so welcome back here so my gummies I have them sitting in the fridge just over two hours and now we're gonna take them out so as you see first it looks like they're gonna be sticky but you just got to pull around the sides and we'll start to pull away as long as they're doing that and you can pull them out you're good you're gonna slay them on your parchment paper or stand them up if you can some of your candies molds are able to stand up others won't so I bought these guys on their sides and then also when it's warm especially it's warm I only take out one or two molds at a time to take them out and leave the rest of the fridge so that they don't warm up too much if I don't have a hard time getting them out of the molds and then I'm just gonna let these little guys dry for 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go yeah if there is still a little bit sticky once you've dried them you can toss them in a little bit of cornstarch so you don't want to do too much usually what I'll do just coat my hands in them and then run my coat my hands and cornstarch and then just run my hands through the candy and just kind of get a very light coating on them the other thing is you could do the same thing with oil so if you want to just take some cooking water olive oil coat your hands to them rub it in and then just gently go over your candies look at a little bit of an oil that will help them to stop from sticking as well and there you've got it Jolly Rancher canna gummies look at that baby and these guys taste so good oh I tried one earlier I don't know if I'm gonna get these to drying time get them fully dried they're so good but anyway guys that's it for that tutorial I'll be back to say goodbye and yeah that's about it oh one thing is gonna tell you so if you tried taking them out of the molds and they weren't coming out they're too sticky as I said don't panic put them in the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours pop them out put them into a double boiler let them melt down again and then bloom a quarter or sorry a half a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of liquid blue matte add that in and that will take care of that problem recast them and you should be good that's awesome thing we working with gelatin and the either if there is a mistake you can usually fix it as long as you haven't burnt it oh and remember that this version of the recipe is just for playing gummies we are not going to sugar or citric acid these if you do they're going to melt I will do another version of the Jolly Ranchers of the sour version for you okay so don't add your sugar and citric acid to this they will melt so that is my tutorial on a can of Jolly Rancher gummies I hope you enjoyed that and if you have any questions as always please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and as I said in the beginning of the video in case you just skipped right over it use four tablespoons of gelatin versus three and a half it'll make that little bit of difference or a little bit softer than I probably would have liked but if you like a softer gummy go the screen 1/2 but if you want that more firm gummy go with the four and you'll be good to go check out that baby's its see-through ish it's got that clear candy looking it tastes just like a jolly rancher it's so good so please let me know if you give this a try I'd love to hear from you on which flavor you prefer and once again thanks so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "Um1XR-O3jY8": "they are pink so guess I'm doing my intro in my kitchen today because lazy go y'all today I have a new DIY season eyes I am going to make my first giant gummy bear but not just any giant gummy bear oh cool a gummy bear made of cooling and flavored of kool-aid because kool-aid is iconic I thought I need to do something with cool a hypothesis and if I'm sweaty it's because it's really hot in here I've been cooking a lot of fun socks these intros are films after I cook so my gummy bear is sitting right there I'm not going to show you till the end two things don't forget to turn on the notifications it's the little bells symbol click it so you get notified whenever I post a video it'll get sent to your phone and be like being up series under video well and once I go almost if you have a really cool phone also follow me on Twitter snapchat Instagram all the names will be below I'm going to get so much love talkin to you so go problem in there so we can communicate more oh also follow me on you now I'm going to be doing a lot of broadcast next month this month is a little busy so next month I'm going to full swing of things so all the links to those will be below they got my heart okay and so in the yellow young wait I thought I held on to awkward no it's too much I thought the frame was going to be less on just like I said a little bit I just lit out for too long too much okay y'all so to make this gummy bear I took a big pot and I started filling up with a lot of agua aka water they can a art human gasoline it's what we live on google it science amen thank you lord for water so then I took this huge thing of kool-aid and I just poured it in a taupe beautiful honestly it looks like the Aurora lights in Alaska you know I'm talking about like the lights in the sky the aliens me also aliens have made me I'm a conspiracy myself I'm an alien King what I didn't say that you didn't hear in here that was a Mandela effect so I'm adding tons of unflavored gelatin I'm just pouring in a lot of packets like a lot like y'all that is 20 times sped up no joke literally 20 times I just kept adding and adding and then anymore and then also some more cow bones and then I mixed it up and then okay this is a long mixing part why why why is it so long I don't know why did I make it so long oh my golly am I still mixing my Narnia what's happening so I finally finished mixing and now it is time to cook it so I basically just cook the gelatin until it was dissolved so I'm mixing it and I cooked it and until it's steaming like that I see it steaming you see the steam rising from the car in Titanic so then I got my gummy bear mold and I just basically poured in my kool-aid jello mixture into the gummy bear slowly but surely it's almost full and y'all I know the gummy bear was so much bigger in the thumbnail but guess what guess what I felt like yeah I felt like making it big that's the answer bigger is better when it comes to candy so for the third gummy bear what I did was I added in some frosting just to make it more of a less see-through color and just to you know experiment make them a little different I made three so that in case of one messed up I would have two backups I'm a genius now thank God on one of them I put Pam like first before I like comporting the stuff cuz though in the head Pam and the other two I forgot to put Pam on them so they completely got stuck I know gelatin could even get stuck well I don't know these things so that's my final gummy bears the one with Pam on it Pamela always saves the day and that's me dancing with it and now I'm tasting it and it it's okay it tasted really good by added way too much gelatin like always I need to add less it's just I always always want to be on the safe side you know I'm saying but yeah I don't need that much gelatin and it's probably not good for you to eat that much anyways so um now is the video thank you guys so much for watching don't forget to watch my last DIY where I made a giant cheese ik and also I made a giant Oreo recently so go check that out as well I love you guys so much I'll see you next video ooh boo boo they fill a few seconds okay oh boo boo wait there's still five more boo boo", "oQhItiXuOJ0": "[Music] parents look closely at this picture it looks like regular coughs syrup if you saw it in your childhood room would you think twice about it it's called cush the drug got a Miami Dolphins player arrested in Collier County this week and then he was cut from the team we sent NBC to investigator David Hodges to find out what it is and you know if these illegal drugs are hidden in plain sight being a big issue for parents and Peter the biggest danger is that they're far more pwned than anything parents may have seen or even tried when they were young so to help your kids we're gonna help you spot them at a quick glance you might not recognize it what does this look like to you ketchup pills that looks like marijuana syrup the final answer is correct Kush syrup found in the car of Miami Dolphins player and Collier County sold in a medical marijuana dispensary in California but not untouchable for kids in South West Florida pretty much everything through online channels you can figure out a way together Steven hill helps kids with substance abuse at Sal's care he says teens will try something like Co syrup just because it's new but I just think it's a different way to do it different and possibly more dangerous syrup has a thousand milligrams of THC the active principle of marijuana per bottle and if taken all at once 10 to 20 times what you're typically going against smoking a joy the side effects would be palpable a lot of times very erratic hallucinations and you can also get psychosis on a temporary basis so the the judgment and your behaviors are definitely impacted grown-ups don't know Lesley Robinson is founder of Street chicks and recovery which runs a marijuana adolescent prevention program in Lee County middle schools she also produces videos helping educate kids about some of the side effects of marijuana in products like Co syrup and it's so potent you're gonna be able to tell your child is high she says the best way for parents to spot these drugs is to pay attention to the new products on the market educate yourself on the other forms besides the bag and the smell the Collier County Sheriff's Office told us they don't recall ever making any arrests where this kind of syrup was down before but many of these drugs come and wave so the best advice for parents be on the lookout if you didn't buy it or authorize it question it for the NBC to investigators I'm David Hodges call email or download the NBC 2 news app and submit your tip now", "n3_dV-e4d9c": "For this video, I\u2019m going to show you how\nto take a few simple ingredients, and make mountains and mountains of your own custom\ngummy candies, at home. Start with a box of Jell-O, some corn syrup,\nand a few packets of unflavored gelatin. The small boxes like this have 4 packets inside,\nand for this recipe, you\u2019ll actually only need 2 of them. Get started by measuring out 1/2 cup of very\ncold water, then squirt in 1/4 cup of corn syrup. Cold water will help the gelatin separate\nproperly, and the corn syrup is going to give our gummies a nice smooth texture. Now we need the corn syrup fully dissolved,\nso give it a good stirring until the water turns completely clear. Then go ahead and\npour the sugary liquid into a pot. But don\u2019t turn on the stove just yet. I\u2019ll show you\nwhat happens if you do in just a minute. Go ahead and add both packets of unflavored\ngelatin to the pot, then pour in the entire packet of Jell-O.  Now it\u2019s going to take a minute or two for\nthe gelatin to absorb into the water, but take your time and be patient so you don\u2019t\nmake a mess. And keep stirring it slowly, until you can see all the gelatin is mixed\nin. Alright, it\u2019s time to heat things up, and\nturn this sugary soup, into a delicious candy syrup. Set your stove to medium-low heat, for around\n5-10 minutes, making sure to stir the candy mix every minute or two, to keep it from burning. While that\u2019s warming, it\u2019s a good idea\nto find something you can use as a candy mold, like these ice cube trays, I found at the\nLEGO store. When you see the gelatin has completely liquified,\nthe syrup is ready for pouring. And you should be able to pour it straight into the molds.\nBut be careful not to spill, because the syrup\u2019s extremely hot, and will burn you. Now if you see little lumps, clumps or bubbles\nfloating to the top, it\u2019s probably because you didn\u2019t start with cold water, or you\nheated up the mixture too fast for the gelatin to fully separate. But don\u2019t worry. There\u2019s a really easy\nway to fix it. Pour all of the syrup into a tall and narrow,\nheat-resistant container, like a large drinking glass. As you do, you\u2019ll immediately notice\nall the bubbles and gelatin lumps, start rising to the top. Let it sit for around 10 minutes\nto give it all a good chance to settle and cool a bit, and you\u2019ll soon see all the\nimpurities collect together at the top, and separate into a layer of gummy foam. Now check this out. All you have to do is\nreach in with a spoon or a spatula and scrape this newly formed skin away. Just like that,\nyou\u2019ve got yourself a beautiful, and impressively clean gummy syrup, ready for casting. And\nto make the next steps as easy as possible, I\u2019m collecting the magical syrup, in a condiment\ncontainer. These kinds of containers are perfect for\nfilling up your molds. They\u2019re super easy to control, and you can squirt the syrup exactly\nwhere you need it, which helps avoid spilling, or overflowing the molds with too much gummy. I gave these candies a few hours to cool,\nso you can see just how much of a difference it makes, to take the extra step and skim\nthe bubbles off the top, before making your candies. Alright, let\u2019s see how our gummy mix does\nwith a much more intricate, and detailed ice cube mold, like this one. And you might have\nnoticed that this time, the syrup, is impressively clear. 5 hours later, we\u2019ve got ourselves a batch\nof really cool, LEGO gummy guys. Which apparently, are balanced enough, that they can stand up\non their own. That\u2019s kind of cool. Now just for fun, I made a silicone mold from\nactual LEGO bricks, and a 2 part silicone mix from a special effects supply store.. Now you should know that when the syrup cools\ndown, it\u2019s going to shrink a little. So to compensate for that, try filling the molds\njust a tiny bit higher than the top. For one finishing touch, I got a clean LEGO\nbaseplate, and brushed it lightly with vegetable oil, then carefully placed it down on top\nof the mold. You can see the edges have little dimples, to help keep all the studs perfectly\naligned. So all it needs now is something like a heavy book to give it some weight,\nand hold it in place. I let these ones cool on the counter for around\n6 hours, and you can see that if we carefully remove the baseplate now, our little LEGO\ngummies, have small divots on the bottom, which means they\u2019re connectable. Let\u2019s take one of the bricks out out of\nthe mold, and take a good look up close. You can see there\u2019s a surprising amount of detail\ncaptured in the gummy snack, and they\u2019re not sticky at all, but actually quite firm,\nand they smell delicious. You probably also noticed they\u2019re completely\ntransparent, which puts their level of awesomeness on a completely different scale. Alright let\u2019s take this idea to the next\nlevel with different colors and different flavors. I tripled the recipes and made 7 different\nbatches. Then let them cool overnight so they\u2019d all be crystal clear. Now if you try doing\nthis yourself, you might find that getting them out of the cups is pretty tricky. When you do get them out though, you\u2019ll\nhave a gob of gummy, that way too big to eat on it\u2019s own. But that\u2019s ok because what\nwe\u2019re really after here is the white layer of gummy foam at the top. Now if you\u2019re really careful, you can use\nsomething like a kitchen knife to slowly trim the top layer off, which will leave you with\na huge chunk of gummy goodness. And these transparent gummy blocks can be re-melted\non medium-low heat, and molded into any shape you want. I made a candy mountain, of LEGO gummy bricks,\nin all kinds of colors, shapes and sizes. And if you look closely, you can even see\nsome little gummy guys in there as well. In keeping with the LEGO theme, I went back\nto the store and picked up a bunch of containers, just so I could have a unique place, to store\nmy custom candies. Now you could keep all your LEGO gummies separate,\nbut I ended up mixing all mine together and filling the containers with all kinds of random\npieces. How awesome is that? The best part is, if you snap on the lid and\nkeep them in the fridge, they can stay good for up to a month. Now since the gummies are interlocking, you\nmight be wondering if you can build things with them as well. The answer is yes, as long\nas you can resist the temptation to snack on them first. For one last experiment, try finding a handful\nof chewable vitamin C tablets, and powderize them in a blender for about 30 seconds. I\nused 8 tablets, or 4,000 mg for this batch, and when you mix the powder into the gummy\nsyrup, you\u2019ve just made your candies, vitamin C enriched. Of course these are a slightly\nhealthier version, but more importantly, it gives them a slightly sour taste, making them\neven more delicious, and extremely addictive. Well now you know how to use a few simple\ningredients to make a bucketful, of colorful LEGO gummies. That are stackable, snack-able,\nand fun to share. By the way, you don\u2019t have to make your\ngummies into LEGOs. You can actually make any thing you can think of. I converted some\nof my left over syrup, into an assortment of AA, AAA, and D cell batteries. Well that\u2019s it for now. If you like this\nproject, perhaps you\u2019ll like some of my others.

San Jose and if you are watching us live right now go ahead and put your name in the comments say hello I'm moderating at the same time and I would love to give you a greeting back and just see what scientists are out there so this week we have been doing a whole bunch of different activities and reading books that have to do with water so of course we're going to go ahead and bring that into science as well and I thought you know this is a great time to do the monster bear experiment and to talk about osmosis because that has to do with water so no reason to be scared we say monster bear because of perhaps how this experiment is going to turn out but no Bears will be harmed in this experiment so let's go ahead and talk about our different materials that we're gonna need then we'll go ahead and set up do our experiment we'll come back and we'll talk about how the experiment went and what osmosis is and what that has to do with what we're doing okay so you see laid out here all the different things that we're going to need for this experiment except for one thing I'll tell you that in just a second so going through these really quickly you're going to need some salt it doesn't really matter what kind I have some iodine salt but you really don't need that so just regular table salt works fine you're going to need some water so I have my spigot here you'll also need some sugar just regular sugar that you cook with three different containers and I have glass ones so if you've got glasses I've got ramekins just something smaller make sure that these are ones that can be put in the microwave safely so nothing metal you will also need a tablespoon we're going to do a little bit of measurement today going to need just a regular spoon and this is for stirring and then last but certainly not least I shouldn't say last second to last you're going to need some gummy bears now I got ones that are all the same color that way we can see maybe what changes throughout this experiment so just like some other experiments we've done one of the hardest parts of this one is not to eat your experiment so these are for experiments not for eating and then the one thing that you don't actually see here which is behind the camera is a microwave so you're going to need one of those as well alright so now that we have all of our materials including the one that's going in the camera looks good and set up our experiment so I got kind of a jumpstart on this experiment I went ahead and filled my lil ramekins with about a cup of water so you can see that there is kind of up to the line and I filled all three of them with the same amount of water so that's how we're going to start and then two of these were actually going to change so one is going to stay just water and then these other two we're going to change with the salt and the sugar so let's go ahead and get to that part of the experiment and then we will do our experiment hope you're feeling brave there bears let's go [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you [Music] all right my fellow scientists we have saved our bears from all the different polls that they had been swimming in all evening and I kept their labels so we know what exactly they were all swimming in at the time you'll also notice that I left an original bear so we know what they look like before the experiment so osmosis let's talk about that what is that well that is when you have something like water move from one material through what's called a membrane to another area or material so let's think about this you could have an area that's got a lot of stuff in it then you have that membrane or like a door that you would walk through then the other side maybe doesn't have a whole lot of stuff in there well when that door is open those two sides want to even each other out so they're gonna come together and they're gonna mix until they have something that's closer to if not even on both sides well that's what happened to the bear that's water that has been moving through that membrane or that door so for example we have the bear that was in water well I said that was water moving right we noticed we actually dropped the bear in the water and then we went ahead and watched it grow watched it absorb water well why did it absorb water why did osmosis happen there well inside the bear there is a little bit of water but there's a lot of sugar and there's gelatin well the water when it comes in contact with that bear it wants to get into that bear because there's not a whole lot of water there again what's even itself out so the bear starts to expand as I start soaking up that water just like a sponge would now this is after you know a few hours think about what would happen if we left it in there for days wouldn't even still be there would it get to a certain size and then start breaking up maybe something you want to try at home okay so what about sugar water because I said there's sugar in bear but I also just said there's sugar in the water well there's more sugar in the bear so the water is still gonna want to go into that bear and so you're gonna get that bear get a little bit bigger what about the salt because there's no sugar in there well salt is actually smaller than sugar so when we dissolve that salt we actually had more salt in the water then there was sugar in the batter so again the waters gonna think there's more room outside and it's gonna start leaving the bear on the salt side so other ways you can see house Moses happening you've ever been in a pool for way too long when it was your fingers it kind of puffy and wrinkly right that's osmosis the waters evening things out you're actually absorbing that water crazy right or if you have dried fruit you then put it into a glass of water what he thinks gonna happen that fruit is going to absorb and osmosis is going to happen so it's going to get bigger water she's gonna enter into that piece of fruit you could also try this with dry vegetables if you have them so that is how osmosis could work with bears so again I hope you enjoyed this will go ahead and put a hashtag down below if you want to show us your bears if you use other gummy animals or if you use different liquids you could try that as well and see which way things travel always interesting

gummy bears I got gummy bears you want CBD I got CBD you want CBD gummy bears I got CBD gummy bears what's up guys at your boy big J coming back at you again today from big Co TV where you watch decide in vain and today as promised I've got gummy bears all right but I've got gummy bears with CBD in them alright and they are amazing I've been using these two weeks ish I mean I've been using CBD on and off for quite a while alright and it actually works wonders for me for a lot of different things but we'll go into that in a minute these things they taste good they work well and it's an easy form for you to take your CBD that's what that's all I can say if you haven't tried CBD you truly need to try alright it's not a gimmick it's not you know you see all these wonder drugs if you're one of those people like me that don't like to go to the doctor you don't like to take the prescription stuff you're not a big fan of over-the-counter of this over-the-counter that and you just want something natural to help ease what you got going on try these alright just trust me and try these so without further ado let's go ahead and check out the bottle alright so here you go we've got the Big Daddy pack of CBD FX gummy bears as you can see CBD FX help gummy bears the 60 count oh yeah the Big Daddy does contain full spectrum CBD they are gluten-free non-gmo and vegan all right which is cool you got a you know there's a lot of vegan folks out there these days a lot of people that can't do Blut inand all that stuff you can still have these alright you can still have these that's cool trust me it's cool ingredients organic cane sugar organic tapioca syrup water organic seaweed extract natural flavors and colors organically grown CBD rich hemp oil gummy bears contain no corn syrup no animal gelatin no artificial sweeteners which leads to guilt-free indulging never tasted better very true these are delicious the statements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose treat or cure any disease always consult with your physician before use underage sale prohibited that's what I was talking about earlier the FDA hasn't said you know the FDA of course being the FDA says that you can't make claims you can't do this you can't do that about CBD because they haven't studied it so all I'm going to tell you about is my own personal experiences with these but we'll get to that again cannabidiol CBD is CBD FX is naturally occurring in the industrial hemp plant and legally imported and produced very important it is legally imported and produced CBD FX does not sell or distribute any products that are in violation of the u.s. Controlled Substances Act the USCS a hashtag feel the difference will roll around a little more supplement facts a serving size is two gummy bears so basically there are 30 servings in here 16 calories per serving so that's 16 calories for two gummy bears no fat 3.6 grams of carbs 2 grams of sugar 20 milligrams okay of hemp per serving and 10 milligrams of CBD per sir roll it around again and bang we're back to the front now for my favorite part I'm gonna go over some facts and eat a couple of these alright guys so as promised here it is got my facts sheet now just so I can make sure I'm telling you the right stuff so on the bottle you saw the CBD is legal that is used inside this product you may have looked and went well why is CBD legal you know I've heard the CBD isn't legal done it up let me go over that okay our products are exempt okay meaning CBD FX's products are exempt from the CSA and DEA s drug scheduling practices which classify whole half extracts as schedule one drugs because extracts from the stocks of European grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice and that is where the hemp is grown that these guys use to extract the CBD it is grown the biomass is over in Europe their product does meet the standards of the 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp which means it has to contain less than 0.3% of THC in the gamete or in the product period in the CBD oil period and again they only use CBD that is derived from a European biomass so that's how it's legal it is also non psychoactive and non psychoactive hemp was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 so there are your working facts now let me tell you a couple other things that are also some facts these things are freakin delicious alright the red they're my favorite color alright they taste like a fruit punch slash cherry I mean they're delicious so pop the cap you're gonna have a little safety seal I just normally yeah I just shut my thumb through here they gave me a couple bottles of these but I figured to show you your fresh bottle so pop it open and really they are little gummy bears I mean they look just like gummy bears and they basically tastes just like gummy bears except with a little pop so there you go it really is just a little gummy but I mean you know what I love these things so now that the FDA which you can and what you can't say let me roll that around so you get a nice glamour shot there since the FDA has determined what you can and can't say I'm just gonna tell you some personal experiences for me again I've been using CBD on and off three years what it does for me and in particular the CBD F FX products what they have done for me I used to be the guy that goes to bed let's say 10 o'clock at midnight I'm still up why cuz my brain won't stop okay it won't turn off I'm just going going going going going sit there flip through social media think about work think about this think about that couldn't shut my mind off I popped two of these half hour hour before bed I'm out and when I'm out I mean I am out don't wake up in the middle of the night no tossing no turning just everything just shuts down that's nice alright that's what I use it for also I work in a warehouse during the day yes that's right I am NOT the YouTube famous you know YouTube superstar I have a day job um and a work at a warehouse I do a lot of walking around you know up ladders down ladders all kinds crap I come home I am sore alright pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away okay after a workout at the gym pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away I mean it's not it's not a super drug but it takes the edge off for me okay other people you know say they use it for anxiety and stuff like that I don't really know if I have anxiety but I will say when I do take them it puts me in a just a nice mellow mood but it's not anything that you that you aren't functional you know I mean I could eat these in the morning before I go to work put in eight hours all day and still be totally fine doesn't make me drowsy even though it does help me fall asleep but the reason that helps me fall asleep like I says it just helps me turn my mind off so that being said I highly suggest you try something like I said if you're like me you don't like all the over-the-counter crap you think a lot of stuff that the doctors give is just you know blah blah mumbo-jumbo because they want you know Big Pharma wants to show some pills down your throat try these all right just try them what's the worst that's gonna happen it doesn't work for you okay sorry you know but I'm telling you most of the people that I talk to they've tried this it works for once you find out how many you actually need okay just because it says take two too might not work for you you might need four you might need six okay try it don't just write it off if it doesn't work the first time okay trust me just give me a favor and trust me on that it does work it really does I wouldn't I wouldn't I'm not the snake oil salesman all right so I'm just gonna be done trying to convince you hopefully you take my word for it and try some if you do want to try something check the description below you're gonna find a link directly to the big co website takes drinkler to the product buy it okay put it in your cart send it to

school today then I was Isabel Rosales is there right now with the brand new developments Isabelle ball we just found out from the sheriff that it was a twelve year old student who brought that THC lace gummy into the school and now that student is facing very serious charges now THC is the chemical found in marijuana that gets you high and that gummy it was supposed to have been broken apart into 10 pieces multiple students took the gummies five of them were taken to the hospital another student was picked up by a parent sheriff Grady Judd says the twelve-year-old who were not naming because he's a minor brought the Edible into his gym class and that's where the children eat it then they started showing signs of nausea stomachaches dizziness and one of them even nearly passed out so staff called 911 those five kids were taken to a hospital that child who brought the kumkum II is now facing seven felony charges and one misdemeanor and deputies are working to figure out how

welcome back to operating sec this is a special video collaboration with Julie from a beautiful horizons we will be releasing videos for some healthy Easter treats for kids make sure you check out Julie's channel if you like this video make sure you hit the like button and subscribe to my channel that's first thing I want you guys to know about this recipe video is that it's extremely simple your kids can help and you're going to want them to help and it doesn't use crazy fancy ingredients you can kind of make it your own and try all kinds of different flavor combinations the only special thing that you guys are gonna need are these silicone molds and I will put a link down below they are the cutest little things adorable in this pack that I got off of Amazon there are three different colors and it comes with three droppers which make filling molds so easy so you guys I hope that you try out this recipe video and make sure you let me know and give me some feedback how you liked it let me show you guys what you're gonna need in order to make these super cute delicious nutritious gummy bears let's go ahead and get started for the first recipe we're going to be making a citrus blast flavor and for that you're going to need two karekare or large oranges and then you'll need a citrus juicer if you guys want to skip this part and just buy some store-bought orange juice it's okay I'm not judging and since I didn't have any lemons on hand we will be using bottled pure lemon juice and this is organic also need some unflavored gelatin you guys can get this at natural food stores or I can put a link down below where you can find it off of Amazon - this is grass-fed gelatin I just have it transferred into a mason jar here on a technical note pineapple cannot be used in these gummy bears the pineapple will not actually set up with the gelatin and for our sour grape recipe you're going to need some grape juice and some lemon juice and then for our last recipe you will need some home brewed kombucha we have a berry flavor and but not least you guys want to make these into sour gummy bears you're just gonna need some vitamin C powder we got this from Amazon and I will put the knife down for that below as well and we're gonna toss those gummy bears and this vitamin C powder and they're so sour and fun okay let's get rolling [Music] in a saucepan I'm just putting one cup of juice 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and then I am slowly whisking in the gelatin at a medium-high heat until the gelatin is all dissolved if you dump it in really fast you're gonna have globs of jello so you want to take it kind of nice and slow and whisk it right in and now using the dropper that came with the molds you're just going to fill up those molds one by one and this is the part where you're kids helping you comes in really handy because it's not difficult at all but it does take a little bit of time so having someone to do that alongside you it's just a really great thing for about 15 minutes okay so I just got these out of the freezer and I think they are ready this is kind of fun if you guys like popping you know those packing bubbles I think that you'll really like doing this too [Music] so I have all three flavors made up and these are ready for vitamin C so I'm just gonna put about a half a teaspoon in with a ziplock baggie and then shake it around it's super simple and it makes some really tasty and fun and sour likes like a healthy version of Sour Patch Kids so just you wanna shake that around zip it up give it a shake me shake you need help with the zipper what oh good job fine to 300 [Music] not really good mmm the orange one is so good why is that tastes like pink yours is candy that I used to eat some this is like bringing you back to my childhood what is that mmm wanna taste one of the kombucha no that's pretty good too let's do this sour grape also delicious and sour I hope that you guys really enjoyed today's video as always you

have a really great Easter bye bye i likey you", "B7WXjXs8L7U": "oh hey everybody we have another fun activity today what are we doing gummy candy that's right the giant gummy candy maker and what kind of stuff can we make we here make gummy bears gummy worms and gummy fish that is pretty cool so you guys have probably seen our gummy candy videos Evan did the giant gummy worm and Jillian ate a giant gummy bear how was that decoy you didn't even need any of it yeah she didn't really eat that whole thing I think that's kind of impossible especially for a four-year-old yeah you're for now you're 7 you might be able to eat an ear or something like that so now we are gonna make our own gummies look at all the cool things you can make you can make worms different color fish gummy bears and the giant gummy bear I don't think the giant gummy bears as big as the one that we showed in our other video but probably eat it it's pretty big okay guys so we're gonna get this open and show you guys what's inside so here's everything you get in the box what do we have over there gummy bear that looks like it's gonna be pretty big we also have some little heating containers where we're going to mix our gelatin over here we have our molds it kind of looks like Simon swipe their molds right here we have some gummy worms and the fish mold and over here we have our little ice tray that we have to fill up with ice and right here we have our heating bowl and you have to plug that in and Jillian's gonna get that ready and of course we have our instructions yeah you should always follow the instructions that are listed don't make up your own recipes unless you want a mess so there's a bunch of different gummies you can make you can make a sour gummy vitamins gummies or even energy gummies using an energy drink like redbull but I think we're just gonna make regular gummi bears today and we're gonna try something different too we have these molds and we also have our marble ice cube molds that we got in our loot crate box and we're gonna try and make some Marvel gummies - mmm so we have two of these heating trays because while you're pouring one thing of gelatin you can also be mixing up the second flavor right here or if you lose one but we're not losing these right so before we use any of this stuff we need to give it a good washing okay so the first thing we have to do is we have to assemble this Gillian's putting the tray together so it doesn't fall apart that would not be good okay did it before we put the molds on top we need ice to put into it because that's gonna act as our cooling agent and it's gonna cool whatever is on top let's press the tray with some ice okay so we filled up our tray with ice and now Evans going to put the molds on michey mob and you want to make sure you put enough ice but you also want the molds to lay flat because you are going to be pouring the gelatin into the molds and if it's slanted it might run out we're gonna put our little cauldron with the metal bottom because metal is a conductor and now we get to mix our ingredients so what do we need so we have a bunch of jell-o gelatin we actually need three ounces to make one batch we have mango here unflavored gelatin yes and you also need some unflavored gelatin you need four ounces and they come in this little package there's four envelopes that are one ounce each so you need to mix 4 ounces of unflavored gelatin with three ounces of flavored gelatin how much water do we have to put in the water half a cup of water okay put it in look at that nice and warm now this pot is hot so be careful so any goes the unflavored gelatin and now it's time for the flavored stuff I have to take a snip jefes always smell so good thank you now for the flavored gelatin it all looks the same stir it a little bit and then I'll let you stir them okay I've been stirring up the mixture in our gummy cauldron I smell gummy we don't want a lumpy gummy so we better stir this pretty good it says stir until mixture is runny get rid of that I've got some clumps in there you each like mommy's gravy hey now I always do it wouldn't be fun if it wasn't messy yeah Gillian's finishing up on the stirring so it has a little spout here to make it four easy pour now let's see if I could do it without spilling it'll be a miracle if I can there's a job on my table maybe I can't see what I'm doing oh we got a Siamese fish going on connect it up ahead doesn't matter yeah matters oh maybe we should let the kids board yes even decorated the bowl look at that it's not any different than my muffins I just clean up after all right so we got a mess going on here let me see if I can do this one okay I'm gonna fill up some of these oh sure take the big fat shape that's easy I had a choice to need that this stuff is pretty thick not just me but you made it okay so this is a little messy oh well you must be having a lot of fun then okay I think that's good for that one all right so I got our marble is cubed molds these might be a little better because they are bigger we've got orange so let's let's do the thing okay so I'm going to do these two and so Gillian's filling up the ice cubes and what we should be doing is making our second batch with our extra one which one you want a blue one okay blueberry on these boxes of jell-o they're actually six ounces so we need to cut that in half in order to get the three ounces that we need I'm gonna pour in the unflavored Wow Wow four at a time look at that that is called skilled Jillian's gonna put in two three ounces of blueberry and let's stir that sucker up time for mommy to that makes more messes good just don't aim well it's a little bit better in texture okay so this is a pretty messy but I'm gonna use the spoon this time and it might work a little better gotta get the little ear we've got a big mess going on here these worms working a little tail there to get that just gonna give them some blue paws we're mixing up our third badge with a resist there goes there's green Joe is stirring up the green stuff oh okay so something's going on with our mixture here it's pretty thick it's not really flowing into the mold smoothly so maybe we're not heating this up enough I let it sit here in the pot and it is getting more runny so I think we were taking it out before it really got high we're gonna have some clumpy bears and some clumpy fish okay let's see if this pours any better this time oh it's actually going in now oh no it's much better we'll make a green gummy face so when you mix colors you have to make sure that the previous color has already solidified otherwise when you mix the next color it's just gonna mix all together become a big dark mess so we have our green face and our blue paws this is too thick right now not quite there yet okay let's fill it an Ironman face this Iron Man doesn't have enough so I'm gonna add some red to it see how it looks so we got some bloody worms we got some chunky bears so these things are cooling now we filled all the molds this is our first try Wow it's kind of a failure but we're gonna see what comes out of this and see if they're edible these bears are not gonna have ears sorry they're mommy's trying to get his ear mommy's goal there perfect but he's gonna have one ready yeah all right so Evans going to karate you see you later buddy it's our bear and I'm gonna fill the rest of it with the rest of this read that we have make a red body it's going over the head too I guess the ears are gonna be red of a nice layer of red okay so I just poured in some yellow into our bear and now he's got several layers so Jillian's removing all the molds from our little ice tray the ice is still down there so they just come out and since the mold is nice and flexible they should just pop out everything's gonna be connected to each other yeah I think so we kind of overfilled them a years he's a ball bear that's got a violet and here are our conjoined bears this one has monkey hair no one's lumpy bear let's see the worms oh look at that it's a worm in slime Oh Julian killed it she dissected the worm mums got the good Bears pretty good eye man oh please I made these you made those you might do I didn't make the green we have some good ones over here the ones I made I'll show you what I made I made these guys Marvel well these ones are gonna be thick they were not meant to be candy they're meant to be ice this woman is look at that whole face that is the thing then we have fist we have an orange Iron Man and we have a red Iron Man and we have a couple shields so the thing we learned is you have to make sure your gelatin mixture is melted all the way before you pour it in and when you do pour it in you have to be very careful not to pour too much quality beer but I do actually like these bloody bears okay Joey is gonna try the worm what are your thoughts you did or where it is okay but the texture is a little weird all right I'm gonna try the red because that one we actually did right there's not enough flavor it's not as sweet as a gummy bear okay so we finished tasting these we're gonna wait for Evan to come home he'll try one of these and we're just gonna finish our giant bear from karate I was karate it was good he worked up an appetite for gummies I guess no would you recommend that he eats these Joe yeah he's gonna eat the bloody gummy bear know what it's like now is it no guys took my Javanese tastes more like jello than the gummy I would have to agree with that I think it doesn't have quite as much sugar okay but he likes it apparently because he just took another one so you got the big thick Iron Man head and instead of putting up I was gonna say instead of putting that whole thing in your mouth take a little bite but it looks like a Lego brick what are you eating you took it apart but before we go we have to go see how our giant gummy bear is doing the exact number okay so here's the giant gummy bear let's bring it over to the table we had it in the fridge to harden a little bit well bring it over to our messy candy workshop over here this thing has a bunch of different colors hopefully hopefully it comes out of here like it is nice smiling green face oh I just smashed the word Wow see let's press his face let's go bear CPR okay it's coming out I got the leg Oh it's a bear that they had I see the head coming there it is he's got a green round face but it actually says bear here on this chest in case you didn't know stay away from my gummies bear it looks messy but it actually comes off like Jillian's gonna try the bear out let's go take a big bite of the ear just like you did with that other one there it is oh it's bringing back memories ah let's see it we've got what is that lime cherry lemon orange and more cherry and some blueberry feet so why don't you bite the foot try that blueberry foot and you can even just pull his hand off like this and you can eat his hand look at that daddy - perfect gummy worm I could sell this on eBay so I think we're done with this gummy stuff we're gonna save this maybe we'll try this again later maybe I'll put some hot peppers in here do some surprise gummies yeah surprise gummy challenge okay guys so that was the Greek giant gummy candy maker it was a little bit messy if you guys want to make your own gummies you can get this candy maker or you can just buy gelatin and make jello thanks for watching and we'll see you guys next time", "GAp0OB_ZI6c": "you marijuana is generally a misdemeanor offense however it can be elevated into a felony in a number of ways and one way is when you take the actual substance in marijuana which is THC and that is extracted in some way and used to create something else than that all this sudden becomes a felony offense it's the substance that THC is considered a penalty group to substance which is a felony and we see this most often in cases involving edibles you take gummy bears for example that seem to be popular especially you can buy them in Colorado and other states and a package of gummy bears may actually contain a very small amount of THC but it is a felony offense or even a couple of them so be aware that what is normally a misdemeanor offense that you may think it's not all that serious when it's turned into something else when it's turned into an edible or something else you can consume then you're looking at a felony offense and your misdemeanor marijuana possession all of a sudden becomes a felony that you're in district court for and facing serious criminal consequences", "92nuXrb59_4": "[Music] we're back again joey we got some gummies here from albanez we were at the show they had their big booth there and we got some samples so thanks

"CE_u3Q1yGs8": "[Music] hey guys so it's Kate and I'm back in the kitchen today and I am making sure free gummies so I've been seeing these all over Instagram and YouTube so I want it to make them and see how they turned out so of course I turn to Amazon to get some silicone molds I ordered bears and then I ordered snakes because I know Hannah like snakes and I like bears so it's a perfect job all right so ingredient-wise let me show you what you're going to need you're gonna need sugar-free jell-o you get the Walmart brand or Target brand whatever brand you want I just happen to have the jello brand and then you're gonna want some plain unflavored jello or gelatin actually and this is the Knox brand I got this at Walmart you're gonna need one packet of the unflavored jello for every box of jell-o you use and I forgot to say this is the point three zero ounce box the four cups the dogs are wound up so we're going to deal with it and then for each box of pudding and unflavored you're gonna need a third of so I'm gonna get this started over here I'm doing two boxes today just because I'm not sure how much I won't have to fill up my mold so you're gonna want to get a little saucepan out and put on your stove and put it on medium heat and then you're gonna add your two packets of your flavored jello and your two packets of unflavored gelatin [Music] and then I'm adding 2/3 cup of water here 1/3 of cup for each package of jello and then you're going to let this warm up and you're going to want to stir everything in here until it is dissolved [Music] okay so it looks like all my jello and gelatin has dissolved in here and I don't really want to bring it up to a boil because you know when it starts boiling jello starts to get frothy and I don't want it to be frothy for when I put it into the molds so I'm gonna pull this off the stove and then we'll get filling our mold up okay so I recruited some help here Hannah's gonna fill the snakes I'm gonna fill the Bears up and we're gonna see how this goes [Music] hi guys so we finished up filling our molds I got like one and a little over a half of a gummy bear mold and hand I got maybe a little over a half of the gummy worm mold filled up so we definitely need more jello or fill our two molds up but that's okay I have the Mod baking sheets which I place the molds on before we start filling them up so it would be easy to put them in the fridge since Silicon trees are pretty floppy so we are gonna go stick these out in the fridge and check on them in a couple hours all right guys probably about an hour to oh I kind of lost track of time I've been longer that has gone by and our jello gummies have set up so I'm gonna get ready to pop them out of try here all right so all right just flip it over and pop them

vodka probably should have been hotter but I'm not taking the chance like I'm taking the chance chumps ain't going away it's a good thing the bottom of this pot is scraped off a little bit because I could see the chunks better in those areas see that sweat chunk that you can't see them over there though use an old pack when you're making this JV tip they look good it does a little steam alright

something a little different a bit of an educational video if you will now hope you guys enjoyed this one drop a like if you do and without further ado let's dive right into it so first and foremost i want to clarify why this video is being made right i get a lot of people coming into my twitter dms or my instagram dm's and they send me pictures of edibles they get and they're these like nerds robes or these gummies or all of these different things and you know up until recently i didn't have as much knowledge on the topic i guess you could say as i did now right like i never really bothered to actually learn much or educate myself because i kind of stopped buying edibles for a while but as i got back into edibles you know i kind of started learning more about what the current street edibles are like and listen alright ladies and gentlemen there's a trend going on that when i mentioned it on stream the other day the vast majority of people in chat not the vast majority but a fair bit of people were like what are you talking about like oh i didn't know that and today we're going to address that right i'm going to give you guys some tips on how to spot a fake edible what a fake edible even necessarily is but first and foremost right i think it's important to note that there's really only two cases where you should even be buying edibles right a go to a dispensary dispensaries have great edibles that are made in ways that a lot of street edibles just can't be made because it requires equipment that is so expensive no dude in his garage is going to have it 99 of the time right or b buy it off a friend of yours who makes it right if you are buying a street edible and it advertises a milligram amount 99 of the time that is wildly inaccurate nothing close to the real dosage right but we'll get to that part later because the real thing i want to push here is like folks make your own edibles okay before i get dive into how to really spot these edibles it's so simple to literally just get together with your homies smoke some weed and cook edibles it's some of the most fun i've ever had in terms of anything weed related making edibles is a blast dude if you've never done it before it's literally it's so easy dude brownies are the easiest thing to make give it a go okay but now let's get into the the real beef of this video okay so first and foremost there's something i want to highlight right not all edibles are made the same way right there's some edibles that are sold on the street you know specifically if you're buying a pre-packaged edible if you buy nerds ropes i guarantee this is probably what you're getting 99 of the time right i know these are a huge trend right now everyone's eating these [ __ ] nerds ropes dude there's probably a few of you guys smacking that [ __ ] right now while you're watching this video okay listen i'm on to you okay i'm on your ass now all right listen so there's different ways that edibles are made edibles of course can be cooked and that's more common when you've got like a brownie or a cookie you know they take an oil or a can of butter and they actually cook something but there's a new and kind of i wouldn't say new but a what's becoming more common trend which is spraying right and a lot of people when i mentioned this on stream the other day this is the whole reason i'm making this video a lot of people didn't know this exists what people will do is they will take distillate and just spray it on the edibles you take a [ __ ] piece of wax paper and you lay it out on a table right and you take nerds ropes obviously are such an ideal candidate for this because you could just put them so tightly together and just spray them down and waste no distillate right so you take this wax paper and you lay these [ __ ] edibles out you lay some let's say you go buy some candy you know you go buy some cheap wholesale candy you lay it out and you just spray the [ __ ] out of it it's so much quicker than actually cooking and think about it for a minute do you really think your plug knows some guy who is handcrafting some [ __ ] nerds ropes one by one in his garage or has like a nerd's rope machine listen there's machines that do a lot of things but there's no machine making nerds ropes and there's also no guy dumb enough to hand roll a bunch of nerds ropes when he knows he could just buy them and spray them and sell them for a shitload of money right you have to understand that this is a very common trend in the comment section i'm actually going to link an article that talks about this right there's a couple articles i found i'm gonna link you guys can actually read some stuff hey you don't gotta believe me that's fine i'm not always the most trustworthy source hey but these articles are okay these will tell you some facts right but moving on from the whole sprayed part there's a couple prop well not moving on but there's a couple problems with it a you don't know what the [ __ ] the dosage is right you have no idea what these people are putting on you can't dose it they're not actually cooking it the spray is uneven but that's really the least of the concerns of the sprayed edible because you have to look more at the fact of like what are they actually spraying onto this product right when something is cooked like you know let's say let's say someone takes an oil or like a can of butter and they make a brownie or a cookie or something like that with it typically you're you're more going to be questioning the strength of it you're not going to be concerned about a synthetic or something fake in it but when you spray an edible you are opening up the door for synthetics to be sprayed on it and this is becoming a more common thing people don't realize that not all edibles even have thc in them sometimes you can get an edible that is just sprayed with synthetic [ __ ] right k2 for example they spray that right that's not like an actual plant they spray some plant matter and you smoke that [ __ ] right they can do the same thing with edibles if they really [ __ ] want to right they can spray it with some synthetic chemical [ __ ] that you don't know what it does to you you don't know where it's from and there's a million different chemicals that they can choose to spray on these edibles and that's why you have to have due diligence when you're buying and you have to look at what you're purchasing and honestly in my opinion the brownie in a ziploc bag is a hundred times safer than your prepackaged nerds rope or sour patch kid is ever going to be okay because like nobody like sure there might be exceptions i know there's of course gonna be that one guy in the comment section he's like well goblin you know i actually have a sour patch kids nerds rope factory in the shed in my backyard and i have over 15 employees churning out nine different machines of nerd ropes you know what good for you you're the one in a million all right but the rest of the people watching this video they aren't in that scenario they're buying it from some guy who is spraying some hoopla right they're buying it from some guy and they're not buying it directly from that guy either it's passed through a hands on hand so you're getting marked up sprayed [ __ ] you're not you're not even getting a good deal on this you have to realize your plug like if you hit up your plug and you asked to buy like a hundred of these edibles in bulk i guarantee you're gonna get some ridiculous price that makes you realize wait a minute how does that even work and i'll tell you how it's probably sprayed specifically if [ __ ] are selling these little nerds ropes or whatever man are these other candies that are on you know trending nowadays you know you go on tick tock and you see these people claiming they they make these edibles you know oh look at these candies brother just spray that [ __ ] dude 99 of the time they don't actually cook something into it but even when they do cook something into it here's the next concern the next concern is that there's no actual viable way of really testing a street edible right you you can't really know you know nobody's taking dispensary weed where they know the exact percentage and cooking it in edibles they're taking street weed that's never been tested and cooking it into an edible that that that's then also never been tested so they really don't know what the dosage is in these you know they could tell you how much they put into it and you can maybe ballpark it but when you get something that is packaged and your plug says yeah it's exactly this dosage don't believe them right if you've got a plug it just tells you yeah these [ __ ] are strong eat half that's honestly probably more reliable going to be a better product than the guy who's trying to sell you some thc milligram that he doesn't actually know exists right so always should have your due diligence and once again this should just be a an advertisement to cook with your homies dude go make some edibles hey go hop in your group chat right now all you need is literally like like a half ounce an ounce and you can make a small little batch of edibles bro that's all you need you and the homies will have a good [ __ ] time you know what i'm saying listen and you don't even need good kush you can get mids bro you don't even need good [ __ ] but hey that's for another video all right another thing that's very important to talk about specifically i see this on some of these right this is a small little disclaimer that we're going to talk about here is i see some edibles advertise activation time and that then and there should tell you to run if if there's ever a packaging on an edible you purchase that says oh man you'll be stoned in 60 minutes oh dude man activates in 45 minutes dude everyone like it's your digestion dude like everyone digests products differently the only way you could advertise that is if you're spraying it with some boo-boo [ __ ] that does actually activate that quick but if it's actually cooked into the product and you have to digest it right that's a whole different story right that's a whole different story and obviously you can't advertise activation time like that so just what i'm trying to say here in this video guys is is really think before you purchase an edible and it's really sad that the street market has become this way you know when i was young and i first started smoking it was just you'd buy some mids and you buy some mid wax and edibles was something you made with your friends out of one of those two things nobody really sold them unless it was your homie with a tray of brownies who was selling them right pre-packaged edibles were unheard of around me right now that's like the norm everyone's selling this crazy carts [ __ ] fake edible [ __ ] it's crazy man and that's why that's why i make some of these kind of informational videos just spread the word about it dude hey man listen if you're a plug out there selling these shits dude you're guilty okay you should feel terrible about yourself but either way hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did hope you guys learned something let me know in the comments if you did thank you guys for tuning in i will see you guys next time peace and

what's up guys it's your boy big J coming back at you again from Vaco TV where you watch decide and vape and as said earlier I've got some gummy bears today but they have the extra added benefit of having some CBD you know alright these things are pretty good I've gotten I just because I got this right here doesn't mean I didn't get extras in it doesn't mean I haven't been eating these things are the bomb let me tell you but before we get into that let's go ahead and check out the packaging and then we'll go to the fun stuff alright guys so here you got it just a nice bag it almost looks like it's recycled um it's like a waxy paper bag kind of nice uh in here you'll see CBD FX hemp gummy bears you got an 8 count this is just like the little fun size snack pack it does contain full spectrum CBD it is gluten free it is non-gmo and it is vegan oh yeah that's right so for all you've eaten out there you can eat these yes you can let's flip it over and on the back the supplement facts serving size 2 gummy bears servings per container you four so obviously you got to eat to to match what's on the label no fat 16 calories sugar 2 grams not bad not bad at all did we cover carbs nope I don't think we did carbs 3.6 grams whew so there's really no carbs here 20 milligrams a hip extract and 10 milligrams of CBD per gummy bear remember you got to take two ingredients organic cane sugar organic tapioca syrup water organic seaweed extract natural flavors and colors organically grown CBD rich hemp oil gummy bears contain no corn syrup no animal gelatin no artificial sweeteners so that makes them what guilt-free indulging never tasted better that's right and it's true these things are delicious on 19min a lot these statements have not been evaluated by the FDA or not intended to diagnose treat cure any disease they have to say that because the FDA you know doesn't really regulate any of this hasn't really looked into it yadda yadda but trust me trust me Kenna pity all in CBD is naturally occurring in the industrial hemp plant and legally imported and produced that's important I do have a fact sheet over here that I'm going to go over with you to tell you why these are legal these are legal you are allowed to have these product and design our trademark cba dfx does not sell or distribute any products that are a violation of the u.s. control substance act the u.s csa made in the USA alright so now that we covered the packaging let's get into what's actually in these things I do have a fact sheet so allow me to read you some of the facts all right CBD FX premium CBD oil has been meticulously sourced from natural organic hemp plants grown in Europe that's very important that they have been grown in Europe we'll get into that in a minute and then shipped directly to their lab in Southern California the cannabinoid oil offered through CBD FX is always substandard sustainably sourced from the highest quality plants which ensures that you reap the benefits of all the cannabinoids terpenes and amino acids fatty acids and vitamins & merrill's it's got all of that stuff in here guys we're proud to offer our customers the most traceable organic CBD oil for sale anywhere cool so they can trace ok so you get this bag in particular they can trace this back back to the plant that it came from which is nice so why is it legal alright it is non psychoactive hemp and it was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 the hemp biomass okay which means the big crop of where the CBD comes from the hemp that is sourced from comes with an import certificate signed off on by Homeland Security and they only use CBD derived from the stalks of European grown hemp plants their products meet the standards of 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp must be industrial hemp and contain less than 0.3 percent THC hmm products are exempt from the CSA and the DEA s drug scheduling practices which classify whole hemp extracts as schedule 1 drugs extracts and here's the important part extracts from the stalks of EU grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice so there you have it now we will put the facts to the side tear this open and try one right guys so here we go that's terrible to try I'm telling you these things are freaking delicious so I do rip off the top there we go they are resealable ok as you can see that the little ziplock and they are pretty sugary too but they do come in my favorite flavor red alright it's kind of like a cherry fruit punchy but yeah uh-huh like I said it's like a cherry fruit punch you get the sugar obviously because they are coated in sugar um but it does take like that earthy taste away that you get in regular CBD don't get me wrong it's still there but it's not bad at all and you know I mean you know it's not bad it's actually quite tasty I've been using these for a couple weeks now the next video I'm going to do on these will be the big the big bottle and I've been eating those at night now when your first pop them in your mouth and chew them up like I said you're gonna get the sugar you're gonna get like that little fruit punch cherry type flavor and then at the very end when you swallow and kind of let everything chill out that's when you're gonna get that little earthy tint of the CBD in there so you know it's in there but it's good by all means trust me it's good it doesn't make you make faces or anything it's good stuff if you want some and again I do suggest you get some do yourself a favor check the description below all right in the description gonna final link to these click the button a couple times put some in your cart put some on your doorstep and you can have some gummy bear enjoyment just like I do um with these I'm not gonna lie there's a whole lot of things that you can say and you can't say about CBD because obviously like we covered the FDA hasn't approved of anything but let me tell you what they do for me what they do for me I'll leave these at night right before bed like a half hour hour before bed somewhere around there I'm out like a light I sleep I mean I'm out I used to be the

warehouse I walk around a lot a lot a lot and with all that walking around you know I got aches and pains these these help with the aches and pains okay um and that's that's personal experience that's just me telling you again the FDA didn't doesn't say that's what it will do what it won't - etc etc I'm just telling you from personal experience so again check the description below you're gonna find

wrappers so they are all 1 inch wide you'll need about 15 wrappers depending on the size of your waist now measure your waist and add 6 inches 26 so I'll meet about 32 inches measure a piece of packing tape that length and lay it sticky side up on the table now tape down each end [Music] now starting at one end place a wrapper in the middle of the tape now place a second wrapper overlapping the first one just slightly continue till you only have room for two more wrappers now place the last two wrappers colorful side down you do this because when you fold the end of the belt over you want the colorful side to shell now cover the whole belt with another piece of tape sticky side down take the piece of tape that was holding it down off the table and trim along the sides [Music] now add another piece of tape around the whole belt [Music] and wrap the edges around the back [Music] now cut off the extra tape on both ends wrap the end you started with through both killings [Music] and secure with tape [Music] now round the other end of your belt to wear the belt put the end through both rings then fold over and go back through only one ring and then pull to tighten [Music] the great thing is the belt is fully adjustable which will come in handy after I eat all this candy or drink it that's right in this next tap you can enjoy your delicious candy haul without even chewing

the best part of my home a full sized bag of gummy bears and since I have so many gummy bears I'll use some to make my yummy gummy slice for this you'll need a wooden spoon cooking oil cornstarch powdered sugar gummy bears a bowl measuring cup and spoons and a microwave first pick out the color of gummy bears you want I'm choosing red you'll need about a cup of one color now microwave this for 15 seconds and then stir until it's smooth [Music] now add two tablespoons of cornstarch and 1 tablespoon of powdered sugar and stir it into the mixture [Music] now put some cornstarch and sugar on your surface so that your slime doesn't stick to it once it's not too sticky to handle you can take it out of the bowl and knead with your hand [Music] gummy and yummy and so fun funny and you can

they're not easy to find so I will put a link to the place that I bought this from and and this cost me I think it was two dollars for one sheet now with a small saucepan just have it on the bench or somewhere put in 1/3 of a cup of water then add one satchel and these satchels vary the satchel I use has about 10 grams which i think is probably just a bit under a quarter of an ounce just slowly sprinkling there now this needs to be unflavored gelatin then you get your flavored gelatin and you want to use roughly 85 grams which is around 3 ounces now for this particular one I've chosen a strawberries and cream gelatin just pour it in slowly now once you've done this just leave this on the counter for roughly 10 minutes and it's about ready to put on the stove now put this on the stove we turn on to medium heat now we'll have this on here for roughly somewhere between 3 and 5 minutes and what we're gonna do is just give it a stir every now and then the idea is once this is dissolved it's ready okay that's ready to go let's do the next stage now just pour it into something that you can pour it out if it's got a little spent and just pull it into each mold leave that on the counter for I don't know five minutes a and then once it's just cooled a little bit and not for us to be able to transport it without it spilling anyway put the end of the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes well they're ready to go now what I like to do is I like to get a teaspoon of plain flour and teaspoon of castor sugar and just mix it together in a little shot glass like this once this has come out of the fridge just sprinkle it sort of over it this will just help the the gummies not to stick together so just do that again spread across it like that so make sure that you do wipe the excess off this because you know what spilling all over the place um well I hope you like my homemade gummy bears got so many yeah let's give them a go oh oh come come Frogger TV hmm I'll see you next time for my next meal [Music]", "z87xwoms6Os": "why are you all here no fingers don't eat me [Music] in today's video we're revisiting one of grant's most popular projects making gummy legos [Music] hey guys today we're here with the whole king of random family hey we're here because we wanted to make one of grant's most popular projects lego gummies so we thought it fitting to include all the kids and we wanted to make an appearance and say hi it's been a year and we wanted to enjoy one of grant's projects and commemorate this time that you guys have spent with us and give you a little insight into where we're at and have a little fun on camera here's the basic idea we're here with the king of random family to make some gummy legos that you can eat and build with okay so should we get pour in some legos guys yeah all right all right so we're gonna be following the recipe grant laid out previously which is made of jello some extra gelatin powder a little bit of water and then you can tinker with the colors with some food coloring if you like but for the most part jello of course has colors uh and one little twist we are gonna try is we're going to see if we can use some tonic water and maybe some b2 vitamin powder to see if we can get gummies that glow in a black light what do you guys think of glowing lego gummy should we try it oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah [Music] so each batch like i said doesn't have very many ingredients we have half a cup of water we'll do one quarter cup of corn syrup a small box of jello it comes in multiple sizes we're going for the three ounce boxes of jello and two packets of the unflavored gelatin one thing that i have learned in making this is that it's actually easier by a long shot to mix the gelatin in if you do it before the corn syrup so instead of watering corn syrup together and then adding the jello and stuff i'm just doing the water then i'll have the two packets of gelatin and the entire box of jello and then we're gonna add our quarter cup of corn syrup into it otherwise you get clumps and lumps and takes a long time to dissolve in just trying to make sure there's no big clumps or even little clumps of the gelatin left it's not going to well if we have clumps in it now then it's not going to evenly dissolve into the water and then we won't have enough gelatin and our jello gummy lego bricks will be like too weak they won't be strong enough to come out of the mold so we want the liquid to be nice and smooth and we want the clumps to dissolve evenly so we get a nice thick jello now when grant was testing this recipe we probably made it five to ten times before we got the perfect recipe so we'd open the gelatin he tried an extra teaspoon of gelatin didn't work then he tried two extra teaspoons of gelatin we got to the point where we found out these packets are perfectly proportionate that two packets was the ideal amount but then he tried three packets to see if that would work those were really gross lego gummies because you could barely not they were like really really like a gummy bear but worse yeah they were really like tough but gummy so they were gross because they were almost hard but they were still gummy so we had a good laugh about that so now we're just mixing in the corn syrup one quarter cup of corn syrup mixed into it so the corn syrup also allows the extra gelatin to make the texture of the gummy more smooth so that was another thing we had to learn because we tried just putting the extra gelatin in and like i said it was really like hard even though it was gummy but the corn syrup gives it that nice smooth texture and extra sugar yeah it's gonna smell let's see what flavor is this we're doing apricot we've got some apricot jello that's pretty well mixed in so now we're gonna throw this on the stove at medium low heat and just let it heat up until it gets clear everything gets perfectly well dissolved and melted into it and then we'll let it cool down a bit and pour it into our mold although if we have too much bubbles or foam we've got something we can do to get rid of some of that as well we have this tonic water and the tonic water in the black light actually glows kind of blue so i think this would be a good one to try mixing with the blue powder and see if it'll uh all right let's see so instead of just plain water we're going to be using the tonic water all right so you actually don't want quite all of it because this is a different brand and each packet is 3.94 so we want about three quarters of it so don't put all of it in [Music] there's no more in there perfect good job it's pretty loud it is all right all of it all of it okay you get on here and we'll make your red jello next okay all right i'm gonna open it okay perfect wow it's going to pour it right there just pour it all into the jar [Music] good man oh wow look that made some bubbles do we like bubbles in our lego gummies no no how are we gonna get rid of those bubbles does anybody know okay we've got our our apricot is about ready and you can see that there are some bubbles on the surface of it we're just gonna see if we can take all that off if it's not coming off super easily something you can definitely do as grant showed in the original is you can just pour everything into a tall cup and as it cools down this foam and gunk stuff is going to cool off and just be really easy to remove i want to feel it oh it's hot it's hot it's hot as you can see in the mold this is lego bricks sort of upside down and we want there to be interlocking bump shapes on the underside of the legos so that they can fit together so to do that we're going to use this base plate and we're going to sort of smoosh it down onto the mold after we've got all the stuff in there but we don't want it to stick too much it doesn't stick too much to silicone sticks a little bit but not excessively but to make sure it doesn't stick too much to our plate we're going to just add some oil and i'm just going to use some paper towel and sort of smear it around on there until it's got a good coating in the original lego gummies the first pours we did we just poured the lego gummies and brought them out so they had a flat bottom so they were not stackable and we were sitting there eating them and they were really good and grant was like hey wouldn't it be fun if we could stack these i was like yeah that'd be really cool how could we do that and we would like kind of it seems really obvious but at the time we hadn't come up with the idea of using this to put on there so the next mold we did we took the silicone and we were like how could we make bumps on the underside right so we're like could we get legos and put them on there and then we're like maybe we could get flat legos and put them on top and then we saw these bases and grant was like oh genius what if we took the base and put it on like that to make bottoms for the lego so that they would have those imprints coming up so then they became stackable after that so fun little story all right we've got our apricot mix about ready so i'm just gonna pour it off into a squeeze bottle here to try and get some of those bubbles out though i just have the lid on and i'm just going to spin it around and the centripetal force will get some of those bubbles out whoa well that's aggressive it is but it brings some of the bubbles up to the top so there's just a little bit less go ahead and pour it right in i want to do it good job jamie i wouldn't do it you'll get a chance too can i do it yeah you're going to get it turned up that one's perfect too do good pours i'm just going to help you squeeze that in maybe we'll okay and then on to the next one so at this point i'm going to put our base plate over the lego mold here to try and get the interior bumps all of these would be ready yep here we are we're back what's ready for us guys hey is that one of the ones that the two colors that was a two color i think you got a drip of the apricot so you might even be a three color technically this one i think it was red first and then blue that turned out really well i like it that's awesome you already would mix but it looks like it didn't yeah this one i think was the one that was too liquefied to have any separation so that one didn't this is totally but actually you can see the blue on the bottom but it's pretty mixed so just a couple of tips for anyone who's trying this out based on my experiences so i think i already talked about how i really recommend you add the gelatin before the corn syrup i would also recommend being sure to wash your mold with soap and water and rinse it well in between each batch i did a couple of badges off screen and the second batch i had a really hard time getting out of the mold i also think it's helping quite a bit that these are cold the second batch i did i just let cool sitting outside on the counter it wasn't in the fridge i think refrigerating it to cool it down and pulling it out while they're cold makes it a lot easier that and like i said i washed the mold i think all of those things helped because these you can see i'm just they just come out really nice and easily for the most part and my first batch came out easily my second batch was a little bit of a struggle this is a short layer of orange and blue and then riley's idea was to put them together and make them layered like this so now it almost looks like a fine delicacy you could find on a cruise ship a sam's definitely done or the world's weirdest sushi if you want to stack them and build with them they should work for that too okay let's see what you guys can stack and build everybody grab five these ones these ones will stack together these ones won't these ones could be the base though so if you're careful you can actually get the bricks to interlock what did you do is it sticking on your face the blue ones were made with tonic water and the yellow and green ones were made with a little bit of b2 vitamins so let's see how much glowing we got out of them under a [Music] the yellow ones glow quite a bit under a black light that's pretty intense and i think it's interesting so the orange ones we didn't add any powder to them but there was a fluorescent food coloring that i added that apparently glows just a little bit as well some of it's settled you can see that the v2 vitamin is like concentrated on the bottom of it thank you guys so much for joining us and our family for building one of grant's legacy videos lego gummies one of our favorite projects as a family and i hope you guys have a great time building it as well i hope you go home and do this project because it's loads of fun and the payoff you get to eat the product don't eat too many i'm back in the studio and we could not do a lego gummy video without putting a fun twist on it so i brought jared from gold yeller into the studio and we are going to be playing with these little lego gummy guys jared what are we going to be doing with these little lego gummy guys and these heads with all these fun facial expressions i think here's the basic idea okay here's the basics we're going to probably eat the heads off okay and then replace them with lego heads that makes it look like they're talking and then we switch them every single frame and that's what we're gonna do okay so i have taken over the studio i'm going to bring the kids back in we're going to let them play in the studio with these little lego gummy guys and what they're going to do is they get to bite the heads off jared has the courage to be here with us and we're doing lego stop-motion with the kids so he's really brave to be here in the description below there's a link to his channel go check it out there's also a link to my blog where you'll be able to find out what is really happening with these shenanigans in our life and especially kind of how things have been since grant has been gone i'm gonna let the kids go ahead and take one lego gummy guy each bite its head off and then put it back all right okay we bit their heads off we're ready to get started yeah jared needs to bite one off he ate the whole thing that's not biting the head off okay who's not following directions here sorry point at him i'm fired mom okay what do you want your lego gummy guy to say to dad did you see dad yeah in your dreams what do you say i love you what did dad do he makes some jello gummies for me and did you eat them all gone yeah and what do you want to say to dad um okay okay now move your hands out and then push that button right there perfect [Music] okay now push the button this one right here why are you all here no fingers don't eat me goodbye well we want to thank you guys again for joining us for this it's been a year since we lost grant and we just want to thank you for being on this journey with us and continuing to support our projects and the legacy that grant left us grant we really miss you but thanks for what you left us [Music] you", "NtGmqEIz9to": "[Music] another review and today I'm doing candy yeah I'm doing baked Bros gummy bears again these are baked pros gummy bears this entire contrack ajiz 150 milligrams of THC 10 milligrams each piece and there is 15 pieces in here so 15 doses and this actually has directions on the bag most of them normally don't but it says start with one dose which is 10 milligrams I love worth up to 90 minutes for effects and consumers needed suggested use temporarily reduces pain stimulates appetite sleep aid and relief of nausea okay so again baked pros gummy bears 10 milligrams each you know guys you know I'm a lightweight so I'm just gonna start with wine right I'm going to cut into this right now I need to cut it again because evidently I didn't cut below the seal this cut low enough that I'm not cutting all right to hit me and just because I'm going for I get it so honey bear squishy yeah Oh something got put the sugar around it because he's very cannabis II and you know I tend to stray away from edibles that have a strong lead taste because I just don't like the V taste that's a personal thing you might I'm glad I read this it says testing accuracy plus or minus three milligrams of THC per piece oh and that's the thing would be good you kind of always don't know exactly how much teach so you're getting and that's why it's best you're like you know trouble I'm and then wait a little bit before you try nothing but they're gummy bears and they're good it's like to me once you get past that initial taste of it like the cannabis taste hmm I guess the sweetness other kind of mellows that out a little bit to me and they're good they taste like gummies you know like gummy bears but growing up and coming beers right and these are things that these especially when you start talking on gummy treats and things like that candy that kids normally eat or that they gravitate towards if you're medicating that way please you know make sure that you're keeping those out of the reach I mean seriously because for them all they see is gummy bear they don't really understand any of this other stuff okay so now that I'm done this is going back into my weed safe and again yes I can have a week I do have a weed safe and I try to keep my things away I have four kids to a grown and then the two youngest or in their team so just because sometimes it's candy and it might look you know killing even though they're old enough to understand what it is I still keep it you know am i safe just you know to keep it away from him but faith grows very good and as far as um I mean there's 15 in here so I mean this is a good amount to dose with okay and when I bought this actually bought this Micra so it's been a while but the price says $31 again baked bros and so many other companies out there they always they're always offering you know not always but sometimes they're specials that you can catch at your dispensary and there are places like weed Maps who else but I go to online they will actually send me notices about different specials that dispensaries are having and a lot of the companies offer you know boku you know buy one get one so what might be you know $31 you may end up getting tuning and that's actually what I did I think for sure I didn't pay the full price for this I end up getting something free or it was on discount or something so like I always tell you be mindful about the specials and deals that your dispensaries have because you can I'm getting your medicine or action alright alright guys that is it so also available in 75 milligrams and 300 milligram bags so you have options okay alright I will talk to you guys later alright y'all take care [Music]", "Ke0LVpwSp3I": "today Kevin and I'm a variety of Albany's gummies for you mich Mich was kind enough to buy these for us from Walmart in Michigan and they were a dollar ninety-nine each so thank you very much to mich Mich these are the mini gummy and butterflies and then we have mini gummy worms and you'll see these say twelve flavor these are the 12 hour gummy bears so this is what the deal is we're we're actually only going to be trying one package of these for you we're going to show you the other two the reason for that is because all three of these package packages have the exact same flavors except this one has fewer flavors this one only has one two three four five this one only has six fibers but those same six flavors are intubated right so you're paying the same price but you're only getting these six flavors you are getting cherry green apple strawberry grape blue raspberry and orange in this back and you want to tell the twelve that you're hitting you're going to serve both beside cherry strawberry mango pineapple lemon orange green apple watermelon pink grapefruit plum blue raspberry integrate so quite a few more flavors these are really pretty see so much more yeah it's a lot of good that is a lot of going a lot of gummy bear applause so that filled up that flight so do you want to show one up close looks a good one to show the details [Applause] [Music] the butterfly your crap so we should have oh we're not gonna travel right yeah after Linda hooker tackle a macro picture but those are very pretty but so we don't need to try one of these because we're gonna be trying to becoming so the news they the butterflies are ten visas are ninety calories are they all the same no no motor pause 10-piece is 90 these are the gummi worms are six and a half pieces for 98 pieces so I won't jump out over why I didn't Rob there will ever be a better father okay there's split and the two different colors each one of those okay right now what yeah yeah we might not get all about well then if we don't the good thing is hopefully we'll have Italy ever two guys yes sure there's some bears they're cute dumpy is so a corporal okay Carmel and this one big there's a wide a light yellow and then there's a dark yellow yeah and then there's a red I'll speed this part out [Music] okay that is a lot of gummies okay so which right I stick to the table white clink like that's the claims you stick to the window yeah which one do you want draw hearts I don't care doesn't well you have the flavors in front of you yeah this cherry strawberry okay so you want to do try found the Cherisher is not right I'll think about that hello the textures are doing theirs it's good that is very cherry you have to like carry a lot what how much did the strawberry I'm much problem are these instead of the strawberry appearance of the texture I'm sure it's the same no no no try what should you do that imma do the more obvious one like the great okay let's do great the same just like the texture and everything so they literally just made a different shape but bricks to the greatest variate outlook right when I was growing up that's all I had I could have grape jelly and bring gum and grape was just mouthing that is a good right okay mango I have no idea okay what we do the boy one blue raspberry I eat these trolleys like I do questions get all the obvious ones and then trying to figure out the rest that's what they say you should do on a test right huh that is a good blue Reisner tofu they're all good it is very good why were very strong fiber blue run it's not as strong as a jolly rancher no no no that's from now but they're pretty good but they have a good flavor okay you want to do is this gonna be green outdoor / yeah Apple okay so that's green apple so then this little green one must be long I like the lime more than green apple yeah part about the ground and Ju you're agreeing out the parcel them oh my god okay what do you think orange clear up for auction yeah it is like a fresh orange it's like oh you wouldn't think in a candy like that but that's like from the produce section of orange it really is these are all good it means lemon you think is dark yellow or pineapple no more we're not eating massage no no these are something that you take your Hamas that's lemon definitely want to kind of live anyplace with mm-hmm for me that's too much lemon I do not care for the lemon a little bit like leaner and there's a lot of those I would pick all those I'll buy yeah I think the little ideal doesn't be the one that didn't either like the light yellow should be pineapple don't make up honestly there was some wife that I couldn't tell what it was DG's like it was so like red and yellow mystery of the white man's content so that was the light yellow that was questionable yeah biggest mangoes okay where do you run down the pink phone no no black bread you think that's pink grapefruit no boys it's very light Ione though strawberry yeah part strawberry mm-hmm we don't hit the wall no one yet we have coming that with strong pink grapefruit pineapple and warmer let's do the light pink one this something different yeah mmm yeah I don't like that so I don't like sorrows but I don't like light think and I don't like the lemon yeah okay let's do this I woke up yeah so that means that white one was warm water mama looked all along we haven't done okay the boy one what is that I don't know what that is normal and so watermelon that's so live at the in Tyson that's a different water it's very very likely I think a couple of these are kind of life but I like the flavors of them I did not like the lemon and it was a little stronger fruits the grapefruit was was strong and I like the orange quite a bit what is your favorite at all how are the cherry and the I like the bright finish the grape was good and the other ones was good yeah if you get the worms or combined it's a combined flavor you're gonna get but yeah you're gonna bite it in half and you can you get one of those flavors two of those flavors in one warning and then like I said the butterfly is just the single flavor but it you only get so many of those so for your money it's best to buy the worms or the bears honestly I would find the Bears because I wouldn't want I mean will eat him of course but if I was buy them I wouldn't want to flavors in one I would just rather have one vibrator count down the worms yet if I don't have to hold on to the other match or a nice thing about eat the whole thing you could a lot of people would respect the whole wall Ramona before I tell you what though you like the flavors into butterflies better than some of the other flavors cherry green apple strawberry grape blue raspberries horn you like all of us why we're so you're you're almost better up on the butterfl right because I didn't like the grape Frater of the mango or the those flavors are in here that's very true so if you don't want if you don't like those that's true from so firm a that would people like me that would we get a better deal for your money Robert was well thank you miss me so much this was so fun for us I don't know how fun it was for you all to sit there and watch us try shoe cubbies but we this is a really good brand these are very very good quality and and the textures are much softer yeah been some of the gummies out there some of them are kind of tough these are less my softer easier to chew up they they are very much so so I'm gonna have a picture for you at the end and thanks for watching [Music]", "JDbazWjashQ": "[Music] but mr. gummy princess toy review hybrids and princesses it's a team I bet the president's missus fans today we are back with another science experiment yep it's called a gummy bear osmosis on experiment we did didn't we do this science experiment before princess Pam we sure did but it's a little different hello because this time we're testing out how is gonna change the size by using different types of coats or sodas oh yeah that's right laughs are we tired regular water salt water baking soda and dip liner it's soda mm-hmm so what are the supplies we need for this science experiment so what we're gonna need is we're gonna need some cups of course we're gonna need some yummy gummy bears we're also gonna need some Pepsi coca-cola sprite Diet Coke and water and also we're going to need a roller remember friends if you want to try this science experiment home make sure you ask a parent for help or permission and what about well they don't have to so does princess Pham or these dreams well you can use any coke or soda or drinks like you that you have a home so it you know I will juice orange juice water yeah that one we should do a version of juice next time yeah good one okay princess scram enough chatting how about we get started mm-hmm okay so let's go ahead and put our different sodas and our water in each I'm gonna start with the water so let's go ahead and pour it here next I'm going to do diet coke day I'm trying to get the same level as okay perfect and next I'm gonna do this bright right over here so let's go ahead and open it up and last but not least we're going to pour in our head see know what are we gonna eat some good meat no now we're gonna put the gummies inside of our sodas and inside uh okay I'm gonna start with my Pepsi and then in my coca-cola I'm gonna do my red I'm gonna go with this green one here and you go for a swim next up we have Diet Coke put a yellow one in here and last but not least what color should we do for the water princess fam we should do orange orange okay but bonus the gummies so now they're all swimming in the water whoa check it out all around me that looks super cool it doesn't this one does to be you can't really tell because it's like dark in there mmm-hmm and then the other two over here are very dark too the coca-cola and the Pepsi so we're just gonna have to wait and see Paulo should be ours okay so what do you want to do with our four hours that we're waiting well before before I was up we gotta make up our classes oh that's right mm-hmm now this one's kind of tricky because it's either in water or like soda mm-hmm so which ones you guys think and then this smallest mmm I think it's gonna be a close race but I think it's probably gonna get bigger versus getting smaller that's my thinking I hope so so much money think we'll get the biggest the one in water diet coke sprite coca-cola or Pepsi what do you think princess Pam I can't choose between any two cups so I'm just gonna go with the water oh yeah well I'm gonna go it's part okay okay so that's what we think will be the biggest the water in this price what is your guess and now we wait the four hours I say it's back to class in session okay I think it's been four hours okay let's take a look like me it's hard to see so how about we take it out and see all right good idea so here we have our regular size got me on this plate and now we're gonna take out gummies that been sucked in solution with the help of a utensil Oh Tesla brink so here we have it I took out the one in water and next let's take out the one in Diet Coke whoa it kind of changed colors purple BAM it soaked up the dynamic you wanna try sure okay I'm gonna take the one out in sprite mmm Wow that one grew too and next we have the coca-cola there it is and ooh that one change colors Joe and last but not least we have the one in Percy whoa I check all of those out so now what do we do now we need to measure to see which one is the biggest right yeah all right but first we must measure a regular sized government I don't really know how big it is mmm so according to my handy-dandy ruler here ooh it is exactly 2 and 1/2 centimeters we must write that down cuz we won't be fine since without collecting data ok so we have the regular gummy and you said it was two and a half two and a half cinema 2.5 centimeters okay go ahead princess Sam all right moving on we're gonna measure our gummy and Diet Coke and it's at two point seven centimeters all right let's move on over to the sprites and from toe to ears it is a whopping two point nine centimeters and look at this one in Coke let's see this one's a little tricky we have this one act oh it has one ear that's I'm gonna go in between and say it's two point seven centimeters let's go on to this one which is the one in Pepsi hmm this one's only about 2.6 and last but not least we have the one in water hmm let's see this one's close whoa this one is only 2.7 so here we have our data my favor make a graph oh let's do it I started up bar breath while we were waiting here we go we have gummy osmosis we have our measurements on this line in the centimeter we have our solutions diet coke sprite coke pepsi and water the bar graph that's in black is our regular gummy which princess Pham confirmed is 2.5 centimeters no let's go ahead and fill this pit so I'm gonna go ahead and fill in yellow for Diet Coke Princess Anne can you help me read this chart yep for Diet Coke it is okay good read the workforce right and sports right it's gonna be a whopping two point nine centimeters close to three so about right here okay and for Coke let's see two point seven two point seven very similar to our diet coke but right here what about Pepsi four Pepsi two point six two points sick okay and what about water two points right here according to our scientific experiments the one that got the biggest is the sprite as you can tell compared to all the other ones it groups two point nine it is the winner hey princess bamboo buffalos that will be the biggest and my hypothesis that's right and you know what you get for being right what it you can eat the gummy right you should eat it I mean it's just so inspiring it's not bad but good texture [Music] although super fun you guys that's the end of

the gummy bears like I'm not like hot I can't wait for that [ __ ] Moonie 5 gummy bears and get like an insulin spike no gummy bears are not good for you there if you eat too many of them [ __ ] your [ __ ] up in there you'll be [ __ ] for days and all this and people were talking about it and I don't eat that many gummy bears ain't like a handful of them go get like a handful like eight put like five in my pre-workout like eat three that's it I eat my gummy bears around pre-workout time I love it they make me smile they make me feel good about myself they doing my favorite candy since I was a kid my mom you know whenever like Christmas and Easter and all that [ __ ] gummi bears whenever candy stores like still exist you don't see them too often now at least around here like you be would go into the gummy bears store they'd have like the [ __ ] the wall of like things you flip up and pull out and put in the bag and all that [ __ ] yeah I haven't seen those in a while but always got a ton of gummies it's my [ __ ] and to this day you know being a pro bar being a bodybuilder in general you deprive themselves of the things you like gummy bears whenever I died it was one thing I didn't need a lot of does it's not good for you also making my coffee away like no sugar no creamer just black [ __ ] that [ __ ] sucks but those are the things you take out of your life so that you can look good naked so now that I'm not doing that season setting getting jacked and tan looking that's much tan I need the gummi bears no physiological benefit zero none don't care what it does just like to eat them if you're looking for insulin spike or some type of benefit from a carbohydrate you can drink [ __ ] Gatorade you can get a rapid glycogen loader car power drink your pre-workout I take those drink the Gatorade might mix it with [ __ ] Gatorade and it's still the gummy bears in why because like the taste they make me feel good so that's it also the deadlifts and gummy bears sure so that shirt big sellin shirt for us we love it that came from time whenever the deadlifts and gummy bears thing whenever I was going through a pretty rough time in my life whenever I was going through the divorce with my ex and me you know having full custody of kids and being super dad and having to do all this stuff it was really rough it sucked and had a lot of crazy emotions [ __ ] with my head and I thought you know I needed to I needed to go to a place that would like let all my aggression out let all my [ __ ] anxiety let all my let all my emotions pour out and I was like I'm gonna go to the gym I'm gonna eat gummy bears train back the deadlifts and pull-ups and all the hardship sweat my [ __ ] balls off and left listen him out so that's what I did that's where that shirt came from that shirt that is just such a wild success and everybody loves it because if they go eat gummy bears and do deadlifts and listen to metal and do hard [ __ ] and make you sweat bro that's good [ __ ] makes bill glad that came from a really shitty time so you know how if you hear those things that like good can come from really bad places and really bad situations that it did and that was where it came from I was able to go to the gym just eat handful gummy bears do set it deadlifts we put up and put on more weight and for gummy bears do deadlifts that's my [ __ ] loved it so that's where it came from the gummy bears do not eat gummy bears thinking you're going to like get some great grand [ __ ] effect from them they don't hold a whole lot of good nutritional value they don't anything they're pure [ __ ] sugar their [ __ ] will [ __ ] your teeth up after belly up I don't care I like on ah so I hope we can close the case on that situation I mean I think I think [ __ ] flex magazine was like oh like after I started saying this [ __ ] they were like oh like you can eat gummy bears and like post-workout and it's like good cuz it's sugar and this now it's like Jesus Christ no it doesn't know how it works like there's way better things you could be [ __ ] eating post-workout then shitty gummy bears okay maybe drink water I might be a good starter not [ __ ] gummy bears is that it been [ __ ] or better than she [ __ ] protein bars dick after selling oh man gummy bears I just like them Oh what else snacks that's another question snacks what do I personally like because I always talk about snacks [ __ ] love them and what are also good bodybuilder snacks too that you can have in your program that can help add weight and do good for you so start number one me personally I love salty snacks [ __ ] extra salty pretzels Doritos cheez-its get snacks that's my [ __ ] I don't the gummy bear thing the sweet thing that's only pre-workout I just like those but from like the snackin standpoint like it high would've baked and sitting there got a couple beers in me yep yep extra salty pretzels they're in there there's Doritos in there I like nacho cheese the kids like Cool Ranch that's good cheese it's in there too so moving on to snacks that benefit protein that benefit you as a bodybuilder [ __ ] peanut butter and jelly rice cakes those are my go-to I usually have two or three of them before I hit the gym right now my calories are up I eat the Smuckers all-natural creamy I like crunchy but I go through I go through about 16 ounce through our peanut butter in about three days yeah maybe sooner depends on what I'm training calories are crazy high right now I've never eaten this much fat I am right now it's working out well I like it I feel better I think more clear I think more clearly or clearer however you want to term that but yeah peanut butter and jelly rice cakes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches the sandwiches in the middle of the night I'll have like I'll have a cup of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches if I had big training day I usually do like a large cup of almond milk or I'll mix up a protein shake like one scoop of protein with 8 to 12 ounces of almond milk with my - peanut butter jelly sandwiches yeah snack wise I also so in the truck I also will have trail mix but something so if I'm behind on a meal and I need to keep my calories high or in between meals mean - you know peanuts almonds dried fruit I love that [ __ ] peanut butter bean butter pretzels they're not really greatest for you it's like that's not salty fat guy thing that if you notice there's a lot of peanuts and peanut butter involved with my with my snacking fruit I eat a banana or two a day apples if we got them yeah I do a good bit of fruit too right now my meals are quite large you know a meeting about 40 to 50 grams of protein along with 70 to 100 grams of carbohydrates at each meal five solid meals a day so the snacking is limited and it's like I said it's usually higher calorie snacking as well so that's also why look at the my training sessions need to be [ __ ] intense they need to be optimized they need to be really [ __ ] hard so I sweat I burn those calories I need to eat that type of food if you are not training like that you will get fat from eating all of that [ __ ] for [ __ ] sure other good snacking for dieting that's another question people go out to snack and while dieting the fruit has sugar in it even though it's unprocessed processed on processed sugar natural sugars I it depends on how far you are into a prep some people don't like it I'm still fine with some fruit here and there probably up until like six eight weeks out maybe seven weeks somewhere on there cut it out other people have their own decisions about that I'm talking about everyday snacking uh cucumbers celery greens those are good snack and thins while you're dieting problem is with those is whenever you start adding [ __ ] to it like peanut butter dressings things like that I usually stick to like if I need to I'll add a little bit of salt to it nice and tasty tastes like salt with water and like crunch that's pretty much what it is about peanut butter jelly sandwich but no those those are pretty much my daily snacks that's it yeah I like salty pretzels ice cream unlike that [ __ ] with my belly and lactose-intolerant so I got to be careful with that yep pretty much it locked peanut butter my jelly I think when I go to the store I typically buy like four or five jars at a time but hey what's do yeah no I don't think yo Girt back to us yogurt would be a good snack for people candy you can eat candy too little [ __ ] your [ __ ] all up being sarcastic don't do that late night snacks cereal I do that raisin bran with fruity pebbles in there protein shake is the milk fuckin'-a right that's my [ __ ] take a nice dump in the morning from it all right moving on how much protein should I eat per day oh boy along with this people also get a lot of digestion I get a lot of digestive questions how much protein should be today what depends on how much lean body mass you have right the next thing is is what are you training like how are you training what what are you doing what what physical exertion are you putting out what are you putting out that you need food for how are you training like I said me when I'm going in to Train I'm training like a [ __ ] animal I am going nuts I'm going to put myself through the [ __ ] hardest workout I possibly can for that day and I'm not gonna settle for anything less I'm going to push myself so that I'm gonna push myself further than I thought I could go before whenever I started when I started I'm like I'm gonna [ __ ] work today as I'm doing it I'm searching for ways for that workout to get harder I want to find it so it can be harder so I can challenge myself then I need to eat because the [ __ ] that I just did to challenge myself I was [ __ ] pouring sweat I was shaking I was pushing myself way past what my body actually wanted to do so therefore now I need to refuel my body so that it can grow so that it can rebuild it so that it can recover how much protein do I need to do that see some people be like oh you need 1.5 grams of protein per lean body mass so if you're - if you have 200 pounds of lean body mass you need 300 grams of protein it's a good way to gauge it but if you are working if you are doing the workouts that I've been doing that I do [ __ ] 300 grams ain't enough will it work yes will it suffice yes but in order to grow need more in my opinion you also need a fuckload of carbohydrates because actually meeting right now you're also getting a good bit fast I probably take in per day in protein I probably take in like 350 grams of protein per day that's you know I'm eight weeks in almost nine and a half weeks into my into a program so I'm in the thick of it I got seven and a half weeks left of this program so I'm in the middle of it and I'm [ __ ] working hard my body is burning so therefore that 350 grams of protein probably around for 425 on like cheat days were very very high calorie days my body can utilize all of those and I know that through a couple things one being my digestion I'm not when I'm not pushing out as much gas I'm not gasps I'm not bloated with gas and I'm my elimination schedule is now the same every day so now I am utilizing all of the food that I'm eating okay one thing in the beginning of a program when people start out and they just started training either like in week 1 2 3 and they're eating this food and they are just [ __ ] farting like a fiend they're farting all [ __ ] day long and it smells like [ __ ] bro you are your body it is overload for your body you're [ __ ] it out you're not absorbing it all and you are just gaseous [ __ ] your body doesn't like what's going on so that's why in the beginning you have to start with a little bit lower like I was eatin in the beginning I was even like 275 grams of protein and I was still with my body was becoming acclimated to us part and I was my shed schedule was out of control was also eating a lot of carbohydrates and fats but the protein standpoint with one and a half grams of protein per per pound of lean body mass is a great place to start if you are feeling uncomfortable because that's too much then it's too much you need to back down a little bit maybe 1 1 in a quarter of grams or put two five grams then as you progress into your program you can increase it so the protein thing like I said that's a great place to start that's that's a well-known fact but just also take into consideration all of the other food that you're eating as well my macros for the day broccoli protein 350 grams of protein like I said over for on my on my cheat days with my high calorie days carbohydrates 550 to 750 average per day than on my high calorie days thousand more possibly fats you know probably safe fats roughly yeah 100 to 150 a day pretty pretty pretty religiously every day and I attest that type of eating to the way I'm trained I haven't trained this hard like I happen since years ago years ago and Mikan a lot of 236 pounds when I wake up I'm like 239 when I go to bed and then just keep on training so from a protein standpoint that digestion part pay attention to your digestion digestion absorption elimination if your elimination process is going wrong or your fart a lot and [ __ ] spraying the toilet when you're taking a dump or you're not being absorbed it's just a mess your fart a lot crazy gassy body's having a hard time digesting digesting all of that so back off the protein a little bit like your body become acclimated and as you continue to train harder and harder and the body becomes acclimated and you start working into it all start increasing your food that's how you grow that's how your body has a smooth transition into your your progress your goals it's my opinion [ __ ] do I know next ah here's a good one this is it should I take steroids yes no should I smoke meth sure no that would not be a good idea should I smoke cigarettes if you want to a really good idea that question is a personal [ __ ] choice it's up to you should you do it my opinion no there's pot calling the kettle black however that's saying goes no III don't you though you better have a purpose but I have a purpose you better have researched it and you better have an understanding of what's going to occur if you're asking me should you take steroids what do you know about them have you done research are you educated do you know what the side effects are do you know what can occur do you know if the answer is no then my answer is [ __ ] no if your answer is yes and you can explain to me all those things I just asked all right then now it's personal choice it's up to you you're you're educated you know things are gonna go wrong you know the consequences that you're gonna have to live with possibly for the rest of your life it's all up to you that means that you can't come crying like a little [ __ ] victim that this happened to me because I did this well [ __ ] yeah did would you expect your stupid [ __ ] that's real [ __ ] saying a [ __ ] joke you know these I hear [ __ ] crazy stories from people with the Jemez crazy stories people [ __ ] taking a thousand digs at rent a week that's it thousand makes a trend a week no tests no nothing just the trend are you a [ __ ] [ __ ] yep you are and then after they're done they want to say uh it didn't work out for me I had all these problems no [ __ ] [ __ ] you had problems like most people don't even know what the [ __ ] that what their supplements are supposed to do and then they're also taking a bunch of gear and wondering why the dick doesn't get hard after they stop taking [ __ ] or I don't understand the whole process of testicular atrophy or anything like that holy [ __ ] don't be that goddamn stupid some people are and if you are one of those people I'm gonna highly recommend you change your ways so my next recommendation would be to go watch two steroids drugs and light videos that we put out we put out I think you tell you well five of them thus far the first ones where you should start part one it's really good but overall like I said in those videos it's all personal choice don't do dumb [ __ ] that's like my [ __ ] blanket statement for everything I've done dumb [ __ ] I'll probably continue to do some dumb [ __ ] here and there but make sure that that type of such that type of thing right there should I take steroids take that seriously do your research don't think that you can take steroids for six weeks and everything will be okay and then you'll stop and everything will be okay no [ __ ] these are hormones that you are injecting or putting into your body they are going to affect you everything in this [ __ ] because if I can take something that makes me bigger faster and stronger if I eat train hydrate work harder leave wadd some crazy [ __ ] take it serious don't be a [ __ ] don't be dumb I mean how am i able to sit here and say all this [ __ ] because I did do a lot of dumb [ __ ] he did that's how I learned I'm stubborn bullheaded I'm a risk taker I'll continue to be that and everything that I do in life because that's my personality but I'm recognizing that it's myself and that's how I operate I also am taking full accountability for my decisions in my actions you don't hear me crying nobody so whenever you do these things you're not allowed to cry like a little [ __ ] victim well this happened to me I can't believe I don't want it yeah dude what the [ __ ] do you expect of course that's what's gonna happen [ __ ] off job I hope this was fun I have fun gummy bears snacks protein juice it's all good love it all [ __ ] up but stay tuned for more each of Wiis don't take too much Hannah draw and stick the old lady just like she likes it even some way she doesn't like it she'll like it you", "mAZXWAuWp6E": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make nerd ropes here's what you're going to need two boxes of nerds one cup of gummy bears and some tincture the first step is to fold some foil in an accordion shape and spread it along a baking sheet then you can pour your Nerds into each fold of the tin foil make sure you have enough because if you don't the gummy make sure we'll stick to the tin foil and it'll be harder to take them out after then you'll melt you're going bears in the microwave for about 40 seconds and if you like add 1 tablespoon of ginger and stir it in I'm gonna be pouring my gummy mixture into a squeeze bottle so it'll be easier to dispense be careful not to pour too much just like I did on that first one take it slow and just do a thin line now you can top the ropes with some more nerds once they've all been filled squish the tinfoil together to make them into a tighter more compact shape then put them into the fridge or freezer I still had some remaining mixture left and instead of making more ropes I'm just gonna make some little nerd bytes by using a mold that I had on hand I also added some more nerds on top before I put them into the fridge once they've solidified in the fridge or freezer shake off the excess nerds into a bowl and then peel them off the tinfoil now some of mine came off okay but some of them I had a little more difficulty with so I decided to leave them out for about 24 hours outside of the fridge or the freezer so that they could dry out a little bit more which made them a lot easier to peel off the nerd bites in the silicone mold came out really easily after letting them sit in the freezer for about an hour [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you guys they turned out so beautifully it did take an extra day for them to drive because they were sticking to the tinfoil but after I let them dry they turned out absolutely wonderful just make sure you put enough nerds on the bottom part of the tinfoil so that you're not having issues with the going mixture sticking I can't believe how fantastic they all came out I'm so excited and they're so delicious because I have already tried some and the little bites are so few I love them so much I could have made more ropes but I kind of liked having these little ones if you just grab I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you to the person who requested me to make this video because I'm absolutely in love with these and I'll be definitely making them again thank you guys so much for watching I hope you try these out have a wonderful day", "90GlUQQXfMM": "mommy's so round two of neutrons muggles same night I've already taken her milligrams THC and have milligrams of CBD and I'm gonna vote to try this brownie which I'm really excited about it is supposed to have any I want to check for you 200 milligrams of THC this is the Bernie and this is the Bernie I'm really excited either there's more like fudge then a brownie but I'm sure this bomb I was really really good like dangerous good Mike never got apples before this could kind of be a little dangerous because I definitely don't really taste the weed in this which is really surprising I think it's because it's brownie but yeah it's definitely like a fudge more than anything it was like really moist it was really easy - mm-hmm so hopefully the potency is as good as it tastes it was to go to hand in hand then this would definitely be a reprieve for me because I love chocolate and I am a huge fan of fudge and this is [ __ ] delicious like this could be very dangerous mmm dose it's the name of the company I can't double yeah definitely definitely really good I'd say I would like this over the watermelon because I'm going to eat this whole thing in one sitting which as I said if you are somebody that does not have a high tolerance I don't really recommend doing something like this because some people don't react well to edibles and you just save which is cool like it really doesn't matter but definitely if you're like just getting into the edibles world like please please please take things slow we do not want to hear stories of mom not being able to really function in the morning because she's still very very very high which sometimes does happen or absolute worst case scenario you completely trip oh and you ever the hospital like that is something we do not want to see and we do not advocate for here we want to see good slow medicating especially if you do not have that tolerance if you are somebody that is just getting into this please do not do what I am doing and please do not sit here and eat the entire brownie because if you do you might get a little bit too high and for some people they don't really like that I mean personally I'm like yeah let's do it like let's get popped out but some people are like no not my forte I don't want to sit there and like zone out and not be able to move or personally like I move which whom I actually I wasn't sitting here my foot is like literally bouncing I don't sit still so for me mm-hmm definitely win I don't say packaging there isn't a lot of it I'm going to only hang with this this and this piece so there's a lot of time in time packaging which is good I love and if my kid tried to grab this you probably wouldn't even know how to open it like I actually took me if you mess be like okay how does this open because besides don't open just like literally rip it open from the bottom which is good because sure happens sometimes we live things and our children's reach which accidents happen nobody's perfect that's why I always say like there's never allowed any judgement because accidents happen [ __ ] happens in the obvious", "jvhAXh5pFFo": "what's up guys it's Audra and back today with another tutorial on a sweet treat that you can make at home so I don't know if you guys have seen that the news lately probably not hard-hitting news there's a lot of rose' trends going on with drinks and food and different things that you can eat but there are friggin rosey gummy bears and there was an 18,000 person waiting list for these things so today I decided to do a gummy tutorial on how to make your own wine gummy bears but I'll do you one even better I put glitter in them so yes they do make edible glitter it's called disco dust and basically it's just an edible sugar that's turned into glitter which you can put on cakes or practically anything it doesn't have any kind of a flavor or anything but it's so pretty it makes everything shiny which is awesome so I decided to buy some and I'm gonna put links to everything that I used in today's video down below in the description so you can buy them yourself but I'm a better Kunis gummy bears well I get these they're glittery and you can eat them and they taste like wine I mean how much better can it get then wine and glitter gummy bears so here's like the close-up shot if it'll focus close up but these guys how get out oMG they're super glittery they're so cute and they actually do taste like the wine that I use so I decided to use a Moscato wine since it's one of the most sweet wines that you can get that's a white wine so I went with a white wine so that you're able to see the glitter rather than using a red wine and so I chose this one in particular it's really good it's really sweet so using that there's enough sweetness plus adding a little bit of sugar to the mix so these don't actually turn out like traditional gummy bears they're not quite as chewy they have more of like a jello texture they're still really good and they have a gummy consistency like I said great for parties great for gifts or just impressing your friends so let's go ahead and get started thanks for watching today guys and I hope you enjoyed the video if you did be sure to give me a thumbs up and let me know in the comments so I can keep making more videos like this for you again all the products that I used in today's video are down in the description below so that you can buy them yourselves and I really hope that you enjoyed making glitter wine gummies today and I'll see you next time bye", "W3iwBHi8Uz0": "hey guys welcome to fit monsters today we're doing drunken gummy bears I got an email from Corey out in Oklahoma City who

how tiny anna's gummy bear is i'm just very surprised that it contains 9 million Scoville that's literally 900 times spicier than a jalapeno pepper yeah so I figured the only way to do this properly is to slowly work my way up there so we have different gummies here this is a regular gummy bear as you can see the only difference between this and this is this one has a dynamite in the middle

what they say enjoy the pain Stacey", "D7xYWUnC8UE": "hi everybody this is Jen from cookies cupcakes and cardio comm today I'm going to be showing you how to make gummy candy we're going to be using the nostalgia electrics gummy candy maker and I'm going to be showing you how to make the little tiny gummy bears and this giant one so let's get started so when I opened the nostalgia electrics gummy candy maker what I found inside were four individual trays like this and then four of these silicone liners so we've got worms fish and then two gummy bear components it comes with two of these heating pots and then this is the heating machine part that and that all the heat comes from that metal part in the center there it also came with a large gummy bear mold and a set of fairly exploit Ori instructions so I'm going to go through my recipe on how to make the gummy bears using this machine so the first thing we want to do before we start making our gelatin mix is we need to fill up the each of the trays with a layer of ice so I'm going to put about half of the container in make sure you want to make sure that your ice is level so it doesn't make any indents into your gummies so I've filled up the other ones already and now I'm going to turn my machine on the my one thing about this kit is that this machine does take quite a while to heat up that's my one complaint but I'm going to give you an alternative when I show you how to make the Jumbo gummy bear so into this pot is going to go 1/2 a cup of water and that's about its maximum capacity as well and then I have one container of a for serving amount of jello which is 85 grams and it's going in and in with it as well is three envelopes of gelatin which equal about 21 grams so you just put all that into the pot give it a stir and then you have to wait so the waiting is going to take probably about 10 minutes and it's going to start to thicken up right away and don't worry I started worrying right away that it will I'd ruined it but just you have to wait till it gets the pot gets really hot and it will get hot so be careful that you don't hurt yourself and you want to make sure that all the gelatin has dissolved in the water so when that has happened I'll be back to show you what it should look like so my gelatin mixture has been heating now for about 10 minutes and I can tell it's ready to go because it's real iqua fide and also the gelatin is in here is dissolved completely so that tells me it's ready to be poured into the molds but it's gonna take that off now another slight complaint here is that the little heating pot is a little bit unstable so I don't want to be pouring this hot liquid while the heating pot is kind of a sided so I'm just gonna turn it off and take it and put it over to the side now really handy are the little spouts on the side here so I can just gently pour them into the molds and fill them up so it takes about 15 minutes for these smaller ones to set so I'm gonna fill up all of my molds here and then I'm going to show you in the meantime while these ones are setting I'm gonna show you how to make the Jumbo Teddy the Jumbo gummi mold to make the giant gummy bear we're going to be using berry blue jello you can use any flavor that you'd like to and it takes two packages and these are for serving packages and they equal a hundred and seventy grams in total we're going to be using six packages of the Knox gelatin unflavored and that equals 42 grams 1 cup of water and the Jumbo mold that's included in the machine kit so let's put this together and make the giant gummy bear so in this one I'm going to show you a different way to make the gelatin and you can do the same for the smaller jellies that I showed you previously if you don't have the machine so all you have to do is pour your unflavored gelatin and your flavored gelatin into a microwaveable dish or a bowl or one like this I like this one just because it has a pouring spout then taking a whisk just whisk it up together and then you're going to put this mixture into the microwave for between a minute and two minutes and what you're going to be looking for is a nice liquid consistent seikhs that's going to start to gel up again like it did previously and making sure that all the little crystals have just melted into the liquid so I'm going to do that now and then I will be back now that my mixture has mixed together completely I'm going to pour it into my gummy bear mold and then once I've got it all in my mold it's going to go into the freezer for the quickest solidification you can leave it on the counter that's just fine but putting it into the freezer will take about half an hour to 45 minutes so I'm gonna pop that in and then I'll be back to show you how to unmold your little ones which are probably going to be ready now once it's been about 15 minutes all you have to do to check to see whether or not your gummies are set it's just to give your mold a little wiggle and I can tell that they're nice and solid so to remove them from the silicone mold it's really quite easy you just can pick them up pop it out like that and then just pry away with your fingers like that so our final step is to remove the jumbo gummy bear from the mold so this is just like I did with the silicone molds so you're just going to pull back on the sides and then pull it out and it's as simple as that so I'll be right back to close the video so there you go everybody how to make a gummy candy using a gummy candy maker now what I liked about the gummy candy maker was the molds I thought they were really cute and I especially liked the Jumbo mold but what I found disappointing was that the maker didn't come with any gelatin and the length of time that heating up the gelatin using the machine than it comes with it just took a long time with what you can do in the microwave for 1/2 two minutes so that's my review of the gummy candy maker I hope you enjoyed the video remember to give it a thumbs up if you liked what you saw and if you'd like us to review a different product make sure you leave that in the comments I'd love to see what you guys are interested in buying so I will see you all again next time bye you", "9wv8g-ToF4A": "oh oh my okay if you beat this gummy bear i will pay you one dollar eat this sour gummy worm and i'll pay you

bailey stroke i was like there's not a chance what's that right now 18 here 18 bucks oh my god i need to break up the flavor you're going for back down to the one dollar i need to break up that flavor sour patch kids watermelon come on these are amazing thirty thirty dollars thirty that thirty already how we doing on time like six minutes seven minutes left seven minutes let me see another four you didn't like in three minutes yeah you're putting in some work ryan you're gonna run the bank uh you know all those times you've made fun of me for eating all the candy at the candy bar oh my god i'm gonna throw up after this oh where's he going come on there you go where's he going trying to burn calories do some squats 10 000 is fine 75 80. he's at 80. 80 bucks 80 dollars you're getting close to the value of the fries that bailey was going for yeah i got five minutes though that's true yeah four minutes and 30 seconds he might blow he might blow all right he's not looking that one hit me really hard oh my gosh my stomach really hurts yes right that's worth it this is all i've eaten today three minutes ryan oh my that's a lot of time left still tap out you don't have to max out that's true i don't want you to get sick this is really no different than what ryan eats every day that's true how much time do i have you have a minute a minute if he throws up it's over i just really had to fart and i ran out of the room is that what that was you crop dusted me i'm sorry nine eight seven six [Music] all right ryan you had a stack of cash you ready to see how much you're in hopefully it's enough here we go all right 85 90 95 100. 100 510 115 okay 120. 125. would you pay that money right now to not feel the way you do yes how much are you gonna eat well we'll see probably not this much can we go next uh yeah you guys are good to go spin the wheel and let's see what time you get so we're gonna be on the same team so we get to spin the wheel twice and then you guys are teaming up with that you're gonna combine the gummies you eat and combine the scores oh five points oh that was five minutes all right fine five minutes spin it again and we're gonna combine time combine gummies and combine money but the money that gets paid out has to be split between the boat carter it says 15 minutes we can't read because you cheated i know it's going to happen your turn okay so five minutes plus five give me five all right so since you guys are teaming up i'm gonna say that's fair but just know that everything eaten combined between the both of you is gonna get paid out and then split between the both of you all right here we go in three two one go oh my god that is tough if you can finish that in 20 minutes that's 250 dollars and that's a hundred dollars for your cheeseburger stuff has been the banker of the day 100 bucks there's a hundred dollars right here i feel like the bigger the gummies get like the more like like just like just so [Applause] [Music] hang on is it only liz cheating or denise too that's not wine liz that's literally yours it looks like it's your burger look at this i don't think that this is a valid attempt take one bite throw the rest of it in the trash can oh man upon further inspection there's actually nothing in here from denise this is only the burger so denise is still going so whatever denise eats and finishes she'll get paid so she's working on a 250 bottle of coca-cola gummy denise you got this oh no way she's actually doing it are you seeing this okay what none that she has yo eric how much time we got all right denise five and a half minutes left she's almost about to finish that coca-cola bottle which is 250 dollars right here that's 250. wait carter come on two minutes left and denise is actually doing some serious work on this can i talk back in and just try to eat the pizza in two minutes let's help her okay fine two minutes ago can you could fold it because you're not going to finish that there's not much time left doesn't matter if you fold it like new york or not a minute left a minute left a minute denise you gotta put work okay all right come on oh she's got in her mouth look at these trying to finish how does it you're probably all sugared up all right five four three two one all right liz if you can somehow finish that then you're set if you can finish that whatever's in your mouth you are set for a 250 bottle of gummy soda that's insane if you drop any piece it's over just like bailey it's over she dropped the piece you drop oh all right so liz you won a whopping zero dollars because you cheated but denise on the other hand really impressive because you ate an entire one of these and this is a 250 dollar bottle of cola gummy so banker stove let's pay it out 250 dollars make it rain make it rain ready have to divide it into two wait that's true hey that's true that's what we said beginning it is split by two oh carter that puts us in first place and everyone else is a loser well i would say everyone is a winner if they walk away with even one dollar our next contestant is a big eater and he is also the winner of our last eating challenge who can gain the most weight in 45 minutes erica you gained 10 pounds of food in 45 minutes so i think you have a pretty good shot at eating a lot of pounds of gummy all right eric let's spin it and see how much time you get there you go the time will be in your favor for this one since the max is only 15 minutes oh 10 minutes okay all right i feel like you could eat at least one of those five pound gummy bears whoa hi jojo ready starting in three two one go all right and he's off oh wow going to be paying out some cash on this kid i might be losing this whole stack right here oh he just ate the gummy bear's face oh that is a strong gummy bear guys it is the world's biggest oh my god there's no way oh oh my okay guys eric is a beast he can eat some serious food and i think he might even go for the green one next whoa wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait where are you wait where's he going what he literally has seven minutes you're giving up oh my god i'm disgusting this is not for me this challenge is disgusting i don't know how you came up with this all right eric you still have six minutes so you could start again on a new gummy bear if you want since you spit that one out or what are you doing this challenge is not worth it after seeing ryan out there on the couch i just don't even think it's gonna be worth the money i'm calling it man i'm calling it that's it all right guys i can't believe it but eric is actually tapping out he's forgoing the thousand dollar gummy bear wait hang on what'd you just eat wait he gets one dollar stone he gets one dollar oh you're still on top two dollars four five six seven dollars all right so i'm calling it wow i'm taking a wrong cash right there all right everyone's a winner so six sixty dollars pathetic you know what i can't i walked away with something and i'm not disgustingly sick so i'll take it as a win here we go guys this is the grand finale we are doing jojo versus stove the way this one is gonna work is they're going to both go at the same time and the person who eats the most is going to steal the other person's winnings and walk away with everything so it's high risk high reward winner takes all you guys ready to spend ready i'll let you go oh five minutes okay so how about he rolled five so multiply that by two so ten minutes give us ten minutes all right you know what all right all right deal here we go ten minutes on timer in three two one start oh he's going for the hot dog hot dog it's a hundred bucks if you can finish it 250 dollars if you can jojo eat like half of that jojo that's a hundred dollar hot dog yeah at this rate he's gonna eat four of those before subjects are ones i mean he might crush the plate of them oh oh he's got it where's the honey hundred bucks for jojo 100 he has to finish it he's gotta finish it but it's right here for you jojo will be officially in first place for this final round and uh remember guys whoever eats the most in this round steals the other person's eatings and earnings so winner takes all no slow mo slow we sell a lot of time left i don't know you just swallowed it the boy has got too much on his plate he's gonna he's gonna make it work i guess technically you could spit it out as long as you still eat it what's wrong with you eyes on the fries i think after this video we're never doing an eating challenge ever again five minutes left eyes on the prize i need some yeezys that's as big as the money you're so close i don't want to throw up after you take your time i mean look you got three and a half years so you can do the mail trip at the end yeah jojo's really clean it up jojo is done that's a hundred bucks ryan payman right here juice that's fine i'll give it to him yeah you get through after think about that jojo you realize if he finishes i know you lose because that's 250. i don't think he is dude that crust is crazy this is so much this that's a long a minute and ten two more dollars just 103. 25 seconds stove just has to get it in his mouth for it to count and then he ultimately has to finish eating it at some point later after the timer am i 110 i haven't seen anyone do that successfully so i think it's a lot harder than it sounds like three four one two three four five six seven eight elbows count you walk away with 250 plus jojo's 100 and change this is really exciting guys this is a very exciting fun round place your bets right now who is going to win we're going to check back in here on stove and see if you can finish you can't go this far just to lose though i mean jojo wants to do it he's actually put in some serious work though oh wait there's one there's a loose piece no i don't know so seriously if that somehow slips and falls it's game over yeah oh oh no oh no what yeah guys no carter there's no way that counts you know he said you said if it touches the ground he loses he said he can't use your hands no hands no hands ugh done all right all right hang on hang on here is the final ruling so the timer ended his stove did not finish his pizza but he did not use his hands and he was able to get it done because he had it all in his mouth and then the timer but he then dropped one little piece which then he ate without using his hands so does that count as a disqualification i'm not sure because also jojo has at least a little tiny piece of equal size of equal size so it's snowdrop so i would say that maybe stone what might end up being the winner but i feel like maybe we should leave it to you guys to vote in the comments down below who should walk away or should jojo keep his winnings and should still keep his winnings i think both of them worked really hard yeah i think they both deserve what they oh yeah i think they're gonna leave jojo and stove because that was a tough round hey guys the bank saw you did a really good job hey hang on hey that's my cash yeah what are you doing guys the bank thought you did great hey here we go ryan give me my money back anyways guys comment down below what you guys would eat and how many of these gummy bears would eat i'll see you guys on the next vlog [Music] piece [Music] you", "_ye7_mXKUuk": "[Music] the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are talking high five chuckles again high five chocalate this is their dark chocolate bar 200 milligrams of THC I've already reviewed one of their products liked it quite a bit I reviewed their milk chocolate this time we're looking at the dark and I gotta say I'm pretty I got good expectations high expectations for this one because the first one was such a success so we're out here at the beautiful dog beach you can look behind you and see all these wonderful ships maybe maybe not long the beach I believe the second largest port in the United States may be the first largest by dollar amount it's even a little larger spy dollar amount or byte the total tonnage I care I have smashed my finger making this very difficult to open guys oh wait wait I see something here ah I got it but I'm dealing a thumb so here we go we've got our high five bar here you can see it with its little logo embossed on it let's give a bite of the dark chocolate again this is 200 milligrams oh and it cost me I believe 15 dollars at my dispensary so a pretty good deal for a 200 milligram chocalate bar oh no tastes pretty good good dark chocolate nice quality almost zero cannabis taste - uh - speak up almost none whatsoever just a good quality chocolate alright guys whoop I'm gonna finish this off and I will come back to you in two hours or through the magic of editing just in a couple of seconds and we'll let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review thanks for watching guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] two two hours later alright guys we are two hours in the future um and I am talking about high by dark chocolate 200 milligrams of THC and curiously at least curiously to me I am less high than I was for the milk chocolate I definitely am less high than I was that the less high five bar not dramatically so not the golf isn't extreme but I am noticeably less high I'd say I'm maybe four right now which is not as high as I was hoping to be I was hoping I was gonna be as high as the last one but that's just not the case so maybe their chocolate isn't super consistent I don't know yet we will experiment some more with high five but I I would say for sure I definitely feel less high than I did the first time just look at my eyeballs why does snow not that's a perfect metric by any measure but you know in a pinch it'll work so this time it was a little bit of a disappointment for hi-fi uh yeah I was I was expecting more so they got pinged a little bit for that I'm sure just four diminished or four reduced expectations but I'm human so I'm fallible I still don't hate it I still like the way it tasted and it's still and I'm still kind of high so you know it's not a complete loss and it was it was 15 bucks so it's not the most expensive chocolate bar edible it's just this is no longer in the same ballpark as like a Akiva bar this is this is out of that contention out of that conversation now well guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on a later of you piece spec pack through our why is my tongue blue Oh brisk that's why bye guys", "s1271Tn7Blc": "[Music] that's right you see what's up the booze is out and there's some candy here so what's the EJ gonna do he's gonna make some drunken ass gummy bears today that's right you know if I'm making some candy or a tree for a party you know what's got boobs involved in it that's right that's how we roll around here at DJ's brew to making the alcoholic fun well yeah anyways so we're gonna make some drunken gummy bears today or also I guess you could call them vodka infused gummy bears how are we gonna do this well we're gonna buy some gummy bears first here we've got a bag of gummy bears we've opened what type of gummy bears do you want to get you can't want to get ones that are clear there's some that are out there that aren't clear now they have less gelatin in them so they stay hard also I found that the harrybo brand of gummy bears are too hard also they are really dense and dry and it takes them a long time to diffuse like probably five days plus if you buy the ones that are super soft gummy bears they call them nowadays they won't hold up to the vodkas so just by everyday plain old dollar store type gummy bears not harrybo brand get ones you like to taste up because that's what it's gonna taste like when you're slamming it down anyways real easy we got like I said our gummy bears are gonna 5 ounce bag here and we've got a bottle of vodka mm-hmm and we have two mason jars what are we gonna do we're gonna put the bears into the mason jars top them off with vodka close it and let them sit for two days so we've got a real you know complex process here we've got our bag and our jar these have been sanitized already I like mason jars why well if you put them in a bowl what you can do the problem with that is you can't shake them okay or if you can't shake them it gets all over the place it or if you have to stir them sometimes it disturbs and breaks the gummy bears okay so here we have our two mason jars nice and sanitized and ready to go okay we've got our vodka we want to cover them with vodka inside the jar get them all happy this how we're going to get drunken gummy bears I've swirled them here we go let him go for a little bit of a swim I'm gonna go over the top oh I have to get some more vodka soon what a shame I have to go to the liquor store and shop for booze I hate that anyway so we have our jars here and each one has about an equal amount there over the top with vodka we're about a cup of vodka I think there's a little few more gummy bears in this one but anyways we've used about a cup total of vodka here real easy you can use any vodka you know what abused really cheap vodka sometimes you can taste that but you know what for the people who are gonna be drinking this and how you drink it it's not really for the taste is to get krump snell isn't it so we're gonna shake it let's be honest right give them a good shake boom and we're gonna let these sit for two days I'll be back after these guys get happy and they're getting their drink on now back in a flash hey guys forgot to mention one thing I know I didn't forget it because of all the drinking I do it's it's it's because I was so excited about this process anyways remember when yours letting me set for your two days you want to keep them in the refrigerator that'll help keep the gelatin together or while they're absorbing all this fun booze and you want to give them a little bit of shake now and again over the two day period so I'll see you in two days we'll be back and we're going to be having some fun with some big-ass gummies that are all full of smelly [Music] two days pass and as you can see here our gummies have drunk enough all that lovely vodka so now we have drunken gummies or fun alcoholic gummies that's right they've consumed all the vodka they've over doubled in size in the two days this particular brand seems to be doing really well in this real absorbent my tasted one of them and they're a little bit boozy so you say DJ what do you do if they're a little bit boozy and it all depends different gummies will taste sweeter than others because you know every mix and everything is a little bit different so I'm gonna reserve this one jar that has the last gummies in it and I think that some people will maybe like to taste that vodka and alcohol a little bit and some people won't so what do we do to counteract that we get some kool-aid concentrate here it's these little squirt bottles you can support this into your sports bottle make a quick bottle of sugar-free kool-aid or you can use it which it's real purpose is probably to put it into our gummies and we're gonna give them a little bit of kool-aid flavor and I'm gonna taste one of these here just in case for scientific purposes only and also to show you how much bigger that gummy is now he's really growing in size you can let me see I guess you can see them on the camera here I don't want to tip off but this is a green one let's see how it tastes hmm I still got that lime flavor when you chew it and eat it it has a consistency of jell-o now so I know these are just right it's got that vodka edge to it I know some of the ladies at the party aren't gonna like that vodka edge that's really who's gonna be eating these ladies and some of guys I want to get there quick crunk on so I'm gonna shake this up and this stuff's pretty powerful so you don't need a lot of it we're gonna put one two three four squirts in there that's it now alternately if you don't have this you can use concentrate for making like like fruit punch you know frozen concentrates it's just all it's basically the same kind of thing but this is a lot easier and we're gonna shake these up or but our gummies are bleeding now you can see all that alcohol and lovely booze and the sugar that's rendered out the gummies is sticking to the inside there so we're gonna let this get happy for another day I'll be back in another day it'll seem like a second for you but we'll have these four side-by-side comparison and we'll show you what they look like after they've absorbed some of this kool-aid concentrate and I'll tell you have to taste it hey guys I'm back you can see we got our two jars of gummies here one with concentrate for 24 hours and one without that have been still sitting happy in their liquid of happiness aka vodka and as you can see in the jars there's not too much liquid left but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna strain them out in with this little wire strainer here into our measuring cup and we'll show you how much rendered liquid is left leftover and I'll be back [Music] okay we're all done straining there are dummies out and look at what we've got here we've got two full bowls of our dummies we've got our ones that are flavored with the cherry kool-aid concentrate here on the on my right and we've got one without on the left now there looks like there's more in this bowl because there's more total gummies but they're all about the same size Dave mmm well more than doubled in size close to tripled and I think these ones here on the right with the concentrate maybe a little bigger because I have more vodka in the in the jar with those but if you take a look here on my measuring cup I've got a full math probably bout a quarter cup left now it's probably not all volume that's been generated by vodka because there's a little probably like gelatin like I don't know runoff from the gummies in there but that means these have absorbed probably a cup and a quarter of vodka into these guys so we've nearly tripled their size we've put all that lovely vodka in there and we flavor this and you say DJ what are those flavor Woods tastes like so got my spoon here let's show you what one of these guys look like I think this one was clear or orange in the beginning you can take a look at him or her whatever the case may be I think it's neuter in gummy bear land but let's see what these taste like oh yeah the flavored ones are super dangerous guys that kool-aid kool-aid concentrate really takes the edge off the vodka you can still tell us there because he'll they nearly tripled their size with vodka so you're gonna taste a little bit of boost but you could down a couple those and get blasted in a hurry and that's what little treats like this are for at a party when you're having a fun party but remember when you're enjoying this stuff you got to enjoy responsibility and if you got a guess that you're giving these two you also need to be good to them too and make sure they're not driving and being tanked up going home when they're paddling some of these buildings wow you can feel the warming going down on these guys but the way you take these the part of the way I like to take them apart is you take your jar here we'll clean this out before we do so and I like to take them in this jar here because it's got so that like moonshine look to it and it kind of makes them cool so you see we got real easy steps to make these dangerous little treat real tasty and if you've got folks that don't like that alcohol edge we know heading out how to take that alcohol edge off of these gummies and you can get your party on so guys thanks a million for watching I appreciate each and every one of you until the next DJ brew tube I guess this is kind of a mixed drink how-to I still haven't figured it out well maybe party libation how to or maybe it's not a libation because that means you're drinking um I don't know until the next ev32 thanks a million for watching and that's a big ass [Music]", "s2uMiUapn_M": "hey everyone awesomer kids here and today we'll be making huge gummy bear jello treats it's really easy to make and not to mention super delicious let's get started first we'll leave one and a half cups of cold water next we'll add 255 grams of whichever flavored jello you'd like I'll be using strawberry first I'll add in this packet of 170 grams [Music] and now I'll add this smaller packet of 85 grams now we'll give this a nice mix [Music] oops this measuring cup is about to overflow let's move it over to the pot alright I'll pour it right in over here and now we'll need six package of unflavored gelatin I'll pour two at a time so here's two four and six now we want to make sure we get this a very thorough mix until all the powder completely dissolves this may take a couple minutes so please be patient after a couple of minutes your gummy syrup should look something like you this now we'll put it on low heat for a few minutes after heating our candy syrup for a few minutes we could transfer it over to our huge gummy bear jello mold let's start filling our mold oh I bought this bowl on Amazon in case you were wondering whoa we got pretty close to the top now I'll leave this in the refrigerator for a few hours to let it solidify keep wait for a gummy candy and we're back our gummy candy looks nice and solid I'll begin pushing down around all the edges to loosen our gummy bear from the mold and now from the corner I'll begin carefully pulling our gummybear out let's slip this mold over and almost almost it's out wow look how huge this gummy bear is and it smells like really yummy strawberry candy the details from the mold look great too I went ahead and made a blue raspberry gummy bear and green lime gummy bear too so let's get these out of the mold oh my gosh these things are awesome so much gummi candy and I'm gonna go sugar crazy if I eat all of these alright the moment we've all been waiting for time for a taste test since these gummies are so huge I'm gonna cut off a smaller piece to eat okay let's give this a taste Wow this guy a bear is delicious tastes just like a strawberry gummy candy let's cut this gummy bear into smaller pieces so I could share with you all this may take a few moments so just sit back and relax [Music] if I couldn't eat with after cutting that many pieces there's still so much gummy bear left can't believe I have to bore these things okay so I know what you're thinking it's kind of boring doing a taste test by cutting it into smaller pieces so should I just take a huge bite out of only these gummy bears yes okay you convinced me here I go oh [Music] then this guy a bear is delicious too I may have gone a little overboard with that bite but I have no regrets it's so yummy well this is so fun easy and delicious to make hope you guys enjoyed this video see you next time [Music] you you", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't

and i'm gonna be talking about this product today these are purna women's vitamin gummy bears so apparently uh the diet that we consume doesn't exactly include all essential vitamins that are required for your body especially as women we miss out on a lot of those and pure gummy bears are basically these really delicious and cute gummies they are gluten free and uh you get like one box of this so basically this one bottle contains a month supply that are 30 gummy bears you're supposed to take one each day to them and then swallow these so i did not have any specific medical condition before consuming these and i didn't have any deficiency so if you are going to consume these for that i can't really say how it's going to work out but my honest review um didn't drastically change anything in my life but again uh as i said a lot of our diets don't include a lot of vitamins and uh essentials that are supposed to be taken and this is a good way to consume those and it's a very delicious and easy way", "T6cQPOrVvdM": "what's up YouTube welcome to guava juice this is my laboratory where safety is number one priority today we're gonna do an experiment I have here the world's largest gummy bear I mean look at that that's huge like look at this it says here 5 pounds right over there that's one have you bear today we're gonna see what happens when we boil this gummy bear who knows I might eat it hey first things first we have to unbox is gummy bear to see how ridiculous this looks I mean look at this this is the size of my hand look at this red delicious bear that's screaming cavity I will give you cavities come here boy ok so we have the gummy bear right here we have the pot and we have the stove so we want to put this on super hot and now we wait and see what happens next as you can see it's only been three minutes and the bear is starting to melt look at this hmm don't feel bad it's just candy it's just a whole bunch of sugar with a red food coloring I apologize for the graininess in advance because I accidentally set the ISO to 40,000 that's right 40,000 anyways five minutes has passed and this is what it looks like I mean we still see a little bit of the body but it's mostly mostly mostly boiling off of the body eight minutes have passed you see a little bit of the body still and it's still the same a little bit of boiling yeah eleven minutes have passed it's starting to look like the kool-aid man just took a poop and it's looking little wishy fifteen minutes it looks like the kool-aid man accidentally pooped his heart look at that that's kind of gross this boiling gummy thing is looking really gross right now finally realized the ISO was set to 40,000 so I set it back to regular and the gummy bear is looking like a brain I got bored during this time so I decided to be a good idea to put a banana in there interesting enough it looked pretty cool look at this it's like a gummy banana pretty gross I wouldn't eat it but it looks pretty dope I was still bored so I decided to put a lemon in there too hey unfortunately the little was from the gummy popped in my hand and hurts so bad I hate you I hate after six minutes of leaving the gummi coat on the fruits this is the result it was super sticky felt like bubblegum it smell like bubblegum and look like bubblegum and the gummy bear itself looked like it just drowns in lava I mean look at this there's no way who could have survived that look at that just looks like straight-up chocolate poop after 41 minutes I decided it was time to take this thing out because the whole house smelt like smoke like I was so scared this thing would light on fire I mean look at this it looks like a volcano waiting to erupt except it's a gummy volcano I have a confession to make the microphone was off the whole video so I lip-sync the whole video if you couldn't tell us so bear with me as I try to lip-sync this look at this look how sticky and hard and dark this thing is this is ridiculous it's basically burnt sugar like sugar that is burnt think about the next time you eat your next gummy bear or gummy worm or gummy octopus or gummy peach or gummy watermelon origami shark or gummy gummies so now it's time to see what it tastes like here we go mmm Bon Appetit mmm mmm oh it's hot it's hot my tongue oh oh it's hot it's hot oh my gosh yeah yeah Oh oh my gosh look how hard it is it became super solid all of a sudden what the heck look at this look at that oh my gosh this thing just fell off instantly Wow Wow ahh oh that is ridiculous Wow okay let's try this again just want to make sure it does the same thing alright let's do this alright how's my lip sticking guys is it doing well I hope I hope so anyways oh my gosh this thing okay I'm gonna put it in my mouth one more time let's see if it does the same thing okay here we go Bon Appetit oh my gosh boy Joel Oh oh my gosh look at this look at this it's hard again it's freaking solid that is ridiculous Wow this is insane so dudes never eat boiled gummy bear because look at this if you think about it really closely look at what you're putting in your system every time you eat a gummy bear that is what you're putting in your system so think about the next time you eat it will you eat it because I will yeah piece ah dudes by", "-Yi_AktzXhw": "guys welcome back to the vlog hey no don't give it away yet so today is a very exciting day because as you guys probably saw in Nathan's video he posted a couple days ago he did this crazy gummy bear and gummy worm like unwrapping whatever and we didn't want to throw away all the stuff so we were like let's just destroy it instead of throwing it away so we're gonna be doing some ridiculous things like catching it on fire putting a machete to it seeing how that works and lots of other extremely ridiculous things that aren't necessary but are extremely cool and we're gonna do it anyways so uh I haven't shown you all the gummy bear yet so this is the poor guy that will be tortured today just to give you a size reference and I've got a pretty fat head if that gives you anything how excited are you I'm yeah okay guys so look at all the stuff that we have so we have machete a bat will show you guys what that's for later and wrote those another yeah and a blowtorch you'll guys find out why we have that later we got some colored flames oh I thought it was pretty cool so I don't know how that's gonna change the color of your fire okay and some lighter fluid yellow also figure out what we're using that for so there we go withouta oh yeah of course gotta have the GoPro but um I guess without further ado we're gonna get this show on the road so after debating we've decided to set it on fire first cuz I think that'll be the least damaging because if we start off with the most damaging it's gonna be a quite a short video but he's all set up and ready I'm gonna soak them in lighter fluid maybe that'll help him catch on fire a little easier I've never tried to catch a gummy bear on fire before but um I don't think gelatin is very flammable so we're gonna have to douse um and some lighter fluid all right guys so I'm gonna use this as the lighting tool because you're insane if you think I'm just gonna stick my hand up to this lighter fluid soaked gummy bear and box so um I'm really scared I'm not gonna lie because I have no idea how this is going to go and worst gets the worst mail a kinda I want to get the flame down in his belly but I don't want to like touch it hey let's try and light the box on fire all right let's see what that does like I said don't try this at home please wait we should try that colored a fire thing oh it smells like a roasted gummy bears I'm scared I kind of want to put him out I don't want to get like a home complaint of like burning our house down I don't know so we move on to the next thing what do you think it's getting a little out of control okay okay he's literally boiling look at the side oh look at his butt oh no he's boiling into the box oh no that poor gummy bear you got it well then he's not even like barely damaged he's melted to the box well it's not hot at all huh well the neighbors probably thought that we were roasting marshmallows but little did they know we just said a giant gummy bear on fire oh it's still boiling over here look you can see the little bubbles I can like feel the heat coming off of him he's got a little stomach full of a lighter fluid and water yeah I don't want it to be like super hot no I think he's fine is that okay yeah the wait for it to cool off I guess all right guys so now that we have set this gummy bear on fire this poor little buddy and his belly's full of lighter fluid I've put the Oh God I've put these gloves on for that exact reason because I don't want to get my hands all nasty I'm about to climb up on that ladder to go up to that roof and climb all the way across and then drop it down on the concrete so um I guess the best thing to say is cross my fingers I don't fall off we'll see like I said this is why I work gloves it's making it a little difficult but this gummy bear has melted so much oh God but that over the oh I don't know how I feel about the smell it's like marshmallow mixed with extreme sugar content so Nathan's gonna hand that to me that's here and I'm gonna climb up over here on this ladder and he's gonna try and hand it to me while I'm climbing up there do this alright guys well that did not work at all because we've tried every single point you see this and you see all that extra room it's just not happening our roof is too tall and we have too small of a lapper and it's just not happening so I guess I put the gloves on for nothing I'm a little sad about it but um I think instead what we're gonna do is beat it with a bat these bar gummy bears bout to have his last like I've never played baseball but I'm sure hitting this will be crazy okay just don't listen to the concrete [Laughter] I feel like I need to sit him up first so give me at least okay okay he's literally absorbed my glove okay feel like this is some sort of quicksand okay just kidding okay okay gross first off we're gonna have such a mess to clean up hey you're the one who wanted to set him on fire so for a reason but he he went off the box he wasn't supposed to okay now he's sticking to that part anyway you put him he's mix two against this buddy just do that alright now let's actually do this I don't know how but I guess it's time for a new Apple watch swing swing better better better better better swing breaking it all like doing nothing literally nothing like wow it doesn't even look like touch them just literally nothing let me show you the damage that this gummy bear has taken and by damage I mean practically perfect conditions I mean other than him being completely burnt and melted but yeah well you know what I mean he basically I mean it's a bunch of jelly I mean like I don't I don't know what to do um just absorbs all of it actually I got a pretty good idea I know basically what we're doing is heating this knife or should I say machete so hot that we're going to just slice through the gummy bear so I'm hopefully this smells really bad and so I feel like I'm burning it too much so I kind of want to test it out I'm gonna keep the flame on there as we walk over there but let's see if this actually slices something moment of truth come on this side so you guys can see I guess I'll just slice through his face just try like a spear actually no slices here yeah that's a good idea all right you guys ready yep good yeah oh I literally put his ear off that was pretty cool okay victory that is victory tell me the machete Queen we have beaten the gummy bear we have set him on fire we have cuts his ear off with a machete we tried to drop him off of a roof but I couldn't get up there so we spared him on that one but I think it's really time to finish him it's starting to sprinkle so we got to hurry up and destroy this thing this is his official grave this is it his official grave and I'm just gonna blow torch his face off so leave a like if you think that's a good idea go ahead all right three two one oh that was anti-climatic let's try that again three two one literally sizzling it's boiling on the spot let's see what happens when I just keep it in one spot but in one spot for like a minute or two it smells like marshmallows I know that's a campfire who knew um alright well even with a blowtorch it's gonna take like hours of doing that uh it it barely even did anything like it looked like it was actually doing something like let me use this glove actually that's probably gonna be really hot but I sat on that one same spot and it like didn't even do anything so I don't even think there's enough like gas in this blowtorch to be able to do anything to his actual face so um gummy bears are indestructible I think that's the conclusion here even though he is pretty messed up like it's still a gummy bear you can still tell it's counter he's missing an ear but it's still a gummy bear so yeah alright guys so like I said lesson learned is that gummy bears are indestructible even if you chop off an ear and you set it on fire douse it in lighter fluid and beat it with a bat so that's that's just about it I don't know what else is left to do except to I don't even know maybe like blow it up with an actual like bomb or something I don't know but obviously that's not going to happen but I'm gonna go ahead and say that this is going to wrap up the vlog and I want to thank you guys for watching and if you liked this make sure to give it a thumbs up and subscribe to see more upcoming ridiculous vlogs like this one I want to make sure that you guys understand do not try anything that I did in this video please because it wasn't a good idea for me to do it so it's not a good idea for you to do it but anyways I want to thank you guys for watching and I'll see you guys here in another vlog", "m--6ifZXy5k": "so here's what's gonna happen as some of you know famously a specific brand of sugar-free gummy bears on amazon have the strange ability to be both tasty and one of the most potent laxatives available on the market i am going to be creating a challenge and i have here a huge bag of sugar-free gummy bears we are going to eat a small amount and every 20 minutes that i don't [ __ ] myself we will be adding more until i cannot hold it any longer i am of the belief that this is all bark and no bite and that this [ __ ] will not actually [ __ ] me up i have done some prep in advance i've had to poop all day for lunch today i only had a cheesy crunch chalupa from taco bell i will be drinking from this point on only frappuccinos iced from starbucks we are going to start the counter right now it is with great honor and pride that i give you my worst possibly best work the diarrhea gauntlet we're starting the timer right when i swallow

so here is my only drink i'm allowed to have now that is good that is good people are saying only 10 resident sleeper let me respond to that we're going to do more than 10. i have been told that these will [ __ ] you up with just a small amount i think it is [ __ ] how many are you the people who are sleeping on 10 give me a number what's the number to beat because if you're gonna say eat 500 of them i'm gonna say yeah i could eat 500 twix bars and i'm sure i'd be barfing into my like that's not the that defeats the purp 20 all right chat we'll start this with 20 then all right i have one two

put 20 down you guys are like only 20. okay what do you need to tell me alex um i read online about the gummy bears okay people said that you should that 15 will be good enough and 20 would be more than that so don't i don't think you should keep eating them more than 20. what i already ate i know so i don't think you should keep eating more did you did you research this at all i'm sorry i thought this was america but what if it doesn't oh i already feel a little grumbling all right i'm gonna keep it rohana with you guys we are 11 minutes in i am already feeling not hot i already am

half hour i started feeling weird oh no look at the timer i'm feeling the way i would describe the way i'm feeling right now is i would not go out if i was invited somewhere at this point i feel a storm coming all that matters right now is that clock keeps ticking there is a warning on the package that reads consumption of sugar-free candies may cause stomach discomfort and or laxative effect individual tolerance will vary if this is the first time you've tried these candies we recommend beginning with one fourth of a serving size or less this guy's making me confident that i have nothing to worry about so i'm gonna eat three more just to make it just to make it an even 30. there's nothing honestly if this guy can eat a whole bag well maybe even 30. i shouldn't have done that all right let's see let's maybe your guys's media share will make me laugh right as you can tell by the video this video is all about poo and how to hold in your poo when they didn't even get to it okay i'm i'm

a seat thank you guys for joining me in the first ever diarrhea gauntlet shouts out to the highlight channel take it easy guys you", "vAd2MnnDEn4": "hey guys welcome back to our channel if you're new here I am Judith and today's video I am going to be eating a hundred milligram edible for you guys I did get this on 4/20 and I am barely going to eat it with you guys just because I don't know it's been in the fridge it's been getting cold and I thought why not do it today today is my day off so your grocery and yeah so I'm gonna consume this a hundred milligram edible for you guys and see what it does to me I am a huge smoker so I don't know if it would hit me as much but honestly it probably will because edibles hit different than smoking like honestly honestly if you eat edibles they will hit like major but yeah so I'm gonna eat this for you guys hopefully I don't feel like I'm dying and then from there who knows this video will probably be a short vlog and yeah I'm just gonna go about my day on an edible and see the effects of what happens so let me set the camera for you guys and then open this oh so I am in my little sister's room I am at my mom's house and yeah there's nowhere else I'd rather take a hundred milligram edible than my mom's because if I freaked out which I probably won't but if I freaked out my sisters are here and my mom is here and everybody is here so if your girl feels like she's dying everybody is here hominy yeah yeah so let me set this camera up for you guys and then let's do it okay you guys I'm so mad at myself because I literally broke the freaking edible and I didn't want to do that I wanted to show you guys exactly what it looked like and your girl is just not paying attention if you guys have ever tried these let me know in the comments down below and what you guys thought about them so I've tried these before they were good and let's do this again so here we go I'm gonna break this seal for you guys know it's childproof it's childproof you guys it doesn't even have a little cut for you to follow do you have scissors money so you legit might need a knife or some scissors to open the packaging which is always good that's like an a-plus because if you have kids or you have little adults around you don't want them to easily access these things because yeah Oh Jax is sad he's crying outside right now but I don't want him inside because he's just gonna he's just gonna bark and do odd things possible but he's sad because jenna so just dipped or she went somewhere I'm not sure but okay so I went ahead and cut it open I'm sorry my nails are a little rough right now one is really bitten your girl has been super anxious and nervous and if you know me you just have a lot of anxiety sometimes and believe it or not I get and I get anxiety attacks and it's just a struggle you guys so if you guys know what they feel like or you guys are also going through the same thing I hope that you guys are doing everything possible to just stay calm and everything is gonna be fine you guys I always try to remind myself that but anyways it smells so good these are dark mint chocolate bars and they legit smell like dark mint chocolate they really do you guys let me push them it to the front they literally broke it in there I am so upset with myself but they still looks so good okay let's do it I'm gonna eat the whole bar you guys so let's do this they are look look at how they're packaging for their chocolate is like go ahead and hold that for you guys look at that it literally tells you the milligram of each little bar that is crazy I don't even remember eating the other one and I don't remember being this excited about having the milligrams on the bar I don't know I guess yes yes if you guys how do you say it um if you guys are dosing or how would you say I money you just oh yeah mone is smart she okay so if you are micro dosing and you are a big believer or a big person who does micro seeing these are exactly what you need but let's do this image it tastes like dark chocolate man mm sorry 20 milligrams yeah 820 milligrams right there let's go ahead and eat oh my god I'm such an idiot you guys and you guys are not telling me so apparently it doesn't give you the milligrams on here I just assumed that they did but no it doesn't it actually says THC on the bar d\u00f6 oh my god I'm either dumb or I'm blind you guys I'm so dumb but it does say THC on them on the packaging and lets you know that each bar is 10 milligrams so I just assumed that that's what it was on that's what was written on the bar but you know what it's still cool it still lets you know how many milligrams each little bar is and honestly dude the reason why I like these is because ok 30 more milligrams and then it's 50 milligrams total and you can't argue with that [Applause] and I got this one this one didn't break yeah so this one didn't break you guys and 15 milligrams for this little bit is yes yes I love edibles that are tiny but they pack so much like a little brownie that's 100 milligrams like thighs the best because you don't have to eat as much like it legit gets to the point it's not like you have to eat 50 cupcakes to get 100 milligrams like no I love that they high dose these things so that you can eat less of it but get more of a punch like those are my favorite edibles look 20 more milligrams what is that now 70 milligrams oh my god I'm freaking myself out honey you're gonna be here with me okay my sister said if I feel like I'm dying she's gonna be here with me you're gonna remind me that I'm not dying she was gonna remind me I'm not dying guys honestly I can always have I can always be having a bad day but once I get on camera for you guys and I talk to you guys I just make a difference I do feel better I do feel the best I could be sometimes but yeah like I really like being here with you guys you guys motivate me of course I do want to do big things when I'm older I hope you guys stay to see what the [ __ ] that J and J twins are gonna do in the future my sister has a boyfriend and they're hella cute you guys so shout out to all the couples out there especially my sister's relationship because he is so nice you guys like so next so nice oh hi there any more milligrams and that's gonna be a total of 100 milligrams you guys so recently hmm yeah I would buy these again mm-hmm yes mm-hmm so recently I took half a tab with Hubert he took the pool tab you guys I don't know I don't know people could do the most and still survive but me knowing I'm gonna take a full time I know that it's gonna be full-blown everything like everything I'm gonna see God I'm gonna see [ __ ] mythological things everything so I took half a tab right you guys I swear I couldn't stop laughing like I was trying I was trying so hard to keep it together because like I wouldn't look at Hubert and I was just like in my mind it was so funny like to even look at him was so funny like I didn't know I didn't know why looking at him was so funny and while I was doing that I was applying to new things so that I can get my life together and go find better things so I was on my laptop like the laptop looked cool whatever but then I started to realize oh my god oh my god it's hitting like my half tab is hitting and that's why I only take half a tab Jax our guard dog our long-haired dachshund or jealous long-haired dachshund even after the tab was over and we woke up the next morning I even asked him I was I asked him how his tab fell and if he felt it and he said smack - smack but yeah I am my my half tops max I didn't think it was going through because I've never had great oh my god looks so young with short hair so I never like I never really have good experiences with papertabs usually jalisa gets us gel tabs and those are the ones that really really like always boom like and these paper tabs one time we took them and they just it didn't work out so yeah lesson learned gels are my favorite my point is don't be afraid to microdose don't ever feel like you have to eat the whole edible or take the whole tab like no I even take quarter tabs and I feel good I feel like I could take a quarter tab and go throughout my day or take a quarter tab and drink and have a good time so everything is possible you guys don't hurt yourselves but I will come back check up with you guys and see when this hits so I'll make sure to time this for you guys let me check and you're gonna wash my hands because I do not want to lick my fingers so it is currently 138 I will come back whenever these shit's hit which will be in like 30 minutes hopefully or maybe an hour who knows no one ever knows um yeah and I'll check up with you guys and see you later my dude shoutout to jealous because she is hooking it up with some boiling crab but yes but yes okay so it's been like 45 minutes okay you guys so it's 229 now and oh my gosh that's so weird why is it doing that anyways so it's 2:30 you guys and I am pretty faded I don't know what that means that's so weird oh it's doing it's like something the camera can see but not us okay guys so the edibles definitely hit you guys I was watching a really good movie right now called private life it's called private life and I was crying you guys I can't stop oh my gosh this edible is definitely hitting I was watching this movie called private life and if you haven't watched it you guys need to watch this movie like the movie is so it's real and I like that so yeah the edibles this is like 45 minutes after or 15 minutes after so like about an hour it took me to really get the feeling like I am super faded right now you guys like I'm just like deeply in movies right now if you guys want something that's gonna hit you guys should definitely get some wounds and if you like the mint flavor with chocolate this is definitely that so yeah thanks for watching and I will see you guys in the next video", "yJQizqVTs5I": "all right here are the gummy bears in three different flavors and I'm gonna show you how to make these hi everybody today I'm going to show you how to make gummy bears make with these cute little gummy bear trays I got these off of ebay and I'll leave you the link below it comes with even this little dropper so you can put it in there easy we're gonna make three different flavors so the first one we're gonna make is blueberry wait 1/2 a cup of blueberry puree I just warm them up a little bit some frozen berries and then I blended them in my blender and it makes perfect PRA like this okay so we're gonna warm up in a saucepan the blueberry puree 1/2 cup and you add 1/2 a cup of water and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice so I was just gonna blend this up and then we're gonna add the honey when you need 2 tablespoons of the honey like that we're just gonna melt this together really nice and then we're gonna add the gelatin right now I need to add the 3 tablespoons of gelatin and just kind of spread it around so it doesn't clump up in a spot okay just mix that up until it gets kind of glossy and all the Delta mix is off okay this one looks ready okay now we're gonna make an orange juice flavor orange one so we're gonna use a cup of orange juice and one tablespoon of lemon juice and two tablespoons of honey and stir that up and now we're going to add the gelatin again three tablespoons of gelatin and stir that up till it's dissolved and it's nicely coat it together and it should look a little bit glossy so just cook it up for a little bit okay that one's ready now we're gonna do the last flavor we have strawberry all right we put the strawberries puree in there half a cup of water a tablespoon of lemon juice and again two tablespoons of honey okay on three tablespoons of gelatin that's it stir it up really good let it cook up to dissolve all the way okay that's it now I let the three flavors cool down okay I've got my trays ready I put them on top of cookie sheets so they won't be so floppy because we're gonna put them in the freezer so I'll just go ahead and fill up your flavors here I'm going to start with the orange one and I did not strain the pulp out of my oranges so we'll still have that in the gummy bears so if you want to strain yours that's fine but I did not okay now we're gonna do this strawberry too much okay okay now we're gonna do the blueberry okay if you don't have a gummy bear molds you can use any kind of pan as long as you line it I got it's a wax paper and then I'll the wax paper you can pour it in there and then once they are cooled you can pop them out I'm just have so much left over I'm just gonna mix them together kind of make like a mixed berry now what we're gonna do is we're gonna put all these in the freezer and they have to freeze for about 30 minutes now if you didn't have a mold and you did it like this just let it freeze first and you could chop them up into whatever shape you want or if you have the molds that's fine you just pop them in just like this and the cookie sheet or if you don't have those molds you could use any kind of silicon molds that you have I have these ones silicones and I have these ice cubes I only have the silicone on the bottom I can't really show you now has silicone on the bottom so that they'll pop out so any one of these methods will work if you want to just try it ahead of time you don't have the gummy bear molds this you can try it like this and these I got on eBay like I said they were eight dollars and I'll leave the link in the description down below if you want to check these out they're totally a good buy so I these I got 200 gummy bears for seven dollars so that's pretty good and I came with their droppers okay so now we're just gonna put them in the freezer like this for 30 minutes and this is how they turned out we got the Stars and the leaves in strawberry and the blueberry flavor and these are the gummi bears whole pile of them here they're really small cute perfect size little gummies and then these are the ones that we had on the tree cuz we didn't have any cut out and I just cut them into cubes shape I'm they're perfect - they're really nice you could try any one of the shapes or if you have something else go ahead and try it and our favorite flavor was these strawberry ones here so let's you try it and tell me which flavor you guys like and like subscribe", "1E5---nUtTM": "I don't know I mean how hot can it beat one gummy bears a good also bid army welcome back or if this your first time watching the channel and you love watching Harry doozy on this occasion pure Hellfire synthesized into a tiny little bite-sized piece of food then you're in the right place so think about subscribing but today we are doing the today we're doing the little nitro world's hottest gummy bear now this thing clocks in nine million scovilles which is not the hottest thing I've ever eaten but it's not enough that has got me very worried that means it's 900 times hotter than a jalapeno I'm like three times hotter than police pepper spray and I'm three for three now on spicy challenges I successfully finished the one ship challenge the Death Note and the world's hot chocolate bar but I failed the tuatara which was 30 million scovilles almost call an ambulance the toe of satan and the chicken wings britain's hot chicken wings from a couple of weeks ago so i'm hoping to make it four out of seven today which means i'm more successful than unsuccessful but as most you know by now I really hate spicy food I actually got this from a very kind subscriber it came in a big care package full of stuff but I've gone back to our messages and I can't find out the name of the person that sent this to me but if you did send us me it really means the world to me just hopefully I don't die and we don't get your honor manslaughter charges but um yeah the rules of this thing are two minutes in your mouth and then after you've swallowed it's five minutes after boom that's always the tricky part for me so without further ado this is Benny's food and this is the world's hottest gummy bear challenge right so it's one single gummy bear shouldn't be this hard oh there we go right so far is not too bad you know they said you got to move around alpha he's got very very slowly you start to salivate more now oh I shall we will it's still there well the videos I've seen says don't chew it too much you don't wanna break it down before two minutes but now that's not it's not melting so my troops I can swallow after two minutes so it's hot hiccup results when you know if you hiccup it's like a million or so at least your alternate hook is long well why not this wins but both see around the mouth it's not true people won't believe that okay bro but I'll show it to the camera so OD milk me are these two day two days past its sell-by date it's really guess the roof of the mouth it's weird are different things some get you here some get you the throat this is a dry out of the roof yeah the book ready yet the milk ready why do you do this every time just getting ready please I feel like sucking Bartoli helps a bit in a weird way thank you I think it's kind of level it out this is looking secret it's really bright 22nd of September 24th today okay so I got to get to six minutes I think it's taper it off now let's stop like it got a little a little drip on the end of my schnoz didn't you see no camera you look a little bit yeah you look a little bit disappointed I think you expected more pain right I expected more pain thankfully we only have wood anymore stuff right so he finished that kind of was mostly around the roof of the mouth yeah I'm not I'm normally absolutely desperate for it or ice cream or something but get a little on single little face tingle not too not too much it ahead know what tastes good it's not lump it's fine it's it it says it's nine million I'm not sure if it's because of the way it's kind of made into the gummy bear it's nowhere near the toss it table sayin oh but the giant they're really giant gummy bear that'd be brutal we don't normally have whole milk goodness this is this is usually a skim a skimmed milk household so I've got a whole middle but yeah that's a pretty good if you want bragging rights I would say that's a good challenge to do because it's it says it's nine million scovilles but that wasn't quite as far as the one ship the wardship I found quite hard this is unpleasant but it's not I don't think you could do it most people that are you know don't make her enormous salts will probably find it quite difficult and quit but if you don't I mean I don't like spicy food at all and that's doable I'm okay no I'm not absolutely chug in the milk and asking for Ben and Gary sorry I didn't think that will be actually quite a lot more entertaining oh thanks for watching catch catch you at the next one [Music]",

hello everybody welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy mixed up scary overwhelming place you call your dispensary today good old-fashioned classic ass episode of wheats which means it is an edible review my favorite kind of review if we're being honest love me some edibles and one today that i've got uh high expectations for no pun intended uh it comes at a premium price and it comes from a relatively um experienced well-known player in the field but one uh one of these players that is known for their cartridges not their edibles but they are branching out and so who is that that is heavy hitters that's right guys we are taking a look at the gummies uh now out from heavy hitters uh those are the fine folks that make really really nice um premium thc cartridges we've reviewed a couple of them here on wheats like them quite a bit uh and now they are making their own gummies that they say are ultra potent um there are some curiosities with this here first of all it says that they are five 20 milligram pieces which is a hundred milligrams what it's supposed to be uh it's just another sort of indication of how [ __ ] up the labeling is and how nothing really matters with labeling um because technically it's supposed to be everything is supposed to be uh at most or minimum 10 doses of 10 milligrams but this says five 20 milligram pieces well but then they get away with it by showing you actually on the back uh that even though it says they're five uh 20 milligram pieces oh sorry it's right on the front it does say two 10 milligram servings per piece so it's kind of very disingenuous to advertise it that way but whatever um we do have everything we want to see on our packaging here nutrition facts lab testing results showing our 100 milligrams of thc um and uh ingredients all that great stuff i'm not sure i've ever heard of a agar agar before it's one of the ingredients uh this is the strawberry flavored it's free of all the things you would hope it would be free of your glutens your dairies and your nuts um so you know if any of those things need to be free for you this claims that it is free uh and as i said this is at a premium this is an expensive edible uh at the dispensary i go to the gummies usually range in the about 15 16 range this comes in at a premium for 20 bucks uh so the heavy hitter's name uh given a little extra premium on the price let's hope it's going to be a little bit premium on the product so uh let's go ahead and open it here does have some opening instructions on the back i find those always to be those pictograms that show you how to open these child proof uh bags are very bad i think um usually they're not too bad it's usually about actually the trick is opening the bag beneath the zipper as opposed to above the zipper is the trick for most of these originally you know you rip the zipper anyways what does it matter um i just think the iconography of those things is terrible so here we go here are our uh 20 milligram pieces excuse me are two 10 milligram pieces i guess it is nominally scored as such does smell like strawberry and of course like all of our wheats reviews the way we do it i'm going to do the entire product i'm going to eat all 20 not 20. all 100 milligrams of heavy hitters strawberry gummies uh and then about two hours after i have that last one i'll come back to you guys and let you know exactly how we're feeling let's go ahead and try our first of five right here for you hmm wow that is a tasty gummy that is a very tasty gummy i like the gummy a lot almost zero weed taste i mean i'm really looking for it there on the aftertaste not not much i mean that is a gummy i would be very happy to eat uh just uh out of boredom and anxiety like all gummy candies should be consumed but yeah that's that's that's great um a shockingly shockingly uh devoid of cannabis taste which you know hopefully is gonna be a huge positive if these get me as high as their ultra potent label suggests we shall see look that sugar off my fingertips well we're two-fifths of the way there i've got three more of these to go i'm not gonna gorge myself right now i'll have these over the next i usually like to do this over about the next half hour to hour or so and then two hours after that last one actually that is not 100 true um what i'm gonna be doing is doing these next three on a live stream with you guys as soon as i wrap up this first half of this review i'm gonna save these three i'm gonna be doing a live stream hanging out with you folks saying hi getting high with you and at the end of that live stream i'll come back and give you my wrap-up thoughts but that's just a little pitch to you guys let you know we do the live streams now and i hope you will join us for those in the future regardless if you do or not we will be back to tell you if these heavy hitters strawberry cannabis infused gummy are worth the heavy hitters premium price until then stay healthy and stay high my friends see you real soon bye-bye welcome back to weights everybody looks like a dog might be joining us welcome back tweets guys it's been about three hours a little over three hours since our journey started with the heavy hitters strawberry cannabis infused gummy and the dog is still coming in hello dog uh and i am very happy to say and especially if any of you had watched the live stream i did while enjoying this review these are quite good uh these are a premium product at a premium price but i gotta say they do land in that top tier uh echelon of gummy edibles i am very high i'm very pleased with my high uh quite impressive with these and that's not to even mention as a taste which um these are among the best tasting gummy edibles i've had especially for as potent as they are um really happy with it the only downside is that price uh these are more affordable or excuse me more expensive rather than most of the gummy edibles out there uh but you know i i uh some of it may be just uh some psychology of uh wanting it to be more expensive more potent because it's more expensive but if you hear me rambling it seems like it may actually work i don't know might be more than just psychological tricks i really enjoyed it really enjoyed it heavy hitters strawberry hundred milligram gummies can i get a big old thumbs up from me if you can find it and if it's not that much more give them a shot for sure so speaking of premium products uh i want to share with you guys a little cherry on top a little something extra that you can enjoy that's not necessarily weed related that's like let's do something a little premium we're going premium edible let's go premium cherry on top what does that mean i don't know that's kind of a dumb thing but what i do mean is go premium on something and really what i mean by that is get rid of ads on something hulu spotify apple music whatever it is that you use that has an ad subsidized version pay to get rid of ads ads are terrible they're the worst i don't think you even realize how hey you're on youtube pay for youtube premium get rid of ads eat [ __ ] the music stuff who gives a [ __ ] who gives about anything else just get rid of ads live your life with as few ads as possible it's not until you start to consciously remove advertisements from your life that you realize how pernicious and awful they are so this cherry on top is a premium service of your choice and this review is a premium product heavy hitters strawberry that tree on top was really abstract but you know what i mean pay for something you'll be happy you did and that guy's is going to do for this chair on top that's going to do it for this review that's going to do for everything here on wheats i thank you so much for watching as always stay high stay healthy and we'll see you guys on the next video were", "3XVZyth777w": "jumbo fella dreamers in today's video I am sharing with you how I make delicious and nutritious homemade gummy bears let's go hit it so for this recipe you're going to need a half of a cup of juice I'm actually making two recipes I'm going to do one that's orange and one that is lime and then you'll need a tablespoon and a half of unflavored gelatin this is my favorite gelatin if you're vegan agar agar would work just fine as well and then you'll need a tablespoon or two of sweetener depending on how sweet you want gummies so maple syrup honey sugar and then if you want a little extra zing to your gummies I actually like adding a drop or two of The Young Living vitality citrus oils but that's totally optional so first you're going to want to get a half of a cup of juice now for this it took me 2 and 1/2 limes and 3/4 of a large orange if you have juice that's pre-made in the refrigerator that's absolutely fine cherry juice pomegranate juice whatever you happen to have even lemon juice would be really good as well depending on how you know what flavor you want your gummies to be so just getting all of my juice squeezed out here and you can see how pretty that orange color is just so nice and then here is the lime juice as well so I'm just going to take one of my juices I'm going to start with the lime one and put it into a pan that's on medium heat and I'm going to add about a tablespoon and a half-ish of maple syrup and a tablespoon and a half of the unflavored gelatin I'm just going to add that to my pot as well and this is where a whisk comes in handy because this can tend to stick to the side of the pan so you really really want to mix it very very well you'll probably be mixing it for a solid minute or so now what you're looking for is for the liquid to kind of become an opaque sort of color and it should get slightly bubbly on top and you don't want to scorch it you don't want it boiling over just kind of keep an eye on it medium heat about a minute is pretty much all it takes so then once that done you want to add your vitality oils you can I meant to put one drop of lime and to came out but that's okay it's very limey and delicious so then I'm just going to pour it into my little jelly gummy molds here these were from the dollar spot at Target probably about five years ago or so but you can get these off of Amazon they actually have really cute ones now where you have gummy worms gummy bears all sorts of different shapes so explore Amazon so once they're filled into the jelly mould you just want to let it sit I'm going to do the same thing for my orange here as well you can let it sit on the counter to cool if you want to do that or if you're impatient like I am you can put it in the refrigerator for about a half hour if you're even more impatient you can put it in the freezer for about ten to fifteen minutes just until they are solid and then you just pop them out and that is it super easy to make healthy gummies that seriously the entire family will love just store them in the fridge and snack on them throughout the week ours only lasts a couple of days because they are just so delicious thank you guys so so much for hanging out with me today if you haven't already and you'd like to hit that button down below subscribe so you never miss a daily Dreamland video kiss someone you love today I'll see you all tomorrow ciao", "eCgLs3IYk0E": "[Music] and fries today I got my big mouth oh okay this is what a Big Mac looks like check it out it's not big enough we don't want the Big Mac fries look at them they're tiny I know I know go down master like when you guys know I need my good luck for my gummy videos let's try and a 200,000 thumbs up you've been killing it lately so I know let's get started so today I'm back with not only myself I know I'm the dummy god but I don't just Beth combine the camera so obviously we're gonna need some gelatin okay guys and you guys know I go hard on the gelatin so I got some gelatin bro are you serious am i serious about what - hey sugar flavor what it's a boy stuff this is possibly gonna be the biggest DIY I've ever done so basically you know I would explain everything I got but I don't know what the [ __ ] I'm doing so we're gonna figure out what we're doing as we go through the video basically what is in a Big Mac is there's bun meat lettuce pickles okay I'm not doing pickles but we got cheese more button more meat and fries so I got this mode for the top of the bun this mold for the bottom of the bun I got wolves for cheese I got wolves for tomato because you know you can't miss out on the tomato on a [ __ ] burger okay Big Mac I need to add tomatoes your burger you don't even like tomatoes I don't like tomato but everyone likes Tomatoes except for me I [ __ ] hate to me but I'd love to me exactly the Big Mac these Tomatoes we got molds for the patties we got moves for more patty we got molds for the middle one and we got normal for the lettuce and last but not least I got some primal picked up every [ __ ] morning all right this better be enough if not I'm really gonna be disappointed okay I don't want like in the story but you guys know how to make gelatin I don't know how to do it cuz I failed all my gelatin DIYs but Dustin knows how to make it so first step is to warm up what's first up water water big pot Brown cupboard that covers that cover right here okay I definitely lived in this house for a long time another one so everyone knows I'm the king of measuring on my channel obviously I always like to measure my stuff we're gonna measure half of a quarter of a Richter scale okay following along you're not I mean you gotta clean this bird but Richter scale measured me all you man circle shape and that's I'm pretty sure that just equals out to one of those folds now you need the hexagon oval oval shape and then just do it so let's fill it up guys and obviously you know what I'm filling it out there's this way you can do it but there's also this way so what I like to do is sometimes have a little fun with my camera mom just come in are you serious okay so we got one but it'd be the same technique with the second row this sprays too much mom come here for a second I need you to walk under this you don't want to come here so what you're boiling water guys it's a common misconception everybody think mom does wrong it off put it to medium-high and then to the little guys because we'd like to be productive on my channel in the meantime we are gonna be making this McDonald's fry box and my mom's actually gonna be making it I bought some [ __ ] marker to do the shading so mom when you can't make something yourself guys you got to get your arts and crafts mom basically if you want to make anything into the magic shape anybody watch Wizards of Waverly Place cuz I [ __ ] did I love that show okay I don't know if you guys know but Justin Bieber got his instagram back so you're gonna be like Justin Bieber got a finger back touch it in a [ __ ] turn into a fry box let's do this you do it I don't know what I'm doing recipe right yeah you gotta commit to it we'll do it together three two one Justin Bieber guts fry box just like that there's nothing over here you need to worry about nothing over my dad look we're gonna do the end on this box I know it looks better with an Emmy my mom drew this and that's definitely not this do the comparison this looks like Whoopi and this looks like a Ryan's reason not to mention it might not fit on the box guys the box is so blessed so let's go through the GI Bill I bet Raghu lon Eli beeline so as you guys can see the pot is steaming hot right now we're gonna put half the band in each pot like so and it's already starting to solidify oh we're supposed to whisk it this is the small way where's the biz Rick it's not apologetic you can never have too much gelatin I don't know if your science teacher told you otherwise they were wrong wolf he's always right [Music] now that the gelatin is a bit warm we're gonna put the sugar into so we're gonna use half of it in this one this is enough to give you instant diabetes so what is high laid everything out on the table guys we are gonna have to fill all of that up with do you like be alive heal I'm feeling the rest of the gelatin is going in this one and you have to whisk it right away otherwise it will get higher the amount of gelatin I got could feed six hundred families you know throw the bacon and we're gonna pour it into each of the mold so we're gonna start with the buttons tell me that doesn't smell yeah [ __ ] absolute [ __ ] okay we got the top button now the bottom button so now that the top and bottom funds are good we're gonna grab the middle one oh my god that's uncontrollable it's leaking every why is the price old brown so when you [ __ ] up guys don't worry we're recovering I did that on purpose guys I'm gonna teach you guys what happens when you [ __ ] up we're gonna pour this into this well just a nice yellow fry like so there we go so while that gelatin is cooking I'm just gonna add some food coloring in each thing fries need to be extra yellow so I'm putting a lot of yellow food coloring just to make sure they stay golden yellow crispy McDonald's fries you know how they are I also got a little bit of icing coloring but this stuff is super saturated super concentrated you don't want to use too much of this otherwise it'll turn oh I forgot to tell you about that your stained that's it no no no 100% staying for a week oh my god my fingers are now tinted yellow forever it's gonna put a little bit of that something okay guys we got the brown icing sugar I'm not saying my finger Brown I don't want you did you [ __ ] him wave your eyes it does not clean it we got to be very careful with the brown guys oh I said I'm talking about okay got my strawberry flavoring we're just gonna be flavoring the patty strawberries super strong yeah it's super strong okay so you use it all right tuberous Robbie said to crush me oh it's all gone okay so for the button we're gonna do a little bit of pure lemon extract apparently it's not sour I don't believe it that's heat units our boat holy [ __ ] that's bad next one we're preparing the lettuce the tomatoes and the cheese we're going to need our pan dusting can you take the top off for me please I like that nice and oily there can never be too much oil there as if you actually made that we're gonna be making the lettuce you want the legs to be nice and crinkly oh that's a good idea where he's pulling it through the door how is he still pulling it so like I was saying guys we're just gonna need about this bigger piece for this okay we need this lettuce shape number one BAM that's that romaine right there that's that good [ __ ] she's a little bit of orange oh that's nice that's what I'm talking well that's that expensive cheddar cheese that you get from the gums actually dogs are not about expensive stuff quality it's quality you know it's part to be pleased so for the tomatoes we have red food coloring and red icing color we're gonna use the food coloring because we don't want it to be too red three dots of that should be good enough those are nice tomatoes those are really nice no you would not so basically now all we have to do is leave all these to cool down for like the next eight to ten hours but I'm just gonna leave them overnight for a full day so I can make sure they solidified and I will be back when they freeze tomorrow all right guys day two we are back everything should be gummy let's go to the washroom and check it out as you can see you guys I told I'm gonna put a sign do not enter a gummy inside so that's how you know shit's important yeah so here's what we got it smells [ __ ] absolutely delicious actually let's see how one thing is that's [ __ ] gummy it doesn't even look fully gummy but that is way more successful than I thought so now what we're gonna do is bring everything out to the table and make the DIY biggest gummy burger McDonald's Big Mac burger in existence I don't want any of you guys telling me I'm not the goat I'm the DIY gummy goo right and I got check this out this is like some thin plastic looking material the buns are nice tomato and ketchup are nice we're gonna start with the fried okay so Dustin's working on taking out the fries we're gonna take them out and then put them on a cutting board and cut them after that's the way it's gonna go they just can't break on us if they break up this it's about to [ __ ] swing down and smoke you in the head yeah anyways like I say hopefully they don't break on us please gummy just come out in one piece I need everyone to smash that like button right now if one thing breaks then basically were [ __ ] so give me all the good luck guys I'm not good with gummies you know I fail all the time let's plop this over and see what this bad boy is saying three two one no nothing it's not coming out this is not good right now oh it's coming it's coming it's coming when you just suction it's gonna break let's go look at these McDonald's fries just finishing up on the fries guys we hold the knife so it is just gliding in like butter this fry is a little broken by the neck but we're gonna try and MacGyver a way to fix this but at least these fries are flawless so in order to get the fries to stand up we need to have a backing behind them otherwise they're just gonna snap off so we're gonna use wrist the board that I got but the thing about this is I wrap the tape around it thinking it was a good like life hack but it's now stuck I pull it and my mom gets pulled with it we're pulling the wrong way we got it off okay so now we are starting with the bird the first thing we need is the bottom of the bun three two one oh let's go okay so the next thing on a Big Mac if we look at this cheese we're gonna put on some cheese nice lay it on so that it hangs off the front oh my gosh delicious next is the Patty three two one oh yeah look at this concentration guys it needs a magic Wolfie top that is a patty if I've ever seen one that looks beautiful the cheese on the front of patty god damn what is next on this boiler oh yeah dehydrated drop cake okay we gotta be strategic with how we place these now we need to go a little bit to the left because it's tilting a bit to the right more cheese align it with the other cheese some lettuce because you know diet Wolfie is still alive and well so here we go let's go let us look at that so I'm over here too even though the weight will do Tomatoes next quick little yay whoa Oh tomato god this is just getting more unstable by the second yeah yeah I'm really scared we are limited on time all that's under the patty we have another yeah but the Patty's supposed to go under the tomato you have a Big Mac right there how did you yeah the party goes on top really patty goes on top confirm that it's the last thing the hell is Hattie bun Big Macs also don't have tomatoes do they don't but my Big Macs I've tomato this cannot breathe hi this is it too many I say we go over there right a bit there's a good balance drop panicky the ketchup does not want to move ketchup done three two one will expand kick the table world [Music] yes we're just taking the thumbnail but the burger is starting to crack my mom is behind me and trip me it's all good take the fries away this is way behind the scenes overthrown there looks like behind you the fries in front of the price where the burgers don't panic you're good you're good 100% you can you see my mom my right arm is numb I'm taking that time now bro it looks beautiful though it looks good it looks great Oh still looking great all covered so guys check it out basically we have the fries these are definitely hard to like just keep up we have to put some support sticks inside each fry just to make sure they stand up but compared to regular McDonald's fries and the burger I mean there's not much else to say compared to a regular Big Mac anyways we're just gonna get a nice cut through the door any other nice burger I feel like once we start cutting it's okay it's not sharp enough you got a machete guys be very careful okay yeah good I'll give you a fried first yeah here's your fries I need to have a McDonald's try to compare it pretty good cuz I wanted I don't want to eat too much down there yeah it looks good oh my god it's not bad yeah take a slice people are you doing that's been said you would take a slicer boom got some nice slices I've ever seen one that's all you need neat ketchup you need tomato can't stands on me if you got a compare so that's a Big Mac those for real good the badge real quick it's all good right Barry actually what it's just so good oh my god so the white bunnies like 2d fruity then we put that in that that was actually blessed this one this one this one this one and I see this one this one and this one and

this guy is the hybrid Andrea this guy is pineapple first off let me just tell you guys I cannot find anything about this company online no website is on the box there's no no website I can find it you search their name so I have no idea where these guys come from I have no idea about their background but whatever you guys are using the balm products let's just go on the pineapple which is here in the indica the flavor that these guys have is is is the these guys I can honestly say are the best tasting gummies I've ever had obviously Medicaid they come in these little packets so this is a 200 milligrams so these guys are each 50 there's four of them and they taste they taste like they taste familiar but they are so good I love these also they don't come GUI like that my just melted I didn't make just I absolutely love these got me he's like I'm kind of obsessed I'm never going back they are also generally when it comes to your mood and how you on them you're gonna be kind of happy at least for me and my experiences have been very uplifting and they've been very positive I don't go in any type of cycle as well at least for me they're not overly strong what is really great so if you want something where you're gonna be able to like lay around your house and watch TV these are a perfect choice so if you find yourself in California or if you live in California and you're in the Southern California region at least I know that I see these from time to time and I would pick one up they also are at a really great price especially compared to sake and because you punch I only

them out and try them okay so i think i have one of each color here that's in the bag looks like the ones on the front and on the back side it says they are cherry strawberry mango pineapple lemon orange green apple watermelon pink grapefruit lime blue raspberry and grape so let's see i had to take a guess this one probably cherry yep um that was good strawberry strawberry is very good not too sure which one would be mango i'm gonna guess it's gonna be one of these yellow ones nope that was a lemon that one was mango this one should be pineapple yes one of my favorites i had the lemon already so orange lemon and orange are my least favorite so far green apple that was pretty good watermelon i think that was watermelon [Music] no that was pink pink grapefruit that was pink grapefruit definitely pink grapefruit lime nope green apple that's one is watermelon you like green definitely blue raspberry and grape so my favorites were strawberry mango pineapple pink grapefruit and watermelon my least favorites were cherry straw i mean cherry lemon lime orange and grape the plain flavors but these gummy bears were so soft they're so soft some of the gummy bears like this is the pink grapefruit some of the gummy bears like the haribo they're sometimes they're too hard and chewy these are super gummy so is this world's best they might just be up for that [Applause] [Music] gummy bears this is a watermelon these are really good gummy bears if you have them in your store pick some up you won't regret it if you like gummy bears thanks for watching i better not eat too many of these even though they're fat free gluten free and low sodium they're still got sugar in them right so catch you on the next one peace", "pUhJnKKQDTE": "as marijuana becomes legalized throughout North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the munchies?

We keep our animals cage-free   and happy in their\n  natural habitat, right up until the time\nwe end their lives.  It's such a lovely place, I\n think most of these creatures   have no idea that the main\n  point of their existence   is to be killed so\n  we can eat them.  The gummy bears are\n my favorite to breed  because you never know\n what color you're gonna get and they can't kill\nyou like regular bears.

This can intimidate the males,   so we need to help\n  them a little bit.  Once the mamma bears\n are ready to pop,  I'm right there ready\n to catch them babies   and get them ready\n  for consumption.  Now, there are a few\n ways to slaughter.

good bro bro my stomach hurts his stomach is killing me make sure you guys like subscribe turn on the post notifications comment below if you want joshua to try a little nitro i'm not going to try below if you do if we get a thousand comments on this video i'll try a little nitro all right we out", "H_vVwcXn3Q0": "oh what's up easy bakers so today i'm going to be showing you guys how to make your own diy infused nerd ropes so if you haven't already follow me on instagram at daverny freeman i will be doing some giveaways so you want to follow me on instagram that's where i announce all of my giveaways and if you want to be a young young young young guy go ahead and hit that subscribe button and the notification bell so let's jump into the video so this is everything you're going to need you're going to need some heavy duty aluminum foil it doesn't really have to be that heavy duty you can go get the 99 cent one whatever fits your grip baby so i'm gonna use some aluminum foil and with my aluminum foil i'm just gonna place them on a flat uh surface and you you will be putting this inside the refrigerator so boom pow now what i'm going to do is i like to create my own little mold i don't know if you guys want to go on amazon to see if they have these molds but i know a lot of people were saying they could not find any nerve rope mold so you really have to do them by hand so this is what i'm doing now i'm just making my own little molds which is just popping the aluminum foil up a little bit so it can have this barrier in between the two i'm doing that on each side so that's what i'll be doing right now [Music] and you guys do want to be careful when you're making your little liners because this is aluminum foil and it's easy to kind of tear through them [Music] so you guys i prefer to reuse these package this the packaging that comes with it so i ain't i'm not gonna buy normal packaging y'all don't play with me we're just gonna reuse these packaging what you do is you take where it's sealed all at either end of the rope and you kind of open it up like you will a bag of chips it's very easy to tear so you do want to take your time to open up the seal and once you open it up there should be a like a little cardboard against against the seal and you put your fingers in between the cardboard and the foil and you gently slide your fingers down in order to tear the packaging apart so that's what i do i do that then i set it aside and i take some nerds now this i do this all the time so i have additional nerve ropes and nerves in there and i like to take the nerves off of the rope which is very easy um so i don't have to buy a thousand boxes of nerve ropes yeah i mean i'm nerves when i could just use this now that you have separated your gummies from the nerves you're going to place them in a heat safe microwave safe bowl and place them in a small one i do recommend doing small batches at a time because if you do so many it's going to be kind of hard to control it so now you want to take your infused coconut oil i like to use liquid coconut oil instead of the coconut oil that goes back to solid and you want to use your tincture i'm using my eva clear tincture that i already infused with your cbd and they're going additional box of nurse just in case i need them but i don't feel like i will it's just whatever floats my boat and you also want to get yourself some type of piping bag or you can get a a condiment um container i think a ziploc bag is cheaper well not really cheaper but it's it works for me and i do reuse these so it's not like i throw them away because i know i hate plastic now i'm taking my coconut oil and i'm just coating this ziploc bag with the coconut oil if you do not want to use your infused coconut oil you can definitely use pam to coat this bat this ziploc bag but i'm saying if you're going to infuse something why not have everything be infused you get what i'm saying you're going to share but yeah so i'm going to do that and i'm also gonna do the same thing to my aluminum layers that i made my little molds because if you do not it will stick i don't care what anyone says in my i've been making these for forever in a day and they will stick if you put them in the freezer you put them in the refrigerator you will have pieces of aluminum stuck to your gummy now you looking at like a food like you're in third grade with goat with with aluminum foil in your mouth like it goes so yeah that's what you want to do just make sure everything is evenly coated then move on to the next step [Music] all right you guys so to my two rope gummies and six additional gummy bears i add half a tablespoon of infused coconut oil just to give you guys some type of starting point but this is definitely a trial and error type of situation so as you guys i have my tincture right here and i'm going to use five milliliters which is a teaspoon of t-shirt and i'm placing it to the side in a condiment disposable condiment container because i wanted to be you know on hand and you guys also saw that i had my liquid lecithin next to me just in case i'm going to need that as well so you want to take your rubber spatula or you can use anything that you're going to throw away i like to use this silicone rubber spatula because i could just wash it off and reuse it now i'm making sure that everything is evenly coated and i'm going to put this in a microwave for 10 seconds and it's going to look like this now i'm just stirring this around to make sure that my oil and gummies are combining together i microwave it again bring it back out stir it around and as you guys can see a little bit you see how they're the gummies in the oil is not coming together so what i'm doing is just trying to stir it a little faster and a little harder just putting a little bit of elbow grease into it to see if it's going to combine together and once it does as much as i would like for it to at this point i'm going to add my tincture to this i only add a half of the teaspoon into this at this time because you can always add more you really can't take it away so that's why it's super important to do this in small batches so you won't gotta worry about anything but as you guys can see the oil really did combine well with this so now i'm going to go ahead and add that t-shirt and do the same steps stir it around kind of be careful because it will splat it out okay y'all see what i'm saying i told y'all it'll splat out and that's nothing but my tincture splatting out honey that's why i'm like uh um let me let me try to put you back on in there girl then i'm stirring it around again just just to make sure that it is fully incorporated because if you do not do this you will have it will be set like oil and vinegar separate yeah this that's exactly what this will be baby your gummies will be to the right and your tincture will be to the left so you want to definitely make sure that it's fully incorporated microwave it again then you're going to place it in your ziploc bag or your piping bag remember this ziploc bag is already all uh down so i'm trying to give you guys a good angle but this is hot girl i'm like oh i'm about to stop the camera this is hot so you want to go ahead and pour that into there i use i try to use my rubber spatula to get the rest of it out but do what you can because it will kind of become you know it'll cool down a little fast so you will be working very quickly boo boo so once you get that together you're going to just whatever side you're going to cut it out you're going to cut it away from your workspace okay i cut it on the ground so you're going to cut it away from your workspace line a little bit of nerves just a little bit unless you want it real thick to the bottom of this pan and we're going to pipe on our gummies [Music] [Music] so you guys i am starting off with a thin layer i like to use at least when it when i like to make beans nerd robes i'm showing you guys how to make one and a half so with the measurements and things that i will put in the description box to my preference it makes one long nerd rope and kind of like um a quarter of one as well so what i'm doing now is i'm just going ahead and piping out my gummies and once i get done piping out the gummies i'm gonna take some additional nerd rope and sprinkle them on top of the gummies so they can have gummies on both sides i um really do this as a preference when it comes to how many nerds i'm actually putting on the rope so like i said this is really trial and error for some people you guys gonna have to figure out what what you like and what works best for you [Music] so all of those nerd roasts that you put on the side or if you're using a new box you're just going to go ahead and sprinkle as many nerves on this as you want to help you out you kind of want to make sure that all of the gummy is covered and go to your next step [Music] so [Music] all right so now you want to just go ahead and put your nerd roads in the refrigerator for several hours and once they harden up you're going to come back to them [Music] all right so now that it's been several hours i'm going to get my packaging my flat irons i don't use them on my head but i should use them for this okay and i get my nerd rose as you guys can see that it was covered up so you don't have to worry about anything getting on them [Music] now this is why it's super important to spray down that aluminum foil you guys see how easy they're coming out of here i'm definitely being gentle because i don't feel like anything cracking breaking or anything like that or in between boo-boos so you see how easy they're coming out but i'm just plopping them out ever so gently and now once i plop them out i'm going to put them on the cardboard that every nerd rope come with and i'm just going to place it on there and we're going to go ahead and package them so that's just what i like to do [Music] so now what we're going to do is i put them on my cardboard liners i'm going to flip them over so that the cardboard is facing up and i'm going to get the two ends of oh sorry you guys then we're going to get the two ends of the aluminum foil kind of put them together where where nestle had the glue already there so i'm just going to line them up as even as i can and we're going to heat seal them with our flat irons with my flat iron they go from like a one to a five and i believe i have them on a a two maybe a three i just want them to get hot enough so when my hand touch it my hand is not burning and i can kind of just like close it all together so heat sealing something together is really really easy you guys and that's just pretty much it you just heat seal them together and

think we should start putting some sugar in because so we're on experiment instead of putting it on here and then moving it because it's a little hot right now I thought since it'll be a little bit core we could put that helmet in and sprinkle it in and mix it and they get a little bit cooler and give it a nice cool down so it's really really good like mine smells amazing my school off this is not supposed to make it what's to make it not sticky so nothing bad is in here that will poison you it's not glue it's just gummy bears so for this line you can eat it and play yeah you can play too

"i1etHmADoHk": "hey guys it is so gloomy outside right now I just want to make some hot chocolate and cuddle up under a blanket on the couch and watch TV but yesterday when it was all so gloomy I spent my day in the kitchen making some DIY fruit snacks some of you might call them gummy some of you might call them Fruit Chews but no matter what you call them these actually are really yummy and they're really easy to make too I picked up some unflavored gelatin from my local Target you can find this from many grocery stores and for those of you who live the vegan lifestyle I found a website that might help you out with some unflavored gelatin that will work for your diet so if you go to a website called vegan essentials comm I've never shopped on this before but I just wanted to do a little research for you guys there's a product called Lieber's unflavored jello you use in place of the unflavored gelatin if you don't want to use this product the other things you'll need are 100% fruit juice and any type of silicone mold if you don't have a mold you can always just use a dish and pour it in kind of like jello and cut it into little squares or use a cookie cutter which I'll show you in this video before we get into the video a little bit about what's coming up on Friday I got this yarn I'm planning on making a loom knit yarn hat if you don't have a yarn loom you could probably just use a container and like I showed you in the yarn flower you could make your own loom somehow this one's out of thin yarn so this one with the thicker yarn will look much better and be a lot more cozy but this was just a test so if you like this idea let me know and I haven't tied it off yet if you're interested in seeing Friday's video and all of my upcoming Christmasy and holiday videos then please subscribe to my channel and click the thumbs up button and now let's get into making some yummy fruit snacks yummy gum you see for this recipe I'm going to be using some unflavored gelatin some 100% fruit juice any flavor that you want and a silicone mold I purchased my adorable mold from amazon.com I'll give you the link to that in the description box below also honey is optional for more sweetness and you'll want to use during spoons imagine cup a pot to mix in I'm beginning by getting a measuring cup and I'm just going to pour one cup of juice into that now pour your juice into the pot and you're going to measure two tablespoons of unflavored gelatin if you're using the exact same gelatin the I am you'll just use three of the packets let the powder completely absorb into the juice and then mix it together once it's nicely mixed you're going to turn on the flame to a low to medium heat and then you're going to just heat that up until you can't see any more powder it will just be really liquidy and at this point you can use some honey for more flavor you can use any type of essential oil such as vanilla or mint any type of flavoring that you want to and just add that into the pot now I'm using a syringe that I got from the pharmacy at Target they just gave it to me so if you go up and ask if they sell them they might just give you one I washed this with soap and hot water and then I am just filling it up with the mixture this just makes it a lot easier to fill up your little tiny silicone molds then if you have any mixture left over which I do you can just pour it into a plate with a groove or you can use any type of Bowl or glass pan to pour this into then you're going to put all your gelatin into the refrigerator and let it chill for maybe an hour it might not take that long but just to be safe and then once it's completely hardened you'll remove it of course and here I'm showing you that you can make little hearts or whatever shape you want by using cookie cutters and you can of course eat all the excess that is left over then the ones in the mold of course you'll just pop out carefully at all the cute little shapes will be revealed for my next batch I cut the recipe so I only used 1/3 of the ingredients and I'm actually using food coloring to color the apple juice since it's a really light color so instead of using 1 cup of juice I used 1/3 cup and that is enough to fill up this mold and still have some left over and then you just use one packet of the gelatin if you're using the box I am and any amount of other flavoring that you want and there you have it personalized gummies you can make any shape that you want and you can make any flavor essentially - so these are really cute and really fun snacks to have around I love eating gummies I think they're so yummy so this is a perfect way to make your home I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial if you did please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my soap

orange and yellow one they kind of come off the hook easily so we might go through this bag pretty fast like that so maybe it's like something unusual they've never seen and it smells different than anything they've ever seen and so who knows and I'm not trying to jinx the day just cuz we caught one but we'll see if we catch more but that's another theory and all the parties I think it came up just all right guys check it out I'm switching to a little you know I'm it makes the kind of Carolina rig a little bit this octopus see if we catch someone and gummy octopus let's see if the llama turns things around not even hook a llama and hook the llama through the foot and then put the hook point in his head there we go that'll be good action in the water oh I missed him I did on the llama that was he started take off with it dang it grabbed the llama pulled him off almost pulled him off the hook they call this one Cusco my dad has a tough morning efficient besides it's been good for me but with my gummy worms I wouldn't say that turned our day around no no but it got the money got the monkey off my back a little larger ah nice got one annika me where he snagged he snagged though oh my line is tangled I was wondering what was I can still feel him on there he's still on look there you serious oh that was that was crazy got snagged I thought here's what I think so these baths are just used to eating protein all day and they see that little sweet snack I know they've never seen anything like it before Wow guys ii gummy worm a fish ever another another like solid I've switched back to like I'll show you guys what I switch to they caught this one on a different I've been trying just like every gummy worm in the pack that one on the Black Forest ones but this time it was an orange and yellow gummy worm I've been throwing everything dinosaurs everything we got snakes and this is tell you what maybe it's a finessed and I'd say maybe the sugars coming off of that thing because it's kind of melting in this warm water each worm only lasts about 5 or 10 minutes but maybe that's the key to it at 2:00 today well guys I'm happy that I caught - I can't believe they cut - do you did on gummy worms but the gummy worms as you can see you're starting to just fall apart fall off the hook the fish bone apart easily well guys if you enjoyed this video preached plus the like on it and we'll do another gummy worm challenge and it differently hopefully on a day when it a little bit better then you guys so much for watching I'll see you guys the next one [Music] [Music]",

it's dr. Michelle the innate mom and we are here to show you how to thank our homemade gummies what are we making candy gummy yes okay so to make gummies really what you need is you need a good healthy source of gelatin and some sort of liquid so for these ones today we're gonna go ahead and use coconut water these are actually my kids favorite ones so we just used coconut water and gelatin and then a little bit of stevia super duper easy now the cool thing about gummies is that you can really use any type of liquid so you could use these fruit juice that's unsweetened or sweetened with stevia or you could even use some fresh-squeezed green juice we've often done that um kombucha tea anything actually would work and then the ratio is really what's gonna give you your gummy I don't like ours like super hard and chewy we like I was kind of more of like a jello texture so to get that ratio and to get them nice a nice texture for the kiddos to eat we actually just use three cups of liquid we're gonna do the three cups in good dump that in that's two cups and then we ran into our last cup I know I've done this so much so we know that this is three cups even so and this is just the coconut water I like it because it comes in a glass jar so three cups of liquid and then the ratio is 4 cups of gelatin we're gonna use the table spoons we can measure so here's one good pump two three four and now the trick with this is that you don't want that water or the liquid that you're using to be too cold and then you also want to start to whisk it right away okay so you're gonna mix that really really well to make sure that there's no clumps in the gelatin and then once you've got it up blended nicely what you're gonna do is you're gonna actually take it over to the stove and put it on medium heat you don't want it to boil the cycle denature it but you're gonna put it on medium heat and do that for about five minutes we're gonna just screw over this way now oh wow okay and we're gonna scoot Jade over here and she's gonna just keep whisking just keep whisking just keep whisking it so do that for about five minutes okay okay cool so once she's done with that then we're gonna go ahead and sweeten our gelatin or our gummies with some powdered stevia I usually put about two or three scoops in there well sweeten it with that and then we're just gonna pour it in our molds and we just got these really fun these are like legit gummy bear sized molds and then we also have Lego molds my son really looks the Lego most we have robot molds they're fun we have insects molds we have animals we have Hartnell we have Lego dude molds okay so you can just use any type of mold that you want to make you work on these into so let's talk a little bit about the gelatin while she's hanging up back there it's really really important that you're using a good source of gelatin this is not your jello gelatin that stuff has artificial flavors and colors and lots of sugars and sweeteners so you want to find one that's actually a healthy source and not any of that junky stuff this one actually has from grass-fed pasture-raised cows so they're using a good healthy source too the gelatin if you're using stick animals or you're eating stick animals that's making music so we've got to find a good healthy source of animal that are producing the foods that we're eating the other really cool thing about gelatin is that it's got a ton of the essential amino acids that our bodies require essential means that your body absolutely requires it and have to get it from food that's what essential means so it requires that you have to get it from - so gelatin this actually has a ton of those that we actually aren't getting anymore because we no longer eat the part of the animal that makes up these this food here we tend to throw this part away and eat this it's like a nice chicken breast and the healthy meaty part but the tendons and the ligaments and the bones actually have a lot of the amino acids that are extremely important - and so we actually was doing that we're actually unbalanced so by eating this this helps to balance out the amino acids the essential amino acids that our body needs the other thing that's really good about this is obviously has a good source of collagen in it collagen is what helps to make up your not only your skin and your nails that's why it's how'd it as being the the best kept secrets of having healthy skin and hair but also it helps to actually repair and heal the bones ligaments and muscles so you have a little athlete on your hands who's doing a lot of the physical activity and exercise this is such a good way to help rebuild and repair and help their little bodies to recover after strenuous exercise and of course we know toddlers are exercising all day long that's also one of the reasons why it's good for people with arthritis as you get older your joints start to wear down and have some inflammation the essential amino acids that are in this will actually help to get rid of some that information mama yeah baby you are such a good job let's take it off now okay the last thing that I want to mention and this is oh my goodness you did so good okay so once we get it off they're not to be jealous but once we get it off there we're gonna go ahead and pour it in here because this makes it a lot easier for us to pour into our holes and then we're gonna actually give Jada one because she can start doing the gummi bears and it came with this cool little squirter good and then we're gonna want to get those in the mold pretty quickly so we're gonna just get that and then she's gonna go work on how to work at those ones and I'm gonna go ahead and pour them into our molds let's just do the gummy bears and if there's named laptop okay so then we're gonna just pour these in and then we're gonna get them into the fridge as soon as we can perfect and mommy's making a mess of it that's I mean you'll notice that they put them on a pan like this one here so that it's a lot easier to transfer and of course my spilt okay but it's a lot easier to transfer from the counter into the refrigerator and so we've got the robots done now we're gonna go ahead and do some Lego pieces Gina's working on the gummy bears the last thing that I wanted to mention about gelatin and the health benefits of it is that Johnson actually is known to help restore the mucosal lining of your gut now what happens is when there's an imbalance of the good bacteria and the bad bacteria and the parasites and the yeast and the bad bacteria and just being that out of balance from antibiotics and toxins and stuff like that in the environment what happens is that mucosal lining of the gut gets damaged and then when we eat food some of the proteins are actually from the food proteins are actually able to permeate the gut lining which is really bad because when it does that you get them to the bloodstream and that causes your immune system to start to attack those foods you get food allergies food sensitivities that kind of stuff so it's known as leaky gut and then it shows up in especially Kansas food sensitivities and food allergies so by eating a lot of gelatin what we're able to do is we're able to repair that gut lining and what you'll notice is that sometimes kids are able to get over some of those food sensitivities and food allergies that they've had but just just by healing the gut which is so good I'm sure you heard about bone broth bone broth and it's harder to get into toddlers is it does the same thing it's extremely healthy has some of that gelatin in it really good for the body of course to heal the gut bone broth heal the gut it's the two big things right now but for us obviously getting bone broth into these guys is not as easy as getting gummies into them so this type of thing will also help to heal and repair their gut so that's how we do it these are the gummies we're gonna go ahead and stick these in the fridge I just want to show you the end result we made some of these last night too but this is the end result of the little gummies gonna move on up there you go they're kind of hard to see cuz their coconut water and they're clear but there you go and the kids can't get enough like I said we made a batch last night and this is all that's left from all the ones that we made so I just wanted to share our healthy homemade gummy gut healing bone muscle joint preparing snack with you guys hope you enjoy have a great day trust your Nate", "PfYE4KY2DxQ": "it's rolling up until morning is certified pothead you may notice a I'm not smoking right now I do got some super flame for you and you put it on spin move never gonna be doing a review of some dank gummies so without further ado let's jump to the close-up [Music] [Music] [Music] hi Burke owes me some other bird emojis flapping in the comments section as we take a look at the base edifice never look at these dang gummies these are peach rings now I'm already about to in um I wasn't smoking if you know video so I can tell you how they make the reef you just go ahead pop this third one it you know explain to you how to take all right Burke up these have a very decent peach scent oil you don't really get a cannabis scent coming out of them you know it's a very good peach and kind of sugar scent place papi can try to break down how to taste actually it [Music] coating very sugary when you start to break it open very nice peach flavors come - and it's actually a pretty good Pete very good peach representation like it almost tastes like biting into an extra peach [Music] not really picking up too much of the cannabis at first but starting to come through is still behind the peach flavor a lot but figured up on the very end of the taste as far as what I'm feeling right now three of these are 15 milligrams this is the third one out hat so same won't break that break down the third mini twenties they're almost 30 milligrams I've already a and it's a nice feeling nice body high relaxing everything on and you spiny gummies but I will say they do them a try you don't want to go just eating a whole bunch of them because it takes a while creme to uh jump in nice you start to feel the effects so you can easily overdo it but they'll be afraid these at will be real good I'm I definitely recommended that to Lamar come out there [ __ ] cuz [ __ ] bring buddy trumpeted but daddy what a comedown [Music]", "zaml88FpweU": "all right what is up everybody Jacobs back with another video for you guys quarantine video I've been staying at home that's about it some exciting [ __ ] for you guys this time though we got some sour patch dummies right here 500 milligrams straight to the dome you know we're doing them so it's like I believe it's like 10:30 in the morning so I'm gonna be in candy in the morning but which I don't like but I feel like this is gonna be a really good high so I wanna like have it last the majority of the day instead of like taking it like later in the afternoon then falling asleep like halfway through the high or some [ __ ] I don't know got these for $25 from the not from like directly from a dispensary but from a friend of mine so yeah there's a pretty good price I think if you were to go to like a dispensary or something they usually charge $10 per hundred milligrams so kind of a good deal but yeah I'll show you these guys again know if you can see right down there 500 milligrams yeah 500 huh so yeah let's dig in so that's pretty cool just like I don't know little sour patch kids they don't look quite the same the sugar is kind of weird it looks wet and another thing it says on the back here five servings per container serving size one piece but there's like just way more than five pieces in that I don't know if you guys can see but we're taking doesn't taste like weed at all it's a lot better than that nerd rope I had that [ __ ] was like I don't think I like nerds I don't know but I did eat like a banana like I think an hour or 45 minutes ago just to sort of like activate my metabolite I don't know but oh yeah and something else I forgot like I figured like people would just figure did I do it that way but like I keep like I got a lot of comments on the last one I did like the nerd rope the nerd rope 400 milligram edible I think it was there were a lot of people that like just thought that video was like one video or like one time I think like I just got a bunch of like comments that were like you know edibles take longer than 10 minutes to hit and I was like well you really think I've like a weed Tube channel and I don't know the edibles don't hit immediately after you eat them so I mean I don't know I mean but just this isn't gonna be the whole video like I'm gonna check back in like an hour two hours whenever I start like really feeling high and that's gonna be me then later so alright cleared the whole bag we're out of these shits so I'm gonna check in and like last like an hour maybe two hours maybe three hours however long this takes to take effect yeah I'm gonna take one more head of this [Music] little baby hit but yeah I'll check back in with you guys about two hours or so so peace alright so check him back in guys it is now 2:30 so it's been about three or four hours and I am [ __ ] high I'm so high like I just feel like good and like cozy like I don't know in movies right now I'm on yes man with Jim Carrey shit's hilarious but yeah I just been chilling and I had two bowls of cereal but ya know how feelings [ __ ] good this is like holy [ __ ] this light that I have for the lighting like he's really [ __ ] bright yeah I would definitely recommend these who these things are [ __ ] dope they smacked me in the face cuz holy [ __ ] I'm I like him actually like I don't know I feel pretty good about him at least right now edible you know just kind of chill cuz yesterday I got like I drank so much like an I passed out I'm so tired and I threw up it was just like a horrible day so this just yeah it's a lot nicer everything like I don't know everything I look at like specifically focus on like looks very like clear and like clean but then everything else behind it is it like such an intense like a blur well yeah I'm just really chilling you know like this I like I said this is definitely a [ __ ] fire edible I [ __ ] with this i 100% recommend it but I'm other than that I have no idea what to talk about I kind of just want to know getting my [ __ ] back get in my bed and watch this movie so yeah I'll take one last rep I haven't been smoking too much we're hiding actually I had a couple reps of this like I think three hours in or so not too long ago he's dying but I did that because I was like kind of feeling the body high a little bit but I was just like nervous that it wasn't gonna be intense enough for whatever reason sometimes he sings some like a [ __ ] hit or miss but yeah so I smoked and then I like got really high and yeah I think I'm like getting maybe close to like the full effect I don't know how long this will last but I think usually the potent ones are the more potent the longer it lasts so maybe it's still building up but either way I'm just trying to chill out so I hope you guys are smoking I hope you guys enjoyed the video [ __ ] sour patch dummies stay high stay lifted stay quarantine stay clean and peace everybody", "FIvxTPO_x3A": "hi folks its flower child 1970 and as promised I am going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears the easy way this is the easy way there's so many ways on the internet I just this is what three ingredients four ingredients actually if you include the water okay so you are going to need Knox gelatin I'm gonna bring you up just so it's not crooked you will need Knox gelatin okay or brand name gelatin don't go I've tried to go the cheap route and just by no-name gelatin I'm telling you folks I don't know what these name brands stop having them but there is an extra ingredient or something that allows this to work so you will need Knox gelatin only two packets okay so I have my two packets of Knox gelatin you will also need half a cup of kind of oil which is kind of this oil or coconut oil infused with cannabis so this is kind of coconut oil a measuring cup because you need half a cup of hot water and whatever brand of jello you want to use today I am using grape okay so it's gonna get a little shaky I'm sorry so do not turn on your stove yet what you do first is put your dry ingredients in first so you're gonna add your jello I'm opening it up oh god I broke a nail okay so just put your jello in whatever flavor and use name-brand jell-o do not use no-name jello its I'm not sponsored by them or anything but it does make a difference folks okay you can try it doing in a cheaper way but I'm telling you it's not gonna work they won't set right though they'll separate that Kenoi 'el will separate from the jello and you'll get a two-tone candy gummy bear and it looks terrible and it tastes terrible so we put our gelatin in again you're doing the dry ingredients first grape jelly smells good my garbage aside and then you're gonna want to mix this really well so that you don't see the white crystals anywhere on top you can even do it this way just shake it about it works it either way of stirring it or just shifting it in the pot pan and I'm using a nonstick pot it's very important that you use a nonstick pot as well so I am going to add my half of cup of hot water I did boil it already and now it's okay to turn on the stove because you're putting in your water I have mine at medium art whoops terribly sorry about that just mix it around you're gonna want to make sure that the there's no clumps in here and all the grit is gone you don't want to feel great at the bottom of the pan you want to make sure it's smooth much like how you would make it when you make you jello so we're just going to stir this around for a little bit for a few minutes just to make sure everything's separated and something fell on my burner sorry so what you also need while that is it'll boil a little bit it's just on four but what you also need are molds okay and what I have here and you'll see it over on the other side once this mixture is ready and you will need one of these little plunger things but if you where did I buy these I think I bought these at bulk barn I think I bought them at bulk barn and when you buy them you get three of these trays which have 50 divots each they're little gummy bears 50 divots each so you get 150 total in three trays and you get two or three of these little plungers to suck up the stuff and the mixture and put it in here so you're not burning yourself or using a spoon or anything like that okay and because there's always overflow it makes more than 150 I have my other trusty Molde here with the emoji faces on them so yeah I mean it's pretty basic it only takes a few minutes what takes the longest in my opinion is having them solidify in the fridge so I think this is pretty well mixed yeah it's mixed so just because I'm going to rush it but don't rush it because of a mixture might not work out as well it's actually starting to bubble so I chose great because I find that you taste the can of oil I know it doesn't bother some people but I like to taste the sweetness and the sugar and stuff so I guess you could put it less than half a cup in there you could put a quarter cup in here depending on your tolerance but my tolerance is quite high I eat a fair bit of edibles and I do consume it by smoking it so throughout the day and so I use a half a cup of the can oil so it's pretty good right now I think I'm just going to add the can of oil okay so we're gonna add it slowly just make sure that it gets mixed in there's a lot of stirring involved in this it's just I mean I've watched different people do it online and I know some people just leave it be but I don't I prefer to keep stirring it because I find the more you're stirring it the more it's going to stay mixed together I find it separates a lot sometimes so just be careful of that be cautious and be aware because if they don't mix well when they're solidifying they separate and it gives you a two tone candy I don't like that I find the butter it just or the kind of oil separates from the gelatin and I don't know why that is so I prefer to do it mixing it a lot stir stir stir came and add the rest of it you know just see the gelatine ah oh no glad I noticed that it's a little hair there so you want to mix this once all the butter or the can oil sorry I keep saying butter and used to make it with butter instead of the coconut oil but it's just it's not butter it's coconut oil so I'm sorry if I keep saying butter I don't mean butter I mean it's kind of oil kind of as coconut oil so now it's starting to heat better and it's gonna boil up as you can see which is good you do want that but stir as it does that so you're gonna want to stir it for about five minutes you might have to turn your stove down like I'm going to do cuz I find that's bubbling too much I'm actually gonna lift it up off the stove and move you up I'm sorry my phone's getting a little hot I'm gonna move you over here okay you can still see hahaha sit in the bunk pot they're just silly to do that so yeah I'm oh five minutes four to five minutes you're going to want to keep stirring it as it's sitting on the stove on medium four or five degrees depending on how your stove how hot your stove gets but it's pretty well mixed even the stuff on the side is mixed into the pot I'm gonna lift it up just so I can see how well it's mixed and then it's all mixed and looking well together excuse me I'm sorry about that so I hope you guys enjoy this video I can't believe I've never showed you guys how to make gummies before but this is homemade gummies they're not gonna taste exactly like and the textures not going to be exactly like this way the way I'm showing you I mean they still taste gummy obviously because of the gelatin and this is the easy cheap way to make yourself some gummies you can use whatever mold you like but I prefer to use the little gummy bear molds and the emoji molds okay I'm gonna shut the heat or actually no I'm gonna keep the heat on low because the mixture kind of cools itself down when you're dispersing it into the mold so having it a heat source is a good thing because it helps keep it hot or warm depending on what temperature you're gonna keep it set at when you're putting it into the mold it's important not to have it too higher you're just gonna burn the mixture and it's not gonna work at all so I've got it on low because I'm going to get ready to put it into the molds and I move the pot back and forth but since I'm filming it I'm gonna put you in another spot yes so that looks really good it's mixed really well I don't see a lot of the remnants of the the cano around the rim which is nice that means I've been stirring enough and there it's gone off the spoon or the mixing spatula okay I'm gonna move you over here you're gonna see my broken picture on the floor I can't believe that happened to fell right off the wall and boom down to the ground it went and it smashed okay it's kind of crooked you guys are gonna be having crooked necks trying to watch this oops well I'm sorry for all the movement I'm just trying to get it so that I can film it set it like that then okay here we go you have our little little miniature turkey basters [Laughter] okay here we go so just take some up obviously you guys know how these little things work where are we start on this end okay and sometimes I noticed because it's so hot it'll squirt back out I'd yeah it's kind of hard to see that but just be careful this stuff is really hot so you just put it in squeeze it into your molds kind of at medium to fast pace because this whoops this stuff cools fairly quickly I notice when I'm doing them but you will get if you're using this small gummy bear molds about a hundred and fifty plus gummies yeah so you can once they are solidified I've noticed some people on the internet use sugar powder I can't remember confection powder sugar to sprinkle on them because they are a little oily from the kind of oil that's mixed with them but I don't do that I just keep them in the fridge and then if I want some because obviously the touched her when they're in the fridge constantly is a little harder than if you left them at room temperature once they are all solidified and ready to be eat so you just continue ba-ba-ba-ba-ba get them all in there squeezing as you go so yeah I just I couldn't believe I was looking through my videos going yeah indeed I've never shown anyone how to make the gummy bear so this is how you do it this is my way of doing it this is and I find the texture fine you just got to make sure that you're also doing this stirring it around because it does separate and putting it back on the stove is a nice idea to keep the temperature hot whoops making a bit of a mess but I mean I'm sure instead of using cannabis oil to make these like some type of edible or treat for the kids leave out the kind of oil obviously oops no there we go was a little raised up there we gotta have them even so they harden properly and they're all ready to go at the same time you know what I mean so I find this fun to do this I mean I love to bake especially when they're edibles we're almost done here folks I'm actually gonna put this back on the stove for a second be right back just noticed it was starting separate you don't want that to happen okay all right she didn't had the stove on hot so I might take a little longer for you guys if you have it on medium or low so obviously we're gonna get more than 150 there's 25 in each of those gummy bear sheets so we're just gonna fill these up now obviously the emoji the pink sheet that I'm doing right now is going to take longer to harden because they're deeper bigger so I won't be showing you those but I'm hoping that these little ones if I put them in the freezer will solidify really well and I'll be able to show you them in the video no guarantees because my phone's been really wacky lately and when I pause it it shuts off on my phone sometimes so we're getting to the very last of it and it will the last few gummies will be very mediciney because of the butter that stays behind that's really what I'm soaking up here I can just see the difference so I'm just gonna pour it in there okay okay so I am going to cheat and put them in the freezer alrighty and hopefully hey that looks see that that looks like the Mickey Mouse symbol you see that a little dollop right there two ears all righty so that's what we do so far so good okay got a bit of the counter in there that one was never used so I'm gonna put these in the freezer hopefully when I pause it it won't mess up but if it does I'm sorry and I'll show them to you in another short video so we're gonna pause it and put them in the freezer for about ten minutes okay see you soon folks and if not love and Huggies and I'll show you the finished product in another video if that's what happens okay so that's how you make gummy bears folks it's pretty simple it's pretty basic and it's really easy and quick it's quick nothing to it the longest it takes in my opinion is to solidify them in the fridge which is usually about 15 20 minutes but we're gonna cheat and use the freezer okay lemon honey see you soon right alrighty so it only took five minutes but here are some this is what they look like whoops it's just what they look like gonna eat one so yeah so there you go folks oh my gosh where's the camera here we go ha ha sorry so yeah they look like rug dummies they just taste a little different you know what I mean so there it is I'm actually gonna have a couple more and put them back in the fridge but there they are dummies ready to be eaten folks lovin Huggies stay true stay unique and enjoy I hope you enjoyed the video folks and I hope you give it a try and if you do please let me know how it turned out ok bye", "YlzkjcxX3EY": "Lala

they get to eat sugarfree gummy bears uh do you know anything about this the reviews on Amazon for over touches these gummy bears so here we got our so popular first of all let's do we had to buy this bag ok so talk about the price yeah yeah yeah how much okay let's Astro how much do you think this bag of gummy bears costs on Amazon it's it's 5 pounds it's just 5 pounds of gummy bears now let me put this into perspective the sugary version of these is like 9 bucks mm-hmm less than 10 bucks I was gonna guess ten dollars so I'll say a little bit more maybe it's fancier 15 $100 one well you just gave it away $100 I was gonna be like higher lower like you no no okay no I'm holding a Benjamin yeah yeah and that $100 it's heavier and the reason why a cinderblock it's because the reviews are so funny that the item went viral now should we eat some of these while you're telling me yeah yeah um is this kind of like the cookbook have you seen microwaving four-one-oh no but I should look into that there's a cookbook called microwaving for one and Elizabeth little lady wind microwaves were first came out they're really popular oh it's not a joke it's kind of sad because I think she lost her spouse and now she's microwaving for one so it's kind of depressing but it became like really popular on reddit and this book that was like five dollars is now more expensive because it's kind of this microwaving oh  I own it okay see while you're chewing on this just to have one just just one drop what's all the rage about David just hold on to that other one don't eat it you the title of david's review is fully weaponized gummi bears I bought it back because I'm trying to cut down on sugar it seemed Haribo has replaced the sucrose and a typical batch of gummy bears with : shredding rage just a couple of handfuls left me crying for my mommy on the bathroom floor parenthesis I am 43 years old what well you won't eat that other one here's one by a little nervous here's one by Sims here is only one way to say it it's by one way there's only one way to say it I sneezed out of my buttonhole I want Rosana to read these okay can we let her reading of course um-hmm um-hmm right here oh this is continued yeah let it read that wrong it'd be like a bedtime story for my lower GI tract oh here we go when the rumbling started I sprinted down the hallway and made it to the bathroom just in time for the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse to stampede from my backside laying waste to my home septic system and my will to live oh you want an island here already so I read some here they go why don't how many of you want ranks I've eaten too how many of you eaten - I don't know if I should do anymore based on these reviews they don't taste that bad but I'm really getting nervous every anything with sugar alcohol in it you know like uh like if you do like the low carb diet like my wife went to this thing where she was getting like the Atkins bars oh gosh and they have sugar alcohol in it which is a sweetener that you know is it's not sugar it's not sugar mm-hmm but it can have a horrible effect on your bow case-in-point Christopher gray his post is entitled space-time continuum I have observed an interesting phenomenon when I eat these I am temporarily granted the power to poop things I didn't actually eat here's one from Greg be a fight I do not bring to sporting event other than the war that the bottom half of my body is currently having with this porcelain chair it is as quiet as a pin drop in this public restroom I call out does anyone have a diaper hoping that some gentleman was changing a baby nothing no one said a word I know people are in here I can see the toes of shoes pointed in my direction under the stall does anyone have a diaper I am screaming my son is now crying he thinks he is witnessing the death of his father I can't even assure him that I will make it and let's see yes he is like really good writing yeah I think in their little sensational they get sensational but people actually experience this stuff um this ruined my life from gummy poo um I see is that the beginning of this cuz we kind of wrote this up in a weird way it is and this is not the entire thing this is just an excerpt of his right without gummy poo from gummy poo with no other option I ran back towards the bathroom trying to keep my cheeks clenched little staccato bursts of sulfuric farts punctuated each yard as I raced for the finish line hoping that I could keep my chocolate starfish clenched tight enough to steal the donuts that's too much information I mean you've nicknamed it I ripped it really I ripped the door open and somehow managed to drop my pants without undoing my belt whatever that sounded like a steamroller driving through a bubble wrap you know what we should study these it's true does anybody want any uh you know what I uh I hate to a handful no don't yeah we're not gonna document okay alright you want to read a couple more I have here no if it gets any worse than that I just feel like I thought about my car and how I complete an unforgiving fire would be the only way to cleanse it gonna burn himself his car he's gonna burn his car okay well would we learn a day till my wife I loved her Haribo I hold no ill will I blame no one I have even forgiven myself is there a Gibson for giving myself okay I think we've learned that I am so sorry mrs. teacher's name I was never asked to send snacks to my daughter's class again oh I do want to find out where did you get those cupcakes from place on Magnolia so Magnolia I like him so much really sugar free sugar free cupcake I'm going I like those those are good um so ro uh we ate a lot of stuff on your channel too but I don't know that you expected us to eat everything at every point in the process of making the recipe but you dealt with it pretty well yeah um I couldn't help but notice that you weren't eating any of like the cake batter the cake batter or this when we do test baking we'd test bake in like different sections and the day before I usually eat about 4 to 5 cupcakes so I try to control it quality control cuz I have a sweet tooth so right right I go crazy about once a week during the test baking and then I try to control it there were the rest of the week but do you like um like I was I was telling you I have a weakness for cake batter or anything that's like raw sweets or like undercooked like cookie dough cookie batter brownie batter like once you bake that stuff I I could care less I'd rather have a rib and that's a disorder it yeah I'd rather have meat and man if you go to cook that batter you might as well just give me meat I like them both I like steaks and I like sweet so I don't do that you don't Duras I do I like cookie cake better not as much as cookie dough cookie dough's my favorite cookie dough ice cream gets me in trouble I can't be around it or I'll eat all of it I went to the farmers market here in Los Angeles mm-hmm and they were there was a guy selling cake batter in cups and cookie dough in cups and all the raw stuff but he made them without eggs so no one would die so no one would die that's cool but technically was social you're not gonna get Salmonella from we've been through this raw eggs in America you can eat all the raw eggs you want just like rocky drink them for breakfast yeah mm-hmm yeah I know people who do sampled eggs every morning but those are cooked what those are good this isn't really relatable but I just like I mean maybe there's a part of it that's under coach they don't have to because I do sunny side up what's your favorite dessert like if you had only one dessert the rest of your life having made so many stuffs my current favorite sure macaroons was all fancy French cookies delicious how many ones that are kind of I don't get better I don't get them they're kind of crispy mm-hmm they're like soft and fluffy on the area hide crispy on the outside they come in different flavors but my sweet tooth changes a lot because I do eat a lot of sweets I also love donuts maple donuts maple bars okay you should put pork rinds on one going seriously hot news flash I'm I'm

have a baggy t-shirt on and my hair is wet obviously the edibles that i'm going to take i took out the little card but this is the edible i already took these three but with these three i cut them in half i took one hole like a couple days ago [ __ ] is crazy but the other two i cut them in half and like took half the dose but this is a 200 milligram edible um this is the card it literally says this super potent gummy is 200 milligrams strong the company suggests that patients should begin with one candy at a time and adjust as they become familiar with the effects this product is segmented into four candies so dosage can be well managed i'm going to take the edible now but it does take an hour to activate so i'm going to eat the edible on camera chill my bed time it for an hour and come back an hour and doing makeup so that's what we're gonna do the only thing i don't like about these gummies is that it's a little hard to chew it's super super hard but honestly like they're nuts so this is it it's obviously like lemon flavor and it's a little alien the freaking alien design should say how like strong it is but [Music] like i can't even chew it i have to really just pluck on it but i'm gonna put coconut oil in my hair oh my god i'm gonna cut the video because i'm gonna be chewing this for the next 10 minutes because this is how hard it is i'll see you in an hour it is 12 30 right now so i'll see ya at 1 30. okay so it's been an hour um yeah all right so i'm gonna start doing my makeup all right i'm not even gonna lie when i'm when i'm high my voice gets really low like really really low so that's just yeah okay i want to play music so bad right now because i love like listening to music when i'm high but i'm gonna get copyrighted i'm doing my eyebrows with this palette even though i have my mirror in front of me um i'm gonna use this mirror because it's closer and my eyebrows need to be precise i've done my makeup hard before but like it always comes out like fine all right so what should i talk about because i don't want to just stay here silently oh almost look about the first time i got high okay i don't remember [ __ ] okay so when i first got high it was [Music] pretty sure was my 18th birthday i think it was like after it was like a week after my 18th birthday at the time one of my close friends at the time she had already like smoked she was already like into it so she knew what she was doing um and her best friend like also like my friend her best friend and her sister so they all like knew what they were doing already um i had always been like really nervous to get high because i was like i don't know how i'm gonna act i don't know like how i'm feel because you can explain to people how it feels but you don't know what it feels like until you feel it oh i was like i already had like my like like i guess my my stigma about it i don't know i had my own opinions about it but i was like [ __ ] it i'm 18 like let me just try at least i wanted to at least try it because i was like okay then i can know if i like it or not i went to her house and i don't know i don't remember if we planned on doing it or not but i think they had planned on doing it and i was just gonna like chill out but then eyebrow okay i said i do my makeup better when i'm high but my eyebrows coming out a little funky so whatever she lives like five minutes away from me not even like a two second walk and i'm at her house so i got to her house and they started to smoke and we were all in a circle they were so we were like a little diamond i guess and i was sitting there like hella nervous because i was like yo i said oh my god when i was like nervous because i was like am i gonna do this right like am i gonna smoke this right until i was like what's gonna happen to me i was like [ __ ] up so i think i think me having anxiety prior to even smoking is what caused my experience so i was like freaking out whatever and it gets past me and like they spent like five minutes trying to teach me how to do it right because we had done it before the first time i really really smoked i didn't do it right so i felt a little bit but i didn't feel like anything compared to the time i'm talking about right now did that make sense so whatever they spent like five minutes trying to like teach me how to do it and i was convinced i wasn't doing it right i was like nah i'm not doing this right i don't feel [ __ ] because in my head i'm thinking oh it's supposed to be like an immediate feeling because when they were doing when my friends were doing it they i could already tell they were snacks i was like what the [ __ ] so whatever i passed this for her sister circle kept going right it goes to i don't know if they care if i use their name and i'm just saying that i'm like i'm like this like i'm like yo what's happening right now and i'm like i'm not realizing that that's what i'm feeling that i'm feeling hot in my head i'm thinking like am i laced because i didn't know that that was the feeling you got they when they explained to me that you felt like what i what you would feel what i would feel i don't know what the [ __ ] i'm chatting about right now they were like basically saying you feel calm you feel high like they don't know how else to explain it because it's like i don't you don't really know how to explain it to a person i'm too smack right now um where was i oh yeah so it gets past and i'm sitting there like confused as to what's going on because i didn't know that that that feeling i was feeling was the feeling i was feeling high so i'm sitting there like yo guys i'm like freaking out and i go i think i go on the bed and i just sit and i'm like i'm like looking out the window i'm like yo i like in that moment it felt like i was in heaven but because the sun was sitting and it was coming through her window so i'm looking at the sun like so i'm looking out the window like yo i'm in heaven right now and they're just laughing at me because i was saying like nonsense it did y'all i feel like this looks bad they were just laughing at me because i was saying like a bunch of nonsense and i don't have the video from that day because it was in my old snap and everything i deleted but um i was basically like just bugging out i was like i feel like i'm talking to computers going off and they were like yo are you good and i was like i was like no i like i knew i wasn't good i wasn't good to where i was like unsafe but i wasn't good because i like i wasn't comprehending that this is what you feel it was my first time one and two i didn't know like what to expect [Music] so in my mind i'm convinced at that point i'm convinced i just got leased and it's not i wasn't thinking that because of them or anything i was thinking that because again i didn't know that that was how i was supposed to feel so so i was asking them i was like yo is mine different like i don't know i was like yo did i smoke something different because i don't know like i feel crazy i was saying like i feel crazy because everything was just like yo okay that took a lot of concentration she asked me she was like is this your first time getting house like like yes bro i was so like frustrated because i was like i was like oh my god i was like i don't know what to do they were living their best life they were enjoying it but i was just so paranoid and i wasn't enjoying it at all like it honestly it really wasn't a fun experience for me because my anxiety was just like getting the best of me i was just getting hella paranoid and my anxiety was just through the roof and i was just sitting in the corner like yo like i wasn't crying but in my head i was because i was like oh my gosh and then like when it like hit me that this is like me being high what was i saying i forgot what the [ __ ] i was saying oh yeah i was like i was just hella paranoid i like i didn't know what to do with myself and at one point i was like when does this end i was asking them like yo when does this [ __ ] end because i just didn't want to be high anymore i was like i'm over this like this is no um and they were like give it like another like four or five hours because like at the time i had never smoked before so it was gonna last a long time not smoke that much compared to now if i would have smoked that now i would have been like okay like can i get another one that was my first time getting high i was hella paranoid i had hella anxiety i told some of my friends the story they're like they're like so if you had that bad experience why do you continue to smoke and like [Music] eat edibles on [ __ ] camera for youtube um honestly i tried it again after that because i was like i was like okay i need to have a better experience because i truly feel like in that moment all i was doing was just panicking and like questioning everyone and like just acting like annoying so i was like okay i want to experience this again because i want to learn how to just like be okay and just enjoy it instead of like freaking the [ __ ] out so i ended up trying it again and the second time it was the second time the second time was a way better experience it was a lot more fun we actually went out and did stuff so i was cool what gets me tight when i meet people and i'm like oh like do you smoke heavy smoke before they're like yeah i've smoked before but i i didn't feel anything so it don't work for me i'd be like i mean i'd be like wrap it up because i'd be like one it's either you didn't smoke it right or two you didn't have actual weed because no you didn't have good weed i'm like i mean i says you didn't feel anything because you didn't smoke it right because if it's me if you're smoking weed you're gonna feel something especially if it's your first time so you death didn't do it right and i would know because the first actual time i did it i didn't do it right and i barely felt that i had like the giggles more because i was like oh my god how but like i didn't feel [ __ ] because i didn't do it right so that's why when people always say that [ __ ] i'm like i'm gonna teach you i'll be like i'm gonna teach you [ __ ] like i got you [Music] that water tastes so good i felt it okay so i'm gonna take laura mercier and set the concealer on my eyes i'm getting the munchies i was gonna order food while i was waiting but then i was like i was like no i want to wait so um like snack snack so i could crave food [Music] see now i was starting to hit like a brick before i was a little high i know i could have been hired and i was starting to hit me like a ton of bricks oh my god i don't know what i'm doing i don't know what i'm doing okay i'm gonna take this kylie bronzer [Music] and use it as a little eyeshadow to dust off the translucent powder [Music] the indian asked oh what the indian clay mask i need to do that oh i could talk about the story the time i took my first edible too that story was crazy first time i tried edible rape my friend that made it for me and my mom they were both telling me they were like this is your first time eating edible so be careful just eat half and i was like alright yeah i was like i know like i was trying to act all big and bad like yeah i know like i'm just gonna eat half i saved it for like a day or two because i was like i want to wait to like so i know i don't have anything to do the whole day because if this is my first time i want to be home chilling whatever so i was home i ate the edible i had half like he said and then i was just sitting there and it's been 20 minutes wow i was just sitting there and i wasn't feeling anything like an hour pass and i wasn't feeling anything i was like i was like hello i was getting mad because i was like this is not working for me that's everyone's [ __ ] mistake when they take edibles it doesn't work for me it's not hidden [ __ ] i was just chilling and i was like you know what i'm gonna eat more so i practically ate the whole thing i left like a little slither left i ate the whole thing basically and i was like this should do it idiot not realizing what it's actually gonna do to me 30 minutes later it all hit at once and i was bugging out i ate like two no i ate a full down on those pizza i had wings i had a lava cake i had all that i had lava cake i had soda and i ate it all and i'm getting hungry my mom i knew i had ate half so she was just waiting so she came into my room like an hour after it officially hit me she was like you good i was like i was like i feel like i have super powers and she starts busting out laughing and i swore in that moment i had super hours and i was just like okay i'm bored i want to do something i was like really jumpy pretty sure because it it was sativa yeah i was like i want to do something i wanna like i wanna party so i started making i probably made like 20 dance videos that night of me just dancing in my bed and it wasn't even like real like choreography dancing i was just i was just filming myself doing like my goofy [ __ ] because when i when i add goofy i'll be doing nuts i look like crackit i literally convinced myself i was like i'm trapped here i'm never gonna be able to leave oh my god what the [ __ ] and then like as quick as it was for me to have those thoughts like even quicker for me to just get rid of those thoughts like i was thinking that and i was like oh my gosh i can't get up and then i was like [ __ ] yes you can and i was like just get up and i got up i ate the rest of whatever i didn't eat from domino's and i knocked out that sleep hit so different that was probably the best sleep i've ever had someone if someone i didn't that didn't know i had just taken an edible walked in and saw like how i was acting they would have the straight up just been like yeah this [ __ ] is a crackhead like they would have been like she's on some type of crack

excuse me thank you guys for watching", "bYpk6tIa5bw": "so in this video I'm gonna show you how I make gummy bear enchilados and I'm gonna show you guys a different method than my first video just in case you guys want to know um I have a lot of different recipes because I would try a lot of different stuff so I'm gonna show you what you're gonna meet you're gonna meet my I'd just have mine in this bottle this is actually a different brand this is don't burp it and then sometimes I use this mega you're gonna need your gummy bears a black forest to me is the best brand or type of gummy bears and if you can't get black forest i really suggest so warm white pine these are already open please my daughter open them i really suggest the walmart tank so then also you're gonna need your chili powders again you're gonna need candy powders I have Miguelito I have this fancy go Rico I have this new one that I bought it's called super Rico for Vito and I'm gonna put close-ups of all of them or a picture of all of them so you guys can see I have a lengthy mask seasoning and I have Tajin for spiciness I also have these particular packages this is what they come in I'm going to show you guys how I do this method with this candy right here it's called blue says got las I'm gonna put a close-up so you guys can see so basically this is somebody though I think yeah it says that my dingo it's just a big consistency like that and I'm just gonna show you guys how you can do it with different products it doesn't necessarily have to be the powdered sugar and chumlee mixture so I'm gonna melt this in the microwave for 10 seconds I'm gonna bring you guys in closer so I can see what's going on I'm gonna get my candy that I showed you guys and with the fork I'm just gonna scoop some in there I just got about that much because I'm I'm just gonna do one pack of gummy bears so I'm gonna scoop that in there and then I'm gonna pour some Chum way in there as well don't put too much cuz you can always put more so I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna put this in the microwave for 10 seconds and I'll be right back okay so this is right up right out the microwave so I don't know if you guys could tell but it melted a lot so I'm just gonna mix this and if you guys can see this is very very thick and we kind of want it a little bit more runny so I'm gonna add more Chum winter do you wanna just okay so that I wanna say that's kind of the consistency we're going for it I'm gonna do this much I only did a little bit because I don't want to make too much so now I'm gonna get my container and I'm gonna pour my gentlemen with my gummy bears in there and I'm just using the Walmart kind the great value and I'm gonna pour this mixture over it and I I didn't use all of it but are you quite a bit of it what I'm gonna do next is I'm gonna mix this and I'm gonna mix it very well [Music] [Music] so I'm just gonna stop right there and I'm gonna get a separate container in this container I have a live with it so I'm gonna put my gummy bears in there and I'm gonna start pouring in my powder so I'm gonna first start with this what the cool powders that I showed you guys right here and I'm just gonna drizzle it all over it okay I'm gonna use the particular eco Clady powder now I'm giving you stacking and I mean this just depends all on your preference you like a lot of time if you don't like it too spicy I'm gonna use the Valentina seasoning I'm using all the seasonings my short jaw in the beginning of the video I'm using super Rico and I'm gonna use a little bit of Miguelito I'm actually you put just a little bit more Tajin in it okay so now you want to cover your container you want to make sure you mix this very well okay so now that I've done shaking it I'm gonna go ahead and open it so you guys can see and there you have it delicious gummy bears enchilados I hope you guys like this video and I'll see you guys on my next video bye okay so here's a close-up so you guys could see how long they left don't eat [Laughter]", "DxZBva6YLVE": "now we'll use a sport or you could use any other stirring item and we'll just mix this until the corn syrup completely dissolves okay that should be good we'll take this to the awesome stove and pour it into this pot Willy to pouring two packets of unflavored gelatin go ahead and do that and then we'll leave 85 grams of jello for this part you could pretty much use any flavor you want you don't have to follow ours but we'll be using strawberry mmm this is the good stuff now I'll just get our wooden spoon mix this thoroughly until all the powder dissolves still need a stir in a bit more we could still see a few chunks [Music] okay once you get it to look like this you could stop stirring and then turn the stove on to low heat while we wait for that are gummy tray it pretty much feels like one of those rubber ice cube trays this set also comes with this dropper tool but wool actually be using this condom it squeeze bottle it'll be easier and faster to pour into the mold so after about 5 to 10 minutes on low heat your gummy syrup should be ready the texture should look something like this alright so at this point you're ready to pour but you may want to place your mold onto a plate or a cutting board it'll make it easier to transfer into your fridge you don't want to wobble your mold all the way over and accidentally spill it yeah that would be bad now that the gummy molds on the plates we'll pour the liquid into the condiment squeeze bottle it did where parents and sweet jelly hurry some sweetly catchy song right just made it up all right let's put the cap back on and we are ready to pour stir with this one on the bottom left if you guys are using a condom and squeeze bottle to be sure not to squeeze too hard it might overflow you want to just gently squeeze it and if you're using a dropper it might take a little longer but the gummies will still taste the same okay so I'm pretty much doing the same thing over and over again so let's fast-forward to near the end you had a few more left three two and the one whoo we just made fifty gummy bears here's a closer look at her beautifully filled gummy bears ah some of you may be impatient like me putting a lot to leave this in the fridge overnight boo and it's the next day I'm sure you could already tell just by looking at it but the liquids have turned into a gummy texture let's take one out whoa that came out pretty easily and the multi is pretty clean well I'm pretty impressed okay so this gummy bear came out in perfect detail you could see the arms the leg", "OCItY9oGobI": "hi everyone my name is kelly and thank you for checking out my video i started i freeze that because free secretive stuff is what i like to do so with that being said let's get into the video in today's video we will see what happens when we freeze gummy bears we will be doing three tests with the gummy bears in the freezer for the first test we will be freezing a few in a container so the second test will be freezing a few in a ziplock bag and just for the fun of it we will be freezing a few on a plate nothing on it just straight in the freezer okay gummy bears are in the freezer we will come back and check on them in a few days all right it's been a few days let's get the gummy bears out of the freezer very good ok guys as you can see the gummy bears are completely frozen solid we're gonna do a few tests with the gummy bears we're gonna let a few completely thought to see how they hold up afterwards I'm gonna try one frozen and we're gonna take a couple outside and see what happens if we throw them on the ground will these fashionably not let's find out okay let's test and see what a frozen gummy bear tastes like I think we're going for texture really cold it tastes like you only you girl it coal stone and you get gummy bears on your ice cream and to kind of like get cold from the ice cream that's what it tastes like so it's actually pretty good though would you recommend it as a treat yes okay guys we're gonna see what happens if we drop these gummy bears on the floor okay guys it looks like frozen gummy bears do not smash on the ground try the last one Nick and everyone for our last gummy bear test I brought in our gummy bear expert this is my niece Lily say hi Lily okay say hi to the camera we're gonna test the gummy bears and see how they did I left them on the counter overnight so let's see what they look like now that they are completely thought out we're gonna test the gummy bears in the container first they test it no need to go in there she doesn't like red yes she's ready to move on to the next one do you want to do the ones in the bag huh okay let's do the ones in the back which one do you want taste one out of the bag let's see if they're squishy here Lily go like this look see how they're squishy she gonna take cares yep okay let's taste them do you like them [Music] mmm all right you want to move on to the plate would you anyone oh now these ones on the plate are kind of I can tell they're gonna be really chewy and dried out they are not they're squishy but they have like a really dry feel that like Cody I'm gonna eat this one you meet that one oh that's not good okay if ya don't freeze gummi bears just straight on the plate that one she's shaking her nosey not as gross that was not good okay to recap the gummy bears froze really well in the freezer they tasted really good frozen they did not really break frozen which was kind of a bummer if you're gonna freeze them I would not freeze him on the plate because that was just nasty they were okay in a plastic container I wouldn't recommend container but I'd freeze them in the back when I froze them in the bag and I tasted them they were really good it tasted like if I just bottomed so if you want to freeze you got me bears Poneman as a blog back thank you guys so much for watching my video I want to give a shout out to my sister Melanie who helped me and encouraged me to do this video so thank you so much Melanie and a big thank you to my camera woman who's been holding the camera and helping me with this video if you guys

can't talk yes we can I need you to bad yep I didn't do anything that was a fail anyone how is it", "l9ISgglG9vE": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying some Albanese a gummi bears they were a dollar ninety eight for the bag at Walmart they're fat-free gluten-free low-sodium flavors well we'll talk about the flavors when I open them five servings are in the container ten pieces or another twenty calories so I'm gonna let Kevin take them out no smell incredible these gummy bears are something that we can't have in the house very often because Evan and I cannot be trusted with them to be honest we both like to just graze and pretend that they don't have any calories at all and before we know it they're all gone uh-huh they have this has cherry strawberry mango pineapple lemon orange green apple watermelon pink grapefruit lime blueberry blue sorry blue raspberry and grape so 12 flavors so do you want to try six and meet Ron six or do you want a high phone cuz they're out I'm trying to sort if some of each I tell you what they're pretty they're they're a very pretty color the regular Albanese gummies that we back don't have all that coating on the outside no they're just smooth there they're gelatinous looking you know just like a regular gummy these actually have a coating on the outside of these yellow it says yes we know these gummies are beautiful but before you base this new relationship purely on looks know that it's what's on the inside that matters now that you've been introduced go ahead cheer up in the bag and find out why our fans call them the world's best gummies could this be the start of a passionate love affair these are made in Merrell Indiana you can go to their website at www.petland.com I'm here as well 1 2 3 4 1 everything else I've got one right one it's open we're gonna look at them we're gonna pause for one second so I can take a picture because once we eat that red one it's gone and we'll be back okay I got a picture I think they're big enough to where we can split it I'm hoping let's try that red one first cuz it's the only one I mean and I'm curious is a really solid don't talk they taste different than the origin that is the cherry that's good mm-hmm like if you like sour that's really good and it hits a sour mm-hmm really there but some it's off for an instant and it goes what okay look I guess we've tried to read and was are two different helps to your brains actually I think this one's even I wasn't saying I can't you this that is that in that are active yeah and then you get the darker right yeah so there's three membranes right sorry green apple normally I would love you so much fun can like yes there's all sugar on the outside yes normally you would you would enjoy these normally you would enjoy them and suck on them but that's that was definitely great Apple okay what do you want next we're gonna do the elegant let's do the other gremlin yeah okay there's actually like I said three different prints mom mm-hmm that's what I think yeah mom I'm trying to get this part you camp the waves I felt it have to work Jordan once I have sewn the end of that I thought I was gonna be able to open up and look at it all right go down and open it no I don't think so because the chair is here I would have I would have torn it off completely that was alive it was very very good and they they all have had a very sour but Pleasant sound ah yes no burn your mouth ball sour to smooth some I'll have some men shot starring us though we'll make it now her watermelon drink some nothing that's watermelon mm-hmm yes okay come on how about the blue blue raspberry you know that right away yeah I like that one okay these could be a little and that's great hmm I almost did like a meeting right time to strike it's very nice though it's very strong in flavor each flavor is very strong and it's done right go wow that orange what's wrong it's so strong it's like a it's like a orange cool light but it's a little bit stronger than orange polite names like tang but that's what it takes would remind you of is orange cool like okay good no no okay let's do this I'm assuming this is gonna be strawberry don't think so since we already have cherry overall berry let me tell you what we have left we have a mango pineapple grapefruit and lemon oh so there's there's even two okay that looks like a dark darker than me we might have only gotten one that might be the pineapple in it you want to turn pro them Commission that the mango so no that's quite brekford this is pineapple and it was a darker yellow no that's one you would think that's a five yeah [Music] that's like a cleaner yeah that's very very limit or a suppose I bet you anything that is great for or mango I wanted to which is either why is praying at the best mango peach yeah it's mango and it's horrible I don't like that at all no mm ah it's just so hard so sour tart air in the tanks is just terrible all right so now you're taking a bit pineapple or go around pineapple or grapefruit okay gonna turn a darker blue all the whites that's a yeah that's great fruit there's sour ready so when you need a grapefruit you know they're great for your salad exactly it takes a minute once it got down my teeth it's like oh that's right dog okay so this one should be kind of I would open up some of these I actually got the color stuff right except for the aluminum oh definitely powerful yeah oh yeah so they only gave us one lemon and one cherry I'm sad about the cherry because I really like cherry the lemon I don't mind only getting one the mango mango veiling x2 oh they gave us three we ate one I don't mind that because it was gross the two flowers I don't like her or the lemon in the Mac the having grapefruit did they give us say it was for grapefruit so I'm trying they didn't give us very many as I was either you're more of a grateful person I don't mind it I wish they had given us more cherry and I wish they'd give us more orange because I do like the warranty what flavors do you think they gave us the most pineapple and the blue raspberry [Music] okay the blue raspberry I don't like it was too much though right but at least we did get one of each because we bought things before and it's like we want to review them for you and we didn't even have one of something and it's like like what I know yeah yeah we can't try because we should have bought two packages of whatever what out you think companies would make sure you at least got one of each but but we did so we can't remind the random thing is mix them all together but so I think these are good if you like sour things and you like gummies you like sour and gummies these are really good right hey you can you lend your tongue and kinda like dissolve that sugary part on the outside and they're still sour in the middle so I like that because some you dissolve with sugar on the coating on the outside this is going right beside so yeah I would rather have the regular sweet gummies but if you do like sour things which laughing with a lot of sour stuff it's gonna be good candy out of the tube I would rather have the original yes well yeah just something sweet but I do like things like you said for some of the sour I'm like these two it's different so I will have that picture for you at the end with the red gummy and thanks for watching [Music]", "89BV6rVYOBI": "and what's gonna be J it was good for us good bro what it's good faded family so you guys today I'm back with two thousand milligrams of liquid karma THC lien THC

hard time staying up on them I'm probably fifteen sixteen hundred milligrams deep first time in my life so forgive me if I don't finish it I might try my best to I just feel like if I finish you right

another episode of eating lunch i'm billy and i'm mark and this week we've been challenged we've been challenged and we're gonna try to accept the challenge let's see how we fare we got little nitro let's get into it [Music] we got little nitro here the world's hottest gummy bear recently we were challenged yep by abby we're challenged by abby she sent us a video hi mark and dilly i got a challenge for you you should have this the world's hottest gummy bear i feel like you what i want to see react yeah so we're going to try the world's hottest gummy bear today but before we get all crazy and we do that we're gonna go over our top five gummy candies and we got a bunch of gummies here today um we're gonna try some out we're gonna tell you which ones we like so if you just want to watch us burn our faces off skip two this time so my number five i found this very hard to create this list but for five i stuck gummy bears great choice i put gummy bears in there because they are a classic absolute classic when i was a kid i had a man named uncle dave who is my dad's like best friend in college he used to come uh visit my sister and i and i guess he got us this teddy bear when we were young or something and the first time he gave it to us he put gummy bears in this little pouch the bear had a little pouch on his belly oh that's cute so every time he would come again he would give us gummy mix i was always so excited for uncle dave to come here bring me some gummy bears my number five is real fruit when my mom would pack me lunch for school this was one of the like snacks i would get in my lunch bag and i was always so excited see for me but i think there is a difference between a gummy candy and a fruit snack and i think this kind of straddles the lime and almost falls into a fruit snack also for my number five and gummy bears going back to this i prefer the maynard gummy bear which i believe is the one uncle dave would would bring what's your number four my number four is neon worms nice now unlike gummy bears i can't tell you which brand of neon worms i like they're all good the iron worms seem to live in a brandless world my number four is gummy worms i can say gummy worms gummy worms not neon worms they are great they're fun you could just how about worms and dirt love worms and dirt haven't had worms and dirt in years here's a clip of us eating worms and dirt that's how much i want to have i know we kind of cheated we got pudding cups i just poured them in a bowl um go do this guys it's fine number three number three my number three so my number three is cherry blasters no way yeah nice that's my number three as well wow something that's weird though about cherry blasters and you can actually clarify to me which you prefer okay if you get a small pack like this yeah they're round circles if you get a larger pack like this they are a double circle with a little cherry stamp do you prefer the little circles or do you prefer the bigger version with the stamp the bigger version really yeah i'm a little circle boy you're a little when i get my shadow blasters i get them in a little pack i'm glad we share number three i know i don't think we've ever shared what's your number two though let's see this is gonna be interesting my number two is shockingly a newcomer in the field of gummies okay this product came out of nowhere and has quickly risen up my ranks to the number two spot and that is we have it right here the twizzlers gummies now you may be thinking this is kind of what i initially thought that this kind of thing would be like a twizzler a licorice twizzler that's not the case this is a full gummy it's not really on brand for twizzler at all it's got no licorice component it's just a good old-fashioned gummy with a twizzler looking tongue and they are delicious absolutely delicious very good what's your number two coke haribo yeah cause the cokes aren't all the same the the there's also the sour cokes add box burnt and the normal coke at pogba which are both karivo likes their gelatin to be dead no it's the haribo cokes and it's just it's also got a family memory every time my aunt would come over from germany she'd always bring the haribos so straight from germany i love these my number one is right here sour patch kids just a great um great gummy good shower um they recently added the blue guy i was just looking at that i was like where's that blue guy those blue guys blue raspberry and that really just put them over the top for me i think it was a great addition and it popped them up to number one when they used to maybe fall below cherry blasters i love the blue guy now and they're my number one gummy my number one is tiny bears gummy bears is their number one i was just thinking all morning i'm like you know what i love gummy bears i love how squishy they are i love how small they are they aren't too big like a worm i like to bite their heads off now my next question is would you ever buy a giant gummy bear or a giant worm would i ever maybe once would you regret it i would too okay as a man i am going to eat this gummy bear and as a woman i am also going to eat this gummy bear we only have one uh we're going to split it in half just like the chip what comes in this box you gotta you got little nitro himself he's packaged oh they want us to do five minutes without relief senko minito without relief okay we can do that here's little nitro he seems to be holding a nitro gun i think it's supposed to be a stick of dynamite that makes more sense little nitro is kind of like rock hard probably harder than a haribo even these guys are nice and squishy oh wow hear that if you drop this guy let's drop them okay smells spicy a little nitro going down let's do this five minutes this is for you abby thanks abby here we go it's already spicy oh i got spicer i tried to chew it real fast but it's hard to chew fast it's a rock we talking about this last week she got the spice hiccups my mouth is on fire this is worse than a chip we've got a minute and a half so far my ears are hot little niger i'm not joking around my head what are you feeling the back of my tongue is really hot yeah stinging i feel like my eyes are water wiring up a bit i'm trying to do it for abby having believed in us definitely hotter than your normal gummy bear i'm coming down a bit my body's still tense my tongue still hurts we're coming out to four minutes here that was my head's all spacey my head's all spacey i think they know that five minutes is the point where it's starting to cool off yeah yeah it's like you've you've done it you've done it at this point it's just like your regular hot sauce trying to loosen up the body here the body gets tense yeah that's five minutes five minutes do you want water the burn is leaving my mouth and it's slowly in my stomach what a ride what was worse that or the chip i think that was worse than the chip they're both pretty bad and they both lasted around five minutes okay you want to get into a bit of overrated underrated sure okay over it over it we'll see how this grows um let's start with watermelon salad spices overrated don't like them fuzzy peaches overrated i think fuzzy peaches are pretty highly rated sour keys completely forgot about them some that are rock hard and they like break when you eat them it's like eating an actual key and other ones are quite soft sometimes too soft i think sometimes they're definitely harder than cubby herbs a gummy bear you like biting a can yanking it it's kind of the fun of it it's kind of the what the key is known for this but you gotta get that it's right cannot be too hard now something that i do love is the big ones she touched her eye i washed my hands right after she chose not to and then she went and touched her eyes as a disclaimer if you're gonna go and try to eat a little nitro i would say don't touch your eye don't touch your eye so what are you uh sour keys overrated or underrated sour keys i think are properly rated i think they are partly overrated swedish swedish berries over edited let us know what your top three favorite gummies are here's joe's joke of the week march madness is here hope it's not as mad as last year it was cancelled last year people were mad um [Laughter] okay my travis is going on right now and i just i just have one question why so man and that was billy's joke of the week comment section time okay from brandon he's commenting on i mentioned them last week about the blazing wings he said the blazing wings were deadly haven't tried them again since that time at least there was no crying like when benny eats a lemon pepper wing but basically ben's sitting there eating a lemon pepper wing and it and tears are dripping down his face he's crying i think he said something about how he had a spicy wing before before and then the lemon pepper cut his tongue open and it got into the into the flesh of his tongue and it burns a lot and so cautionary tale from ben there yeah um ben if you're watching let us know what really happened sydney wanted more details on your jokes last week you didn't do i didn't tell a very good joke last week i didn't tell a joke at all just a funny experiment experience so yeah we walked into walmart there's the greeter at the front hall she said hi welcome to walmart and i went hey really enthusiastically um when we were leaving she did walk away and kind of ignored us after that yeah you really screamed at that walmart lady she was not expecting you know she was very quiet and you i yelled out ranked up the volume yeah you were very happy to see her john the can is so deceiving makes it look great i know those pringles so disappointing haven't touched them since i've tried them since and they they're still bad still bad he's insulted that we don't think he can fight a bear understandable we'll set it up okay and then your mom and gram are together going off on pringles yeah they're just pringles haters yeah i don't mind a pringle graham's saying the only pringle that's good is the plane um i think your mom is just completely against yeah she's like don't even they're not even a chip to her i love that we got some banter going on in the comments here a lot of people like to put their own comment but they don't reply to anyone else i encourage you guys to if you see another comment that you like comment let them know say hey hey say same page like graham did here i love to see that a little bit yeah i do a little banter in the comments it's a great word going on great work we're doing great anyways i think that's it for this week that's it my stomach's on fire and i'm yeah um little nitro really came after us thank you abby for the suggestion i think we passed your challenge yeah if you guys have any more challenges for us let us know let us know shred us now and uh we'll see you next tuesday [Music] peace", "ztvQhTfAVgY": "hello everyone welcome to wheat's the marijuana review show where we help you wonderful fine folks make sense of that crazy maybe now remote place you call your dispensary uh we're out here in beautiful sunny long beach today trying to stay as healthy as we can out here in the pandemic world don't worry i've got my mask on me um but we're gonna do even with this pandemic raging one of our favorite patented wheats reviews and today we are taking a look at a company that's quite big uh one that i don't think i have reviewed anything uh from yet but one that i'm very excited very much looking forward to giving a try and that is one of the many weed companies with the name canna that's right this is canna cannabis infused gummies k-a-n-h-a not the c or k-a-n-e-h of canaco or c-a-c-a-n-n-a of many other cannabrands all these are their 100 milligram gummies pretty standard issue um they are 10 10 milligram gummies so instead of the uh 20 doses you get the 10 in here which i normally prefer indica mango flavored and uh from my experiences with canna their gummies are usually pretty tasty too uh their gummies are quite affordable they're usually a little bit cheaper than uh like the plus gummies or steezy they come in usually a couple dollars cheaper i think i picked these up for 13 at a dispensary in long beach about two dollars cheaper than most gummies that i see in this area um and that indica mango gummy taste sounds really exciting so i'm going to try to open this up with one hand here and we'll get this review started like all of our wheats reviews uh guys the way that they're going to work is i'm going to eat this whole product not necessarily all in front of you on the camera here but i will eat all 10 of these gummies this is gonna be a little bit uh rocking here excuse me you just look at me this way for a moment hello child proof packaging there we are oh wow i could smell them the second that bag opened not the weed smell no weed smell just that that is very very very mangoey uh smelling wow that is a crazy mango scent uh here are the gummies themselves these aren't cubes like a lot of the gummies are these are little pucks very very sugary pucks that's a lot of sugar on it uh so let's give it a taste no weed odor but a crazy amount of mango scent my dog's pretty tired here i'm playing some frisbee oh wow yeah a little bit of um weed taste there at the end but early uh in our taste experience it's nothing but overwhelmingly sweet candy mango flavor uh but i mean that in a good way these are pretty good they go right down uh they're just coated in that mango sugar um so yeah in terms of flavor um no problems with the cannaba cannabis cannabis canna cannabis infused indica mango gummies um real good especially for that 13 price point but the taste is the smallest most insignificant part of the uh edible review uh the most important the signature thing about all edible reviews is it is it gonna get you high and for that you're gonna have to wait just a bit me i'm gonna polish these off over the next i said about hours so and then uh about two hours after i have that last one i'll come right back here and let you guys know if these can of gummies are as good as we hope until then stay safe stay high stay [Music] healthy hello folks i am back it has been two hours since my last can of gummy and the question is can of these make you high uh and the answer is yes they definitely can um these are pretty good uh i think their quality is maybe just slightly under that of like a plus or a steezy or something in that range uh but they are a little bit cheaper and they um hit almost just as hard tastes pretty good um all in all the canna is pretty pretty good uh value so if you see the canna and they're a little bit cheaper than some of the other gummies give them a shot unless you have a really big preference for one of the other brands as long as these ones are a little bit cheaper uh i i think they're going to uh you know this slightly less uh [ __ ] i should just start over holy [ __ ] i'm sorry to me i guess and welcome back to weeds guys it has been about two hours since my last canna cannabis infused indica mango gummy uh and i am very happy to say that uh my joyful journey uh was [ __ ] hello everyone welcome back it has been about two hours since my last canna indica mango gummy uh and my journey was as joyful as advertised uh these are pretty dang good um they are i would say just beneath the top sort of tier uh edible gummies out there uh they are cheaper i've seen these as i said at the beginning of the review routinely uh two or three bucks cheaper than their competitors um i would say they are not quite as good as again those like plus or steezy kind of gummies but they're so close and that price is is is a you know a nice enough discount that the trade-off may certainly be worth it for you um so uh yeah very happy with the can uh canna cannabis and views indica mango gummies uh really like that lion guy he's pretty cool looking um i also uh just now noticed that they are the winner of the most accurate accurately formulated edible by the sas the prestigious sas wow man uh i wish i had known that they were the most accurately formulated editable uh as awarded by the sas beforehand um because i would have you know done nothing different with that information uh speaking of doing nothing additional with any information let me share with you a little cherry on top little something extra that you can enjoy with or without your weed uh both of these though i would say uh probably gonna be a little bit enhanced with weed it's a two for one today uh i'm gonna uh give you the cherry on top of a two for one video game both from the same uh studio which is i believe annapurna the movie studio but they also make video games they had two that came out last year that are both great i think they are both available on ios and switch i played them on switch uh they are called donut county which is sort of like the inverse of a katamari dimashi where you uh met you start as a whole and you make stuff fall into a hole and then the hole gets bigger and then you can have bigger stuff fall into the hole which makes the hole even bigger so that even bigger things can fall into it it's amazing donut county the other one is called sayonara wild hearts very dumb name uh i mean it's kind of a cool name but it's also kind of embarrassing to say sayonara wild hearts out loud uh but it is uh sort of it embraces the cheesiness of that name in the game itself it's kind of impossible to describe both of these games take about 90 minutes to play um and uh they're both available super cheap check them out donut county and um sayonara wild hearts and maybe while you're checking those out try some cannabis canna cannabis infused indica mango gummies it may make them even fun more fun funner more funner until then stay safe stay healthy stay high and we'll see you guys for the next review bye", "CYHTDnsuZGY": "ready for a fun simple treat for you and the family let's get started today we're going to be making one of my favorites gummy bears but wait we can't have gummy bears on keto correct not so fast today we're going to make something that is super simple and it really only requires three simple ingredients all right so the ingredients we're going to need real simple today i went down to walmart and picked up four of the sugar-free flavors of jell-o it's really all you need when we make this recipe keep in mind i'll put the macros at the end but 20 calories absolutely zero carbs three proteins per and that's going to give you about 25 gummy bears per serving you can get the molds and amazon i also picked up an additional mold for the gummy worms those are just a little bit extra fun so all right to get started we're going to go with a quarter cup of water in the pot we're going to bring it to a slow boil now one of the things i told you is that this is super simple we're going to go with two simple ingredients i'm going to start off with a little bit of the sugar-free orange and just pick you up a packet of unflavored gelatin that's really about all you need bring it down a little bit so we don't we don't burn it out but that's really all you need i'm going to bring this in and let's get started start by putting in our one packet of our gelatin and then we'll put in our one packet of orange stir this in and you're going to want to go until everything is fully dissolved okay now that we've got our jello completely melted we're simply going to take an eye dropper that we we got with our molds and we're going to start filling the molds it's that simple [Music] okay so as you can see the one box gave us about 35 gummy bears and gave us an additional three of the gummy worms now keep in mind we said a little bit earlier and we'll put the macros out uh shortly after this but for all that we just made for the 35 or so gummy bears and the and the worms you're talking uh pretty much zero carbs on any of this stuff it's a great fantastic substitute for when you have that sweet tooth or for when you're just wanting to have something a little bit different like a gummy bear we're gonna go ahead and fill up the rest of these and once we're done i'll be right back [Music] as you can see we're starting to wrap up what we have um and we've made quite the load of uh quite a load of gummy bears um this is going to be an actually a fantastic treat to have but i'll tell you what so we talked a little bit about um what we can do for these and how we can snack now it's time for the real talk okay guys so we've finished our first recipe we've got some good gummy bears now the part that we're going to talk about here is going to be the real talk about keto so you're going to see a ton of recipes and a lot of them are going to sit there and say that they taste just like the real thing i don't want to break your heart they don't taste like the real thing and so many of you noticed it's just gelatin and jell-o sugar-free jell-o and so many people want to look at that and say well what you basically made is you've made jell-o shots or jell-o bears or jell-o gummy bears or whatever you want to call it just sugar-free and you're not wrong and so this kind of goes into the keto mindset about how you've got to look at your food a lot of the things you'll see on the keto diet are going to be very similar to some of the foods that you eat but not exactly the same and the reason being is that we don't use a lot of the same ingredients that are in a lot of the foods and i give a really good example what we make today has literally zero carbs you can eat these things until your heart's content you're talking about 20 calories per serving of about 25 that's an entire handful and by comparison i'm going to show you something that i think is very interesting [Music] that right there when i went to go pick up our gelatin and the jell-o sugar-free jell-o at the store today i ran across as i was getting some himalayan salt which is another great keto staple there was a a little container of sugar-free gummy bears and it was kind of unique because that's what we were making today now as part of that one of the things that we had seen was that a single serving um 200 i'm sorry a single serving is 47 carbs 47. and out of that 170 calories and 5 protein but 47 carbs if you're really starting to look at it and this is where the the uh the product type and the serving size start to come into play this container was literally maybe a little bit bigger than a tuna can for some comparison and it said that in that container there was nine servings so i can tell you that before i started keto i could eat the entire container not a problem it's not that much it was probably three handfuls of gummy bears now what they did say on the label was a serving size was eight gummy bears so for eight gummy bears you've got 47 carbs 5 protein and 170 calories and so i look at that and i go okay so what am i really getting in real life food and so what you're really looking at is if you break it down you are getting about 211 carbs 765 calories and 22 protein that's what you're going to get if you eat just half of it and that's really kind of typical of the standard american diet and so when we start looking at things for keto and you start looking at how you revise the way you think about food the jello gummy bears make perfect sense you can have them they taste pretty similar to gummy bears your taste buds are going to change and they're going to acclimate to some different things but you're going to be able to go in and actually have something that you can take to the movie theaters when they open again um you're going to be able to take them outside you're going to be able to give them to your kids for snacks they are sugar-free and they're just a great alternative for when you really want something for the sweet tooth so really look at the gummy bears as something that is an alternative to what you used to eat and that's what's really important about this recipe it's not that it's a simple two ingredient recipe where you're using a little bit of water some gelatin and some jello and that's not what it's really about what it's really about is revising the way we think and revising the way we eat and how we view how we view food and so if i can have an option of having 50 i'm talking a big old bowl of gummy bears that taste like it and i hit and run the refrigerator sometimes i'll grab a handful of these things out of a ziploc bag or container and i know that i'm only getting 20 calories and zero carbs it's perfect i hope you enjoyed this video hope you enjoy the real talk it's the honest talk i'm still fairly new at keto we've been doing it now for about five six months and so we're learning every day and i hope you continue to stick with us and i hope you do the journey with us take care", "mabfxc09iq8": "hey guys welcome back to my channel today I'll be sharing the super easy recipe and this seems to be the latest craze right now all the kids are eating it everybody's buying it and do you know what I'm gonna share with you my simple version of it because it's so easy to make you're gonna need a bag of gummy bears and this is the party size it's twenty eight point eight ounces and you can use whatever gummies you have at home I also have these sour watermelons like GE but you can use sour patch kids you can use lifesaver gummies whatever kind of gummies you have use it anyway powder is basically plum powder it's a popular thing here in Hawaii and they have different brands as well but this Brown seems to be the popular one here you're also going to need lemon strips the Jade Brown is my favorite one if you can't find that they have different brands I found these as well they're called Rocky's and they also have local kind snacks some one that you don't want in don't get this don't get the lemon peel because this actually has seeds in it and you don't want that in your candy we're gonna also need one lemon juice from one lemon and just a little bit of sugar as well so let's get started the first thing you want to do is go ahead and blend your lemon strips in a blender the consistency that you want and you want it really fine and shred it because this will help to quote the gummy bears at the end when you're ready for alright so next you want to go ahead and juice one lemon and I have this little gadget here alright so I have my lemon juice and I actually measured this this is equivalent to two tablespoons of lemon juice so you want to go ahead and pour that in a bowl you also want to add one tablespoon of sugar two teaspoons of leaky moy powder and you want to go ahead and mix this until the sugar is dissolved completely so the sugar has completely dissolved at this point you want to go ahead and give it a little taste to see if you want it sweeter and if so go ahead and add in another tablespoon of sugar but I kind of like it this way because the gummy bears is already sweet and the lemon strips have sugar in it as well so I'm gonna just stick with one tablespoon next step is to add the entire bag of gummy bears go ahead and give it a good mix and make sure that the gummy bears are evenly coated with the lemon syrup [Music] here is a close-up of the final product you can see that every single gummy bear is covered with those lemon strips and that's just how I love them and I also went ahead and put the gummy bears and these little plastic containers cuz I'm gonna just give it out to family and friends anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this easy recipe give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below and feel free to share my video if you want to anyways thanks for watching guys and I'll see you guys next time Aloha", "0MWFW4tKCVY": "so i just want to thank clumsy cakes for joining me we're doing a collab video i am doing the vegan version of uh gummy bears so for the vegan gelatin we're using sea vegetable agar agar this will act as a gelatin for sweetener i'm using more agave i also have some elderberry i say some blue blue tea thingy thing and this blue tea blender is amazing i'll list her etsy shop down below i have some ginger tea spirulina some pineapple juice and i'm also going to juice off some carrots and then i have my gummy bear mold that just came in from amazon so let's make our cheese and get everything all together all right so we have our carrot juice we have our pineapple juice sugar we have our butterfly um tea we have our green tea which i'm gonna add spirulina soup partially aloe vera tea and i'm just gonna add one tablespoon or one or two tablespoons of blue agave you can add whatever you want and i'm also going to add one in a half teaspoon of your agra agar um you have to heat up your liquid first so i'm just going to measure out a fourth cup of everything heat it up and then we're going to make these into beautiful gorgeous uh gummy bears that are natural colors no additives no food coloring and yeah actually just using my measuring cup two ounces is fourth cup you can also use a scale um but i like using my liquid measuring cup and i'm making a mess which is normal all that good old carrot juice just sitting on the counter so this is two ounces i'm going to heat it up and then i'm going to add the aggregate and i'm going to do this for every single one just doing a quick photo shoot of everything so you guys can see what it looks like this is for my thumbnail and this looks so pretty it's a purple color um but i know if you add an acid so like a lemon juice or lime juice it turns pink so i'm actually gonna do that but yeah guys these are all the ingredients i'm letting the carrot juice actually half of it is on the stove heating up and then we're gonna add agar agar at all and make our beautiful natural gummy bears so after a couple of minutes on the heat i've heated up the carrot juice you can see it change it color and we're just actually going to add this directly to our dropper or gummy bear mold not our dropper using our dropper you just want to make sure most of your um what is it called i got argos dissolve you can see it but this is very good so i'm just i added in one tablespoon of uh which i'm gonna call it what is this called this stuff agave and then i also added in a half a teaspoon of ginger powder because i love the taste of ginger it's also very medicinal so yeah we're just gonna drop it in there so using our dropper we're just gonna go right in there we're gonna fill it up and we're gonna drop it in our mold this does not hold a lot it's so cute and then you're just gonna repeat this until all of them are full i might not even need all this liquid to be completely honest i'm only going to do three rows of this one and then i'm going to fold do the same process with all the other ones and i'll be back to show you guys what the gummy looks like but same exact process heat your liquid up add one and a half teaspoon of agar agar powder a tablespoon to two tablespoons of your sweetener of choice and yeah that's all and then fill it up in your mold the mold and everything will be listed down in the description bar this one i want to see you guys i want to show you guys how to change the color of this because you see what color it is now we're going to do this in slow motion so for the clear gummies i decided to use some of my hibiscus and rose water it's super easy to make and i'm going to use this to make my clear gummies and i'm also going to fill in the rest of them this tastes and smell just like hibiscus and rose it is so flavorful and then i'm also going to use some of the leftover pineapple juice to fill in the extra so yeah i'm super excited to make this into the clear gummies and then i'll show you guys can you see they're so adorable and cute and jelly you can see the jello consistency they're not too sticky actually and they're so cute look at it so i'm going to take them all out and plate them look at them they're so cute and these are the pineapple ones they're so cute okay so these are all the gummies they're kind of sticking together so i'm gonna rub them with cornstarch as she suggests in her video which is linked down below for those looking to make um gummies out of jello some jellos i think are vegan i would have to double check that and i'll let you guys know down in the description bar but these are what mines look like again i'm using these for vitamin purposes if you're using if you're looking to make a more gummy i will put some other substitutes for gelatin down in the description bar below okay we're going to go through the flavors so this first one right here is a pineapple and carrot the one following it is elderberry this one next to it is carrot this one is pineapple this one is butterfly pea flour tea with key lime this one below it is the butterfly pea without key lime this one is my rose water hibiscus water with a little bit of agave this one's spirulina this one's just green tea and this one is elderberry those are all of the flavors that i created and they look so cute so in regards to flavor my favorite two ones are the butterfly pea little phase three um the pineapple and the elderberry i'm gonna try the green tea one now because i didn't try it yet and then i'll let you guys know yeah so these four right here are my favorite the other ones are just from medicinal like medical not medical but for vitamins because you know you need to consume them every day the best place to store these are in the fridge i'm going to dust mines with a little bit of corn starch so they don't stick together in a little bit of sugar but yeah that's how you make vegan gummy bears they're not super gummy but they get the job done you",

toilet between 15 and 20 times since Chris left about two hours since we consumed the gummy bears and hold on excuse me for one second that came out of my ass I have been doing that for yeah the better part of two hours it calmed down a little bit in between there maybe I had about a 15-minute break and all of a sudden I was sitting I was watching a new jontron video and incredible amounts of

[Music] [Music] you", "o2Y25GpYlCo": "hey everyone here's a quick recipe for these amazing immune boosting vegan gummies that will help get your little ones through the school year you'll need raw sugar agar powder vitamin C powder elderberry syrup water 100 percent juice gummy molds and a whisk turn your pot on low and the first thing your porn is your water and then you'll add your juice and then you'll add your elderberry syrup stir that in and mix it in really nicely and then slowly begin to add your egg our powder don't add it all at once because then it'll clump up and it won't be the right consistency for the gummies but slowly add it in while you're constantly stirring because if you stop stirring then it'll like clump up and you don't want that so make sure you just constantly but slowly stirring while you're adding your car powder ain't nothing keep stirring now you'll see the mixture start to thicken up and then that's when you'll speed up your stirring because you don't want to make sure to stick at the bottom it won't it usually doesn't but just go fast anyway and then you'll add your vitamin C powder and a dash of sugar to taste if you used juice with added sugar you probably don't need it but if it was you know 100% juice with no sugar then just add a pinch of raw sugar now that the mixture is done pour it into a measuring cup and you can pour it into your mold right away you could use the dropper that comes with the molds little kit things but I don't I mean you could just imagine how long that would take plus that's more for gelatin because with the guard powder the mixture the little too thick to use the droppers if you don't have your measuring cups you can go ahead and use a spoon I do a lazy hack for these smaller molds I just pour it in a row as you can see because doing it one by one would take all day and then I clean it up with a spoon or spatula whatever I have on hand to try to work as fast as possible because the mixture is cooling as we work and it is gonna eventually solidify if it solidifies before you get a chance to finish filling your mold you can just go ahead and pop it into the microwave if you use a microwave or you can do what I do and I let it sit in a pot of warm water after about 10 to 20 minutes the mixture has solidified completely all the gummies are ready to pop out they pop out very easily it's kind of a no-fuss finish you don't have to worry about the cleanup because even the cleanup in the container or the pot ill just it's a jail now at this point sort of just slide off so just gonna finish taking your gummies out of the mold some of them may have some extra whatever on the sides my daughter doesn't care but if your children do just clean them up with a butter knife grab an airtight container or a jar to store them in these will keep for about two to three weeks and you're all done [Music]", "oHn0K1PN1tg": "[Music] so [Music] so [Music] let's go [Music] oh [Music] oh

playtime thank you to all my subscribers for asking me to make gummy bears and yes I do have a video already uploaded about how to make gummy bears using gelatin but in this video I'm going to do something different something where some people out there sitting at home don't like gelatin in their food so I've come up with a different recipe I've come up with a vegan vegetarian recipe on making your own gummy bears so for all the families out there I hope this is the winner for you and if this doesn't interest you I do have another video with gelatin so let's get started so the first thing you need to make sure you have is your glucose syrup so that's it that's the replacement for corn syrup so either glucose or corn syrup you also need some water you need some fruit juice you need some citrus pectin which is um you can actually get that from the health foods section in your supermarket or from any health food store and it is actually made in Mexico so for anyone over in America at the moment and you'll be able to find it I'm sure you also need some pink food coloring and over here you need some agar agar now agar agar is going to replace our gelatin fruit our citrus fruit pectin is actually going to replace our jelly so we also need some citrus acid citric acid if you're going to roll it in to make a sour type of lollies and some castor sugar and I've just got some icing sugar in a bowl here ready for when I roll them to make them just nice and plain we also need our sauce spoon a spoon make sure it's wooden or plastic because if it's a metal one it will heat up all the ingredients too quickly and also we can't forget our silicon molds so let's get started so the first thing you need is 1/2 a cup of water and place that in your saucepan you also then need 1/4 of a cup of glucose syrup and it's really really thick and gluggy so just be careful and take your time and then just give it a nice mix you need to mix us so both ingredients are nice and smooth together so our next step is to put our gelatin replacement in and that's going to be our agar agar now you can get that from your health food section in the supermarket or your health food store and it's gluten free its fructose free dairy free nut free and lactose free so anybody out there that's suffering from any of those this is the alternative to still make gummies and still have fun so in a normal recipe where it says how much gelatin you need just convert it into the same amount in agar agar so in my previous video it was two tablespoons of gelatin so I'm going to use two tablespoons of agar agar and we're going to mix that in and make sure there's no lumps okay so once you've mixed it and it's all nice and clear we're now going to put our jelly replacement in now what we want to do is we want to put one cup of our fruit juice so I'm just going to use my half a cup and I'm going to do two halves to make a one cup so I've got one half and then my other half to make one and in jelly it also does have gelatin in jelly so with this I'm going to use citrus pectin and what that is is that's gluten free as well dairy free it's soy free and it's lactose free and it's not free so all we're going to do is use three and a half teaspoons of this so it's a bit thick so we're going to add one and a half cups of water and now put three cups of sugar our last thing we need to put in is a food coloring so I've chosen the pink okay so now all of my ingredients are mixed together let's go over to the stove and heat it up and fingers crossed away so turning on the gas stove and just move it down to more of the lower heat and place our mix on and just keep stirring so keep stirring it until it goes nice and clear and it goes nice and like sticky if that makes any sense and once it cooks to that part then it's ready to put in our molds so come with me and let's start putting it in and so just using two teaspoons just carefully place it the mixture into your molds I'm using silicon molds just because it is easier to and take the gummies out afterwards so now I've put my molds in the fridge for half an hour and then in half an ounce time we'll see what we've got fingers cars yeah okay so our gummies are already they're out of the fridge so they're ready to be demolded and we'll see what we have got oh wow that looks great and so yes they are sticky like my other video so I've got my sugar my icing sugar and my citric acid here on plates and so that's just going to give me different flavors okay so there you have it I've got vegan vegetarian lactose-free gluten-free gummy lollies which I would probably say has a little bit of a jelly texture to them and they're not as chewy as your gummy so I suppose I now I have to do the taste tester so here we go let's just do a plain one mmm yeah definitely a jelly type of line really good now I've got the plain one to do so that's just plain no coating mmm and you can see inside is very jelly like absolutely amazing I know you're waiting for to see my face with the sour one I'll be ready I really travel that really jesu at the same time so thank you to all my subscribers that has asked me to do gummy lollies I have given you two videos because I just love you all so much enjoy I hope you enjoy making these at home be safe don't forget to Like comment and subscribe and I'll see you in my next video", "1wSCMic5Epo": "[Music] hello and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are looking at a trusty lovable brand one that we reviewed a couple of times in the past and like them every time we're gonna take another look at them in this post and apocalypse world and that is the fine folks at cannabis syrup well mostly for buying folks I think they do some review inflating on weed maps that has me a little peeved but for the most part I do like cannabis quite a bit this is the hundred milligram variety cherry flavored I think we've done grape and chocolate didn't change arena in the best so now we're doing cherry again this is 100 milligrams 10 servings of 10 milligrams each of course we're just going to do it in one I've like canvas syrup every time I reviewed them I find them to be quite potent I think that they are reviewed by s or excuse me they are they used to at least be reviewed by SC labs but I don't see it on here right now but I'll double-check that but independently verified doesn't taste terrible I therefore being unfortunately has a bad texture it it's gonna or thickness it's got like a cough syrup like thickness or at least it used to well let's just go ahead and shut up and open this up and and give it the old-fashioned review here alright almost done with the protective loo balloon okay here we go here is our cherry liquid maybe we could just do it in one gulp that's fine now I do have a chaser here in case things go badly but let's not let's hope that doesn't happen down the hatch did I get it no oh it's like robitussin well it's no good it's not terrible it tastes like cherry cough syrup um but it won't get you uh what's the word for when you do sizzurp I can't remember whatever that kind of crunk is or drunk or [ __ ] up this won't get you that it'll get you high but it won't get you whatever it is like doing coding also don't do coding and I'm done oh well glad to be done with it and guys if you've never tuned in two weeks before you're gonna have to wait a couple more seconds to find out how it's actually going to affect me cuz that's the most important part of the edible review how it makes you feel not how it tastes so I'm gonna sit here stew for the next two hours see how I'm feeling and I'll come back to you guys to let you know thanks for watching wait so I'll see you in just a second this cherry is a real peach that was terrible but this is really good another kind of a syrup another winner ten bucks for this I had a discount to think it got up like seven bucks did it taste terrible it has a cough syrup it kind of flavor as I went over ad nauseam but I'm high I'm still high right out of the sort of six ish kind of range five six someone there feeling good like the format like the syrups it's an easy quick discreet way of doing it this might be the last cannabis we review or review for sometime maybe we'll try some of the higher dose ones because I think they do actually have some like two under or not I've tried that 200 milligrams I think they might have 500 milligrams I'm not sure but maybe we'll do some of those but for the lower doses the 100's the 200s that is going to do it for our cannabis reviews we know they're good now we can concretely say that you can pick up cannabis and feel like you're gonna get your money's worth happy to tell them are happy to give them a good review so again this was the cannabis cherry 100 milligrams from cannabis give it a shot if you haven't already I think you'll be quite happy with cannabis when you do that's going to do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a future review peace", "HPimeP9aCrg": "okay

Personally, it's actually really hard. I think I would actually rather\na hot dog, is that weird? Unless it's a chicken burger. If it's a chicken or a\nturkey burger, I will do it. But I'm just not really into beef. I'm not into beef, I don't\nknow what it is about it. And our refreshment of choice is The Coldest, Coldest,\nColdest Water Bottle. So, you can get yours\nin the description box. I also apologize, I'm actually\npretty sick right now, so I'm just trying to keep it together.

Let's do one of these little babies. Literally so cute, oh my gosh. Last time when I had these,\nI thought that this red part was the ketchup. Yes, I'm very silly. That is the beef patty. What type of burger would\nthat be if it was a lettuce, cheese, and tomato burger? Doesn't make sense. Alright, cheers. Okay, now for this crazy pizza. Look, it's actually so\ncute, like it closes. Wait. Oh my gosh, I literally can't, I can't. So it closes like that. I'm literally like a 12 year\nold, I'm not even joking, like I'm 24 and turning 25 this year. I swear I am a 12 year\nold at heart, honestly. This is our pizza. Look, it has like olives right there. I guess some sort of spaghetti on it, I don't know why there's that, but. Should I eat it like that? I'm just gonna set this down. Alright, so whatever this\nis, or supposed to be. Let's eat it. Okay, let's have some olives. There's like a little orange, but it's probably supposed to\nbe like a pepper or something, or I don't know. Maybe an onion. This is supposed to be a pepper. Okay, so now let's build our little pizza. So here's our pizza, we have a teddy bear on there. Put the olive, okay. We have something else, I\ndon't know what this is, but put it on there. And our egg. Here we go. Here, oh my gosh, okay\neverything just fell off. This is the story of my life. Just kidding. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh, like work with me. Okay. Here's our pizza.

oil to make my gummy bears so even though we're going to be using a quarter cup of coconut oil i'm going to measure out a half a cup of coconut oil because we're going to lose some of that coconut oil during the infusing process so just keep that in mind all right guys my cannabis is now the carb so now i'm going to add our coconut oil to the mason jar now i'm going to add a teaspoon of lecithin to my mason jar all right guys so now we're going to do is put this in a pot and let it simmer for about two hours add your pot to the stove [Music] add your mason jar now let it simmer for about two hours all right guys so i've been over two hours so now we're going to filter out our cannabis [Music] all right guys my cannabis coconut oil is now done so now let's start working on the cannabis gummies so before we start working on our gummies i'm going to spray my gummy molds with this non-stick cookie spray all right guys so now what i'm going to do is put my pipe on the stove and now we're going to turn the temperature on low [Music] so now i'm going to add in my water i'm going to be using 2 3 cups of water [Music] guys what i actually recommend you to do is turn your stove on like medium heat just so it can speed up the heating process and then once my water get kind of hot i'm going to reduce the temperature back down to two and then add in my cannabis oil and then all of the other ingredients so um so that's what i'm gonna do all right guys so i let my temperature stay on medium heat for about two minutes and now i can see the water is starting to boil a little bit so now what i'm gonna do is reduce the temperature back down to low [Music] all right so now we're going to do is add the candle oil [Music] now i'm just going to mix it together now another thing too guys usually water and oil wouldn't mix but that's why i added the lecithin to my can of oil so if you already have kind of oil made and it's not made with lecithin at this point i would add a teaspoon of lecithin so just keep that about all right guys so we're going to keep the temperature on low and i'm just going to let the water and the wall incorporate together all right guys my mist is fully incorporated so now we're going to add the unflavored [Music] gelatin [Music] and just mix it together so i'm just going to mix for about 2-3 minutes i want to make sure everything is incorporated all right guys so now we're going to do is add in our pack of [Music] jello [Music] all right guys so now we're going to do is add our mix to the mold all right guys so once you finish filling your modes put your bows in the freezer for a few hours [Music] all right guys so been about four hours so now we're going to remove the gummy bears from the mood so now what i'm trying to do is just remove some of the extra gummies from the gummy bears if that make any sense so so this right here i'm going to strip that from the gummy bears just to make it look a little bit better [Music] there we go [Music] all right guys my cannabis gummy bears is now done to my left is the medium-sized gummy bears and to my right is the small size gummy bears i personally like the medium size better but what i'm going to do is leave the link for both sides in the description below but um thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace [Music] you", "x8UW3AYy9VY": "hi guys it's annie let's eat today we have our little woo halloween candies yay this year we didn't do any trick-or-treating because of covid and i bought a little bit of the halloween candy that we would normally you know get from trick-or-treating is eaties here except for the blood and brain i know this is very interesting i've never seen this before this here is syrup i think it's syrup i hope it's syrup i mean they wouldn't sell it it was not edible right so this is supposed to be a bag of kind of like oh it's leaking yeah because i did it yeah you did do you want to try this one for summer it's kind of cool look how cool it is i've never had this before never know and then we got some brain over here gummy brains we have sticky sticky syrup and we have some marshmallows of course then we have eyeballs some eyeballs and we have these little whirly things these are just add-ons really because they're so good yeah i love the rainbow um sour patch we have some cute little burger gummies here they actually feel really good when you like do this yeah they're quite soft and it actually says fries i'm excited for these because these smell and look really good and we have oh henry i always ask the kids to get me an old henry bar every time they go trick-or-treating yeah and that's what they ask for actually right yes and kitkat i love kitkat yeah that's the one thing that i left out so yes well we don't have kitkat we don't have kitkat it's okay we got these so okay which one are you gonna start with emma i feel like i'm gonna start with the oh henry where's my oh henry oh it's right here because it's gonna melt oh yeah you're right the chocolate is melting cheers if we went trick-or-treating this year emma what would you be a school person what do you mean a school person i got a teacher no a school person like a student i would guess that you would want to be mulan because you were obsessed with mulan for a couple months when the movie came out and you liked that character since last year then i moved on to stitch there isn't a costume for stitch though i can make it a mangas character or monkeys i'm not familiar with the language it's a game i know it's a game i've seen you play it a couple of times is it just like hide and seek no how do you play that game so it's like um there's like either like two or one imposters and uh you can dress up when you're waiting for like more people to join because you have like these like a maximum like it's either 10 or like maybe four people so and then i always joined like almost like nine players to 10 so and then i joined and then um so we have to figure out who's the imposter so if if the impostor kills someone and you turn into a ghost and you try to have to do all the tasks to win tasks i mean and find the imposter yeah and the other p people have to report the body and the imposters can vent like go through um like vents and then um um the crewmates can like uh pool mates yeah crewmates they can press an emergency button and they can report the body and find out who is the imposter and then they just go floating around when they they so does the imposter like try to take you out like try to kill you in the game uh um or do you just have to figure out who it is yeah you have to figure out like the crewmates like one imposter if and impossible because you're really good if the imposter kills you you turn into a ghost and you have to finish all tasks to win if you're a see you ghost and you can't um like help anyone and you can text in the game but if you're a ghost you cannot text no one can see you yeah it's like serious like in two if there's two girls a ghost and there's one more ghost so three ghosts you can talk to the two other goats ghosts because they're ghosts you lost me at ghost your mind you should try these gummies these are supposed to be zombie gummies you know actually quite tasty and they're not too sweet so which is

see you guys next time", "o9c3-FqnrVI": "what up YouTube it's me Rashad a couple of my subscribers they hit me up in the comments and never fight how do you make gummy worms and kool-aid I'm about to show you how the technique that I use to make Magnum worms just so I can understand how I make them come on let me show you out so in order to make you good mornings with kool-aid you're gonna need it a couple things you're gonna need some sandwich bags you eat this this this one right here just thing of kool-aid this container DV something works alright yeah I've been eating on this thing I know so it ain't gonna be a full amount but it usually makes about 23 bags when you bag them up and put a pin in there first things first is you want to wash your hands so before that wash your hands before you touch any air anything all right I'm a working man as well so you get another plastic bag and you you do it like this I'm gonna put ten in the bag that's how I do it alright that's four that's ten in the bag that quick alright then let me show you how I put the kool-aid in it you just get a scoop like this right you see it's kool-aid in here you get a scoop I don't have to be a full scoop and you never put a fluid after much and you go like that in this watch I have a link in the description if you want to find out about this watch it's a cool watch you get from Amazon well yeah that's all you put up again that's all you put up in there and then you rub it around like that and you go like this it's I get all the air out so you don't want it to pop and you don't you want to save as much space in your bag as possible alright so now that's cool when you put it aside if you're making a bunch of these what I did was I put 10 in the bag right I built up the whole bag 10 10 10 10 10 that's all artists anyone who's going out of here alright that's right all those dimmer ones were going I'll get the scoops and up I'll get the scoops like this and I'll pour them in the bags and then I'll tie them up like I said I'll put them all in the bag right I'll shake it up and I'll tie it up get the air out and inside the trip you gonna need some of these little kool-aid packets to make the great time you could experiment with other flavors but I've tried it a couple of times with other flavors and nothing that comes close to the great time alright like I tried orange and didn't taste right but you can try an experiment you pour the regular kool-aid in there right you see how much is in there it's only that much because I'm not gonna pour it on me good I'm not gonna make that me all right and then you pour this one in there and see how it looks pouring it in there but you don't want to pour too much of this kind in here because it's real potent like it's real sour and then you mix it like this right it doesn't have to get real purple but if it you don't want it to be too pink or it's not going to taste that great if that's a freakin word this is great it's not a word okay it's not going to taste very much like grape it is trooper this is to paint compared to that pink one that's purple when you see it that's the paint regular and that's the one mix and I'll just make a city anymore just because okay these are the normal gummy worms with kool-aid and hair are the great ones but more pinkish and grape ones look more purplish now when you leave them in your bag overnight it precipitates they like it'll be moisture in the bag but that's normal all right that's how you make them work the kool-aid I'm done subscribe the light fighters I got more videos coming out random videos technology videos this me blah blah too long this channel just show you how to do stuff you want to know how to do something in the comments come out over shot talk to y'all later

because the thing is a lot of them are filled with additives that fill with dyes synthetic ingredients a loved one from the health food stores no we're talking I'm talking regular ones when you make your own you control what's in them and if you buy these very healthy ones super expensive yeah I'm going to show you how to make them well let's show show us how miss Barrett what do we often as well that is okay that really do that is it's such an easy recipe that's what I love about it look how pretty they are as well pretty so what you need is you're going to use fruit juice organic fruit juice not juice from concentrate and the reason is because you want it to be really strong okay have a lot of taste what is this one this one is elder berry and I like to use a juice that has added health benefits and elderberry is very good for your immune system right then we have gelatin if you're vegan you can use agar agar flakes that is a sea vegetable is a wonderful option for a vegan or a vegetarian you have honey and then you have the vitamins that you're going to use you can customize use which are the vitamins you want today I'm using vitamin C powder you could do a be even a probiotic okay all right so that's it how do we make these well I actually made a few earlier so just let's roll in the tape oh look at those so what I did was I put the juice in a little saucepan like so then I sprinkled on the gelatin and here's the really fun part now is that I whisk the gelatin in and then I left it for a while to see it blue it blooms which means that it absorbs all of the liquid then I put it on the heat and it started to liquefy so you want it to break up and to completely liquefy then I'm adding some nice raw honey to it and then finally I'm putting in powdered vitamin C or vitamin C loading it up there and then whisk it again make sure there are no lumps in it spray really important to chocolate mold or a candy mold I use that doesn't stick right exactly then I used a turkey baster just to add it into the little candy molds and then I am going to let it set for just a couple of hours in the fridge and we are done and what we actually have here is the little set ones and you may try one if you like right there mark what if they don't come out of the mold so mark they do they do come out of the molds really do all right you can control the amount I have my determine C for the day you've got your vitamin C for the day work do what if you don't have one of these all right so if you don't have your moulds it's so easy you can just use a glass pyrex dish that you have at home I have pre-made some here in a little saucepan I am simply going to actually would you spray first this is very important as well not be able to get it out of the bowl see that does it come out of the mold Oh mark you're just so she's doing that will you and then in that goes like so and then you're going to leave that to set in the frigid air and when you are done here I'll take this over boom oh thank you mom another wave right here we have set one now hang on a minute what if it doesn't come out of the mold me what if it doesn't come out of the mold okay what do you like to cut it for you to cut it into little cubes hey drop some numbers over here what's this cost all right in the store it's upwards of 20 bucks for third for a month's supply for a month's supply $2 Wow this is why it makes sense save yourself a money go to pinterest.com for such a home and family TV you'll get the recipe and all the instructions they're waiting for you", "gPNy70wqTq0":

eating that in front of me right yeah look at your old ass oh my god no no no now you're making me want to go somewhere to get weight and get food but Huizar good everyday what's up everybody it's biggy welcome to the vlog again I hope you guys had a awesome New Year's I know some people probably feel like [ __ ] today I only had a couple drinks last night so I feel great I'm heading to the gym right now and do I believe some arms start off the year and a good a positive vibe at the gym with a little arm day action who doesn't appreciate a little arm day I really wanted to do something today trying to make like a trip down to Ikea maybe get some new office stuff some like additional minor things that I need to get to help build the office setup which again I'm sorry that it's taking so long to update you guys on the office and get you guys an actual full tour of the office but it's not done yet and I don't want to have asset like I said I want it to be a dope office setup tour a dope like gaming workstation streaming just an all in one place that I can uh that I can show off to you all and brag a little bit with it's not ready it doesn't look like the gym is actually that bad today I figured first of the year that there might be a lot of people here although that's annoying although it's like yeah it's annoying to have the gym be super packed and stuff I do want to remind people my friend Rob actually put out a good video on that just because people are coming to the gym and [ __ ] and some of them don't know what they're doing I know some of it can be funny sometimes and again I know that this can get annoying you know having a lot of people here and maybe they'll take up your parking spots just have some [ __ ] respect man like these people are just trying to better themselves and they're using a new year and a resolution to to help that and yeah in a couple weeks to a month maybe the gym might clear out but some of these people if you actually like support them and to help them out if they if they're confused about something and don't be a dick about [ __ ] some of these people are actually going to follow through with their resolution just because some people give up doesn't mean that everybody does I relate big time I was that guy that was like scared to go to the gym and work out because I was worried about other people making fun of me or what other people thought and slightly don't be a dick it's pretty simple don't be a dick why are you gonna make gummy bears more often now that's made out of T in its wheat without it being real sugar they're not done yet but they're definitely better consistency their money they're so Megan's gonna start making gummy bears apparently and they're like healthy gummy bears so she bought a whole bunch of these little little trays little gummy bear trays water we can start making like we could start making acid ones and sell them oh yeah we could make G field one soup of course but we can start making acid ones or likes somewhat sluicin Ingenix in it and start selling them no Jesus Christ so I've gone over some my goals for the year what I want to achieve in 2019 major ones are the losing 50 pounds hitting the goal of 200 the daily objective is managing my day better financially getting out of debt and just you know progressing as a person and mentally and physically progressing you know that the health was continuing eating better that's one thing I really do feel like 2018 that I did progress actually really well was eating a lot better I really moved into the keto and paleo lifestyle and I didn't do it in the sense of just trying to achieve weight loss route you know actually trying to just feel better just I don't know get more out of my food you know they may just get more out of what I consume on a daily basis so I figured one thing that would be cool is just to kind of see what you guys want to do this year what do you guys want achieve this year what kind of resolution do you guys want to set forward in 2019 what do you want to change about yourself this year what could you say in the comments or on Twitter or an Instagram in relation with us that could hold you accountable if you guys aren't following me on Twitter if you're not following me on Instagram I do post like daily on just updates on everything that I do you know so that way if you don't see much of the vlog you can come by there and check out the stuff there what is you guys want to accomplish issues what is it that you want to change about yourselves I really do want to know like I mentioned one of the coolest things about 2018 was like getting to know you guys and I feel like a lot of you guys and gals do have objectives you do have goals I feel like maybe if you even present it to us myself in the comments or on social media and the people alongside the community that we're building maybe you too will follow that kind of like feeling that I'm feeling with the vlogs and everything and just sharing everything about streaming and sharing my life on social media that says the feeling of being held accountable you know so please in the comments down below what are you guys's goals and ambitions this year you know don't be shy don't feel that your goal is any less than somebody else's because it's like not a weight loss or a money goal like what do you guys want to get done this year I know a monthly goal right now my objectives in the first month of the year cuz I do want to start breaking down things a lot more is when I get two out of the four weddings that I'm working on out of the way so that way it gives me a few months to work on the last few or a couple months to work on the last two hopefully I get my camera back this month right now I'm recording on the sony a7s 200 play I get stuff done around the office get the setup done overall everybody I just want to let you all know that no matter what kind of goals that you have no matter where you're starting off right now it may seem cheesy well I want you guys to understand that there's there's no difference between a lot of us like you really can set out and get those goals this year if you want to have a lot of goals and ambition on streaming charts streaming and get the [ __ ] done like do it cuz you will get a result if you want to start creating YouTube videos if you want to start designing if you want to start working out through what other people think even if they are making fun of you or we're not supporting you in some way realistically I can just tell you from experience that in a lot of situations most people out there just don't care like I said we are our own worst enemy when I first started going to the gym I was really nervous as I was afraid of how people would start looking at me you know cuz I'm overweight I'm in I don't really know what I'm doing it I super realize like nobody cares like nobody gives a [ __ ] they're there to better themselves like real people are everyone might have an [ __ ] every now and then but don't let those people stop you from working at bettering yourself 100% you can hit your 2019 let me know what they are on the comments down below let me know what what you want to hit what day and please if you also see somebody else commenting on like a goal or something that maybe it's not similar to something that you did it's you shirt respond back to those people give them some encouragement like let's let's get this [ __ ] this year dude let's work for some [ __ ] get some stuff done maybe actually get

is to make and I could see a bunch of kids sitting around making a lot of different flavors and colors of gummy bears they will love it so what we're going to do is we're going to take 1/3 cup of regular tap water and we're going to take one package of jell-o and I got cherry jello cuz we're gonna make cinnamon I kind of thought the red cherry would go with the cinnamon but you can use whatever kind you like you can make all kinds of different kinds so we're going to go ahead and put our package of jell-o in Yeah right we're also going to put in three envelopes of gelatine this is basically unflavored gelatin we need to get our jello basically super power to be able to make our gummy bears so we're gonna really give this little bit of water a lot of gelatin these are 0.25 ounce packages of jello and I this recipe I actually don't know where it originally came from making gummy bears there's this recipe is all over the internet so I can't really give credit to the person who actually made this because there's no way to know who it was if you happen to know then let me know right but thank you to whoever that was that developed this so we have a package this is a three ounce package of jell-o we have three package of gelatine and we have a third of a cup of water now to give us our cinnamon flavor we are going to add some cinnamon oil and you get it in this little two pack of these little things I got this at Michael's if you use a coupon they're really inexpensive they're only like a couple dollars anyway and I still use the coupon and I'm going to use a quarter teaspoon of the cinnamon oil this is going to give us our cinnamon flavor you can use as much or as little as you want quarter teaspoon gives you a nice cinnamon flavor you can actually supercharge it and put a whole bunch so we're going to go ahead and stir this up and combine this right here off the heat just make sure you kind of get the lumps out of it ooh I can smell the cinnamon you get actually any kind of oils that you can find you can make flavor if I can find some hot chili pepper oil Eric could love hot chili pepper gummy bears I've even seen people make adult gummy bears and you know what I mean with that little vodka a little brandy all that fun stuff so we've got this combined and we're going to go ahead and let this sit for five minutes off the heat then we're going to put it on the heat and melt it so after five minutes it's like gels up and it looks like this it's not hard it's really soft but it looks like this kind of consistency that gelatine really gels really fast so we're going to put it over a medium burner and we're gonna let it melt so let's put it over on the burner I already have it preheated you just want to continually to stir so it's nice and melted so now it's all melted we want to loop move our liquid into something that has a pour spout because we're going to put these in our molds and if you don't have a pour spout you're gonna make a mess and this red coloring could stain your counter so you don't want to do that okay so now we're ready to pour our molds and now we're just going to pour our little mixture into the molds to make our little gummy bears and how many this makes really depends on how big your molds are these molds are great I could see myself making all kinds of little chocolate it's for Eric I can't eat chocolates but he sure can so this is going to make little hippos its gonna make little lions and it's gonna make a little bears and this one here is gonna make little hearts which are going to be great with a red so we're going to let these set up you just want to set them out room temperature for about thirty minutes they're gonna gel up and we're gonna have our very own homemade cinnamon gummy bears so it's been a little over half hour and we're gonna unmold our little bears here or our shapes so this is the silicone molds and look at how easy they come out these are the little hearts and we're just gonna pop them out just like that look at that isn't that adorable yeah we have gummy hearts I love this is a small one that I did with the leftover so you can make these as big or as small as you want here are some little bears oh that's a toot and here we have a little hippo and a little lion oh look they're so cute these molds are so easy nothing sticks to them they just pop right out these are a little sticky so you can put a little cornstarch on them if you want them it does make them like light like there's flour something on them but it will keep them from sticking but that's just a major of homemade gummy bears we will get our hearts out here are adorable we have our little hearts our little lions our little bears I love them they're so cute and you can you can really smell the cinnamon so let's try them we got cherry and cinnamon mmm all right taste this light gummy bear mmm salmon if you really want your cinnamon hot you could really crank that cinnamon up I think this is a really good blend of the cherry and the cinnamon try that mmm it's funny how they really gel up I mean this is Blaine jello it would just be Wiggly but that gelatine really they just get kind of hard not hard but not like jello Wow they're great so a little of your very own cinnamon gummy bear so easy to make and your kids will love them if you like this

"what's up youtube budget baller here with another quick one take review today i got the 3g delta 8 thc gummies i got 400 milligrams of delta 8 thc per pack milligrams in each little gummy and 16 gummies per pack and this retails for 39.99 if you want a quick brief history about what this is uh it's a cbd gummy basically made with delta 8 thc which is basically like the brother of delta 9 or the thc that you would normally find in marijuana delta a contains similar psychoactive properties as its little big brother delta nine thc but the catches it is still federally legal here in the united states um the problem with delta eight is it's very hard to get it concentrated to give you like a real high it doesn't exist too much in abundance however companies are finding way like 3g to concentrate the delta h delta 8 to give you um a nice cool relaxing experience i took mine about four hours ago it's starting to wear off a little bit uh it came the high high quotation marks came about an hour and a half in and i will tell you if you've tried cbd gummies and you don't feel like you're getting anything out of them like they're not getting you that relaxing feeling that you want uh 3g delta 8 thc gummies did it for me past two and a half hours my body's been really chill kind of relaxed um a little bit tingly just nice i've been having a real nice feeling what i don't have is too much of the head high or feeling like oh hi or any kind of the psychoactive properties they don't feel like they're they're you get that kind of head high that you get with the some strains of marijuana you get just a more like peaceful relaxed chill feeling and i honestly think like that's what i've been looking for in cbd gummies and this is not a sponsored video by the way this is just me being truthful i like these you i tried multiple cbd gummies and they haven't given me that chill relaxing feeling at night when i'm just chilling that i wanted but this did like i i feel good right now um i've had a little bit of trouble filming these videos uh today because i mean i feel like you know i'm pretty chill like i'm not on top of my game as much as i would but i wanted to do this um i want to get this out there because is it worth it even at 39.99 a pack definitely definitely this is cool this i like this experience i had a good experience with these sorry guys this budget baller uh thank you for liking subscribing doing all that i really appreciate it um have a great day and then i'm gonna close out on the pack for you here there you go nice little look on it cool see it", "-xix6u2w-uc": "guys do i look like wendy from peter pan right now this bow is giving me peter pan wendy vibes i always wanted to be wendy hi everybody welcome back to my channel if you are new welcome my name is cooper new and today we're making another fun little treat in the kitchen we're making champagne gummy bears let's go i'm so excited i'm gonna set these down i made gummy bears once before on my channel it was weird anyway all of my friends and family know my two favorite things on earth are gummy bears and champagne that's it that's all i need so let's combine them there's a candy brand called sugarfina they have champagne gummy bears they're amazing so i'm going to try to make it myself so yeah if you want to see how to make champagne gummy bears it's supposed to be super easy then just keep watching [Music] so for this you actually don't need very many things you just need champagne you need sugar and you need gelatin oh and also gummy bear molds hello duh for right now i have one cup of the root rose is reducing over medium heat once this has kind of reduced down a little bit we'll add another cup and a half and now i'm going to do just a regular champagne i figured it would be fun to try both again i'm absolutely terrified of doing this part oh my god am i doing it i'm doing it oh wow i'm a beast nice i took off the last one with a cork opener i know that's super not how you're supposed to do that but i did it so one cup yes i feel like i should pour myself a glass while i'm making this what do you guys think it is time for some champagne i love to drink champagne everything's looking good these guys are bubbling i'm enjoying my day how's everyone doing are we all doing well okay so let me tell you guys a little bit about the gelatin we're using today agar agar what i'll name my firstborn it is a vegetable gelatin substitute the difference here this is plant-based it's made from red algae without any artificial chemical ingredient regular gelatin is made from skin bones tendons and cartilage of livestock animals yuck that's kind of gross this has fibers calcium iron vitamins so yeah this should be interesting i'm excited to try this this one looks like it's reduced so i'm going to go ahead and add a cup and a half more so the rose one is doing a nice job here so we are going to go ahead and add the gelatin and also the sugar so for the gelatin you're doing one fourth of a cup okay and now let's also add while that's doing that let's add a cup of sugar there we go so we are going to continue to whisk this until everything dissolves and until it really thickens up so now i'm going to do the exact same thing over here for our regular champagne gummies fourth a cup of the gelatin pour that in got it all over me and also a cup of sugar now i'm just gonna go back and forth kind of whisking these guys until they look ready to me i guess take our lovely reduced mixture here this is the rose one and i have out our gummy bear molds and i'm going to use a dropper now this might take an eternity uh to do a dropper and do this but i'm willing okay so let's begin so what's interesting about agar agar is that am i saying that right agar agar whatever is that the freezing point of it you know when the molds get hard is just room temperature so these are already ready to go so that's pretty cool that you can make these so fast i'm telling you these are already ready oops look he's already ready to eat i'm going to eat him interesting but delicious i'm gonna keep making some more i'll be back okay guys here they are uh these are the champagne ones these are the rose ones aren't they kind of cool nice so i just want to show you what they look like if you decide you want to coat them in sugar it gives them obviously a little extra sweetness but they're still just as cute look at that guy these also have a little bit more of a melt in your mouth kind of more of a jello texture than a traditional gummy bear these turned out really well i'm actually really impressed with how quickly the agar agar solidifies just at room temperature it's super fast and yeah these are really good it says that these are best kept in the refrigerator i like the regular champagne ones a lot more than rose ones i wonder if i could toss them and eat them in the sky i'll get it oh close that was way off i don't know what that was nope nope that was just straight up and down that was way behind my head nice i did it that is it for this video thank you so much for watching and i will go ahead and see you guys again in my next one bye", "J5Nu589uIAw": "what's up everybody my name is Sarah feet and welcome to the channel the haze we're gonna be reviewing the very famous very well-known and very beloved got me edible cushy punch now this is a California brand this is the sativa formula and it is absolutely fantastic so there's a few different types of products such as you punch makes the gummies I believe are their main and their original I know now they have like vaporizers they have CTD products things like that but the cushy punch are very well known for their gummies now these guys come in a hundred milligrams they also have a 200 milligram call to TKO and these guys come in these awesome little packet they're easy to break apart and each of these little squares is ten milligrams so you can dose however much that you would need personally now they are pretty strong I don't know exactly how they're made so they are made with organic sugar and feature no artificial coloring is all made with natural coloring so if that's something that concerns you if you have allergy problems and you can do artificial coloring these guys are a great option so let's talk about flavor these guys are really nice they're sweet but you do get a strong kind of cannabis oil to smell to them so if you pull them out in public if someone partakes or it is kind of in the know-how of how cannabis smells a little recognize this then they will smell it now if you're trying to see what kind of high this is this is the sativa one and for me these guys will keep me well they don't make me drowsy you can be very creative on them yeah I built this Depot these guys are good I could go together in a pinch because you will find out my most places now if you're talking prices they kind of range up and down I've seen these guys as low as $10 and S&M as high as $20 I don't really know if there's just a lot of places that are able to up the prices because it is wanted so bad if you can find a good deal on them they're very much worth it if it's the people are signing for 20 bucks and if you have to get it but it's a bit bit overpriced for these guys all in all if you are someone who travels a lot these guys aren't perfect companions they're small to fit in your pocket if you go to the movies a lot these are great as well so that is my little small review for the fam the cushy punch well there you go guys thank you so much for taking the time and watching this review again my name is Sarah B welcome to the haze and I will see you next time oh also please follow us on

earth did you ever capture them a little gummy helped me vodka you know I don't believe in gummy bears no Kingi sometimes I guess we are pretty unbelievable with that", "gwIs86fcWps": "hey what's going on guys we're shooting another gummy infused with vodka video I know you guys are probably getting tired of them but some people are still asking for stuff one of the most recent questions was hey you know I don't have any gummy bears but I do have some lifesavers gummies is it the same thing well pretty much I mean we got here gummy collisions two flavors in one so I mean this could actually turn out pretty damn good you know if your party you got two flavors in each one and then plus whatever kind of vodka you decide to use so here today we're using uh some orange smirnoff vodka and the gummy lifesavers shouldn't really be an issue with the lifesavers take a look here just open them up get your little gummy rings same consistency as a normal gummy you know I mean so I I suspect they'll do just about the same thing the only thing you want to watch with theses I guess after they expand they might be pretty big I mean right now they're about the size of a quarter maybe a nickel but uh who knows after a few days it might be like a half-dollar or silver dollar size I mean it's pretty cool so basically all we're gonna do is follow the same recipe even watching on these videos just take your gummies add a bunch of them into your little container and spread them around just depending how many you want to make I mean you can split it up into batches or sort out the color say you want say you want to do all these yellow and green ones with some lime vodka or Citrus Vodka make a separate batch of those then you got your yellow and orange you want to do orange vodka you know but this time we're just going to mix them all together hoping for a pretty good result here just crack open our orange vodka there we go Smirnoff orange basically want to top these guys all off cover them up a little bit more don't be afraid I mean whatever's left over the gummies itself will have kind of dissolved a little bit and that will flavor the vodka so you can always reuse the vodka that's in here if you over pour just you know use a funnel or something filter back in the in a different bottle or you can just put it straight into shot glasses whatever works for you so take a look there they're all submerged got a nice clear line right about where they are with the vodka we're going to be adding more later in a couple days so cover them up each one and go and throw these guys in here for diretor you'll need um probably about three or four days the longer you put them in there the more they'll soak up but it eventually gets to a point where they're just saturated and they start to dissolve so don't go anything more than about a full week so go ahead open my fridge got some other ones there for a party coming up this Friday so those are a different batch take our gummy gummy saver rings with our orange vodka throw them in the fridge and like I said every couple days just give them a good stir and see what kind of progress you what's going on guys we're back here now with the second experiment as far as a gummy infused vodka goes or vodka infused gummies I guess um this one I decided to do lifesaver rings lifesaver gummy rings or whatever a lot of people were saying you know depending on where you live it's kind of hard to find certain types of candy and this was one that somebody sent in and asked me to do so that like I said we got the lifesavers gummy rings this was like a fruit fusion blend or something or they're like two flavors per gummy um I would say they turned out okay they've grown a bit I mean just because I guess how dense they are like the shape of them you won't really notice as much expansion as the rest because it's you know it's in a ring but it's got quite a thick little border there they did grow soaked up quite a bit of the vodka I've already kind of drained them off a little bit that way you can get a better idea of how they look um texture wise I'll check one out here split this guy still still gummy still chewy if you look in there nice little center still soft chewy like I said two flavours I decided to do orange vodka with this so let me take a bite well yeah these ones are good really good they have a little bit more sweetness than most regular gummy bears I don't know if it's because the type of candy maybe there's more fruit juice inside of these but you know they turned out really good I would recommend these ones for the party um so I let them soak for about three days separated them every couple days start them shook them up added a little bit more vodka just because it was about halfway I always want to keep them topped off so they absorb evenly but this is a really good one I would recommend this for a party now pretty much can either you know you can you can sort of dry them off like towel dry or something if you wanted but doesn't really matter maybe serve well get some Forks or something or little toothpicks or something that way everybody's not like reaching in like I did but you know what are you going to do I guess when you're partying it doesn't really matter right everybody's having fun and don't mind really sharing out of a community bowl there so but uh like I said this was a request for one of the users on my channel and if you have any other comments or questions just let me know and I'd be happy to answer them so thank you for watching and

"y-UlV_CJ-NA": "i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little [Music] hey and i know you guys are like sick and tired of me disappearing for months on end i legit have been gone for a month even after i said i was going to start recording again i've just ultimately realized like at least for me and my life and my health i i just have to do things when i want to do them and i've learned that in my relationships my friendships like you got to let people go when you want to not when it's good for them and put out good things you know when you have the energy to do so so i am finally feeling like i have the energy to record again and i figured why not give you guys something fun obviously this video is going to be about me trying edibles for the very first time but backstory i have never smoked before i've never smoked i've never legit done any drug ever like nothing ever every time i mentioned to somebody that i haven't smoked before they're like why like i'm 26 years old never smoked before you know nugs not drugs kids nugs not drugs i've always been interested in trying edibles or um shrooms weird enough i actually just watched a documentary i think called psychedelic on netflix i'm not sure what the documentary is called but i have just always been interested and i guess an easier high where you can just eat something and experience it i genuinely think this is probably going to be the first and last time but i mean who knows like sorry mom i know you're probably watching this it's so funny because everybody including my mom including my dad literally everybody i know has smoked before everybody has done something before i literally have done nothing so i figured why not make my first experience memorable and share it with you guys so the big sour patch kids are the highest milligram that i got it's 150 milligrams i don't even know how milligrams work i don't even know like how much wheat is what i remember getting weed for a guy that i know a couple years ago and literally i got it wrong and he ended up like losing money i guess because i got the wrong amount and i was like i don't know how this works like i legit have never done drugs so yeah this is 150 milligrams whatever that means thing that i got was the red velvet chips ahoy honestly this i got just because i was like this sounds delicious like i've never tried red velvet chips ahoy and they're soft and i was like oh like it's gonna be good so i got that that's 175 milligrams last thing that i got were hot cheetos and these are 75 milligrams two um again i don't know how much milligram is what i just know that i was like i'm gonna get the things that i would actually eat this ain't going lowest the highest but he said cookies then cheetos then the gummies um and he said you're a virgin my [ __ ] is rockin um and then he said don't eat all of anything and then he said i'd love to come check on you he actually asked me about a boyfriend i spent 60 dollars um i can put the prices of each thing up on the screen like right here um but it wasn't crazy expensive been around wheat my whole life i just have chose not to um so i know what weed smells like wow okay yeah the gummies definitely have the highest amount [Music] okay i'm hoping somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour something happens i don't even know what high feels like so i don't know if i'm even gonna notice but we'll see so i'm doing this much one cookie oh i'm gonna do two cookies so i guess two cookies i mean i definitely i definitely think if these were on the counter i wouldn't notice that there was wheat in it i mean it's definitely like it tastes like a cookie i'm kind of like noticed doing this much of the other cookie all right i'm cozy guys i'm over here thinking i'm like my mom's probably gonna be more mad about me eating on her couch than she is about me doing drugs all right hot cheetos i really just want to taste these i'm really not gonna eat a lot of these i think that much don't feel like that's enough what if i end up like i didn't take enough and then like i don't even notice y'all i don't taste it at all but these are good like i honestly haven't had hot cheetos in a minute because i don't really eat chips like that like when i eventually do want chips i do end up getting hot cheetos but i really don't eat chips like that so these just taste good i don't think maybe because they're hot you taste it a lot less had you not told me not to eat all of these i probably would have eaten the entire bag of these hot cheetos okay [Music] i haven't had hot cheetos in a minute y'all these are good and lastly the big sour patch kids i think i'm gonna do three he said don't eat all of anything but he said i could have a few so i'm thinking three they're like this size you see that they're like this size this tastes good they don't have a wee taste at all honestly i don't feel like any of these really have wheat taste like i know it's in here so i'm looking for it but i legit feel like if you just said it on the counter you would not like pay attention to it guys this is going to be so good just for the simple fact that i don't eat things like this like i really don't eat candy like that i really don't eat chips like that i really like you know my weight gain my weight eating came from food honey i'm like one of those people that be like oh i want a midnight snack but i want some ribs it won't be no like simple snack all right last one yo this one looks like two in one this last sour patch so i did three sour patch about a little palm full of hot cheetos and two cookies so i'm gonna check back with you guys i'm also actually video chat my friend so hopefully it doesn't get again when i'm on my conversation but we're gonna see so wish me luck i'm gonna see you guys in a minute so it has been 30 minutes so right now it is 206 i took the edibles whatever at 1 35 so we're 30 minutes in and i don't feel anything the one thing though that my best friend i actually told my best friend i was doing this video right before nicki if you're watching this hello she just um messaged me on instagram and she was like girl don't take more like less is more so we're 30 minutes in i'm just going to check back in an hour i've literally just been on i was let's say facetime but i'm in i'm team android right now so um yeah on video chat right now so um i've just been checking in but we'll see in 30 more minutes so at 2 35 we'll see if i feel anything um and then again at what's after 2 35 305 we'll check again um but yeah so i'm just going to keep checking in with you guys every 30 minutes and see if i feel higher um i don't know if it's gonna work for me i just feel like when you haven't smoked before maybe like my body's like especially because i'm one of those like whatever i really don't care about being high and feeling this and escaping the world i'm like i love my life i love my job i love everything that's going on with me and my life the disrespect on video chat but whatever so anyway um yeah i just feel like when i'm a person that like doesn't i guess care about it or really believe in it or want it to work i'm like i wonder if it's just not gonna work for me because my body's just i mean i've legit just been watching tv and on video chat so again we'll check back in all right so [Music] i originally told you guys i was going to um check back in at 2 30 5 2 35 all right so it's 4 42 right now and i'm like i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little bit of a second like everything nothing's funny nothing's funny okay anyway what i was saying is i said i was getting checked back in at 2 35 it's 2 42 and i just can't stop laughing because i was on um i was on video chat and um i was eating this mango and a fly was in the kitchen on the floor and it literally like jumped like a frog and it kind of threw me all off guard but um since that happened it's just been like everything's funny i don't know how to describe it other than like get so lovey it's so weird because like i think i might be high but i can't i keep saying that i'm not high so i can't okay no it's like i can't get anything out like what the heck okay it's weird because like i'm i'm here and i recognize like what's going on but i don't know why everything's like funny okay everything just got really funny and i'm freaked out because i have to legit drive to get my mom so my mom's at um i dropped her off this morning and i have to go get her and i'm like i don't know like i don't know it came on in a matter of like 15 minutes because when i definitely looked at the clock and i was like oh there's eight minutes until i have to tell them if i'm feeling high or not and um then everything got funny and i was like oh shoot like legit that hit me really fast i didn't even know if i was still recording or not okay the feeling of high i don't know like i legit walked upstairs to get my charger and then i couldn't focus and i felt my brain was like not focusing um but yeah the most thing that i noticed the most the thing that i noticed the most was just that my heart i've been able to feel my heart like like my heart um i can feel it like i can feel my heart through my body the main thing that i feel like i just i'm talking a lot more and i feel like my thought process is just like this all over the place i don't know i don't know why that's like a feeling people would want to get because like while i'm feeling this right now i feel like i'm right now i'm on an even mindset i'm understanding i'm recording youtube video and then i need to stop talking because i'm on video chat and this is supposed to be like a short explanation and i just can't stop talking but i recognize that this is what i'm doing right now like i'm i am doing this right now but um i'm just gonna check back in with you like but i just don't know if i like this feeling like i am acknowledging that i'm recording this i'm acknowledging that it's for a reason but my brain is just like going on everything but um yeah so i'm going to check back in in about 30 minutes we'll see i've been recording for five minutes i feel like that's a really long time it's a really long time um so my next check in i'm gonna make it try and try make it short and sweet and yeah talk to y'all in a little bit hey guys right now it is 3 51 and i definitely feel like i have experienced the high i guess i didn't think that it'd feel like this i don't know like genuinely i felt like the entire time all i've felt like is actually i'm gonna look at myself just because it's helping me focus a little bit more looking at something um but i feel like i didn't expect it to feel like this i i just felt like i kept saying things that were so honest and i was like oh like i should start you know being quiet and it just was not i would not stop talking so yeah everything um was cool it just i guess this is just not how i experienced or thought i was gonna be experiencing it it's just really weird i don't i actually don't like it and i don't know why people get high like i would not want this feeling again i don't know i guess i thought like high like when i see people they're like chill you know sit back and share whatever like they feel good or like i guess some people get high and get like hype but i just feel like i feel so outside my body and like uncomfortable and like i just felt like i kept on saying things that i didn't want to say for the past hour which had been eating talking on the phone and then i got off the phone everything was funny a minute ago like i did not i guess that's when i noticed that i was high as like my brain just doesn't feel like it's fully functioning how it should function right now um and then all of a sudden it got really sad like five minutes ago like i don't know it's just like a sad feeling but i don't know if i'm sad because i'm like i really wish i didn't do this like like that might be why like i'm kind of sad about that like i was having a conversation with somebody and not able to understand like what was going on i mean i get it like we were having a conversation but like some of the conversation i just felt like i don't know like i was definitely talking and saying things that were like overly truthful and my mouth was moving but i'm like shut up like stop talking right now um and that's not a good feeling like when you're when you're aware that you're not coherent enough for the conversation you're having i feel like that's i mean that's i don't understand why people would want to feel that maybe just feel outside your head i don't know if like your person who doesn't really think much then maybe getting high will make you think more but i feel like i think a lot and i'm very focused normally so to feel very not focused and scatterbrained and looking at everything that you know pops up um i don't know like that feeling i don't know i guess that's why i've never done anything like this or done anything like drug related it's because i feel like if there's no reason for you to be doing it then don't do it like if you're watching this video even though like i'm recording it to show an experience don't think it's cool or like this is fire like this is not i don't know i guess it was like a funny video idea but i also wish that i didn't even do it like i don't know i just feel really sad i feel like i feel like that sadness is just me like realizing that i just shouldn't have shouldn't have done this um but yeah so it is three three it's 3 56 so um i thought i was going to check in at 3 35 i think last time but um i think i'm going to check back in around 4 35 like 4 30 or 5-ish just see i mean how i'm feeling then ultimately like it's really weird because all i'm thinking is how long is this going to last like i don't know i just don't get why people do this like i mean i have definitely um i guess they say that you should do it with someone for somebody to babysit you i was on video chat i mean no one's in my house right now but um i was on video chat but i just felt like i don't know i don't i don't i don't know i felt like once i got off the phone it was when i noticed um i don't know more aware of things like the way things felt in my body and i don't know i just don't like this i don't like it i feel like looking at myself in the viewfinder is helping me focus but i feel like i don't know my brain is definitely just like why did i do this that's why you don't do drugs kids it's honestly not even the hype that people made it this isn't like a good feeling like being high it's like i like being calm and coherent and you know not feeling outside my body and i guess a lot of people do it to get outside like if they're not happy or they want to feel a boost of probably serotonin and serotonin that's um in your body that like releases you to be happy um i don't know like this doesn't feel like that it just feels like a little bit like i'm outside my body and i'm um not myself and i actually really enjoy being naughty in my my daily life so um i don't know i wondered like if edibles like the high that you get is like different from when you smoke i don't ever plan on smoking like i don't know if you've ever been to the bodies exhibit we have it in atlanta um but you can see what a lung looks like healthy and what it looks like when it's been um smoked through and i just don't want it in my lungs like i smoke before but i'm like i would i even stopped doing that because it made me feel light-headed um but yeah i don't get why somebody would want to be high i ended up taking off my lashes and stuff because it like legit felt like they were 200 pounds like they were irritating on the eye and then i like ate this mango and put water all over my face and then wiped to where the inside of my shirt i'm sure has like brown from my makeup and i was like oh shoot i have makeup on but yeah it's four o'clock i'm gonna check back in around five let's see if i'm still high hopefully this doesn't last too much longer because i don't like the feeling and i want it to be over with but um yeah we're gonna check back in an hour and see how i feel i might take a nap just so i can like maybe sleep it off i'm hoping maybe i can drink it through maybe the food just has to like get out of my body but i don't know guys i don't know but i just want it to wear off already i laid down for about an hour i did not um i didn't go to sleep but i laid down for about an hour i couldn't like my mind was still racing but i feel a lot better just laying down um i can feel it coming down really weird experience i feel like i'm like a little hot and i'm talking with lisp which is i don't know but yeah that was my first time doing any kind of thing it is now time for me to go pick up my mom i just feel tired now um but yeah weird experience don't do drugs kids i feel like now knowing the experience i would never do it again so i thought that my last snippet video i guess was going to be my last video but i'm actually feeling a lot better right now it is the 7 50. so just now at 7 50 i'm finally feeling better and like myself and like my brain is clear i went to go grab my mom and i was honestly like really hungry i mean while i was high on the edibles i ate two mangoes two apples um a baked potato um what else a coke um i feel like i have something else oh and this like um shrimp and broccoli like stir-fry or whatever with some ginger sauce like oh and a bowl of frosted flakes so i don't know like i thought that you only got hungry when you were high on like smoking i didn't know you actually got like high off edibles and still wanted to eat stuff i never knew that was a thing but yeah i ate a lot while i was um highly edible before i got to my mom i did go ahead and stop at taco bell and i did guys i was trying to go ahead and make that like a laxative because i figured if it's an edible it's something that's in your stomach and it needs to get out of your system so tmi got it handled and since that happened i now feel a lot better um when i went to go pick up my mom we've been sharing a car for the past like a week or so um until she gets her car next week but excuse me um i literally when i pulled up to her i hopped in the passenger seat like mom's like why didn't you get out the car to like get in the passenger seat like i just need to get in the passenger seat so pretty much i um let her drive and just kind of like drove away and um go ride over here i just went ahead and went to sleep so i feel a lot better i didn't really go to sleep but it was more like relaxing closing my eyes and like now that it's out of my system i feel like i feel a lot better um i did not like the feeling guys i don't know how people do it like i know people who do edibles all the time people smoke all the time like i don't know if that's the feeling you get but i did not enjoy it i don't like feeling outside of myself i like to be clear-headed um so to feel like i was drugged like that's what i mean it felt like that um it wasn't a good feeling i was like i don't want to experience this again i literally remember um on the way over here all i was thinking was yo i need to like get rid of these like i need to flush them on toilet give it to a friend something like they have to go not flush them down totally but you know get rid of them um likely i'm gonna give them to a friend rather than throw it away because it was sixty dollars but i am just not interested i'm not interested in getting any more trying different flavors like i just did not like the experience um i felt like my brain was really clouded and heavy and it was almost like i'm kind of atd so i feel like every time when i'm thinking my thoughts go everywhere anyway but i can still organize them like i'm used to it enough that it's like i can organize thoughts in my brain but when i was high on the edibles it was almost like i could not control my brain hopping on a trillion different things and i was on video chat and i felt like i was saying things that were like brutally honest and i'm like yo why is this happening right now like it was like my mouth was moving saying things like shut up shut up so yeah i didn't really like that feeling i don't like not feeling in control and i definitely did not feel in control while i was high on the edibles um they tasted good we're going off taste i'd say 10 out of 10 they were all really really good but i'm just really thinking about experience i don't know if it's how you're supposed to feel but i just remember feeling really disoriented and my thoughts were not coming up straight in my brain as well as the fact that um i was just really confused and would not stop saying things i'm just like be quiet and then directly after that i got really sad um and disappointed in myself that i did it how long does high last night like it peaks at two to three hours so i was like i think i'm peeking so i literally was with my eyes closed but i was paying attention to everything like the fan um how it felt up against my skin i felt like i was um breathing extra heavy i don't know i just was not it was not comfortable and i just was not happy but i am glad that i experienced it i'm glad i experienced it alone i don't know if that was good or bad thing but yeah we're never doing that again hopefully you guys enjoyed it and give this video a thumbs up for me and my experience and yeah that's gonna be it for today i just love you bye", "iJwdqt7ebmE": "yeah here we go here we go again what's up yo back with another review today Oh edible gummies Mira Mira specifically Rob hots sour flavors I believe this is a relative new relatively new flavor for them I'm not a million percent sure even close to sure if it's on the REC side if it's not now I would imagine it will be soon so diving in the flavors we got inside here blue raspberry grape and green apple I don't know I had to look at it I actually know the flavors of jelly me anyway that's pretty much my favorite flavors enjoy ranchers and other candies so that was a super big plus for me I'm not really a huge tower fan so I'm really hoping they're not especially a sour yeah I was gonna enter a picture probably already did or I am now so we're gonna dive into what one thing to keep in mind is the brain all right we go is that the milligrams posted on the bottle or on the container are not necessarily the exact amount that are in your specific bottle your specific bottle will have a separate location where it is located exactly how many milligrams are in there I will insert a picture of it but it's I just keep smearing it you cannot see it at all anymore but I know that this bottle says 500 milligrams and it has 467 point 6 4 milligrams in it meaning each piece is not 50 milligrams but 46.7 6 milligrams per gummy it will always tell you the specific amount of THC that is in and milligrams that is in your container but it's not always exactly what's on the bottle sometimes it's more though I had another bottle of greens but I ate before I could review sometimes it's more the greens were 500 and something milligrams so each milligram or 5/10 I think or anyway doesn't matter because it was 51 milligrams per gummy i remember that specifically so sometimes you're getting more sometimes getting less if you're really a budget conscious person and you want to really maximize your bang for buck check out the different flavors and see what milligram is the highest of the actual bottle that you'll be purchasing we're gonna move on to the scent also it doesn't say whether it's a hybrid or indica or sativa so that means it's a hybrid most edibles are pretty much hybrids anyway I'm to get a edible specific video posted so keep an eye out for that because I'm gonna give like tips tricks all kinds of different information about edibles specifically that you can apply across pretty much all edibles sauer sorry I'm getting a little bit of the grape but I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys these two are the two that I'm gonna be eating and one of them is great the reason these are the two that I'm gonna be eating is because I licked the [ __ ] out of them getting the sub nail photo and specifically the purple one is the one that I started with so it got the most saliva on it so I'm not sure if that has affected the scent that I'm picking up the most in here I'm like rotating something like the blue raspberries up on top I still kind of get great more than anything else behind this hour cuz this hour is the first thing that I smelled so that's a little bit concerning for me but when I was licking them I didn't taste a lot of sour however in the photo you can see there's a lot of like more there's a lot of rocky material that's only on one side from what I can tell because the green one too it didn't have any on the bottom I'm thinking that's the sour so I would imagine that you could dust that off and they wouldn't be sour but tact tactically they are I'm gonna grab one that I haven't wet because that they're more sticky Wow they're mean Wow I'm having before but they are they're very soft and compression they're definitely gummies cuz they're a little bit sticky but let's see yeah they're a little bit sticky my fingers are a little sticky after that but I could be because I was also handling the ones that I licked so we're gonna let see my fingers do not feel sticky at all or the like least amount like to smile if anything so now we're gonna squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze it is sticky yeah it's sticky and that's one that was not licked but it's not super bad cuz now after I've done it a few times it's pretty much not sticky anymore so a little sticky but you'll be able to like dust it off and no big deal as long as you don't like continuously looking and grab it and grab it and grab it that makes it sticky alright let's ride let's ride so I'm gonna be doing actually 150 because I'm gonna try all three well I was Jenni myself so harshly I'm like oh you're not getting quick enough that I couldn't actually think about adding up the numbers so it actually may be more like 135 levi's I am going to put the sour directly on my tongue with this one and then the other way on this one and whichever way I like the most I'm gonna do for the blue raspberry because that's my favorite and the apple looks like it's not got a lot of stuff on it so [Music] okay I push the gummy off to the side to just deal with the sour but it's really not bad like you can see my face with like a little bit but when it's really sour it's my faces all kinds of you know I am definitely getting a great flavor I would say that there is a mild earthy flavor to it I mean hash has a very very attached distillate has a very mild cannabis flavor to it but I'm picking that up so it's not but I I mean any edible honestly any edible is gonna have the slightest flavoring whether it be hashey or earthy which this is a little bit both I'm getting it's interesting you know I'm getting the earthiness of the you know cannabis component but which is in distillate but I'm also at the end getting a little bit of the tang or the dryness maybe that's it of the hash flavor if you have smoked hash or gotten it on it and like licked it and stuff you kind of know what I mean you the smell like honest if you know what the smell is you kind of know what the taste is so they're green apple oh and as far as I continue to talk the flavor I'm left with is a very mild grape kind of a again there's it's not really necessarily earthy at this point it's an off great like it's great but just like a little okay solid metal that straight-up tastes like Ukraine Apple the end part I got a little bit of sour and as I was coming out of it it tasted like a sour green apple so that was really nice not quite as much earthy flavor in that one I just think maybe the green apple complements or goes with the cannabis ever slightly so more than the grape so more I'm not really tasting the green apple anymore it was strong when I was eating it but it doesn't really have a leftover flavor and blue raspberry [Music] whoo Smiley's an idol I ate a boy okay that was delicious it honestly reminds me of a blue Slurpee but I I honestly don't think I've ever tried a Slurpee ever but it's what I imagine a blue raspberry a Slurpee tastes like blue raspberry otter pop that's the closest that I can relate it to cuz it's not quite blue raspberry Jolly Rancher but it's blue rounder blue blue raspberry otter pop so it's a little duller than a Jolly Rancher but still nicely blue raspberry we're popsicle I swallowed unexpectedly during that so some sour got in my throat so it's not the best feeling and I did just eat on three so I'm imagining the flavors gonna be a little ol kooky but I kind of maybe I just want it I feel like I have a remanence of blue raspberry in my mouth but I might just be wanting it so much that its existing you know for the placebo effect so flavors oh dude I didn't get any hash from that no earthy no hash maybe because I like that flavor so much or it goes better with it I don't know but it tasted delicious so that you know as far as overall experience I appreciate that the sour is not super sour I almost think there's gonna be people who are disappointed but it's not super super sour but I thought it was a nice mild level of sour what yeah I still get the grape more than anything in that particular whip waft I wonder if it's because I was also thinking it was gonna be so much more sour that I smelled this no I smell sour but it's not as strong it has before that's so funny anyway I love Rob hot gummies I've had them pretty consistently there's definitely other companies that make really good gummies but Rob hots from what I've experienced so far seems to be the best thing for the [ __ ] and having good quality like great quality gummies however I did want to mention gelatin and glucose syrup is in here I don't know how that relates to either vegetarianism or veganism all right so the milligrams are definitely affecting me at this point I'd say I'm Spacey relaxed [Music] I'm frontier I was more minute early and now I'm more relaxed and I think when I get to doing the video editing it'll be easier to focus than trying to pull thoughts out of this brain it's more just do versus think which is wonderful my hands are so dry my knuckles oh my gosh I need to get more lotion I have to go okay I just needed a quick thing yeah yes I would recommend rabbits gummies I would say pretty much overall at this point different flavors you you're gonna like and not like so that's gonna be a personal thing but overall I think that Rob Potts does a good job with their gummies and the sours were delicious and not super sour and I really like that I hope you guys have a wonderful rest of your day",

today i'll be showing you how to infuse starbursts so delicious and surprisingly was one of the easiest edibles i've ever made and i feel like i'm going to make these many times in the future they turned out so well [Music] to make these starbursts here's what you're going to need some starburst candy i wish i could have had the all pink kind but we don't sell them in canada so i just got the original infuse coconut oil and optionally you can also use a concentrate or extract to make them extra strong and some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks so much guys have a wonderful day [Music] you", "8cWP1sf1taA": "what's going on you guys welcome back to a new video today we're going to be filming a very fun challenge

okay we're just gonna go in with our hands we're just gonna bite it okay this actually tastes like a waffle like i'm getting like maple waffle vibes this is really good i'm going to try the egg now dude you're going to break a teeth mmm this one is so good that one doesn't taste like egg but it's really good mm-hmm i think i like this one better than the waffle one okay the bacon though i'm excited for this one this one smells like cherry mmm it's okay i'm gonna try it this and the egg have to be my favorite ones this is really really good i'm gonna sit here enjoy my breakfast and then i'll see you guys in a little bit because we actually have to head out to the store and get a snack so we'll see what we end up getting for a snack so i'll see you guys in a bit five minutes later okay guys we just got here to the mall and i came to my favorite candy store they always have a lot of good candy so i'm really hoping that we can find a big variety of gummies and then i'm able to find a snack so let's go to the store [Applause] [Music] bish i literally found everything that i needed we walked in the store and we were like jackpot i found everything for lunch snack at dinner i can't wait to show you guys everything that we picked up one thing that i did get was this gummy bear which is the little nitro world's hottest gummy bear if this video gets at 20 000 likes i will try it in my next asmr so give this video a thumbs up and now let's see what i end up having for my snack for our snack we're going to be having this a gummy pickle with real pickle taste so let's see what this tastes like i'm kind of nervous because i love pickles but just like the thought of like real pickle taste on a gummy i don't know about that okay let's check it out it smells like oh my god i was gonna say it smells like green apple but i can literally smell the pickle now oh i don't know this is gonna be good okay let's try it out oh my god it's so bad so disgusting this is no for me this is i cannot even swallow this it's like sweet and then you get like the actual flavor of the pickle this is a no-go for me so i will see you guys in a couple hours for lunch time hopefully for lunch time we have better luck than our snacks two hours later okay guys it's been a couple hours and now it is time for lunch my stomach is growling and it's also hurting a little bit i don't know if it's because i'm hungry or if it's because all this candy is starting to get to me but either way it's lunch time so i do want to eat so cameraman what do we have for lunch oh you have pizza a hot dog a cheeseburger and a coke okay so for 2021 i was like you know what i'm gonna eat healthy but i guess 2021 had other plans for me and i mean i'm not married so let's try it so we do have some pizza with no veggies okay just the pepperoni and cheese awesome this is what it looks like oh it smells really good okay honestly after this video i think i'm gonna have to go to the dentist there's like so much tugging and they're so like hard to chew i'm just like you know but it's really good i can definitely taste this is like a strawberry flavor it's really good this is definitely vanilla and this is orange right here so this is not bad it's actually pretty good i'm really excited for this hot dog though look at this look at the detail we have the bun veggies the sausage and then we have the mustard and the ketchup now it's a little bit hard to take out just because it's not like a whole piece you do have to take it like one by one trying to pick it up can you let me see let's try this there we go so let's try it out what flavor is this that is so freaking good that is the best one that i've tried so far today now we're gonna try the cheeseburger there's lettuce the bun the meat the cheese and everything it's just it's really well made so let's give it a try do you guys want to take a bite now let me take a bite oh dang i don't need to go to the gym this was definitely a workout it's pretty good but it's not one of my favorite ones next thing that we're going to try is the gummy coke i am really excited for this one just because like i love the mini gummy ones that are like the coke flavor so this one i know it's going to be good so let's give it a try that sounded really painful it wasn't painful though it just sounded like you know it wasn't that bad mmm does it taste like the mini ones mm-hmm i have to say our lunch was very successful i cannot wait for dessert because i know dessert's gonna be extra sweet so i will see you guys in about 40 minutes to an hour so we can have dessert and then we're gonna have dinner so yeah i'll see you guys in a bit for dessert i have ice cream and i also have a donut they both look pretty good but i think the donut's gonna be better which one do you think's gonna taste better the donut looks pretty fine right i really like how it has like the chocolate detail and like even the sprinkles so i have the ice cream we're gonna try it out to see what it tastes like vanilla look i was expecting i was like this would be vanilla for sure it is vanilla i'm also going to try the little cone strawberry this one is the one that i'm really excited for oh not me ruining the chocolate i really want to try the chocolate so i'm going to give it a try it tastes just like chocolate really well that's good so the donut one has two layers i'm gonna try the strawberry one first this one it tastes just like the chocolate drizzle on top of the donut overall i really think that the donut one was my favorite one just because like i had a lot of different flavors going on versus like the ice cream cone so i have to say this one is my favorite one so i'm going to sit here and enjoy my dessert and then we'll see what we have for dinner it is time for our last meal of the day yay i'm lucky so happy because i'm like i'm ready for some real food i'm tired of candy honestly after this video i don't think i'm gonna have candy for a very very long time so for a dinner we're having a whole buffet we do have a sushi here we also have some noodles as well as a taco now fun fact i don't know if any of you guys know this but i have never ever ever in my life tried sushi like raw sushi my mom never let me eat sushi so this is the closest i'm ever gonna get to sushi so let's see let's try i'm guessing this is kind of like the soy sauce the details i know it's so cute i really like how they put like the detail in like the rose look at this i don't know what this is supposed to be because i'm not really into sushi let's try this one it's like a double roll me trying to use chopsticks and i don't even know how to use them these are some of my favorite candies but usually i get like the peach ones i have never tried the green ones what flavor is this oh this is apple i have never tried apple ones i usually always get like the peach ones but this is really good i also want to try this one because i think this one has like a marshmallow oh the marshmallow you have to try this that is good it's like so soft and chewy that one is pretty good that one is really good i also want to try the noodles you should try one of these let's try is it lemon i don't know what is it i don't think this has a flavor it sounds crunchy oh it tastes like perfume why does it taste like perfume i don't know oh yeah no i'm not a big fan of that one no let's try some noodles this is what i'm talking about also look at the detail of this it even comes with a little egg so let's try the noodles let's try to slap the noodles impossible i really want to try the little egg oh these what are these thinking it's like marshmallow it's really it has it's like coated in sugar it looks like a marshmallow reminds me of peeps it reminds me of the peeps that's banana flavor that's really good look at this taco i'm really sad this is cardboard i really wish that like they can make the shell like gummy i feel like that would have been awesome but look at everything that's inside you should try to bite everything at the same time these are really really tough to chew guys but i have to say my favorite ones that i tried from everything were these especially because of the marshmallow it was so good also the little green rings i have never tried apple flavor so that was my first time trying it as well of this so i guess kind of like the marshmallows were like my favorite ones just because they weren't like so tough on my teeth and i wasn't like yanking on them but overall i have to say today's video was pretty successful after this video i am not going to have any more gummy bears or anything that is gummy related i'm not going to be eating it for a while i am so glad that this challenge has come to an end because right now all i can think about is just in and out a real burger with some real fries and a real drink yes that is exactly what i deserve because i feel like i put meat in my stomach through a lot after this video so don't mind me guys i'm going to go get some real food because i am literally done with this gummy food all right guys that is the end of today's video thank god because i am so done eating all this

joining and the regular guys welcome back so today I am going to do a very quick video for you guys on how to do tincture since I've kind of moved over to tincture using it for can't sugars and syrups and flowers and so on and so forth so for those of you who don't know how to make tincture there's two ways of you can do it there's the old-fashioned way of using a mason jar and your plant material and your vodka or if you've got one of these handy-dandy puppies the magic butter machine or another type of machine like that that does infusion or that does t-shirts then you're much better off to go this way so this method takes four to six week or sorry six to eight weeks and this takes four hours so if this is something that you want to do just as a one-time do you can go ahead and try that but it tinctures is something that you get into for your edibles on a regular basis I highly highly recommend trying to get one of these things it's gonna save you so much time and effort and yeah so that's it for that so I'm just gonna get right into it there's not a whole lot here we're talking vodka a jar or the machine and the biggest thing is your alcohol so for your alcohol mainly vodka is the best one now you need to make sure that it is at least a 100 151-proof or at least seventy-six percent or higher in the States you can get Everclear which I believe is around a ninety four ninety six percent in Ontario or and I don't know about the rest of Canada however in Ontario if you can find spiritus this is 76 percent you can buy it off the shelf if not we have what's called alcohol that is ninety four percent however you have to contact the LCBO the I don't know what was it I'll put the link in for you just to make it helpful quality control that's it you have to send them a request as to exactly what you want to use it for how much you want to use it a year and if they agreed then they'll send you a letter and you take that to the LCBO and while off they will give you the the alcohol alcohol so or it come back way easier get right off the shelf and so that's about it this is more than the difficulty is getting the higher percent alcohol now a trick for you if you cannot obtain the 76 percent alcohol you can do the oldest method of distillation so get your 40 percent alcohol put it in the freezer wait till the water that's all completely frozen once it's frozen you will take it out and put it over a strainer and and you just take the lid off because the alcohol does not freeze it will work its way through the ice and drip out and that is going to almost double your percentage in your alcohol by taking out that water that is the oldest method of distillation is freezing so there you go or an easy trip an easy trick for you then you can do the second time to increase it even more so that I said waited should do it if it is difficult so I'm gonna just back up the camera a little bit here for you so we can see everything and show you how to put that together alright so to do a t-shirt now you can do a tincture for any type of plant materials so this goes for your herb if you want to do rose petals so if you've got a garden and you do all kinds of herbs you can do this is the exact same way that you would do those type of textures as well if you're into herbalism and things like that this is that exactly the same way you would do it so you are going to first of all deke are pure plant material if you don't know what the garbage decarboxylation which is converting your THC a to THC you do that by putting it in the oven in a glass oven safe pan or contain here hold on one sec something like this hourglass food would be better for you if not covered with tinfoil and you put it in the oven at 240 degrees Fahrenheit for 40 minutes and then you take it out and let it completely cool to room temperature once you've got that you will place it into a mason jar if you were doing it the old-fashioned way you will pour I've got three cups here of my 76 percent spiritus alcohol shoot well hopefully your partner is not all over your counter that's it you will place your lid on for a minute and you're gonna give it a good shake then you're gonna place it in your cupboard in a dark cupboard for the next six to eight weeks and every day every once or twice a day a couple times two or three times a day whenever you happen to go into your kitchen take her out give her a good shake up put her back in the dark and I said about six to eight weeks later that tincture will be ready you will strain that material out and you're good to go now if you're doing it with the herbal magic holy mackerel the magic of butter machine sorry if you're doing it with the magical butter machine the magical butter calm it's just a simple it's actually simpler you will take everything now you have to do at least a minimum of two cups to a maximum of five cups so I am just gonna take this because I'm not doing the six to eight week method and we just pour it right into our magical butter [Music] let's go scrape the rest of that out well it's easier said than done just give that a little bit of a stir up there put your lid on Luger in and you are going to set the temperature to 130 degrees Fahrenheit or I can't see what it says in the cells if he says 94 Celsius and you are going to set it for the four-hour t-shirt that's it lights are gonna come on it's gonna do the grinding in that and after four hours we are going to strain this and that's it we'll have our texture so a lot of great reasons as I said we're making tincture is that you can make so much from your tincture as I said you can do the can of sugar check out my video on how to make kin of sugar there's the other one on canna flour powdered sugar Cantus syrup and simple syrup how to cover those so you can pretty much make all your base ingredients now with your tincture and it shows you how to do it to dehydrate it so it evaporates all the alcohol leaving your good stuff and you can then use all these ingredients then for your base cooking so you're no longer having to put butter in two places butter has no business being like jello so I'm pretty sure we could get a million recipes enough one of those recipes is going to call for butter so that now lets you eliminate the most of fires and things and lets you make things more in their natural state as well as being able to better control how strong or weak you want to make your products so you can either just use a little bit of sugar so 1/4 because sofa for example if a recipe is 1 cup you can either use a quarter cup it would be pretty mild or you can use a whole cup of can if you really wanted to render people unconscious so it's that it gives you far more versatility than using the butter or the oil you're going to get the same type of strength and yeah I definitely love using that I have a lot more oh and one thing also when you are if you are using the machine I always make sure to either have a fan if there overhead fan going or Stan fan or have the window open you want to always have air circulation whenever you're working with alcohol especially alcohol that is so highly concentrated all right and one other thing that I know a lot of you are gonna ask me which I probably should have said earlier about the D card would I would de carbon so generally on average people again it's all how personally strong you want to make your base your t-shirt so I've included the a link for a calculator so you can calculate your own but my route what I generally do is a half an ounce to one cup or one pound of butter so that's generally my rule of thumb of how the strength that I like to make mine as I said use the calculator and then you can figure out exactly how much you want to add of your plant material in order to get the strength of the dosing etc of exactly what you aren't personally and so once your your texture is done if you're using the machine after four hours you can then just strain it well with your handy this bag is awesome if you guys have this machine you know this bag is almost worth but getting it for the machine so yeah just straight around if not if you've got if you're doing it HR method then you will strain it you can use a strainer and a cheesecloth or a coffee coffee filter and for those of you who don't know what a cheesecloth is it is a fine fine mesh cotton cloth that you double and triple up to to get it as fine as you want it to and they're awesome for straining you can get them in any grocery store any dollar store they're really easy you easily two pot they're very easy to find story and yeah does it said and they're really inexpensive they're like a dollar and they're huge and you can just use whatever size you want but so that's it once you're done you will you will store it in a mason jar secure the lid on tight and keep it in a dark location and that's it for textures alright so my infusion is now done they got the lid pour it through this handy-dandy strainer just gonna get out of the extra pulp maybe squeeze around forever dropping things pour back into your clean mason jar on it and that's it you store it in a in your cupboard in a dark in a dark cover so this needs to stay at a direct sunlight that's very important otherwise it will deteriorate everything and that's it for tincture easy as pie so I hope you enjoyed that little demonstration there for you and again as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and you guys are awesome this is the first time you're watching I do hope you subscribe or at least just check out some of those other videos and I think that's all I've got for you so I have hope you have an awesome rest of your day thanks again for watching bye [Music]", "dO7VuHMBPhI": "[Music] what's up everybody my name is sarah b and welcome back to the haze today we're going to be doing another edible review we are going to be reviewing the very well known but new to me wild edibles so let's talk a little bit about wild in general they are a portland-based edible company and they specialize in using things that remind them of the pacific northwest and what makes it special and using those ingredients and those fruits and other items found in nature to make these awesome little gummies now in this box there is a hundred milligrams and there are ten small gummies i also want to just talk about real quick how the packaging is it is so cool so you open it like this and out comes this little pocket super easy to open you just squeeze on the side like this bam pop open and you will find these small little sugar coated gummies these gummies are made all with natural flavoring i absolutely loved these edibles they are not overly sugary at all which is fantastic they taste like a natural gummy something that you will find like in a trader joe's or something like that i started out with 40 milligrams and it hit it hit good too i loved it i wasn't overly i didn't feel dumb which some edibles can make someone feel dumb i didn't feel dumb i didn't feel like falling asleep was just so awesome i've been finding too many edibles lately that make you just want to pass out and these guys kept me up kept me going and once the high kind of wear it off and the after effects kind of left i still was able to have a great functioning day which is really nice i love the artwork that will did i love these little huckleberry flowers you'll see all over it and i believe every box looks a little different it goes with whatever the flavoring is which is really awesome on the inside it gives a little message and i'll read that for you the edible contains hybrid perfect for preparing for life's adventure it's a little like the perfect balance of wearing pajamas to work i just really appreciate the the thought process that went into the packaging and making of these edibles now i believe these guys are the number one selling edible in all of oregon and it makes sense they're based in portland but i found them also all over california they are a little bit more expensive than your normal edible but they are extremely consistent some edibles are really great one bag and they can taste great they'll be just like mind-blowing you can give a bag to your friend next thing you know they say it never hits them i don't believe this will be a problem with these guys i'd say if you if you were going to be hanging out at the house like all of us are right now but you're going to be studying maybe doing something for work i'd say eat one of these little guys and you're going to be chilling you'll be chilling you'll be chilling hard yeah so if you guys see these little edibles anywhere i would say pick it up you will not be making a mistake i promise you all right guys so that will be it for my small little review again my name is sarah b thank you guys so much for tuning

what delta 8 is what we usually smoke is delta 9 thc so this is a new thing that they have it's delta 8 which is another cannabinoid that people have been you know it's been picking up a lot of steam now you know kind of like when cbd came out you know people are just like well you can get this legally anywhere in the united states it's just like cbd but i won't provide any links anywhere like on the uh description because i've been deleted over cbd before so just trying to be careful but it is 300 milligrams of gummies uh our thc eight in this in these gummies and we're gonna go half on it and we're gonna see how it hits and then we're gonna be hidden on some of this gorilla glue hybrid which is ninety percent delta eight thc with 10 terps i do like to mention is that i did try the other disposable one and delta 8 does not taste like delta 9 in any way it tastes a little bit different um but mostly i just tasted the terpenes but there is a bitterness towards the end like toward like a medicine taste but you know that delta a delta yeah it just came out didn't just come out but it's been around but people haven't really been talking about it as it is now can you um just hold these for a thumbnail or something oh over here so i could i don't have to see your knee all right now open the gummies so like i said ladies and gentlemen oh yeah they even have nutritional facts on this [ __ ] i'm like damn brother you know qr code as well and you know no no you know yeah so open it and that's uh let's see what pour some in your hand actually for uh for like a thumbnail and just a few and then put the the thing so i could read the the thing you know all right yeah okay got it yeah all right so back on this camera we are gonna eat uh so there's 10 gummies each i think um so you already have two in your hand no don't drop the sugar what is this [ __ ] thc eight okay so he has five they actually have uh nine in here uh i would say maybe yeah because i i've already tried this my tolerance is a bit higher so you still have 1200 i mean you want to split on this one no that's knocking this is perfect okay all right i need to be able to function later still you guys well we don't uh so i've been told that thc 8 or delta 8 thc is a bit more mild not as intense and psychoactive as cannabis but then again we're eating it and eating thc is different than smoking or vaping so different feeling so yeah cheers it's got some chew on it that's not saying not bad this is good candy okay candy wise that's pretty far there's a car just like hello you know what i did i did think that maybe they would have had more flavors just because the the packaging was all rainbow two players or so yeah these two i wonder if there's thc in the circle sugar crystals oh it smells like a berry yeah whoa i think i ate one you just look all the salt or so what we're going to do guys because i know our tolerance or edibles don't seem to hit till like 20 20 minutes or so later not not too long i mean it doesn't hit too quick we're going to be hitting on this and then we're going to stop the video and then we're going to um i guess turn that back the camera on and tell us or tell you how we feel you know i'm saying if we do even feel anything resume the video as soon as this is done but yeah it came with the same package this came with the same uh oh yeah same person oh okay all right open up handcrafted boys [Music] there is a bit like a slight bit minimal bitterness towards the end with that candy but un barely noticeable i didn't really notice it too much that's why i said barely he said too much and barely noticed it too much see all right maybe you do i guess i'm just kidding all right um yeah we're ripping this way go ahead we're going in wow oh by the way we're outside randy's house so don't trip we're just oh [ __ ] very thin pinkish heel looking oil this would look like if it's vape oil yeah i see maple like this all right so uh i did mention in my first delta eight video that interesting uh i did mention that when i first heard of pink oil i was like what the [ __ ] but you know apparently it's uh delta eight when it's uh it shows or it's delta a that makes it pink or sometimes so i don't know i'm not a scientist in any way so they're not are they all different you think pretty sure right what do you mean like as far as the color i don't know i think they're the same throughout the day so we're going to be using the shiv you guys know the shiv right off the bat i this is it seems like a pretty nice cartridge itself probably going to lower it to let's do a 2.6 and as usual we're gonna let now he said in case it's poison i'll do it first i guess that's right so that way i get poison next that makes total sense you should let me go down see that i get poison and then you'll be like oh okay i'm not going to hit it now all right or it doesn't even hit oh yeah delta eight sorry buddy you want to try again check atomizer damn thing's pretty smart it tells you like what possibly could be wrong with it yeah that's pretty cool all right so apparently this is not compatible with this um i don't have another battery in here but i'll probably do an individual video on this but we still did take the thc so uh we're going to wait and see what's going on um do you have a battery i think i do unless you can get do you have a battery in here let me go check that's all i was thinking or now i think i do have one it just might not be good [ __ ] it it's probably better one that doesn't work right that's true i'll be right back throw this away we'll be back see he's we're really outside his house put this inside i'm feeling the delta oh the friendly farm that don't work yeah i think yeah i think it's that one that's gonna work all right let's see you guys it's just auto hit oh it's dead [ __ ] i have a charge in my car maybe we can [Applause] oh you got in the mail yeah my brother orders it i think you can't hit it like that i think i tried it before hey what's up oh [ __ ] that was your brother oh no it's all good so it has like a weird blinker time you have to like keep hitting it until like it actually turns on let me see try it it's probably because it's like oh yeah it's still blinking red still because it's gonna look kind of dead actually we're gonna get some time to charge guys yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all right boys we back um he ended up being able to sneak a hit off this so let's just get another hit off of it um it's probably been about 10-15 minutes since we did take the the thc eight gummies so uh give it a few more minutes and we'll see but i planned on you know hitting this cartridge and uh hopefully boosting uh the [ __ ] feeling of the thca heat but yeah [Music] and so this is gorilla glue thc uh okay so it doesn't taste like medicine though don't taste bad you'll feel it and when you feel it just don't stop hitting it until it blinks but uh the similar bitterness towards the end but not bad like not much pretty much like a sprite like a lemon when you're trying it honestly it tastes like [ __ ] those medicine gummies that you eat the vitamin the vitamin ones yeah it tastes like that the flintstones don't taste bad yeah you know they're they're bearable at the end of the day this is people consider you know you know uh marijuana medicine you know what i'm saying so what's to say if it tastes like medicine a little bit you know it might be more willing to try it maybe the taste of delta 8 thc is that medicine taste because i've never tasted this coming from a distillate and you're gonna be like like thc nice little taste of like lemony yeah yeah like uh like a sprite like a sprite yeah that's a good one very similar to the other jack carrera one i do like to mention that uh gorilla glue is a sativa hybrid and jeff herrera is also a sativa so that's probably why they have similar terpenes or at least like a piney lemony you know so does this hit the same like amount of thc as the other one or delta nine or something i don't even know there's different deltas you could have like delta one through nine and [ __ ] now so uh i've heard from people i don't know if this is true or not i've read it i've seen people tell me that you know uh people use delta eight to lower their tolerance on delta nine because the tolerance of delta eight does not uh is not the tolerance with delta nine but i've heard that it isn't i've heard that uh delta eight is more of a like a more mild high it's not really too much as thc you know thc or delta nine thc [ __ ] getting confused but yeah um i'm a little confused on that too but i can see like so delta a is just basically it's a new cannabinoid that's not new but it's barely getting studied right now and it's barely picking up steam just like cbd did like two years ago um people are like a lot of uh street carts or fake cartridges that are uh probably pink or this pinkish hue it's probably delta eight you know since it's legal you can buy it and then probably street dealers are probably putting it in their cartridges i don't know um but me using this one is not bad you know i believe it's 25 for a gram out the door and for people that are in illegal states that don't have access to you know uh legal cannabis products you know this is a better uh not better alternative this is an alternative wait so they uh you can buy this legally and like in the clubs right now oh i have actually seen delta a products in authentic oh sure okay yeah but you can buy this online on websites there's a lot of companies three chai shout out to naruto i believe there's another one i forgot another one he mentioned but you know uh i'm in a place where i'm fortunate enough to have companies uh message me i don't really message too many companies anymore but uh when they do message me and then they uh i check out their website and it's cool seems legit you know i will consider it you know what i'm saying yeah it doesn't taste bad at all it doesn't it's funny it does taste like sprite hey [ __ ] a lot of people like sprite you know what i'm saying dude sprite's like one of the only few sodas that i want yeah because it doesn't dye your teeth sprites [ __ ] the [ __ ] sprite so after taking a few hits off this and the gummies do you feel some some type of i feel that change i feel mellow yeah i was honestly gonna say that too like i'm not like like i'm not stupid faded you know like you would get from dabs and stuff and like real delta and 98c but i feel like just like in the first video i felt something it was definitely different than a normal high yeah like i don't feel like um i feel relaxed i feel relaxed mellowed out i don't feel like let's say if i was to like smoke a dab i'd take too much of a big dab sometimes i get paranoid i don't feel like i'm gonna get paranoid or not my mind and everything is like i'm relaxed i feel it this is refreshing because it is like a sprite you know what i'm saying and uh like off that first do a blinker do a finger and see what's up but lightweight low key i kind of feel like the edibles are starting to hit but then again it could just be you know i'm feeling this but i'm feeling because when you obviously like i mentioned earlier when you eat something it's much different than smoking or when you're eating cannabis it's much different than smoking it we're vaping it but i definitely feel it in my eyes oh yeah look at you see my new merch got the the wax right here oh [ __ ] evolution you took that photo yeah no i got it off a website that's royalty free picks so you know what i'm saying once you put it on there anyone could use it unsplash.com i think it's dead again i think we got enough hits out of it i would say uh but like i said man i am definitely feeling something different than a normal high that you would get off delta nine thc ugh oh i did just eat habit and maybe you know smoking after you're eating you don't feel it i don't [ __ ] know i'm trying to [ __ ] say something uh how are you feeling and i definitely feel high though no joke just just not like a normal high it's not a weird battery yeah it's not the best battery but it happens we made it happen yeah my eyes it matters so you know your opinion i give it i'll give it a go give it a good grade you know like i would i don't know like if i didn't i mean i didn't know about it now that i know about it and i see it around oh yeah yeah i might be like more interested on this channel too no i will say that now that i know about it from like you exposing it to me i might like if i go to the street i mean to the clubs and see it i might be more interested in buying it now because now i had an experience with it and i know it was good so i might be more interested and when i see it in the store to go and pick it up so i do say it was good yeah i like it are you would you say you're pretty i would say i'm pretty highly look at me you gotta talk and prove it oh yeah no for reals i usually usually stump i usually be stuttering looking [ __ ] like a number you're hitting pretty good and i'm proud of that y'all know me i'll be stuttering yeah so uh like i said uh earlier there's a lot of delta eight thc like companies out there so please just do your research uh this one's pretty good and i i would vouch for some other ones based on naruto's opinion because he's tried them uh but yeah just do your research and you know uh they this website that they have actually tells you like you know delta thc uh delta athc 101 has blogs articles on there so if you want to check that out and learn more on this website specifically i believe uh i'll post it in the comments post go and check it out yeah but uh let us know what you think in the comment section oh yeah and by the way subscribe to the homie you know i'm saying kind of ended with that but hopefully you did enjoy the video you got

"MTn3wB7_Jnc": "hey guys welcome back to our channel so today is gonna be a little bit of a different video we're gonna be testing out these little gummy bear molds that I got from my sister-in-law she actually sent them over for the kids for Christmas and yeah so we're gonna try them out we did actually film this video yesterday and I filmed it with my kids but the recipe didn't come out very well I think I might have made a mistake on making it so I'm gonna add a little bit more gelatin today and we're to see how these would come out so these molds you can buy on Amazon for about $8.99 I have mine here in my dish rack just dry now cuz we did use them like I said they were just kind of like jello just a tip on these gummy bears they're not like your regular gummy bears tell you buy at the store but they are a lot healthier I'm gonna be using four ingredients you can use even less if you want to just put juice with them but and you do have to keep them in the fridge and I read that they can last up to two weeks in the fridge and a container so they're not like the gummy bears that you get in a package but if your kids like little treats like that then it's perfect so what I'm gonna be using today is just this pineapple juice I got from Walmart you're gonna want so any kind of juice that's not from concentrate and then I did go ahead and go on Amazon and bought the vital proteins beef collagen it's like grass-fed beef gelatin but this is the one that they saw at Walmart so I bought this one you need three tablespoons of gelatin a cup of your juice but I'm gonna throw in some strawberries so I'm gonna have to blend them up I'm gonna put them in there then measure up a cup with the juice here then we're gonna blend it and then we're gonna put it in the saucepan we're gonna add this gelatin let it it says that it has like bloom so you're gonna see little cracks on top and when that happens then we're gonna bring it up to a simmer you're not going to want to boil the ingredients then we're gonna add our honey after we take it off the heat because you don't want to mess up any kind of benefits from the honey so we're gonna do that and then we're gonna pour it in the molds put it in the fridge for two hours and we'll show you how they come out we'll let you know if they come out really good I did see a bunch of cool like health ones you could just put like turmeric in these molds and honey you can make like cool little gummies for one like your stick or anything like that but today we're going to be doing strawberry pineapple gummy bears so let's get started [Music] so I just removed these from the bridge and it's been a little over two hours I tried one and it actually came out pretty easily this is what they look like they're super cute and the true test is gonna be the taste test so let you know they taste [Music] all right [Music] I don't phony [Music] okay good [Music] I'm Annina Seth keep them in the fridge for two weeks but these wouldn't last two minutes and my head yeah I like these I don't usually know as honey baby house honey well if I had one kid this would be like the best like your first kid when you don't give them junk after you have five it's like I think the two tablespoons of honey was perfect well I don't the rejects so there you have it your gummy bears let us know if you've made these before and if you have come up below on any recipes that you might have that are really good and we'd love to see them Thank You Carol and Fernando and the kids for sending these cool little molds and yeah if there's any other things you want to try out go ahead and comment below and we'll see you guys in the next one says Diego always says peace out and God bless Turkish work it [Music]", "Gec4mvJTpRE": "[Music]

[Music] you", "xxUeSGXgLsY": "hi friends its karena conscious and today I will talk about something that our kids laugh a lot and we ourselves eat a lot and we hear that it can be good for our joints or even as a snack or dessert I'm gonna talk about the gummy bears and all the jelly stuff that's on the market so honestly today we have a huge variety of products on the market that are available and me as a host coach and consciousness coach I would recommend to not ever eat anything that has colorings not natural colorings in it and come is consistent of pure chemicals please look at the label every time you go to the store I have something in my hand right now and I am gonna recommend this product but it does not necessarily have to be this it can be anything so this is a keto gummy bears and the three tastes in this box peach apple and strawberry I'm gonna read you the ingredients of this right now it seems like a snack that our kids love at the same time it's all natural based and the colorings are out of juices juicing natural juicing and this is healthy and this is can be eating but please avoid came across colorings and other products so ingredients of this prebiotic soluble fiber from chicory root gelatine MCT oil which is on itself an amazing an amazing supplement I would recommend everybody to take at least a little bit a day it has some malic acid it has packed in packs in and itself is absorbing the toxins from a human body and the flavor comes from apple strawberry in Peach coconut oil the colorings come from purple carrot juice chlorophyll supplement better keratin supplement which gives it better keratin gives it an orange color and chlorophyll gives it a green color this is amazing and stevia there is no sugar in this you know the kids today they are different and the sugars should be avoided for adults and as kids as well and colorings too if you want to remain healthy happy and library every day which I recommend to you so again this is categories bears but the common theory tastes but you can use anything please stay healthy stay vibrant and sigh like this video sign up for my channel if you would like to see and hear

aren't natural at all either but he says this review is gastrous Nash neo Armageddon after a few hours I had an extreme buildup of gas with no relief all I could do was lie on my bed and pray for a

This is\nserved as a pairing for one of the Le Cuvier wines but it has no alcohol in it;\nit's great for kids, it's great for anyone who likes gummy bears or\ngrapefruit juice. The recipe is very easy; start by putting about 120 milliliters,\nabout half a cup, of grapefruit juice into a bowl. Take about 22 grams, or about\n3/4 ounce, unflavored gelatin and sprinkle it on top of the juice. While\nthe gelatin is softening you're going to take about 177 milliliters, or another\n3/4 cup, of juice and put it into a small saucepan, and 59 milliliters, or\nthat's 1/4 cup of sugar, to the juice in the pan and you're going to heat that\nuntil the sugar has dissolved. Pour the hot mixture from the pan over the\ngelatin in the bowl and mix it up until it's very smooth. If you like, you can\nwhisk it to get rid of any small lumps of gelatin but then you're going to want\nto let it sit so that the bubbles subside before you pour out the mixture\ninto the mold. Gummy molds are not hard to find; I bought this one online, you can\nget them in department stores, housewares stores, and they come in different sizes.\nThis is actually considered a jumbo size, gummy bear although they really are pretty small, only about an inch in length. Since the mold is very flexible, it's a\ngood idea to put it on something solid so when you put it in the refrigerator\nit doesn't bend and make a mess. Take the grapefruit mixture and pour it\ninto a pitcher, and then use the pitcher to fill the mold. When you're pouring the\nliquid in you don't have to fill each little cavity individually, you can just\npour it in and then spread it with a spatula, an offset spatula is helpful.\nNow these will firm even if left at room temperature, but if you refrigerate them\nit will happen a lot faster. These are chilled, but they're not going\nto melt at room temperature. They're really fun and they taste good!\nThanks for joining me for One Minute Maven; for more tips look for us on\nYouTube!", "swXm_XPodwY": "alright guys so let's make this short and sweet I have six grams of gummy bears inside my peer pressure rosin bag I go over here open up my plate excuse it in there and I'm gonna get this in the center of these plates I can't do it one-handed so it will be very bad start off a little bit of pressure oh sure Jews I don't expect no big downpour like I said this is 6 grams so I'll probably get about one point three grams of return from it somewhere around there 1.2 1.3 man definitely looking good a little more pressure now be careful though because you had too much pressure you will bust the bag or the parchment paper this is really strong parchment paper it's not from the grocery store this is from peer pressure also but you can still only take so much before you rip it wide open alright guys so we're at about the 2 minute mark [Applause]

forcefully expel itself from my innards I call out to every muscle in my body for help yeah my legs are flexed in my arms and shoulders and back are stiff I managed to Waddle like a penguin to the men's restroom only to find that every stall is in use anyone looking on would think that I am having an upright seizure to be honest I'd I'd trade a seizure for this moment a thousand seizures do I go ahead and then fulfill the dream of every high school boy and and poop in the urinal the explosive gas let out and into an explosive shart I felt some wetness in my underpants one mile from home on my walk and yeah and I had a mess fortunately for compression shorts it didn't run down my legs sure enough I had I had full full-on Hershey squirts in my boxers now I can successfully say that I know what it's like to vomit out my butt my butt became an upside-down volcano those Satan's diarrhea hate bears did something to my insides that caused my sphincter to vomit out the madness what came out of me felt like someone tried to funnel the Niagara Falls through a coffee straw I nearly shat myself inside out pretty sure my boxers clogged that toilet it went on for hours I am severely dehydrated my external anal sphincter could not do his job and it remained open and relaxed while about five seconds of gas was expelled the other men can sense that something isn't right I've never experienced or even heard of that happening and I have set a new world record for most poops in a five-hour period with nine it was so unnatural that I had to check and feel if my colon had somehow pushed his way through my anal sphincter muscle I was laying in the fetal position on my bathroom floor sobbing I'm leaking horrible there was stuff coming out of me that I ate at my wedding back in 2005 I'm a 280 pound man I was sobbing I'm screaming my son is crying because he thinks he's witnessing the death of his father I told a friend about what had happened to me not a word was said what a diaper I was thrown over the stall she said she really wished that she had listened I think she was crying I caught it I lined my underwear with it and put my pants back on and I walked out of that bathroom like a champ I'm able to fit back into the jeans that I wore in high school so not all bad I suppose be sure to also buy a tub of OxiClean with this to get the blood and diarrhea stains out of your underwear you will totally spray the bowl and the back of the seat your clothes your furniture these bears cost me a pair of boxers and my dignity your pets your loved ones the ceiling fan I'm lying on the bathroom floor in the fetal position and I plan on spending the rest of the night right where I am shame on all of you who handled these beers before they got to me shame on Amazon for making these available for sale shame on the guy and the warehouse who packaged these things and shame on the UPS guy who delivered them to my door you all new and still you let me do this to myself shame on you

when making medical decisions i am a legal licensed medical marijuana patient in my state this is an educational video intended for viewers that are 18 or older in today's video we are going to be talking about delta 8 thc specifically hemp derived delta 8 thc is it really legal does it really get you medicated what's the difference between delta 8 and delta 9. i'm going to tell you everything i think that you should know about delta 8 in this video stay tuned [Music] good morning everybody my name is nate and this is nate on cannabis and today we are talking about delta eight i am sure by now you have heard of delta eight over the last six months or so i've seen it everywhere all over the internet and to be honest i've been extremely skeptical i have a lot of history with hemp products and while i do love full spectrum cbd oils and full spectrum hemp products there is a lot of snake oil salesmen out there when it comes to cbd not all cbd and hint products are created equal and even the really good hemp products that i found and there are quite a few while some do a very good job of relaxing you and relieving stress and anxiety none of them get you stoned none of them get you any kind of inebriation there is no intoxicating effect with any hemp product that i've ever tried that is until now i finally broke down and tried some delta eight thc hemp derived delta a thc and my experience was very surprising as a matter of fact the first time i tried these so these are 25 milligrams a piece right i was so skeptical about getting stoned off of a hemp product that i took three of them my normal dose from delta 9 thc is about 20 milligrams that is personally where i like to be i took 75 milligrams of delta 8 and boy howdy there is not a whole lot of difference between these gummies and the gummies that you would get at a dispensary there's a few differences and we're going to talk about it but before we get into the video i have to show a little bit of sponsor love this video is brought to you by elevate holistics elevate holistics is a telehealth clinic offering medical marijuana recommendations right here in missouri and if you need your medical marijuana card and click the link in the description you can get your medical marijuana card for just 75 now that is an affiliate link but i do not get paid if you click that link and sign up elevate holistics is a sponsor on the channel already i already got their money but if you use that link in the description it will save you fifty dollars off the normal 125 card which means you can get it for 75 dollars and saves you a little bit of money so shout out to elevate holistics link in the description all right back to delta eight so so i was talking to the manager of cassfield dispensary a while back charlie who is quickly becoming one of my favorite people now she knows that i suffer from an anxiety disorder and because of that i'm a big fan of edibles gummies they are longer lasting i don't have to medicate every 30 to 45 minutes to keep my anxiety in check i can take one dose now and go off to the depths of walmart which if you have an anxiety disorder going to walmart is insane if you don't have an anxiety disorder going to walmart is probably almost equally as insane so i'm a huge fan of gummies but she has suggested that i try delta eight because gummies are kind of expensive and i'm not always a big fan of being so medicated that you can't function sometimes that's fun i enjoy it occasionally but most of the time i need to find some kind of relief to keep my anxiety and my panic in check so that i can go out into the world and function as a normal human being so i got some of these delta eight gummies from native hemp and then shortly after i got these i was sent some delta eight gummies from top shelf hemp now this has been about two weeks and i've had a chance to really dive into them so what is delta eight thc well it is not much different than delta nine thc which you should already be accustomed to if you consume cannabis or are a medical marijuana patient here in missouri delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol is the molecular compound that gives us the intoxicating effect when we consume cannabis right so when we smoke or vape it it gives us that intoxicating effect when we eat it in an edible or consume it our liver turns that delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol into 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol which is a complete different compound of itself which gives us a more inebriating effect it lasts longer when you take inedible it's a little bit stronger it doesn't take as much to get you where you need to be so there are already different types of thc that you should be aware of delta 8 is another one now delta 8 is naturally occurring it naturally occurs in cannabis and it is derived from hemp hemp is just a legal definition for marijuana that has less than 0.3 thc in it so all of the delta 8 on the shelves that are being sold in stores is hemp derived it comes from plants with low delta 9 thc and actually low delta 8 thc delta 8 doesn't really grow in abundance in any plant whether it be hemp or marijuana they actually extract it by isolating and extracting cbd and once that cbd is isolated they use a process that includes acids they actually convert that cannabidiol into delta a thc so it comes out cbd then they turn it into delta eight thc and then put it back into products so they cook it into edibles or they put it into a mixture and spray it onto hemp flour or turn it into a distill it into a concentrate like delta eight dabs or delta eight vape carts and because they derive it from actual hemp legally grown him and because delta 8 is not delta 9 it's being sold all across the country but how legal is it actually is it going to stay legal what if you want to sell delta 8 gummies should you be concerned if you possess delta 8 gummies and you're not a medical marijuana patient should you be concerned well to give you a little bit more information on the legality of delta 8 here is matt gunther with the american cannabinoid association congress is the law making body with constitutional authority to write laws and pass bills so the 2018 farm bill which was crafted by congress and signed into law by the president clearly establishes legislative intent that specifically protects hemp as currently defined now this protects the plant cannabis sativa l and any part of the plant including the seeds derivatives extracts cannabinoids isomers acids salts salts of isomers whether growing or not as long as it's below 0.3 delta 9 thc on a dry weight basis this is important because regulatory agencies do not have the constitutional authority necessary to change this law until congress passes an amendment or updates the language of the farm bill in 2022 this federal definition of hemp that protects delta hthc and other emerging cannabinoids remains the law of the land secondly the language of the interim final rule doesn't target delta 8 thc instead it references synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols now while delta hthc is structurally considered a tetrahydrocannabinol the language of the farm bill specifies that its congressional protections supersede the classifications found in the controlled substance act furthermore delta eight thc isn't usually synthetically derived now while it can be chemically synthesized from non-hemp derived precursors it is generally derived from hemp via the isolation of cbd again not only is delta 8 naturally occurring in the plant it is also derived from the hemp plant both of these characteristics make the compound federally compliant under the 2018 farm bill you can expect delta 8 products to remain legal till at least 2022. now will the federal government change the farm act that remains to be seen that's if we don't see federal legalization of marijuana between now and then which is still kind of what about urine tests what if you work a job where you're kind of afraid to become a medical marijuana patient because you don't want to fail a urine test or maybe you're on probation and parole and you think well i'm going to take some of these delta 8 hemp gummies that way i don't fail on that urine test when my po pops me are you gonna drop hot the answer is yes you are probably going to drop hot you are going to fail your analysis test if you are taking these gummies because even though its delta hthc going in once your body metabolizes that delta eight once your body metabolizes thc in general it all comes out the same most panel tests are testing for thc metabolites so delta 8 delta 9 doesn't matter what's going in it's all coming out the same so if this is something you're using to get by on that account you might want to rethink your strategy people say that it is the same high without the paranoia or anxiety that some people get from taking edibles or overdoing it when they take edibles it does seem to be a less intense experience so if you are a new patient that wants to try edibles maybe you have a medical marijuana card but you haven't tried any of the brands that are out there yet because you've heard the horror stories of people calling 9-1-1 because they thought they were going to die in some cases they thought they already were dead no charges have been filed against a police officer who admits to confiscating marijuana from suspects and then baking it in brownies and once he and his wife were full and high they thought they'd overdosed and called 9-1-1 i think i'm having an overdose of this still as my wife overdose of what marijuana i don't know if they had something in it can you please send rescue did you guys have fever or anything no i'm just i think we're dying how much did you guys have i don't know we made brownies and i think we're dead time is going by really really really really slow well instead of being charged parallel sorry instead of being charged the police department let the officer resign his wife was not charged either so far police officials have not commented on the case now how do you follow a story like that those are funny stories but they can be scary so if you're worried about having an experience like that delta 8 is a good intro into it for me personally i started taking delta 8 because i can't afford dispensary prices all the time i just can't most people probably can't either delta 8 is about half the price of delta 9 thc it's actually a little bit less depending on where you get it these 250 milligram packages of native hemp delta 8 are actually only about 25 and if you pick them up at cass fill dispensary you can get them on sale right now for 19 so if you are looking for a good intro into edibles delta 8 is a good place to start in my opinion or if you're like me and just can't afford to hit the dispensary all the time delta a really gets me through in between those dispensary runs or caregiver drops delta 8 is a good replacement or if edibles tend to give you over anxiety or panic attacks like they do some people then delta a might be something that you want to look into for that because it is it is less intense i feel less anxiety less paranoia all of that that they used to advertise delta 8 i truly experienced just at a less potency than you normally would feel so just to recap delta 8 is hemp derived thc it is made from converting cbd into delta a thc it is 100 legal for now it will make you drop on a urine test so if you're on probation parole or you're in a job or that's a problem i wouldn't recommend using this or any other cannabis products but they do work and they do work as described as always this is a subjective opinion this is my personal experience so let me know in the comments have you tried delta 8 products what did you think about it i am becoming a huge fan and with the current price of edibles at the dispensaries these may be my new go-to for quite some time as always thanks for

so simple to make they're easy they're kid-approved you can take them on the go and they're really low-calorie so if you want to see how to make these and how to customize them yourself then go ahead and keep watching the video you don't need that many things you're gonna need some hot water some teabags some gelatin liquid sweetener and some mix-ins if you'd like to switch up the flavors today I'm going for Tazo passion tea I love this blend it's so delicious it's very fruity so I love that I can make some fruit gummies and I also love that I can make sour gummies which I'll show you how I do that in just a second I like to use something with a spout so this little measuring cup works perfect for this if you don't have a water kettle then you're gonna want a microwave or boil your water ahead of time and then let it steep in this little pitcher so that there's a spout on it so after it cools down I put it in the refrigerator to chill completely look how dark that is it's just so good it extracted all of that delicious flavor from the teabags and you don't have to squeeze out your teabags like I do but I like to get all the liquid out some T's it can make the liquid cloudy and if you want to avoid that to make nice clear gummies just don't squeeze it I don't have a problem with this specific tea so at this point you with your cold liquid you're gonna add your gelatin you can get this kind of gelatin which you would just have to measure out with a table spoon or a scale like I'm doing here and I'm gonna measure out 28 grams but you can also use the packets and it's four tablespoons or four packets so I'm gonna measure out 28 grams which is also equal to one ounce on my scale and then I'm gonna stir that in completely you want to mix it in really really really well and if your liquid is cold it'll mix in really well so when you do chill it make sure you chill your tea down all the way and then you're gonna microwave it for 30 seconds three times depending on your microwave until it's completely liquid and hot and then I just like to give it one more stir just to make sure that it's totally incorporated I like liquid sucralose you guys can use whatever sweetener you want you can use granular sweetener and just make sure that it's hot enough to mix in and totally dissolve the sweetener so I like to use a roughly half of a teaspoon of sweetener you can use liquid stevia if you'd like and then at this point you'll add in all of your mix ins you can do apple cider vinegar for Tang but I want mine really sour so I went ahead and I'm going to use some citric acid I have a bunch of this stuff it's food grade and it's totally fine to add if you don't want to use some sort of man-made substance then you can use lemon or whatever else you'd like so just mix it in really really well you want that completely dissolved because that stuff is super sour and if you'd like you can add your extracts I have lemon and raspberry but I'm not gonna add anything else to mine but that's just an option I want to let you guys know about so give a one final little stir always taste your mixture because that's what your gummies are gonna taste like I wanted mine just a little bit more sweet so I added a little bit more liquid sucralose you know do what you guys want to do if you want I'm super sweet Yolo just do whatever you want to do and then I am going to scrape off all the bubbles because once this sets the bubbles are going to basically dry on top and to avoid it looking not so appealing you just go ahead and scrape those off it's not a big deal I really love this mold I got it at a thrift store but I'm pretty sure that you could find something similar on eBay or Amazon and it works really well for these little individual gummies if you're extra just scrape off the top again just to make sure that they're nice and clear and chill them all the way so those are easy to remove from the mold and this is what you're left with eat some and then package the rest up I keep mine in the refrigerator so that they're nice and chewy every single time I want one and I hope you guys try this out if you do leave me a comment down below let me

million other people made their own story games like so many story games were so trash and then people stopped being interested in story games because of the trash games so I'm hoping it doesn't become like that with a piggy inspired game so make good ones", "PfOlImiBoyc": "Murphy are you okay I was right I fixed it oh oh wait okay me gets a load of this [Music] [Music] throw me your juice

and welcome back today we're making some homemade fruit gummies these are all-natural they can be made with fresh-squeezed juice and they're actually really easy we're going to be using the fruit shack here to create these gummies you can find these on Amazon and each kit comes with two droppers four trays and four different shape molds so I'll be showing you a different recipe for each mold today to start off by making our grape gummies and I'm going to be using some pre-done juice this is just organic juice I got at the natural food store you can use fresh-squeezed which is what I'm going to be using for the rest of the recipes but in a pinch this will do so we add our juice we add our gelatin get that all in there and then you're just going to let it do its thing for just about three minutes next we'll take it over to the stove and mix until it's dissolved and warm but not quite boiling then you're ready to start filling your molds Aarthi so cute they're little grapes which is totally appropriate because we're making grape gummies when they're all filled we're going to place them in the refrigerator for 30 minutes until set at that point we can take them out of the refrigerator pop them out of the molds and they're ready to eat I really love the freedom of being able to put whatever you want in these and you can skip all of that unnecessary packaging for a recipe number two we're going to be making our orange gummies this one I kept very very simple and I just used some fresh-squeezed orange juice and a little a sorbic acid so same thing here pour your juice into your little pot you're going to add in gelatin and let that do its plain I also add a little bit of honey so you can do that to sweeten them slightly and I love doing that in a natural way where other than all the added sugar from typical fruit snacks again we did corresponding mold so for orange I did the orange mold and look how cute they are when they're done little oranges next up we're making our strawberry gummies and for this I did some fresh juicing of strawberries I got to admit I don't think I've ever do strawberries before but they're really good I added a tablespoon of lime juice to this one and it just really complimented the flavor I made them a little bit more tangy but for the gummies it was perfect I had a little bit of honey and then did the gelatin I also let that sit on the stove I added the honey on this one after it was already starting to get warm you can do it either way and then once it was dissolved then I filled up our molds one of the nice things about this kit that it has two of the droppers in it number one you're able to get really precise but also you can fill up molds and let your kids help too so as long as they're you know old enough to be careful it's kind of a fun little mommy-and-me project and of course they're going to want to eat them even more if they're helping along the way so I love that about these now if you do what I did and you forget to put your molds on the trays never fear because the car that they insert it works perfectly so I'd realized that I hadn't showed you how to pop these out of the mold yet so I figured I would show you on the strawberry you can see they just come out really easily I think it's all about having the right proportion of the gelatin you're using and the fruit juice but any juice will do last step we are making our Apple and spinach gummies these taste so good and I love that they're green thin and with the Apple it just was really cute and you don't taste the spinach really at all but you still get all the good nutrients this one I actually added three or four handfuls of spinach and like I said you don't taste it at all so we had our fresh juice gelatin let it sit cooked it on the stove and then put it in the frigerator for 30 minutes and there you go they're great in school lunches anything you're doing with the kids and I have to be honest our kids hadn't ever had gummies until I got this kit and started making them which one's your favorite camp ain't it enjoy them igloo and I'm gonna shower you in and they're laughing would you like to wall it well I hope you guys enjoyed the video a thumbs up if you did don't forget to share it on social media if you want to share with your friends how they can make natural gummies with fresh juice and we'll see you guys soon

really tried I've only tried a little bit but never really got the full length experience but anyway what we're trying today some are [ __ ] edibles but bowel cancer so what we got today I never tried this before I'm using uh-oh so the reason one is so [ __ ] bright right here is because I have a little lamp and that has a connect to it that's why I clamped it onto my tripod and so I'm just using the edge of my camera right here I mean on my desk I'm using the edge of my desk to hold the tripod and I'm just blocking in my room cuz right now it's like 1:30 in the morning I'll get back to y'all in an hour [Music] [Applause] let me do some research on this [ __ ] before I get [ __ ] [ __ ] hey Manny Pacquiao all right guys so now it's 4:00 in the morning and I still don't feel nothing so I'm gonna take a half of another we'll keep y'all updated [ __ ] if anything I still got this bad boy right here but yeah I'm gonna kick back watch moo tang and I'll keep you posted okay guys so this is an update of Houston's tank he's still asleep right here so he babe he buried uh what he buried himself actually I'm just gonna give him 48 to 72 hours to get acclimated to his tank because it does it is stressful getting put in a new environment which is totally understandable for reptiles such as him so yeah hopefully later on today it'll be out walking around in [ __ ] and so tomorrow we're gonna go get them a new UVB light although they don't need a UVB light they do seem to like it and so if you get too hot in this little rock right here he can always walk to this hide right here which is a little half tree we're still waiting for these edibles to hit and I'll be back all right guys so they have a serious talk real quick right now it's 6:00 a.m. been awake all day this is why I never really wanted to try edibles cuz I wouldn't I didn't want to spend money on something that I didn't know was gonna work on me or not because I have read some people there's some weird reason don't don't feel anything so they get no side effects or anything and I'm guessing what I'm one of those people cuz I didn't get any side effects I've I mean I've eat brownies before I know that I do get high off right homey brownies again I ate up around 2:30 it's now 6 a.m. and only how I feel it's from the last joint I just had the high I'm feeling now is from the previous joint I wrote and it's not secret there's another joint that I just wrote this was a review on the edibles I'm gonna read it as 0 today whoa it's rated at 303 just because it did taste pretty good I guess nice pretty big chunky piece of candy it was pretty good has its highs like I could rate it because I thought about getting another pen but I literally saw that said they I got it yeah it's gonna be it for long

today we're gonna make a flavor and I let you see the video why we making a flavor because I wanna make videos but I don't have why was that so here's the flavors I got something up real quick singing toast cadet ship is delicious candy can't see it pineapple I'm gonna make a pineapple down the so do everything I need here beaker my electric stir mr. gummy candy flavor here flavor here you go 25% I got my nicotine hear and understand off with that so this is 100 milligrams per milliliter so whatever I put in here cuz I'm gonna make a 100 milli or badge he's going to be equal familiar no double down 2.5 ya gonna wash that off it work alright don't eat candy you put in some gummy candy 20 milliliters we go I had a 20 milliliters of gummy candy in there better record that I guess not what fun I just chose 20% for that because I wanted that TV the most prominent flavor I wanted 5 milligrams of pineapple in there pineapple there we go nice five years.when would do next is add 15 milliliters of propylene glycol so meet 30 milliliters of propylene glycol total because the flavor is propylene glycol 40 nice pour the rest of the mix into I [Music] tried making 200 milliliters at a time I need a bigger stirring stick you think okay the music is mmm let's focus friend is sweet then I drop the Skype ticking and we're gonna steer this no pineapple gummy bears mhm yeah watch that for a few minutes [Music] [Applause] [Music] you know now it is smelling really good right now the strong odor of gummy bears and pretty faint odor of pineapple so I miss it with that a magnetic mixer and I like how white and fluffy it's because that means a lot of air went into it and that'll oxidize the nicotine it smells really good right now really strong so for my final step I got this dope Tupperware here it is a 119 not 1880 milliliter Tupperware I just pour that in here I don't always put 25% flavor in there it's gonna be pretty strong order than this [Applause] [Music] senex flavors and since the fda is coming up with a ban on flavors I would highly recommend doing it yourself if you want to continue to be flavored electronic cigarettes but it's not just about the ban on flavors it's also about being able to select your nicotine level I put that away where do we sit dangerous 15 is highly addictive man and I'm down to like point 5 milligrams I still get big clouds and a ton of flavor and flavors are actually really cheap I don't want to mix my own I can always go to a big store and with my mixing materials here it's just like water it down with propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin it's super cheap to get invested and do it yourself bill your own RTA's me don't clog machines you know flavors and now man yeah I highly recommend it also does anybody else who watches my videos make their own flavors please post the video or something show me your video I want to see other people's flavors I want to see other people making EC I look good I just feel like I'm one in a million I'm making my own flavors and they're dill but always do I love them there's no real recipe here in let you watch the video until next video [Music]", "4u0q18pDUD0": "all right so I'm gonna show you how we can extract caffeine from coffee beans and put them into gummy bears that sounds really awesome but tell me how do you get caffeine out of a coffee bean I'm glad you asked you can watch this really awesome animation that's going to show you how we extract caffeine from coffee beans [Music] I love watching science cartoons that was really cool all right so we have our caffeine now what's next so now we can begin making our gummy bears and I will get you to help me so first we are going to take this water gelatin and our caffeine which was already extracted all right you will add that to the pot all right a little bit of this a little bit of that some chemical and the caffeine all of it all of it whoo whoa sorry I should have warned you try to burn me out a little bit all right and don't forget to add the unflavored gelatin unflavored this will just help it get a little bit more firmer than jello all right well I hope this strawberry gives me a better flavor event in no flavor hey it has caffeine so I think any flavor will do oh that's a good point all right so we are just going to keep mixing this until everything dissolves all right and then we'll cut the heat off and add the cold water so how much caffeine Zune distributors so each gummy bear contains about 55 milligrams of caffeine okay so how many would I need for one cup of coffee though so since one cup of coffee is around 96 milligrams of caffeine two gummy bears would be equivalent to about one cup okay thank goodness you're good at math yes well looks like all the clumps of jello are gone yeah it looks like we're good to go so let's cut this heat off and we can add the rest of our cold water so how does this compare to what you do in the chemistry lab Leah I think chemistry and cooking it's all relative right you're just adding a bunch of things mixing things together all a science so if you want to add this to pour it into here pour the what should we call it into the doohickey that is some like Wisconsin or Roe braska I'm really good with my scientific terms so now that we have our mixture ready to go I'm gonna use a syringe because it's a little bit easier to fill each of these up and we will make our gummy bears [Music] all right and we're done that was really quick I know and now we are ready to put them in the cooler all right after you okay and how long do those have to sit in there so they just need to sit for about 20 minutes until they harden up and then they will be just like regular gummy bears all right I can't wait these look like home there's a better serve home so they are they have hardened and they are ready to go so oh there's that tiny wobble all right so I think we should do a little taste test all right I'm ready let's see if this caffeine actually I'm feeling it I think you have to let it wait a little bit longer oh okay so that was just pussy-boy effect I think that was a placebo oh my bad I could definitely see it in these yeah it tastes just like a regular gummy bear you can't even taste the caffeine like strawberry delicious yet I'm gonna be super Jackson super dad yeah alright this is awesome you should try it and if you have any other experiments that you want us to try let us know please tag it alright till next time [Music]", "p6oKnG_sEwc": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where and thank you so much

bowl of chocolate this is Aldi dairy my milk chocolate and we're just gonna go ahead and stop but you guys in a slightly different position today we are at the dining room table rather than in the kitchen because I thought it might be nice if you could actually see me I was talking to you instead of just looking at my hands all the time so let me know anyway what you think of this new position we might be able to do a little bit more of this if people like it yeah so we're just gonna get these gummy bears all covered up in chocolate it's Wednesday today my favorite day of the week we have trivia tonight which means I didn't have to cook which it's always a good thing so apparently gummy bears will sink in chocolate you know um I also wanted to get some help from you guys if possible I guess I better start at the beginning it is gonna be my birthday in about two weeks and I'm not gonna tell you how old I'm gonna be literally guess so let me know how old you think I'm gonna be but in the last six months sort of since my daughter was born a lot of people that I have known not necessarily being close to but people that I've known have died and it's making me feel really quite mortal and like you know knowing that one day I'm gonna die and that's kind of a morbid thought and not really something that you want to think about but it's true and I am not afraid of dying or really worried about dying but what I have been thinking about more and more is that I don't want to die and wish that I had done more than I've done so studying this YouTube channel is part of that but also this year so between this coming birthday and my birthday next year I want to make sure that I do a lot and have a lot of experiences we just recently went hot-air ballooning thanks Matt for looking us up with that and those tickets that was amazing and I've been making a conscious effort to say yes to things that I maybe wouldn't necessarily have said yes to in the past for mainly for financial reasons like if there is a maybe a concert or something that I might have liked to go to but we're a little bit short of money in the past I would have said no but recently I've just been trying to you know find the money to find the finances because ultimately I mean we can save up money money will come coming to our lives while everywhere working that's not a problem but why what's the purpose of saving if you're missing out on life and not having experiences and not making memories and not having fun you know so I really want to make sure that what I think saving is important and that we should be doing that I want to make sure that I'm also living my wife and that's where you guys come in I would really like for you guys to help me make a list of things to do this year so bearing in mind that finances are you know a little bit a little bit limited a little bit on the tighter side because we do have two small children at home and I'm not back at work yet although I will be in a couple of weeks um so I'm going to be signing up to a course on writing children's books children's picture books that's that's in mace I'm pretty excited for that and I would really love for you guys to give me some ideas of things that you have done or things that you wish you had done or would like to do if given the opportunity and it doesn't have to be anything outrageous it might be like you know maybe you would really like to go for a hike of really tall mountain or something like that just you know throw some ideas at me of things that would be fun things that I can do either by myself or with my family so that I don't die with no memories and you know I know I just don't want to get old and wish that I've done more does anyone else ever feel like that like you know really sort of yeah I guess mortal is the word just like you know you don't live forever in hashtag Yolo and all that sort of stuff my husband hates it when I say hashtag Yolo and it's so funny because I say it fairly on a fairly regular basis Pacific and he just gets so irritated at me he's like you're not a teenager and I'm not that's giving away at least one a clue to how old you might think that I am and anyone who knows how old I am and that I'm Karen if you're watching this don't tell them let them guess on their own so we're just getting these gummy bears covered up ready for trivia tonight this is not as hard as I thought it would be the more that I kind of things in chocolate the more that I practice the easier it seems to be to know how much to put on and how much to shake off and that sort of thing and I'm still not super confident in my tempering ability I actually feel like I'm a lot better with the white chocolate then the milk chocolate for whatever reason but I don't know that is what it is I suppose and I've got a couple of ideas lined up for Easter oh the baby's making room I might have to go and get [Music] yeah definitely all right hold on SEC sorry about that she wanted to get up fresh gloves so don't panic what are we talking about oh yeah Easter um so I've got some IDs with some east of videos that are gonna be coming out closer to Easter I think I can do like a week's life but really that might be a little bit ambitious for the amount of time that I have which is slightly limited but also if you have any ideas for things that you would like to see me attempt to do with chocolate let me know and I'll give it a go I know how much longer oculus baby this is gonna be interesting would have to be a fairly expensive item because they're so small and it just takes it would just take so long to chocolate cover enough moving noises with your toy - today my girl today so I'm just trying to getting chocolate on my fingers and so I'm squishing it around in my fingers to get it covered and that seems to be working [Music] why don't you try and make a bit more noise noise it's funny get then yeah just one just one block of chocolate in here and I think she's so excited it's good being awake isn't it can you say something [Music] [Music] [Applause] hey well I think that's probably enough for you guys didn't we get the point go ahead and finish this up and I'll bring me back when it's time to alrighty time to package there was just a few little gummy bears left to be honest there would have probably been enough chocolate in the bowl to cover these but there was no space left on the paper and I didn't want to get another piece of paper out to cover them so I just didn't so we've got I'm gonna do four I'm not going to bother to count them out just because they're so small and I'll have to count all of them and we divide by 4 and my brain is not in a maths mood at the moment [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'll show you a place up [Music] and that that I'll show you close up this is what they look like up close alright time for a taste test I took the ugliest ones it's good Haribo gold bits are pretty chewy but if you can get

works positively with our endocannabinoid system which is responsible for keeping our body in homeostasis now they have gummy bears there are sour gummy rings and gummy worms I have the gummy bears I was on the phone Michelle you know before I went and was knocked out and I'm like you don't taste one bit of CBD in this oh my god put two in my mouth and what it says 15 well I guess I had a hundred milligrams of CBD I am I am really I'm really impressed with this no I'm not a teen on the camera I gotta work later I'm not trying to go back to sleep I took two so I was a hundred milligrams [ __ ] you need one one this is amazing and I'm done you don't I've had many gummies and you know maybe like right to the end tasting some of the CBD or in the Middle East you don't taste one lick of CBD in this it's just so sweet and good you're not usually you know what it says I can't do that with this because it's it tastes good and it would not give them so this isn't oh this is do I have a playlist of playlists or just gummy bears if they have a gun wow this is number one on my list for taste add efficiency effectiveness no I Wow I'm shot yo girl I look like I'm not in gotta go to work there you

elderberry syrup into the bowl okay yep and a half quarter cup gelatin into the ball along with it yep and you got to kind of work with this quickly not like you don't want to make a mess with it but you want to stir it kind of closely together it's all mixed we are going to mix the half cup of hot water and which is right here and you want to make sure that it's not boiling water just hot water and then we started with a whole cup of elderberry syrup we are going to take the rest of the other berry syrup and pour it on in with our other a mixture your line makes sure it's blue is it yeah oh it is oh oh they're very sharp it's very expensive yes you wanna make sure you get every drop okay all together [Music] good job and you don't want to spill it cuz it's really expensive after they are all started and your mixture is smooth you're going to want to take your silicon trans which I bought little bears but they have different designs and the new dropper and drop them in up to the top and then you're gonna want to chill in the fridge for about two hours until they Harden then you can enjoy a lot of people just use you know like a bread pan or something there just pour their mixture in there and chill it and then cut it into squares and that works too and when you store these elderberry gummies you can store for up to a week and you're gonna want to put like parchment paper between the layers so they don't stick to each other and things like that but yeah if your child doesn't like just taking it by spoonful with the syrup or I just want a new fun way to make elderberry gummies I already want the benefits off the gelatin this works great so it looks like after 2 hours our little bears are done let's pop one out let's see it so cute all right silence tell me how it tastes good mm-hmm daddy says what's gummy there I hope you enjoyed our video hi this is why you don't write don't you step no overflow books our cousin it's about what happening yeah alright hope you enjoyed our video bye let us know in the comments if you decide to make these dummies", "_RUjGvspR7g": "hey guys ever since I made orange jello I've been dying to try different variations and this watermelon jello that we're making today is perfect for summer I'm Megan I'm passionate about finding ways to make life with kids easier in the kitchen so let's both our ingredients you'll need a whole seedless watermelon coconut water and unflavored gelatin so the first thing we need to do is slice into our watermelon make sure that you're getting a seedless watermelon so you don't have to find all the seeds so I'm going to take a really heavy knife and cut right through once my watermelon is sliced I'm scooping all the flesh right into a blender so I'm going to bring it down and I'm just gonna use a spoon to do this with but I'm really gonna dig in here and get everything out so I've really scooped every bit of watermelon flesh that I can out of the watermelon you'll also notice that there's some pure watermelon juice left behind and what I'm gonna do is to put that right through a strainer into my container so I'm going to dump it in and then I'm going to use a really high-powered blender to puree the water mine once my watermelons pureed I'm gonna pour it through a strainer and that's because I want a really pure juice so there's not a lot of texture in my jello my juice has been strained but I want a very very pure juice otherwise the texture is not quite right in the jello and I experiment too many times so I know so what I'm gonna do is dump out the dregs of this into my sink and then restrain it through here until I have about two cups my juice is finally ready and I'm going to combine it with my gelatin next now I am using a grass-fed gelatin today because you guys commented in my orange dollar recipe that this is the kind I should be using and I take your comments very seriously so it's what I'm using today I'm going to sprinkle it right in my pan and to it I'm gonna add my watermelon juice and finally I'm gonna add a little bit of coconut water this is because even though the watermelon juice has been strained it's a pretty thick juice and this helps send it out I'm gonna let this sit for about two minutes for the gelatin to dissolve before putting it on my stove I'm gonna turn the burner on low and whisk constantly for about five minutes my jello mixture is all melted and next I need to pour it into my container my vessel which is my empty watermelon what I'm gonna do is Pat it dry because I have found that if you don't have a really dry really clean that watermelon the jello just kind of slides off it tends to do that anyway but this really helps it stick a little bit more you can see that I put my watermelon in a bowl that's so I don't have to hold it while I pour my jello in all that's left to do is let your jello set in your refrigerator for about four to six hours my watermelon is out of the refrigerator you can tell my kids gotcha before I was able to show you guys the final product but I hope your kids love it as much as mine do it's a true testament to what a fun summer treat it is thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye guys", "p4yLFt9xZE8": "how can you see me better now I was up oh that's not even gonna work [ __ ] boys get bored what were you doing what were you doing young

where we review marijuana edibles and help you make sense of your dispensary you guys might be wondering why I've got this Nutella in front of me and that is not because I've switched over to reviewing non marijuana edibles that's just because I'm taking this as a vessel for fat because I'm looking at another gummy today I'm looking at the cushy punch TKO 200 milligram lime flavored gummy edible I don't know if you can see it that package is a little shiny so it might not show up on the camera there on the back we've got some nutrition information oh and guys real quick as well this is one of our week's minis where instead of our customary 30 60 and 120 minutes I just come out to you the initial time and after 2 hours to let you know how we're feeling so first things first when it comes to gummies I always like to have a little fat first and I like to have a little fat I like to have a little Intelli so I'm just gonna take a nice little lick I wish delicious Nutella yum yum and now that I've got some fats in my body I feel more comfortable with taking this and this is a surprisingly potent edible this is so small and they proclaim it's 200 milligrams I've never been a fan of gummy edibles I don't think they've ever been as effective oops but I do think they are more effective when you are when they are consumed with us so here we go here is what the edible the looks like right there we'll try to open this up oh wow it is very plain-looking it is just like a green shot of jello smells a lot like marijuana smells a hell of a lot like weed probably even opening this up you'd get caught because it smells so much like weed a little difficult to get out and there we have it for tiny little squares and apparently this is 200 milligrams THC I say we shall see here we go down the hatch all at once oh oh that is bad oh it tastes they say lime it tastes just like marijuana except in a gummy version and that flavor is sticking around oh that is vile yeah let me do a little bit more fats Thank You mysterious camera person mm okay that's better you get that nasty taste in my mouth I hope it's going to be worth the anguish because this is a 200 milligram edible they say it's won some kind of award and the bud tender recommended it very highly and for something so small it was quite expensive at ten dollars so I mean I've got high hopes even though it isn't gumming I will check back with you guys in two hours to let you know if those high hopes are validated or not thank you so much for watching we'll see you soon it's been a bit of 90 minutes welcome back to wheats I know I said I'd check back in about two hours but it's only been about 90 minutes and the reason I'm here early is because the experience sort of already peaked and is fading I'm actually kind of already pretty much done sober which is unfortunate men what a colossal disappointment the cushy punch TKO is it's expensive it tastes like [ __ ] and it doesn't get you high at all that is three strikes and you are out uh cushy punch TK arrow more like a big cushy punch TK no thank you hard pass woof-woof-woof if you see the sound of dispensary near you just a boy and I'll cost grab anything else this is gonna do nothing for you except thin your wallet well that's thank you so much for watching wheats sorry that we had a disappointment on this review but hopefully we've got better product around the corner thank you so much for watching okay catch you guys next time", "3sTzBVIdx5o": "yo it's your boy Kill'em FTW\nI always kill them for the win and you're watching me,

"G2V6r0X_-bI": "g'day welcome to the simple cooking Channel today I'm going to show you how I make alcoholic gummy bears these are so simple so yummy let's go get a small saucepan and put in a third of a cup of water one packet of jell-o or jelly crystals something like this then add 15 grams of unflavored gelatin and just let that sit for five minutes to glorify and absorb the water now the unflavored gelatin here that I use is this kind now for those that don't know what unflavored gelatin does that's what makes jello become gummy so if you just use jello it'll be very wobbly and fall apart you put the unflavored gelatin in it becomes gummy you get the texture of the gummy bear all righty then now that this has globocide and absorbed the water turn the heat on to medium want to bring this to the boil and have this dissolve the crystals all right that looks ready now turn the heat off and we'll get to the next part and for however many colors you want just do this with each different color now get something else like a measuring cup that has a poorer on it and add about anywhere from a quarter to a third of a cup of vodka now add this to it now get your molds of little bears and just pour the mixture straight in just leave these here on the counter for about 15 minutes so they can set just slightly and then transfer them to the freezer where you leave them for 20 to 25 minutes if you want to only put them in the fridge leave them in the fridge for about 45 minutes to an hour and just take them straight out as you can see alcoholic gummy bears big gummy they wouldn't get to do that if they were only jello YUM and any other colors that you've chosen oh there you go now it's a party so you've got tons of alcoholic gummy bears mmm beautiful I hope you like these oh yeah this little dude whoo yummy yummy mmm oh so good it's drinking time I'll see you next time for my next meal Oh", "oaSZCYzC-o8": "[Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] um [Music]

probably had it before also or some of you probably has never paid to stew it never seen anything ever but uh they're thieves right here BAM yeah they called Haribo gold bears and they've been out in the 1920 twos well since 1922 and these particular gummy bears even though they're in America they've been they're manufactured in Turkey so the name if you throw your off that's the reason obviously is not an American name and yeah so let me look at the other trician facts calories or 140 total fat is zero sodium is 10 milligrams total carbohydrate or 33 milligrams well 33 grams sorry about that sugar it's 18 grams and protein is 2 grams percent daily values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet let's get down to the ingredients the ingredients glucose syrup from wheat or corn sugar blue team text droids from wheat or corn citric acid corn starch artificial and natural flavors not surprised where else palm kernel oil caribou carnauba wax whites beeswax yellow beeswax yellow 5 red 40 blue one okay so apparently this is not all natural type of gummy bear there's not a natural recipe or anything like that whatsoever but uh anyway I'm just here to test it out so see what's about go ahead and get this bag open it says oh there we go it's just ripped in the corner whatever alright alright the pain guys you know the routine take a handful of these guys catch it yeah yeah got their mirror now right I had Anna frigerator yeah I didn't wanted to get all sticky thing like that so yeah ideally keep it in a cool dry place of course mmm I'm getting flavor I taste up on the bear he has orange raspberry strawberry pineapple living with all the flavors heads on the bag so I'm tasting I'm tasting a bit of pineapple a little bit of orange so you know a red one there by itself mmm okay so the flavor is there it's not strong which is more like a good thing you know you don't want to don't have a ton of sugar in there which is pretty good 18 grams okay all right so of course like Matt had a frigerator for a while so if you leave it on top of your fridge or in the cabin somewhere like somewhere dry and cool you'll get the flavors right away but other than that you can actually taste this a light taste which is not bad because ideally these are gonna be you know you don't really see the kids or whatever so you know with them bouncing all over the wall but overall what I recommend this to you guys to the people who's watching this video right now yeah I would even though there's a hell and there was now Organic of course but you know it is what it is guys nothing crazy in there it's nothing crazy in there I tell you that that's a good thing so yeah I recommend it gives you kids you know if you want to yourself your dope get yourself good your grandparents it's good enough oh I already I have had gummy bears in here so pretty important that these didn't suck huh that would motivate me to the team eating gummy bears but on a scale of one to ten I give it our way are you a nine yeah given I get a green one yeah give it a nine all right hurry Bo go bears which is 1922 guys check it out so if you're a candy person and now you like gummy bears and those another American brand was not American comfort are you so but if you had a type of brand that you continued she always had try these out not gonna hurt anything got this for it was 98 cents so a little bit over a dollar with text so can't beat it let's say you know four hours back so nice little slice of them snack on well yeah I totally recommend I'm um yeah keep it simple I guess mother fields coming up guys
