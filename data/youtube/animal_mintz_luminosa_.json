{"ieN6zszOULY": "[Music] what's up everyone it's time for another cannabis critique today we are talking about animal mints from columbia care uh this one came in at 30 percent thc it is a three-way cross a cross of animal cookies with uh gsc girl scout cookies and uh blue power like i said this one came in at 30 percent thc uh let's get into the breakdown because this one was an absolute treat uh the look on this one was absolutely outrageous just some of the best looking flower i have ever gotten especially here in illinois it's just it was ridiculously dense i got i only had two nuggets in my entire eighth but they were giant nuggets super super dense i almost looked like uh like granite they were just sparkly and super dense nugs uh nothing really bad to say about these the trim job was right on they were very big just very very impressive visually i give it a 9.9 out of 10 uh on the look the smell on this one has like the old school vibes too it's got like that kush piney type of smell to it and a little bit minty as well the smell was very good i gave it an 8.6 out of 10. the breakup like i said this bud was some of the most dense i have ever gotten i was kind of hard to break up if you like breaking up with your fingers because it was just so dense so i'd describe this as grinder weed but it definitely fills up your keef department on the bottom portion of your grinder so i give it a 9.5 out of 10 for the breakup the taste on this one was also very good i'd had like that sweet sweet piney type of taste on the inhale and the exhale was extremely extremely minty it was almost like i was smoking a menthol cigarette with this one i mean it was a very very minty a very very good flavor on this one i gave the taste an 8.9 out of 10. just because i'm not like super into the minty buds i kind of like a fruity bud but this one definitely delivers uh if you're into the minty buds this one very very minty uh the high on this is a uh i'd describe it as a very strong indica type of high you kind of get like that warm up body buzz you're just relaxed and ready to go it doesn't make you very sleepy which is a good thing for many many people it's i would describe it as a really really ideal indica type of high 9.4 out of 10 for the high so overall i say this one is a top shelf must pick up if you see the columbia care animal mints in your dispensary just get it don't ask any more questions just grab it because it is a is one of the best strains out on the market right now a great minty indica flavor top shelf all around great job to columbia care on this one and if you enjoyed this cannabis critique be sure to like comment and subscribe for more", "-yE_rOYjtD8": "what's up y'all ocean boys Shelton was another finance episode of waking baking

party going because this is my job and I gotta make a video so actually this is it's really flavorful I can't get over the taste of it but I can't match it with anything it definitely tastes like a platinum imagine a platinum gassy berry taste but it's not supposed to happen anyway we're gonna keep going we're not gonna keep critiquing it that way whoo boom our meeting never coming good yeah remind me you never come to work again drunk Wow good thing I'm the boss off their highs got me feeling like Spacey because you gotta you gotta realize it it's a high mix would say you can't say hangover but a drunk it's a high mix what's that alcohol buzz I really don't drink that much alcohol because it's really not good for your body I used to drink a lot man but lately it's like I don't know maybe maybe once a week you guys over at Donald Julio tequila though 1942 hmm that stuff is amazing anyway they're starting to get this in here so we give you a flavor critique okey let's go I feel like I'm moving in slow motion and I'm looking at the timer on my video I've been talking and babbling about nothing for eight minutes I'm just playing God yeah quite flavorful now see that was a small hit that you're supposed to take so you don't cough up along then I could really taste the flavor on that one it's a taste of Clayton well I definitely taste a platinum I definitely taste some Girl Scout cookies it's a weird taste but it's like a full taste so anyway on a scale of one to ten one being the worst ten being the greatest of this sorry good mood color sluggishly animal man we're gonna give this up this is really nice you guys I think we should probably give it over about eight we're gonna be able to eight oh yeah I just remembered yesterday you guys yes that's when I did the video I was so high oh my god and we were so delicious you guys I forgot to give it a high critique so I'm running down to this ended in the description of the video yesterday and it was on eight I

an album but it was nice wow I don't know much more of this I can smoke because when I woke up you got imagine okay this is the level of from sober to drunk so let's say that I'm about here on the

have a dear and today is Tuesday I don't know what that is you don't want to film anymore so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just share with you the entire process start to finish every day let you know what's happening what's decomposing oh my gosh and then I'm gonna show you the time-lapse so let's go back to the beginning I just sign now this was the first stage of decomposition and this is the fresh stage [Applause] what do you think is it gross and they hit it and the deer hit the mailbox and it landed right over there and I moved it here so should I put a camera above it and time-lapse it is it doesn't think so only about six hours after that I decided I'm going to build this contraption to do a time-lapse Oh leave Falcon oh it's like bleeding everywhere oh yeah it smells there we go this is gonna be good kind of excited to see how long it takes for this deer to decompose I fenced it in so they're predators can't have easy access to it at the very least light over here to keep consistency and lighting all right now it starts time-lapse so that was Wednesday when we started by Saturday morning all you could see was a little bit of maggots on this deer the whole thing had bloated though that's what's called the bloat phase by the end of the bloat phase we get into the next phase and that's when it gets really stinky and I was really worried that's what's called active decomposition and so basically Saturday and Sunday and just a teeny bit of Monday the maggots ate from the tail all the way to the head [Music] at 8:00 Sunday it's day 5 weird stinky look at this here here it is what you can see on day 5 the maggots have completely eaten into about halfway in the body cavity it was incredible to see [Music] but it's also fascinating I think I can handle another day incredible to come and look at it once a day and this is what we have right now this is Tuesday check this out the other issue that we have is we have maybe a hundred thousand blowfly larvae which you've eaten the entire deer they are now going to bury underground they wait for it's like 140 hours and then they pupate out we also have giant scavenging beetles which have been going around and eating these maggots you guys have all been waiting for this here is the time lapse [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I will say that after this whole ordeal I have a greater appreciation for the scavengers and decomposers that break down animal tissue I thought it was going to be way more disgusting than it was and really in the end I was just fascinated I would sit here and watch it for minutes not that long but for a while I just stand there and watch they were focused on that deer and they didn't really want to have anything to do with me and way faster than I

project before I dive into my analyses to tell you that my interest in this fiction dates actually back to my grad school days when I was first exposed to a book by my silly annual called Louisville edema the book of Emma which is a really powerful and dark story that tells the story of Emma who is a montreal-based woman a patient descent who is in a mental ward climb even and we learned her story through the eyes of flow an interpreter who has been hired by her psychiatrist to interpret for her from Creole to French because emma has stopped has refused to speak French she stopped speaking French and she only speaks in Creole she's actually incarcerated because she's going on trial for infanticide and so they're trying to find out if she's psychologically fit stand trial and also to find out kind of what the story is about this and through the novel we learn slowly but surely that it is probable that Emma did commit this infant side but that it was a response to the fact that her discourse as a black woman who's trying to make the true history come to light about Haiti and slavery and the history of slavery in Haiti has been systematically erased by the society that she's trying to present it to her doctoral thesis in history was rejected and so this sort of psychic break is pointed at in the book that it comes it comes from her sort of inability to make herself be heard and we're led to believe that she did probably commit the infant side of her infant daughter because she did not want that infant daughter to be systematically erased by sight so it was an extremely powerful book a really dark but really amazing book that I would recommend and we do have a copy I think in english in library but it made me want to read more of my silly annual fiction and I my dissertation was on the representation of psychic space on a theatrical stage and contemporary theatre so that wasn't my focus at that point in grad school but I was working on issues of madness and psychic distress so once i started at elon i began to read a little bit more of an yawns work and a lot of her work her posts leave on a day my work deals with the traumatic period of the duvalier dictatorships in haiti and her characters have this tendency to suffer from a type of psychic paralysis because they carry too much personal memory there where historical memory is trying to cover over in a race and there is not enough the history writers tendency to forget what people can't forget basically and so all of this in the face of a surface level sometimes similans of forgetting so she says for example and I'm quoting the text we went to school and there too we pretended to have forgotten everything about the night before and its terrors and that's what I've been in one of her short stories that talks about the arrival of the tomtom cut my good soldiers um in her home when she was a child so there's the surface level symbol at the forgetting but there is an individual in capacity for yet and then in during my teaching sabbatical I was able to spend a lot more time reading her work and I presented on a conference on this book on Eddie autonomy HOSA an alligator named Rosa which tells the story of one of the Chiefs of Duvalier's total militia forces that basically arrested and tortured with impunity anyone who was suspected of being against the regime they asked me that tens of thousands of people were probably killed during the 29 years that they the father and somewhere in power and I was able to go to Emory which is my graduate alma mater to hear Danny laughs at Yale speak who is a very widely acclaimed also author a patient descent who is settled in Montreal and in a response to a question that was asked to him by the audience about the Haitians response to baby ducks return Haiti which he just had just gone back after years of exile in France laughs yeah said and this was an off-the-cuff remark it was just there he said I sandal but meanwhile patients don't have memory and I was just kind of stopped right there because it was it was clear that after as he explained what he meant was that the Haitian capacity to get beyond and to push past these things was actually their strength he was saying that what they could do is ignore baby Doug remove him from their discourse and therefore remove his power so that's what kind of his argument was they don't have memory because you know if they if they erase him then he has no power of them and but it was incredibly striking to me having just been really fully immersed in my sitting and you looked where nobody's erasing anything or history is a racing thing to individuals certainly are encumbered by memory so I wanted to what this spring's from is my desire to figure out if there's a theoretical difference in their two approaches to treating memory in their works and that's kind of where I am I meant that moment of close reading and so by reading with you today a little bit from an alligator luminosa the signals come to song silence like blood an alligator named Rosa and la Pharaohs premiered to see winning enigma Jo vote or the inning of their turn and let failure was just elected to the Academy fall says you know he's a huge international figure now I'm he says he's a really important author and his way of looking at things is quite different from annuals so that's what we'll look through today we'll talk about those and try to theorize kind of where this came from a couple of important dates for you if you I don't I didn't know what my audience was going to know about Haitian history coming in here so pulse why do you value a declared himself president for life he ruled from 1957 in 1971 and then he handed his legacy on to his son who was 19 years old at the time who was really not at all politically involved at the time when he became the leader of Haiti and sort of continued on his father's path but in in different ways and in 1976 Haitian journalist Gaston la mole who was a friend and colleague of daniel fai yells was murdered amongst a couple of other journalists and that was what precipitated lefty adios flight to first Miami and then to Montreal so what we're looking at here are two authors with very distinct literary voices whose biography share certain elements in common they were both born in 1953 and we're because of devalued dictatorships annual left Haiti in 1970 at the age of 17 and Lefty are in 76 the age of 23 they were both reared by women and sort of molded by absent paternal figures who were either dead or in exile and they both have authors protagonists who struggle personally with the tension between memory and forgetting nearly all of annuals work street in one form or another central the central traumas of Haiti either slavery or the g-value dictatorships and let phalios which I've not yet examined as thoroughly I'm really focusing on this but he has written a large number of novels that have been qualified as an au tube you wifey american an american autobiography in which he says there is an eye narrator who could be me but who isn't and who frequently is named Denny but who could be me who could be me who is giving what he sees as the emotional truth of his life without necessarily giving the historical truth or the historical exact accounts of the autobiographical elements of his own life so he's giving he he claims to be retaining emotional truth in his novels so as I said I'm going to try to three hours in this presentation how the two authors represent the tension between memory and forgetting as it relates to the g-value dictatorships and also how and why they're two perspectives differ in order to do that I'll look back at the outlook at these three works an alligator nemorosa Latinos come to us all and leaning below two and then one quick word about French style presentations is that French the French don't beat you over the head with your thesis they don't they don't typically structure things in ways that it's I tell you what I'm going to tell you I tell you and then I tell you what I told you they kind of build so I'm going to build to what I think is my theory by going through the text first digging into the text with you first and then build to what I think this all might possibly mean and where I want to go in the future just so you're not looking for that right for me to hit you on the head with it right away so so what are some of the unifying themes of these works so when your childhood your adolescence and your adulthood are basically determined by external forces of a dictatorship that is silencing the entire country around you we see a unified themes in there in of childhood terror of silence of fear and problematic and troublesome memories but after that the ways of looking at it quite are quite different so for example annual after the arrival of a band of Mad coot so when I say don't oh my couch i'm talking about the Volante odourless security nagina the national security volunteers who were basically bands of thugs men and women who would arrest with impunity torture and disappear people they made people disappear for many many years and so the Macoutes and they were working under the devalues so after the arrival of venom akuto index vix the narrator's family from her home the character one of her characters in the scene oskam muscle says ah my English ones are over here to the little daily moments of happiness had gradually given over to a mute distress and sometimes i'm giving you two options for translation or despair i had the impression that we were all afflicted with a shameful illness for which the only remedy was silence or flight and la faille yells narrator talks about how the voice of the regime invaded the house via the radio and he says it was necessary to pretend to listen so that the neighbors couldn't suspect us of not adhering to the regime so we turned up the volume our neighbors did the same an atmosphere of collective paranoia those were the dark years we gotta chill in the spine every time we heard classical music right afterwards they announced a failed coup d'etat which was always a pretext for carnage I ended up associating classical music with violent death so for both of these authors the space of discourse is inhibited by the presence of the regime and it's impossible to talk openly about what's occurring in life around you so imagine a child who can't actually ask his or her parents what's happening who's witnessing houses being burned down the street and can't say because the parents if they're overheard saying anything against the regime are worried that they'll be next so this these are the kind of unifying themes that are around their work but the narrative structure of them that is quite different so I'm going to start with laughs Anna is leaning module Torah the narrative structure of leaning Matilda tool is actually launched by the narrator's hearing of his father's death in exile in Brooklyn while he's living in Montreal and the ho tour the return is his voyage to Brooklyn to bury his father meet with his uncle's and then to take the news of his father's death back to his mother in Haiti and his father has and mother have not seen each other since his father was exiled under false YG beli under the first GBA so she's been living alone with her daughters and the Sun was then exiled by include G value so the men have been absent and the narrator Dannie comments on several occasions that the memory of the past in the book is too great a weight to carry for himself for his dead father and for many other haitians but the ways in which his characters deal with the weight of that memory differ his father dealt or refused to deal with his past through physical and emotional separation from his family in his home country Danny tells us I had knocked on his door a few years ago he hadn't answered I knew he was in the bedroom I heard him breathing behind the door since I had made the trip from Montreal I insisted I still hear him yelling that he'd never had a child or a wife or a country I had arrived too late the pain of living far from his people had become so intolerable that he had to had to embrace his past from his memory so the erasure of the past is presented here as a psychic defense mechanism for the father but at the same time is a as a break with reality that signifies his madness the father windsor who had lived in a nearly empty room in Brooklyn walked back and forth between Brooklyn and Manhattan every day for 20 years and by walking back and forth between these islands it's as if he were trying symbolically to return to the island that he had had to leave an incessant repetition that demonstrates the high price that he paid for the erasure of his past the only concrete object that remains of the father figure is a suitcase that's been locked up in a strong vault in Chase Manhattan Bank and since the narrator danny has the same name as his father he's able to get access to it they're both named windsor love failure and so he and his uncle's go to the bank to get the suitcase and they can't figure out the secret code to open it so they can't get it open and they can't leave with it because that would require more additional security questions that would reveal that he's actually not the true then he left or the true Windsor left out of yak so his uncle's are disappointed but he himself is actually relieved he says my uncle's as if days before the steel door and me rather light not to have to carry such a weight the suitcase of aborted dreams and an interesting thing that we could spend an entire other talk talking about is the form of lanique module tour because it's actually a novel written in verse partially written in verse so that's why you have the lashes there there are parts that are more pros and in there are parts that are in verse so Danny's attitude when confronted with this missed opportunity to grant gain a greater knowledge of his father demonstrates his desire to live for himself free not to carry the weight of his father's exile later in the novel however he still asks himself questions about the contents of the suitcase when he meets his father's best friend false wha back in Haiti he asks him what he thinks might have been in the suitcase and his and floss wat responds with a different a different type of response which I found really it's a really wonderful singing book he says oh he says chasing the chickens the man hasn't become a chicken farmer and he was one of the intellectuals that was fighting against the regime I don't know I got rid of everything that was cumbersome to me in the past was the heaviest leaving pole puffs all I brought with me with my own cadaver but your father he was a historian maybe it was documents but let's forget all that there seems to be a small but profound difference between FSA which is to erase the past and soda baja sada or to get rid of it sediba say a festa de the past as Windsor did signifies a break with reality that leads to this mental disruption and sue davis I suggest that one is pushed it aside in order to live more fully in the present by specifying that Windsor was a historian home spa seemed to suggest that to close a relationship or involvement with the traumatic past can push one towards the necessity of a rupture with reality by placing his history in the vault at the bank Windsor did effectively erase it because it is unaccessible to anyone now and so by reinforcing the necessity of forgetting or getting rid of rather than erasing Francois concentrates on his own simple present that he's fine satisfying he sees of it eldridge avicii a big map TV today I live here with my granddaughter surrounded by insatiable chickens that I have to feed at all hours illiterate presents that presents that I helped to write claims so he's helping them write any kind of official documents that they have to do and loud street vendors who never stop jabbering from morning tonight and that's all that I desire so the satisfaction of living fully in the present is something that the narrator seeks as well by avoiding spending too much time dwelling on his memories his return to Haiti however saws things that he had successfully frozen in Canada this is the language that he uses all the things that I had emptied from our mind there in Canada in order to avoid being bound by nostalgia have a concrete presence here they had taken refuge in my body where the cold had frozen them my body is heating up little by little and my memory cells to become this little puddle in the bed during his exile it was necessary for denny to seek a certain psychological distance from his memories in order to be able to move forward he argued that nostalgia can paralyze the exile in let fans narrator avoids stasis as much as possible he prefers to consider his own exile as a voyage or a journey and you can't travel if your trust up and bound by the past that verb lingo T is not just bound up but it's really like really tied up pretty tight trust up kind of so what's the relationship that Latinos narrator cultivates with his traumatic memories a very personal one that can be summed up by these verses in which he explains his philosophy and I find it really important this is kind of I would say left out I was entire philosophy regarding the dictatorship is the most observer civ thing there is and I spend my life saying it is to do everything to be happy in the dictators face the dictator demands to be the center of our life and the best thing I did in mind was to get him out of my existence I admit that in order to do that I had to throw out sometimes the baby with the bathwater so in order to get the dictator out of his existence the narrator avoids confronting certain elements of his past he attempts to live fully in the present but he recognizes that that comes at a cost the baby with the bathwater might be the close relationships that he once enjoyed with his mother and his sisters and he says at one point in the novel when he's back in his hotel he says java ee lagu de la manga me d i had forgotten the taste of a mango at noon so this relationship to his homeland that he has is he's had in order to get rid of the dictator he's had to put that behind him also so for lavanya writers greatest weapon the power that he has to eliminate the dictator from his discourse by refusing to name him he takes away his power to impact his present life and a significance he talks openly about this weapon in an interview that I think is really telling and sort of talks about the ways in which Haitians are looking at these trauma traumatic pasts differently and it's kind of a long citation but I think you have it on your page so I'll give you I'll read it to you but one mustn't forget that there were always two narrators in my novels there is a singular narrator who could be me who uses autobiographic elements linked to my perception of the world and this narrator is in a struggle with a dictator who wants to impose a way of life upon him exile is a consequence of the dictatorship one doesn't exile oneself one is put into exile but this narrator has always refused to consider himself in exile preferring instead to define himself as a Voyager a traveler for a long time I was attentive to this difference between voyage and exile next there is a collective narrator who carries the drama of those who suffered exile and who themselves chose to define themselves as exiled I could not impose my notion a voyage on them because in calling themselves exiles they called in the same breath for the punishment of the dictator even while making him into a monster if we are on a voyage there is no dictator but for those who had a political vision of the affair it was very important that the monstrous face of the dictator appear on the international scene I couldn't continue to reviews that refuse the word exile but in my own case it was never a question of exile because in my own personal struggle I had other arms to combat the dictator I could not name him what to be under says I can choose not to name him so the very personal struggle of the Pharaohs narrator aligns with his own struggle combat the dictatorship by refusing to give it a voice in his own distict discourse it's from this perspective that la feria is ending nematic declaration that Haitians have no memory makes sense the choice the conscious decision not to remember or to name erases the dictators importance and his power my sentinels of writings take a very different approach to the same questions by underscoring the danger of pushing this eraser to of the dictator too far after all erasing him also means offering him a sort of impunity which leveah recognizes very well as he says in the in the quotation from the interview annuls Navarre an alligator mimosa stages the dangerous tension between an absence of historical memory and the overpowering presence of personal memory it also stages the insta psychological instability of those who have too much memory and those who have attempted to wipe out their own pasts so the main plot of an alligator named Rosa is that oanh tuan who witnessed his entire family being murdered by the tomtom accout as he was hiding in the bushes as a twelve-year-old by Rosa who was one of the Chiefs of the volunteer message joining us you know the total my coat and who is based on it on a historical figure there are descriptions in the novel that are actually really awful I didn't give you any of those today um he has been his entire life trying to find Rosa who escaped and is living in exile in France and he finally finds her and he manages the Skip himself hired as her night nurse she's basically incapacitated now she's in a bed she's handicapped she's being taken care of by her adopted niece who hates her but can't abandon her because of the weight of history basically and so the nice loja has no idea that aunt juan has this history with Rosa and so he gets there and his plan is okay I'll feed her I'll do everything but I will make her admit her crimes and I will make her write it all down and or I will write it all down for her and you know I will get some kind of closure I won't get some kind of justice but what happens is of course things don't happen the way he wants them to Rosa doesn't cooperate at all and the paper that I deliver them I was working on that text was about the dehumanization of these characters by the lack of brings into light everything that happened so obviously that the torturers are represented as inhumane and inhuman but also the danger that happens when people are not prosecuted when there is no resolution is that the victims become lose their humanity and the book has literally over a hundred animal metaphors in which the people are being being compared to losing their humanity these animal metaphors so what what I would like to show here a couple of examples of how now he's completely trapped and how it's quite different from the way that knife a tiara imagines the thing so we no one gets what he wants it doesn't turn out the way he thinks and hopes that it will and he here here he is in rose's house now as her night nurse despite on twiends efforts he cannot fall asleep terrified he feels he's drowning witnessing impotent his own sinking into the burning sand of memories he's in pain rolling from one side to another of the bed one over by this sterile agitation he gets up paces back and forth bites his nails goes back to bed the hours flow by slowly irreparably they string out and stop at the hour of his childhood that never leaves him so Antoine haunted both by his past and buy roses impunity he cannot live in the present this and this emphasis on the sterile agitation is the exact opposite of la valli\u00e8re's idea voyage so move away move forward so he's in constant movement but that takes him nowhere because he's basically stopped at this moment of his childhood when his family was killed so his Co protagonist Laura demonstrates an attitude that's closer to the one that's seemingly condoned by lapels work but in annuls case this attitude is criticized rather than valued she greatly doubted and this is Laura thinking she greatly doubted that roses crimes come to haunt her and then as a human being don't we have the possibility to direct our memory according to our will to select what must encumber it or not isn't that in reality what she had always done get by in spite of herself foul betrayal of the soul a voice buried in her retorts that was the price of survival Laura where would you have gotten the strength to rebuild a new life because there is this question of why does Laura stay with Rosa when she knows that Rosa was a torturer basically but she doesn't know where else to go and she learns through Antoine that the reason that she didn't have parents was because Rosa was responsible for their deaths but this is something that she must have always partially known but couldn't bring herself to consciously know so Laura's fortress of self justifications can't withstand and ones assaults on it he forces her to confront her past and for a time each of them loses the capacity to live in the present they spend their days in constant battle with the past for them the day to day no longer exists no more day no more night inside them the irreparable debacle all these memories sometimes deformed sometimes intact grimacing shadows flowing out rushing forth in an obsessive tumult that fills their bodies they no longer know how to live the sadness and this feeling of the irreparable that is reborn every time they evoke their plunder and childhood undermines their strength so annual represents their incapacity to come to terms with the past is in a ratio of the national natural distinctions of time there's no day to day there's no day there's no night there are too many memories too much pain and the only image of rebirth in this passage is the rebirth of what's irreparable it's constantly being reinforced as something that can't be fixed they become physically ill from the overwhelming presence of their personal memories but this illness is linked to the Big Big H history not having given them any justice or voice so for these reasons they're stuck and this is something that we see in other characters of annuals also in the short story the house facing the sea annual also evokes the prison of personal memories so Antoine and Laura are in a prison a time prison and the character in this play in this short story is also in prison for Mama and me who have nothing left to cherish not even initials engraved on the stone in the cemetery the potholed streets the incident member of the pebbled Shore and the memories that's all that we have we cannot abandon them memories are all full jailers and horrible tyrants they torment us pursue us possesses and regulate our existence since that day because of them mom and me we have become mute like rocks knowing no other language than the one that they dictate us so the memories of the trauma have become is ty rentokil as the dictators themselves their jailers and tyrants and even the burb dictate at the end of the passage shows that omnipresent threat of that which takes away words and reduces the human beings to silence both of these authors demonstrate in their works that this tension between remembering and forgetting and they each express in different ways that too much memory inhibits our capacity to live fully in the president in the present but where life alia focuses on the importance of an individual quest for happiness in spite of a traumatic past annual calls for the punishment of the perpetrators and questions the wisdom of historical and personal silence about the Jubilee this shows a certain fundamental difference between their two approaches for annual to give voice of the victims who were reduced to silence by the dictator for love failure to take away the voice and thus the power of the dictator so for annual this collective vision of those who militantly seek to advance the cause of those who were reduced to silence and for life alia I'm the personal vision of someone who chooses to live in spite of the dictator in the stack off his voice so when la feria declares that Haitians have no memory he's evoke in his own quest for happiness in his own mode of psychic survival which is shared by some of his characters and doubtless by many Haitians but it's also important to problematize that declaration and recognize that for some erasing the dictator equals erasing his crimes thus offering him a form of impunity my silly annuls work seeks justice through discourse in an alligator nemorosa Antoine wats Rosa to admit her crimes that's the only way he thinks that he can find peace in the end there was discussions with Laura they don't get what they want from Rosa but they do drop her off at a hospice place and leave her to die so they do escape from the prison of her presence and sort of theirs I won't say that it's a highly hopeful ending but there is hope that because they have been able to talk to each other and bring this out to light and thought about the possibility of handing over Antoine's archives to someone else and both gotten their physical distance from Rosa that there is there is a possibility of a future for the two of them these two visions to get rid of the past move on live in the present versus confront the past or to seek justice through Munich meaningful discourse they're not only president present in this literature but also in the journalistic responses to Duvalier's death so when I started this project had no idea what was going to happen two weeks before I was scheduled to present the first version of this at a conference Duvalier died suddenly of a heart attack on October fourth 2014 so I did a little bit of digging into the journalistic accounts of what was happening afterwards just to see what types of reactions one can see and here I have a little bit of you know further food for thought related to that so in an editorial published three days after Duvalier's death falls du val who's the editor in chief of the Haitian newspaper lunabelle Easter which is one of the national news murs pointed out the danger of fighting over whether or not to offer devel you state funeral as a distraction from the imperative to combat the attitudes that allowed to value ilysm to flourish so he didn't believe that there should be a state funeral but he said if we keep talking about that we're we're not talking about what the really important thing is and i love the sentence lee blah blah blah for flora sterling Balder valco nude awesome so the blah blah blahs are prospering or flourishing on the edge of this volcano where we're dancing and about to fall in aside from those who are debating in position petitioning for justice the city the country quietly moves on to something else to more immediate concerns Duvalier sinks into the folds of memory he takes his place in the void or nothingness with his death so while Javad points out this Haitian tendency to move on that seems to support nefarious claim he also proposed that there is still a combat to be fought that is indeed link to the Duvalier's lick legacy what's left of his reign that merit celebrations are reminiscences nothing nothing unless it be that unfortunate and worrisome flash that crosses the mind of every leader from here and makes him believe that he is or can be master of lives of goods dispenser of benefits omniscient sole judge of good and evil dvd-a is dead and he leaves us the worst of his regime the little eternally mavs desire to dominate others or the other for the wrong reasons it's to be meditated upon and to be combated again and again so that's why he's sort of against this let's not argue about whether or not he has a state funeral let's remember the danger that is still here in the comments that followed you've as article online there are those who criticize them for menacing minimizing the discussions about the state funeral and those who applaud him for pointing out the danger of collective amnesia about the larger battle for Leonid toyou a fellow journalist at Luna valise baby duck was auntie cooled down play by a pale-faced tiger and while tuyo briefly deplores the fact that his death deprived his victims from seeing him face justice his articles mainly is that the government not offer a state funeral which he did not in the end receive all that we ask the current power government it that they not impose the passage of his remains amongst us as a hero as a man of high virtue will be better for all the dead for him we won't be obliged to denounce at each acclimation but only at the call of duty of remembrance and I'm going to have to explain this a little bit because the French is a little twisted Ferg as nearly mall oh yes they know the schoolchildren I'm gonna Eve these are all victims so many unburied dead for history a former pale-skinned dictator who was nothing but an inheritor has just died without actually freeing him from blame let us let him repose in his insignificance and to explain what he's saying here he he opens the article by saying that the Haitians have understood something that the Duvalier's did not and it's that someone should be at peace when they die so all of their victims were not necessarily did not die in peaceful places but Haitians are content to let them just die and that sort of what he's arguing for it so he's saying when he says for him who we won't be obliged to denounce of the declamation is saying if you give him a state funeral we will be out there picketing it but if you just let him pass quietly into the night then the only times when will be required to call out against him are for the duty of remembrance on the anniversary when were we talking about our friends etc but we won't have to defend the dead which is something that he doesn't want to do so for toyou a state funeral would force those who would rather keep silent respectful to him to denounce him his argument like Laval Sanjeev as is to erase him from discourse and condemn him into nothingness while du Vallon twill both condemn do values actions and even if oak the duty to remember the victims of the regime's they do not explicitly call for continued criminal prosecution of Jebel you least in other voices either in the comments to do valentines articles from or from alternative press organizations such as octopus point out the absolute necessity of not forgetting Daniel meglora who is the head of the collective cultural impunity to the cliq collectivity against impunity which is a human rights organization that seeking prosecution for the crimes said a certain rhetoric would have us believe that a page has been turned with the death of the ex parent this is not the case because the mechanisms of the dictatorship have not been brought to light the balance sheet of the extortions committed has not been drawn up responsibilities have not been duly established the truth has not brought light and the duty of memory or remembrance remains an absolute necessity and she uses two verbs that mean remain actually so it would be something like remains and dwells with us as an absolute necessity so these accounts from the Haitian media show is that literature is not the only textual space in which Haitians are struggling have to confront their pass it also shows us that as la feria himself says the past which defines our way of understanding the President does not have the same density for everyone um not that I men don't see table 2 won't always prettier in French so that's kind of the end of where I am right now but what this research has done for me is made me ask more questions about these different types of representation of memory and you notice that i have i have a small sample size here but i have a feminine author and i have masking authors and i had masculine male respondents who are journalists and then this female respondent i am wondering if I when I look at this more I may find gendered representations of what one has to do because la feria himself talks about how women live exile differently either women who stay behind her women who go I'm hoping to meet Molly said y annual this summer for during my research trip to to Canada but there are some interesting questions to be raised there and I always come back to that quote that Laval says you know sometimes I had to throw out the baby with the bathwater and there's a piece of me that says women don't throw out the baby with the bathwater like that and I mean I know I'm over generalizing there but I think that I'm wondering if there may be something that I'll find when I dig more into this literature but thanks for listening you", "DHy9aIFO4fE": "[Music] so we're on the hunt for the best flowers and today we're gonna try something called double up mince and this is from a cultivator i haven't reviewed before called mad cow and this flower was a tip and i got a tip from brother jack that there was a flower down at the artistry down in west hollywood that had 38.85 percent thc and for me personally that's the highest thc flower i've ever seen and i've ever tried before and thc is not really the attraction for me but because it's the highest ever and also because jack gave me some comments on what it did to him i ran on down there and i grabbed an eighth of this and we're gonna talk about it today so let me load just a little bit into vapor cup straw i've already got two scoops in there we're gonna add the third and this is about the same amount as a bong hit and we tamper and we stick this down into the vapor cup and in about a minute and a half this cup is gonna release the terpenes and the water vapor and i am telling you it is fragrant and unbelievable this one straw one bongan amount will give me 12 draws and i will say by the end of that it can take you to the moon over a whole night maybe i can do three straws and how much weed i'm saving and also else even more than that the flavor is just through the roof there's no burnt throat it's just a better way to use it and today we get to use it with an unbelievable flower called double up mints so you can see double up mints comes in this packaging and it says mad cow genetics and it also has something on the front it's very interesting it says premium 18 day cure indoor flower now i've been hearing about longer cure times i don't really know much about that but i'm going to dig into it because if people are starting to promote it so we should know about it a little bit and especially this flower did that help make more thc and we're going to discuss what this what this if this flower's got it going on but i'm telling you with 38 thc and 18-day cure let's see what's going on with this so you can see this cup is ready to go we've got the vapor in the straw i've got it set to 330 which is a nice low temperature if you want to make more vapor you can move up the temperature at a 345 even to 360. some people might even go to 380 if you want to blow clouds i just like the light smooth flavor i'm telling you the experience of vapor cup is incredible actually so this flower really has an ogee-ish taste i would say gassy og maybe it's not super pungent but it's got the gas and this flower is super smooth i sat around i did this flower last night and i did more and i did more and i realized this is one strong flower i mean super strong but strong in a good way sometimes i don't like flowers because my eyes sink into my head i start to feel real tired and that's not what i'm looking for i like strong flowers that have focus that can grin me out and what did this flower do with 38 thc well i would say this flower made me feel almost young flower again meaning i'm going to do a video of aging and flowers because the experience is a little bit different when you're younger and gets different as you get older and i would say with this flower this flower it didn't just stone me to the bone at one point i was thinking i was clairvoyant like time stood still it is fantastic and i'm giving double up mints by mad cow a 9.5 that's a really really high score it didn't grin me out but i'm telling you if you want to try something that's special in the market that will kick your ass but not knock you into the seats this is the game double up minced by mad cow as a buy i bought this at the artist uh excuse me the artistry down in west hollywood and i know that i got the end of the batch but i would call down there to see if they have this flower because as soon as it comes back in run down there and grab this it's incredible and shan if you're

deborah chan for making it happen uh this is the the third appearance of flowers by fidel's on the page and uh if you've seen the other videos you know they are traditional markets so there's no testing information in here and i would turn it past that little point there's a little sneak preview of the bud but i don't want to give it away so let's go ahead and pop this seal and let's take a look at these animal mints together and there it is i spotted this big boy outside the jar this is definitely gonna be our champion i even think he's got a little passenger i don't know if this guy here i think oh he is attached he's part of it there they are siamese twins in a way it's just like that movie from the 80s twins with uh arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito all right so let's go ahead and look at this beautiful freaking nug wow holy moly man i cannot look at those trikes dude i mean the way this is just hitting i was joshing i was thinking about the 80s not paying attention but damn this nug is hella beautiful and you know what there's really not a lot to smell in the jar because this looks like basically the whole aider should weigh this out and see what it goes for there's a nice little frosty butt in there so yeah if this is danny devito right here and this is arnold schwarzenegger then i'm not sure who that is maybe that's joe pesci whatever his name was in the lethal weapon movies anyway looking damn amazing i gotta get a sniff on oh no oh no i just ripped these siamese twins apart i guess oh i've caused the calamity in the family let me go ahead and just get a sniff here so i'm getting like a muted i would say creamy rubber smells like a sweet creamy rubber almost yeah that's how it hits my nose i mean i'll do a little bit better of the descriptions as i tend to do when i'm doing the full write-up but that's what i'm getting right now it's a sweet rubbery funk uh maybe a little mint in the background but that's primarily what i'm getting but damn beautiful looking herb great job flowers by fidel sorry for those shakes trying to keep it steady but yeah beautiful herb nonetheless", "lC0wZKsJ2NY": "what is up canna fam and welcome back to another product review video just for you guys a little bit for me mainly for you but also for me so anyway so check it out for today's review i'm gonna be trying here for the first time uh some animal mints all right this is the animal mints uh by echo elementary okay it's elementary my dear watson and uh we're going to be trying these animal moments shatter and this is coming in at 78 thc with 0.19 percent cbd so pretty much no cbd uh and then the terpenes for all you terp [ __ ] out there uh the terpenes is coming in at four point seven percent on the terpenes uh not bad on the terpenes uh just just judging this product without even seeing it or anything like that um just off the the test results it's all right it's not bad i mean it's not the best but it's definitely not bad just just going off the results i okay we're gonna get into the product here but again this is by echo elementary now really quick if you don't know anything about this company okay they focus on the terpenes okay they are dirty little turf [ __ ] over there and they love their terpenes uh they're all about them terpenes if you are somebody that is a terp [ __ ] that loves those terpenes and that's all you care about you don't care about nothing else then uh you gotta definitely pick up some echo products okay i believe they've won awards here in the state of oregon uh for how terpy their products are anyway so we're gonna open this up probably didn't even need to rip that but whatever [Music] all right let's check it out it looks good so far and it does feel very stable so those are two good signs old school parchment paper i see oh right off the bat you get like a sweet smell and this is um very stable very very very very stable uh snap and pull i would say because it's still kind of flexible but you could still yeah it's still like you guys can see it's still flexible that is beautiful i mean that is beautiful right there all right um so i told you guys all the information on this and uh there's nothing left to do now but to try this product all right so for this product review video we're going to be using the cactus mini nano rig here by empire glassworks very nice rig look at that beautiful and uh really quick while we're waiting for the nail to cool down for a second i just want to say there's something i did forget to tell you guys here on the back information and that is that the material that they use to make these dabs is indoor grown material okay so all the flour that they used to make the dabs all the flour that was processed for these dabs was all indoor that's awesome all right i love that animal cookies and cinnamon cookies is what makes this by the way that's awesome it's got the what two strains that make it that's awesome let's get it [Music] uh all right so my final views and thoughts on the animal mints by echo elementary all right so check it out guys i'm going to start with the package first okay you guys got to see the back of this package see all that information that is a lot of information this is great this is amazing and i love it i love information is very very very important guys uh when it comes to these cannabis products it really is having a product that has all this information on the back i can tell you right now a lot of other dab companies here in the state of oregon can't speak for other states uh do not have this kind of plethora of information on the back or anywhere on their package okay they don't give you uh this kind of detailed information okay um for instance these guys are breaking it down to you where they're telling you if it's indoor or outdoor okay they are telling you hey this is animal cookies and cinnamon cookies crossed okay they're then going down here and telling you that you should dab it about 600 degrees fahrenheit okay it's a low temp dab for those terpenes for these guys is product you want to make sure that your dab and low temp to get the best you know full to get the full experience of the product okay you want to make sure you're load tipping these guys okay these aren't your average everyday dabs okay um they also tell you keep refrigerated which is great that's just added information um they got all the list of terpenes right here okay which to me okay so for other products you know you'll have the thc the cbd that's basic standard then the terpenes um which is kind of basic standard two and then kind of uh not all but a good amount of of dab companies will have the um the terpene results kind of listed on the product usually on the back but to go into the into detail on all the rest of this stuff that is absolutely amazing and i encourage more dab processors and companies to do the same i really do uh information is key so that already scores a point with me now let's get into the actual review of the product okay now the product itself is dank okay uh it is deck all right the terps are on point okay now when you first hit it it's really smooth you don't get much of a flavor like when when you're inhaling and it's just smooth okay no no real flavor but when you exhale oh boy does a flavor train just come roaring out i mean it is very tasty okay on the exhale and on the lingering aftertaste it is super tasty and i mean super tasty you get that nice like sugar cookie taste like it it's it's really nice okay i don't know how to explain it it's a sugar cookie with maybe like a little hint of like a i don't know i want to say like diesel-ish no not really but kind of earthy diesel-ish but definitely cookie like a sweet sugar cookie okay and it's it's it's very tasty it has a lingering aftertaste like i said it it stays with you for a little bit longer after you exhale okay it's really nice the terps are really nice i definitely see now why these guys are highly you know rated for their terps okay um that seems to be their main stick okay uh now the test results itself awesome again love the info uh terps awesome the high itself is really good it's really spacey like a headspace like just i'm just over here i got a million things other things going through my head right now and it's really nice though um i could feel it in my body though too like it's just overall it's just a really nice hide i just i could definitely watch a movie this is definitely a strain that i could watch a movie on or i could you know go outside and do something on or if um as far as like medical wise uh it it'd be a great strain for pain okay because i i suffer from back pain in my l1 and l2 area and this definitely just instantly kicked it in the butt okay it definitely kicked it in the tutti okay it was amazing it's a nice high um so all those things mixed together oh and the quality itself the quality itself of the dabs it's that snapping pull it's a beautiful snapping ball i know i know the the camera probably doesn't do it much justice because when you have parchment paper like this it kind of mattes it down so it probably doesn't look the most shiny and spectacular but it's very nice it's very golden and it's like a beautiful snap and pull very stable snap and bowl okay and what i mean by that is it's almost to the point of shatter it's almost there but it's snap and pull it still bends i bet though if you know if i go like that it's gonna snap in half but it it's something that's easy to work with on the dab stick okay so all that all that all that wrapped up into one gives it two big thumbs up for me okay it gets two big thumbs up that means i highly recommend it i highly highly recommend it if you're in your local dispensary here in the state of oregon pick it up if you see it pick it up i picked it up for about 25 at third smoke shop in pendleton oregon and that's a good deal too i mean i didn't even mention price in my review that's how good of a product it is usually i'll mention price and that will be kind of a determining factor in you know whatever but i didn't i kind of forgot it was a good high but anyway it is only 25 a gram at least at third smoke shop it's gonna vary probably at the different dispensaries you go to so i'm just letting you know where i pick mine up at okay um so anyway with all that being said two big thumbs up big shout out to echo elementary make sure to follow them on social media just type in echo elementary on whatever platform you're on and i'm sure they'll pop up or photos of them will pop up or something i don't know maybe not but anyway much love guys i hope you guys are all having a good one please if

look what I've got here this is a butt of something called animal land and it's my cookies which is one of the premier LA cultivators and I love trying new flowers from them and I've never heard of the animal land before but one thing you can see is look at that giant machine hole in in this bud and it's crazy because we take pictures of these flowers I hate the machine holes it ruins the picture of the beautiful beautiful bud it's all good in the end because you vape it or smoke it all down but look at that it's they would be beautiful without it I there's a nice side to but I'm showing you the whole side because that's really what it looks like out of the jar but it's a nice looking but and you can see that animal land comes in this jar and this flower has 27.45 percent THC which is right in the middle of what I like I think the best flowers for me as I've tried them are in let's say 23 percent to 29 percent once they get above 30 it's not they're not good that maybe just not happier than the flowers that are a little bit less THC than that and in those THC plus CBD plus the terpenes all work together to give you that feeling that's why finding the perma-grin something something is so hard to find and we're looking for the right patches so today we're going to try animal land out of the vapor cuff and you can see we have a lot of vapor and I've got this thing set to 3:30 and this is actually vapor Cup number 2 so let's check it out animal land out of paper cup number 2 so this flower is definitely an OG and when I buy these flowers I don't know what they're gonna taste like unless the name is something like berry buzz or something like that right so this is called animal am but it is definitely no G and oh jeez have some of the best something something's what did I think of annum lamb how did it rate well I gave a flower in 8 to 5 it was just okay for me as we're looking for the best flowers it's really gotta have game we keep trying more and more flowers and the game is getting tougher to get those high numbers this flowers an 8 to 5 this is the doctor if you want to see vapor cup you can see that paper cup calm it's really something

afternoon New Testament growers all over the world yes we are back at the crack garden it is September 25th 2019 and it's harvest time we are at the 8th animal cooking tip that is the 8 by 4 grow tent and we are at day 75 that's total time base and flour as all of you know been following the channel we started these love ladies now off and they're smart class they were cloned straight from cups we vance them for 25 days that's including a five day down time period where we lost power here in Michigan and they didn't have any power so you know they were kind of just pawns I guess whether you could say pawns and right after the 25th day of [ __ ] we switch them to flour we also have videos of that if you're following us on the Wii tube or YouTube you can see most of the videos are on YouTube but there's a lot of needs as well but yeah I just want to go ahead and you know talk a little bit about how we got these ladies to grow up to the size we got them and everything you know in that time I mean we grow under the new testaments way to grow and that's not the I would say traditional way that a lot of growers is taught to grow it's high heat high humidity and we get good results again these eight animal cookies was not even any extra additive nutrients it was just the meals a and B formula and she was ran under nothing under 82 degrees heat 66 humidity once she got to like the last ten days of flour we raised the humidity to about 70% and the heat was about anywhere from 86 to 88 it just say 85 to 88 around ten days before finishing we had an ice cube Center of water that helped break out the purple of because the high heat and high humidity usually won't allow a strand that's supposed to turn purple during the finish to turn purple so we learned with some of the other strands that we that usually turned purple then you don't you know shocked the roots or you know just kind of get them to get that fall a bit some way they won't really turn a perfect so as you see we did get him to turn purplish he actually turned purple quite a bit I didn't think she's gonna get this purple I ran up on her and I know she has the Girl Scout cookie enter and the video that I seen in the pigeons that I was saying she wasn't as purple but she got pretty purple that was a good thing I let us know she definitely did finish up and again this is where it they could be in flower and she's done again this total run was seventy-five days I mean the way we grow you're gonna get results I mean some strands we get them in sixty five total days that's the normally like the Gorilla Glue we using venture for twenty days and then flower her for 45 days but again I mean if you're interested in learning this way I suggest you subscribe to the channel New Testament growers on YouTube New Testament on the weeds who and follow some of these strands I've learned that a lot of strands really do well under these conditions and again it's not it's very cost-effective it doesn't cost a lot you know and you get great results as you can see I definitely wanted to make this video as best as I could for you guys so that you can see just how good these results turned out and this is seventy-five total days I don't know no grower who would love to have great results like this in that amount of time so you know follow the channel subscribe to it continue to you know grow as a grower you know and I would encourage you if you own you know want to speed up your growth time if you want to make things a little simple I'm going to start just showing you guys step by step and my videos and if you want these results in that amount of time I suggest you do that as you see it I mean the nutrients was very little nutrients you know every other day sometimes sometimes every day with the mills a and B no co2 just straight high heat high humidity no air conditioner just a lot of fans going to keep that you know to keep the humidity moving around so we can you know no powdery mildew nothing you know as you can see yeah if you were interested in learning this way I mean you want to reach out to me direct you know you can email me at New Testament growers at gmail.com I'm

best flower and today we're going to try something called mac by fluorocal and it's funny when you go into the store and you pick and this was a blind pick fluorocal did slurry crasher which was a really strong good flower so when i saw they had a mac i said you know what let me try it because right now the number one flower on wheat entertainment of all the flowers is iog or indoor organic gardens mac one and korva's got a mac and it's real good and i've tried a bunch of mac so in the future maybe we're gonna have to have a mac off we'll see which one of the macs is the best but we know who's gonna win it's gonna be iog mach 1 right until someone can knock them out of the first position and that's not going to be easy to do but today it's about mac by fluorocal and look at this bud look at this beautiful bud so let me just let add a little excuse me add in a little flour into the vapor cup straw and we're going to tamper and this is just three little scoops and about a bonus amount and in about a minute and a half this cup is going to give off the sweet water vapor and the terpenes and the effect is really strong and the feeling is smooth and refreshing and sweet or sour depending on the flower every flower has its own taste and so we're going to today we're going to check out the mac and this flower has 24 percent thc and i've been seeing floracal around so when i saw the mac i just had to get it so that's the reason i picked it blind pick i like mac there's been a few good macs so today is floor cow's day so you can see it takes about that long you can see that the terpenes and the water vapor are gathering on the straw i've got this cup set to 335 maybe let me move it up five more 340 and you'll see it blinks and blinks and blinks and then it'll be 335 336 340. so now the cup what it'll do is it'll give a little less flavor and more vapor and there's so there's a place you learn your cup you either can turn up the heat and make more vapor or turn down the heat and make more flavor and it's really a process you find out where your spot is so let's check it out here we go the mac by floor cow at a vapor cup at 3 40. so this flower has a sweet weedy taste and it's a hybrid and it was an enjoyable vape the feeling was a hazy head the feeling is just okay it wasn't really euphoric for me so what do we think of the mac by fluorocal we're looking for the best and the best is heavy flowers with focus that can grin us out at the end we just can't stop grimming what grinning what did i give them back i'm giving this flower a 775 it just didn't do it for me there's a lot of good macs out there for me this flower wouldn't be a re-buy if you want to try it try it everything's worth the try right you wouldn't be disappointed in this flower but there's better flowers out there for the doctor thanks for joining in if you want to see vapor cup you can see it at vaporcup.com i'm telling you if you get this item every day you'll just

uh not to mention i got a few others that i will be sharing with you guys over the next week as i know the drill but yeah we got cushman's this is two grams here at cushman's we're just gonna grind up enough for one bowl basically but yeah here it is guys so yeah we're gonna do this right now then i mean it looks beautiful look at these knobs man i think i might take one of these big nubs may i'll do a couple of these big nubs in the grinder probably and then i'll save the rest of those for teresa for my girl when she comes over you know what i mean so she's gonna want to take some home with her obviously so but yeah guys so yeah this is it man some cushmits hey what's up guys all right so we're back before we're back with the review now so i just grinded up that weed i showed you guys earlier so one thing i forgot to mention and it slid my mind i'm trying my best to like get more description of the strains i get i don't know no one's really commented about it no one's really brought up my attention but i feel like it's not really much of a review if uh you know if i if i'm not if i'm not giving you guys more information so so basically what this is guys this is cush mints okay and what is it a hybrid okay it's a hybrid it's a cross it's actually a cross strain uh it's between um animal cookies and mints okay so that's where you get they have cushions from okay so either way it's two good strains well we're gonna be we're gonna be jumping into this so actually i take that back it's not it's not mint it's ammo cookies and bubba kush so it's a straight it's basically a hybrid for a cross between both those strands okay it's a hybrid so you're gonna get best of both worlds which means you're gonna get an indica and a sativa uh roll into one so it's kind of cool so if you're like an indica person only then then you know then this may not be a straight for you but you're a kind of person that wants to still be active and doesn't want to be locked into a couch or locked into a [ __ ] bed we can't even [ __ ] move because you're so [ __ ] high like that's that's the indica okay that's when that's when you want to be at home that's when you want to be at home you want to be going to bed it's usually for people that can't sleep at night those are ones that you really really need the strong indicas if you want hybrid then they got the best of both worlds you're at the full body high with the head high you feel me so it's kind of cool so either way though guys we got right here ready to go cheers dink it i'm just kidding it was all right cheers guys okay that does taste pretty good i don't know i read about it online guys it said it took it takes like um it's like it's supposed to taste like mints like you're gonna taste like a mint flavor to it i kind of tasted it this cement a little bit so yep all right cheers guys cheers oh man it's not bad it tastes pretty good actually it tastes really good let's do one more hit cheers ah oh man hey what's up guys so you guys a little update here um i'm not even through the pull ball yet and uh i'm feeling [ __ ] sleepy believe it or not this shit's like kind of knocking me on my ass a little bit i'm trying not to so i don't like sleeping during the daytime you feel me so yeah um yeah i'm sitting here like watching this video and i'm like kind of dozing off on the video loki like i kind of like nodded off a couple times already and i was like wow what the [ __ ] is happening i'm like really i'm really tired almost like it's like hitting me like like it wants me like like it's putting me asleep basically you know what i mean like i don't know explain it man i'm [ __ ] very loopy right now i don't like it i don't like being loopy you know i mean i like to you know i like to so now i can't even talk anyways but so yeah so so i told you guys earlier it's a hybrid this is an indica and a sativa so let's just say that like so now we know that more the indica site comes through on the straight okay so keep that in mind okay so when you guys get the strain make sure y'all make sure y'all keep this in mind that it's gonna be more on the indica side the sativa side okay which means you're gonna be more loopier and just more like tired so if you're getting it to sleep at night it's perfect but if you're getting it to function throughout the day time then i will not go the strength quite possibly i don't know this is just just perceived your own caution i guess you could say i don't know whatever all right i'll be i'm gonna get back to my show a lot of you guys get back to whatever you're all doing i'll see you guys next part of the review all right hey what's up guys all right so i'm back so i'm just gonna close out the review now um so yes i've been high for a while i'm still pretty high right now of that uh mint cookies or sorry mint kush or kush kush bits or whatever i write cushman's i don't even know where is that yeah cushman's okay i had to look at my label cushman's yeah see i forgot what they were anyways guys i am pretty [ __ ] up right now i'm very very high um i did falsely for a little bit there earlier i never fall asleep but i did i did feel pretty sleepy bullet there so just so just just keep that in mind you guys that like you may make you a little tired all that stuff so make sure you're doing something make sure you're busy like right now i'll be leaving for my buddy's place here pretty soon so should we go i'm gonna take a little bit for the road though too but i'm just gonna pack it when i get to his house probably so yeah um other than that i mean that's about it yes either way uh i get this i do i give this uh i give this weed uh 10 10 out of 10 uh very very good very very good stuff um so just so you guys already know it's a hybrid strain so you're gonna get both indica and sativa effects here but it's gonna be more it is more higher on the indica side than the sativa side just keep that in mind when you get this straight okay so all right guys what that says we're gonna kyle always enjoyed this weed review we did make sure you leave the live stream new channel and we just hit 719 subscribers we're on our

head all kinds of things going wrong for me so okay I'm just like a forty-year medicator right now um what I got is the strain from advanced grow lamps it's gonna be fire straight it's a brand new stream it's called the Cushman's Cushman's is the apologize the Cushman's is the annamund animal means crusted the pre 98 bubba kush bad cross 1 so again animal means pre 98 but where's that cross 1 Cushman's this is from advanced CRO labs something like that you might buy the one of the best producers in state of connecticut absolutely say hands down and that you can get this at my local dispensary the healing point home Bristol Connecticut hey guys do another awesome things going on 2019 should be a good year for everything going on and we'll see what happens with that so let's just

little uh mmm medicinal administrators right here got a big ball and the eyes that rig because I got the Cushman it's in flour and they also having a wax are done both so I'm gonna do a ball on the

comas and myself some joints at one point two medications that were [ __ ] with it's the into call CD as far as the CT name goes Cena called CD here it is in flower like 26 percent change THC here isn't wax 86 percent change THC don't maybe some fire and to call CD I mean this is a Cushman's so here it is in the wax which we'll check that one did nice new containers which are pretty badass okay one second here it is in the flower that's just Frosty's [ __ ] ooh there's a totally unique smell to it um the buds like a dance that's got this like it's weird almost got like this broccoli smell to it it sounds to me like a vegetable a fresh vegetable now that you're walking like a farmer's you garden then you should get this scent like it's weird like lima beans or something where it's this craziest smells real 13 like vegetable II it smells great oh really good okay so check these mojo because st. yeah check out this wax okay so the wax it's enough some saucy stuff check this [ __ ] up

great thing is the bait Bank doe - jeez well guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we're back again for another strain review today we are checking out another one from Lumpy's another one a few um peas in the past but it's been a minute since we did one I want to say the last one we did was the Cali berry right yes we did the Cali berry a few months ago something like that bring it to you Lumpy's apple fritter and when i crack the jar I see perc a little bit of perp in there for sure and what is it it smells it smells along the lines of the dogs walls but is not quite that so I would say it smells kind of pervy yeah so it's supposedly apple fritters supposedly sour apple and animal cookies okay and then I think the sour apple I know it has I think it's sour D in Sydney 99 okay so yeah that's that's a nice lineage I don't know what sour apple is but there's animal cookies there's some diesel in there I just told you what sour apple is Cindy 99 Sour Diesel I'm sorry there you go sorry I agree though all the all the parents that went into that one every all stuff I would want to smoke on its own you know so that's usually a good start exactly it's better that then has like og cross with blue dream and I'm like oh why'd you go and do that - oh gee you know dude this smell is really similar to that dogs walls from from elemental wellness back in the day which is we that I love I love this turf it's actually kind of rare I feel like you know it's almost like the herbal turf but a little different yeah you definitely for me I definitely get those like sour II kind of fuelie notes in the beginning but then it's kind of more of like a sweet creamy thing like you're talking about you know I'm almost getting like as I've just broke that up I kind of got like almost like a little cheesy funk or something you know I'm really trippin on the snow guys like I like it there's many layers to it there's layers to that's a good word to describe it there's layers to the smell I'm gonna go ahead and light this joints I forgot we had it rolled I really want to taste this stuff I love me some purp great game in this thing I wonder how far we are into this video there's always somebody that comments down below the exact time and moment that one of us takes our first rip because if we're on top of our [ __ ] it's usually a minute two men in 30 seconds most of time it's usually two minutes and a half minutes and people were like hey I thought you guys were gonna [ __ ] smoke in these videos I don't you guys did high no we just blab on we're just blab blab blab but lighten up this Jeffrey here gonna get high let's see how it tastes huh definitely a good burpy I get purp on the inhale but you do get a little bit of that like almost gas eNOS I'm guessing it's coming from the sour apple or the sour deep very smooth out of the bone I like it the first and this will hit off the joints Barry I get a perfect flavor guys almost like yeah it's sweet like a sweet candy like a like a Laffy Taffy ah that's a little extreme but if I had to tie it to some it's almost like a great walkie-talkies yeah I kind of like that dogs waltz comparison that you drew cuz one that's a strain I haven't smoked in forever and I really missed back in the days when elemental had fire in San Jose that was one of our favorite strains to get from them similar parents I guess I left the cam yeah and then a vertical rise at the Kemp sister of the herbal I don't know after days Ray's dog yeah I think it was Charles about an Urkel so you get kind of that fuelly kind of more pungent thing going on from the chem whereas in this strain you have it with the sour and then you know got the cookies bringing in some of those may be sweet perk Terps not like truth no I can pure Oracle but it's a little very very hint in there to man and wife you know coming from that like great D flavor I'm getting but I almost got like a little berry flavor and there's really good guys yeah lots of lots of depth I feel like to the smells and the flavor of this stuff yeah it's been a while I think since we it may have not I don't know but I think it's been a while since we have we had honestly the best characteristic of this weed to me is the smell so far yeah the taste is good don't get me wrong but the smell I sat there and tripped on it for a minute different smell is what I am always going for you know it's always my number one criteria this strain actually won the cannabis cup a couple of years ago I want to say 2016 pack that for hell yeah y'all this trade year there you go there you go fair's fair yeah but this one the cup a couple of years ago that one was hitting out like 25 percent THC this one right here is coming in at 21.5 1/4 cultivated on 1213 package on 114 so Wow we picked this up a couple of weeks bail it's sitting on it took forever to do these reviews but I'm surprised it still has this good Terps after being packaged about four or five months ago that's really good I mean it stays like 70 degrees in hearing some of the dispensaries I'm sure go a little hot you know one of at least like that not the nice ones but yeah but we've only had it for a week or two and you know the shop it's still really they had it for four months before that so it's not usually when we get weed that was packaged a few months ago in California it's gonna be dry it's gonna be stale that's good the nose isn't gonna be there the way it is on this so I'm definitely impressed this has kind of been I don't want to say their flagship strain but one of their biggest strains over the last I don't know year - maybe longer sure this is the one that really put Lumpy's on the map for me personally and I think there's a lot of other people know yet for sure this is only my second time having it not gonna lie but the first time I believe was like you know beginning in this year maybe even like December something like that and fire both times like he said the freighter you talk about yeah the apple fritter is that what I said yeah I just didn't know if you meant Lumpy's in jail no no no that was for yeah yeah I've had Lumpy's a few other times Cali berry few of their other ones this is my first time trying the apple fritter I saw a batch of it before like one of my buddies just had like one left over and it was like a nicer nug as I look at this stuff it's some you know some of these bugs are a little bit smaller in these this particular jar that I'm looking at not necessarily the tightest no nuts what we're dense at least these particular notes sometimes if you get some like bottom or like more side note right they might just look like that if we were to see some tops of this it might be a totally different story yeah I don't know if I had to get down on rating this one I really like it I like this strain in general I think this is super fire I'm not sure if this is I do I know this isn't the best batch they've ever grown you know if you just want to go based on test results they've definitely grown more potent looking backwards some of the photos I've seen on their Instagram and from other people online I got I got a crazy little you know it's crazy sorry I just totally cut you off yeah go ahead what are you saying go ahead uncle Gard okay oh you know you're a Buddhist daughter you know how a [ __ ] beer has this always like 3.4 whatever the push there it's crazy how we can't get weed like that and do you think we will see a day that we do being that we can be able to grow apple fritter at parking the same percentage every single time well I mean there's so many variables with growing wheat everybody tell me that things are gonna be a little bit different and I think it's way easier I think it's way easier to control like every single just about every single very when you're brewing so you're saying that we will see the day no I'm saying that I don't I think that I think you can control way more of the important variables when making beer obviously I've never [ __ ] made beer I don't know anything about it but this is just what I do right now me too there are way more variables with ie just being that every strain is different yeah each one has different optimum requirement exactly I don't I don't think we're gonna see the day either I need to be able to grow the same plant at the same THC percentage every time that's not going to happen especially when you have the genetic getting weaker and weaker as you clone down I just don't see it happening all you scientists out there please prove us wrong or otherwise or other known or whatever the [ __ ] other stupid English anyways I almost rate this stuff yeah I was gonna say the best thing about this one like you kind of alluded to earlier is the nose for sure that's the first I mean and for being packaged four or five months ago and still smelling this good yeah obviously it was dried and cured properly even perfectly I would say it's keeping alone I would have loved to smell this on the plant or smell it like right after it was like fresh isn't you know at packaging time it's just to see if it was even more crazy and I love doing I would have loved to just rub the sugar that's the best part about growing at so that's the one thing I miss the most about growing is just being able to like just smell the evolution of the Terps knowing what it smells like at early the flowers date of the fire late flower stages and then like you know the color starts to turn yeah and then like once you cut it down and like after the chop and then how it how that kind of flavor just kind of like changes to that final project you know I like being able to see that evolution and like you're talking about just walking in there and doing that form is amazing so yeah we got a 10 on the smell Wow this stuff gets me high man I'm like really high sorry for the stunt 110 on the smell what's next flavor flavors not far behind but super smooth it's very smooth it could just be like more more beautiful white ash it beautiful white ass definitely that's for sure hundred percent so flavor I'm gonna give it eight I'm just gonna grab this a V you could just be more I'm gonna go with the word more really it could be it could be just more pungent I like the flavor on this one I think it's pretty good I did like it a little bit better out of the bomb than the joy let me give it one more bigger but yeah I'm gonna stick with a eight because we're running out of time on this damn video effect effects good I'm just now assessing it like I'm pretty pretty Spacey pretty a bomb-ass song right now it's very creative very uplifting it doesn't make me want to just sit here and be lazy all day so I'm gonna give it I'm gonna give it it I'm gonna give it a 9 I actually really like the high so overall I'm gonna give it I don't know if those average out - I'm gonna give it a 9 9 9 so as far as the buzz goes I cheated a little bit on this one and I smoked some a couple of days ago we kind of split these last couple notes we had up and in between these jars so we could do this video or whatever but it definitely hits me like that at first it's kind of like uplifting euphoric very like clear motivational I guess I don't know what the right word for it is but it's very like uplifting at first but at least for me when I smoked it the other day it just completely did a 180 on me like mmm and then maybe 30 minutes 45 minutes after smoking it because I was feeling like this last time I smoked it a couple of days ago then the coffin in 30 minutes later yeah yeah I guess I'm coffee'd up right now I could have something to do that overall overall I'm gonna give this a solid nine and a half nine point five yeah I like the flavor on it the smell 10 flavor I'm giving that like a 9 buzz I'm giving you no flu Niner ten everything about this is pretty much a 9/10 so I'm gonna go nine point five it's good we apple fritter from lumpy shoutout to Lumpy's for growing some good weed yeah I look forward to trying another batch of this this is something I would definitely buy me too Lumpy's apple fritter from your sister pick this up by the way at atrium down in a Southern California we actually did a dispensary tour on them a couple of weeks ago with that so check it out right up here somewhere over there check it

rambling yeah I might I'm showing you how to throw the Gees up right now it's like they're grabbing some titties I'm Danny guys he's Shane for the CCC 4/20 right hi hey see ya no nice home yet if I told you would I had my bag that [ __ ] will be a palm tree I got more flavors than letters this in the Alfa [ __ ] star no mids around my circle no we ain't allowed", "MP9bdONV80M": "[Music] hey yo yo [Music] hey yo [Music] so [Music] but as you can tell we're out here in the tranquil forest the trenton forest of washington smoking on some tranquil forests from washington yes so you were telling me this is some like special [ __ ] right this is the sherpa uh this is a fire ass train first off the sheriff miss is going to be a cross between sunset servers and animal mints and they're [ __ ] it's gas uh no i'm sorry not animal names cushions sunset shimmer and cushion but yeah uh sprinkle for fort was a they were super cool man they they blessed me with a little bit of this weed before it came out some of the jelly burger and some of the uh german so you know i said let's go to the forest and and make a day out of it let's smoke some of that [ __ ] you know griffin knows all the spots that he brought here to this [ __ ] beautiful spot yeah i can't tell you where though because it's undisclosed location secret but yeah man this is the turquoise today oh yeah yeah i cut a little bit of this earlier right off the bat say great flavor super gassy super gassy super flavored the look of the bun too like i'm going to do a crying close-up so you guys can see that back again for the chronic close-up this time we got the sherb mints and as you can see this is a monster nug extremely beautiful purple all over frosty crystallized all over light green interior and just like the jelly burger this stuff is super dense super dense rock hard take a small nug off here so you guys can once again perfectly cured hear that snap that means that this bud has great moisture content not too dry not too moist perfectly cured perfectly trimmed too if you ask me good job trimmers and [ __ ] this [ __ ] looks fire man look at that let me crack that open purple on the inside extremely sticky just like before oh my god this [ __ ] smells so good smells just like you would expect a sunset sherbet to smell like sweet gassiness and then you got that earthiness of the cushman's just coming through just powering extremely gas all right cool now that you guys got a close-up that was a sick close-up now that we're back this is like i'm going to tell you this tastes like some extremely earthy gas kind of reminiscent of a wedding paper but really glue to me but also has a sweetness to it that kind of reminds me of gelato so i can't you know for a lot of us tranquil forest is the the highest of the highest when it comes to chronic oh yeah and i would agree with that 100 because they really put the care and time into their train this is some absolute all punishment i've tried the sherbets from a lot of other different companies uh the high tide treadmills as you guys know we rated them really high they're very extremely quiet and this is just right here with it i'd probably say this is a little bit better just because of the overall blood structure and the nut i got super advanced and super [ __ ] nice this stuff was like a rock like you had me feel it i was my mind was grown and it tastes amazing man this is my first time smoking it so kind of marinating letting that high kick in but yeah man much appreciative and super thankful to drink it for us for blessing me with that coming through look forward to that trendsetter coming next yeah it's going to fly for sure sure yeah and the jelly burger too man these are these are top tier gas strains and when i say top tier i mean the rating is going to be top here too i've been smoking that jelly dropped that review soon too y'all don't know about that lotto 41 and donnie burger that [ __ ] hits immediately i'm pretty good like that's zero to 60 i gotta everything about this bud is really nice it was cured right it tasted wonderful looked wonderful i mean they blessed me with it i can't really you know say anything about the price wise like it's going to be they're already affordable so i'm assuming it's going to be right there in the same price everything else probably around 45 i don't know the thc percentage because uh it was just given to me you know i didn't have it it wasn't like labeled regard yet but i'm assuming it's probably mid 20 range i feel like [ __ ] thank god it's too strong not to be probably mid 20s low 20s and uh i mean i'm gonna say overall rating this is that gap yeah strength of course every time you know anybody who comes in from out of town they're looking for good weed thank you for trust like it's the mainstay and they just they continue to prove that with this exactly like i'll be telling people man you want to know where it's at let me tell you like i said overall rating i'm gonna give that g then a solid nine point six not a nine point five nine point five is mid top tier gas this [ __ ] is just kicking it off on all fronts i feel like you got the flavor you got the high you got the look the extra point really means something i i gotta say i'm i'm gonna say 9.6 as well that it really just hits you know it doesn't stop 9.6 so we didn't quite raise as much as the rents i like more sweeter flavors personally but this is that super gas like if you like quality gassy earthiness for a decent price you better go get yourself here yeah look out for it it's coming soon and yeah man shout out to all you guys who've been you know shooting me suggesting dm and me sending me uh trains that you guys are smoking i'm looking forward to meeting up and talking with a lot of you guys soon i appreciate all the love much love for the support and uh yeah man overall 9.6 for the tranquil four servants we're gonna finish this and enjoy this in the

I should give them a try but get my attention just for the simple fact that it reminds me of elemental paper and it also reminds me of parchment paper you know like wax paper so that's what it reminds me of and that's why I think I didn't go ahead and buy a pack today had to stick with what I known what I like that's raw everyone and there you have it everyone that was it's not hard I'm gonna go ahead are you can use our clipper did you guys know you can take off a little whatever you call this thing go ahead and pack it down make some room for the filter yeah everyone we wouldn't be here if

wasting time and uh you guys can see we're smoking the Big Apple the newest strain from the Mint's collection and seed junkie genetics we bought this at the cookie dispensary in Modesto it just recently opened up originally had thought about buying snowmen right when I go to the dispensary I usually do like to take a look at the menu before I get there right take a look take a look at the menu see what they have see if they if they have updated it and see what's new on the menu right well I get there and I'm taking a look at the bud you know like I said before awesome customer service they know exactly what they're doing super friendly and nothing like the dispensary the cookie dispensary in San Francisco I wanted I don't want to give it a bad review or anything or you know talk down about it I don't everyone the whole layout was different and back back I don't know how many years ago but the cookie dispensary on Geneva in NSF was it just made me feel rushed everyone made me feel rushed you know it was always packed they always had good strains but I always feel rushed not nothing like this this dispensary and Modesto everyone it's a super laid back it's exactly like an Apple store you get in there you take a look at the products they have some smell small containers you guys can smell through you're not allowed to touch the bud of course but you are allowed to prop open the little smell tap smelling tab or whatnot and get a whiff of that smell and yeah everyone's good good customer service the cookies in Modesto I forgot whoo-hoo I forgot his name specifically but um everyone there is nice everyone super-friendly so i get there back to the story I get there and I ask if they have snowman my friend has hat snowman before hey what are you eating so my friends had snowman before and he highly recommended it so I wanted to go ahead and try it and you know snowman has been the talks of a bunch of stuff has been in the talks for years snowman's don't man this snowman this my powers you know and I've always wanted to try it and so I get there snowman looks incredible everyone that's gonna be definitely my next train to go with but of course I didn't go with that one why because they were changing the display jars when I got there and they were like today is the the release of it and I was like what are you guys talking about he's like the Big Apple it's supposed to release today you know burner just made it made of a video of it of him rolling the joint to it and I was oh yeah I did get to see that you know there I was like can I take a look at it yeah it's right there so I take a look at it check this close-up of it alright everyone it's either between snowman or the Big Apple hopefully we can get our hands on it [Music] [Music] you know they're hyping it up everyone like all the all the employees are over there like talking about it they're like it's here you know it's releasing today what uh they were like you might be the first one to try it you know you might be the first one to buy it they only released it and CERN cookie Soares and after they said that I was like what is it is it a hybrid as an indica they were like honestly we don't know you know it's add to that much it's it's that of a early release you know that they'd only know of much about the strain you know all we knew is that burden was rolling up on it he's rolling the joint video right after looking at it of course I was like I'll take it and this strength does not disappoint everyone i dad all I think I would recommend I wouldn't recommend buying this this this strain if you were to go to a party or like with a group of friends and you guys are limited to buy it and the Big Apple is the only strain you have well I'm guarantee I guarantee every single one of your friends would get medicated will definitely get hi everyone it's super potent constantly say this to everyone I constantly say this in my videos it's a pony strain its pulse cream but it's it's a no lie everyone this strain is it's a fire everyone I gave it a 10 out of 10 the smell on it is sweet but if you ever came across grapes you know the purple grapes it smells like that a little bit a little bit of the purple grapes with some cookie scent into it and a sweet smell to it honestly it's a it's a it's a strain that I I would go ahead and buy again just for the simple fact that it got me stoned it did the job I love the whole breaking down process it was it was a ten out of ten overall smoking it good smoke good good smell good looks and I want to see buy it again everyone so these guys have not disappointed me yet if you guys go back into one of my other videos we smoked the soap buy mints and take a look at that video if you get the chance to and that was

well hope you guys are smoking on something good cheers the skittles mints whoa i really do like a mojave reserve the strains that i have tried i like a lot this one so far off the first hit uh it gives me that that lung expansion my [ __ ] eyes instantly want to drop so that is really good but like always two for the review and i do got the other one packed in a different bong i thought today we'd switch it up one out of one you know but i do like it so far the flavor is really good and it wasn't harsh off the first hit so so far so good and since it's my birthday got myself a modelo and i don't feel like chugging i'm gonna um i'm gonna actually enjoy my beer today because it's my birthday so cheers everybody hope you guys are enjoying your day as well i'm used to slamming them it's the first time i took a sip of beer in a long time tastes really good though quick movie recommendation fury with brad pitt it's a [ __ ] good ass movie if you guys haven't seen it i highly recommend it i think it's a dope ass war movie brad pitt's a good actor i know he's for the ladies but he's a good actor you know i do like the movie so if you haven't seen it i recommend watching fury with brad pitt it's a dope movie dope i was thinking about it today about uh has anybody ever like got busted at work smelling like weed or almost got busted i had a [ __ ] story of when i first graduated high school i moved to sacramento california and i got a job at a diesel mechanic shop and i did that for about a year it was a it was a cool job i liked it a lot but anyway i had just purchased some weed and i had like a quarter in my pocket of some [ __ ] skunky smelling ass good weed this was before dispensaries were around and all that you know i i got it off the street plug but anyway [ __ ] i had it in my pocket and i was supposed to go put it in my truck you know but i didn't i had in my pocket and i ended up working right next to my supervisor we were underneath the diesel truck and we were working on something fixing it and i forgot the weed was in my pocket and you know when you're a weed head you really can't smell it like other people can you don't notice it you're just like whatever it's normal to you hold on but anyway while we're working on uh whatever we were working on it was a long time ago i forgot what we were working on but anyway yeah he was like smelling he goes man it smells like a skunk down here and then i was like oh [ __ ] this weed's in my pocket and i was [ __ ] trying to ignore him and he goes man it's strong and he kept bringing it up and my ass [ __ ] with the quick thinking i was like i was like you know what and the guy's name i'm gonna say his name because it doesn't matter now damn ricketts if you ever see this dan ricketts this is funny as hell but anyway he's like man it smells like a skunk and i was like yeah it does and i go you know what must have happened because it was a diesel truck i go i bet you this truck around over a skunk sometime today or yesterday and that's why it smells like it and he looked at me and he was like oh my god you're right that's the only explanation and [ __ ] he hella believed that so then he kind of dropped it and [ __ ] and the first chance i got i [ __ ] dipped straight to my truck and put the weed away but i got away with it so i thought that was a funny story okay let's get the other one in so i can get the review skittles mints i'm not huge on the mince weed a lot but they seem to be pretty strong most of the time and really good so i can't i can't really knock them and the company is just i really enjoy this company mojave reserve so far i haven't been disappointed by any of their strains it's quite you know above average i would say ah got the ball not already packed whoa cheers been eating today a lot so i'm kind of that's why i didn't want to chug beer i'm kind of bloated already oh man that [ __ ] packs a punch has some good flavor to it it's not harsh get you [ __ ] loaded i like it i like it start calculating it up price where i get it in blue fire dispensary for 36 bucks it's a [ __ ] steal this shit's [ __ ] fire for 36 dollars on it um the the look and the smell is [ __ ] amazing on this weed i like the look i like the smell the flavor is really [ __ ] good it's not bad at all it's a little minty and little fruity uh it's good it's [ __ ] it's good it is smooth it didn't it doesn't [ __ ] it's not harsh at all it doesn't [ __ ] your throat up and the high is definitely there it's i would say this is more of a i would say an indica dominant hybrid in my opinion it doesn't say that on there but i would say it is um so overall for the mojave reserve skittles mints i'm gonna have to give it the 8.5 the 8.5 the shit's no jive i like it you know i i really like this brand i like this strain i think it's an 8.5 i'm glad i reviewed this one on my birthday it's worthy of birthday smoke so i'm getting the 8.5 it's no jive gonna rip off the cart real quick i'm

guys have ordered a new shirt yesterday I'm still checking out on printing companies this is the one I just came in yesterday kind of looks the same except for this is the blacklivesmatter editions whoo all right so here we go gotcha he'd still smoke I got a slight burning on the back of my throat on the top back in my throat it's kind of well it's kind of oh god I can't put my finger on him because the would make sense to you if I said it tastes green you don't taste colors but that's the first thing that came to my mind when I tasted like don't take only flavor I can come up with is green but it's not lying weird couple more tasted eggs all right now let's get back up in here okay coffee's in check let's get back up in here oh yeah okay okay now that's a better flavor there oddly enough it tastes premature like that what's that chlorophyll that's what it tastes like but I know that it's not premature this is oh no just check out that you guys anyway yes this is a very nice-looking button is quite tasty it's got my mouth watering whoo and I'm high already trust and believe C junkie genetics Wow straight from Cali guys this this pad came straight from Cali hopefully I get some more straight from Cali soon the people are coming far and in-between with this uh with with the exotics and [ __ ] I'm like come on y'all run the exotics up on me my folks bring me like one or two packs you coming all the way from California how the [ __ ] is you bringing me one or two packs it wasn't even worth the trip but I'm gonna tell you what this is worth to I literally cannot put my finger on that flavor like I can't even fathom with the flavors you guys I I have nothing compared to it it has okay okay it has a citrusy back taste to it like when I smack my lips and breathe out my nose I taste like citrus orange it's pretty easy it's a weird flavor but it's really good that's why I can't stop something of my limbs sheesh oh y'all remember the resin ball is the update on the resin ball I took a little bit off for yesterday smoked it man I'll put some weed on my ball put a little pinch of this on top of it my neighbors next rule was they got damn what the hell is that I was like what you mean what is that smell I said it's some weed what kind of weed is that this is honor this is like all the exotics this is resident of all the exotics that I've smoked with you guys and this is probably about maybe a hundred a hundred and twenty different strands 125 different strands somewhere around there different strands of resin nothing but exotics then as I told you before I rolled it all up in my Keef I flatten it out put weed in it rolls it up flatten it up and weed in it rolled it up flatten it up put weed in that I squared it out and now I'm just leaving in my tray in my own weed tray here and just let it catch all the debris so probably about Tom my birthday man by October buddy-buddy like I said before to keep it in perspective this is probably now about 8.3 grams this is 8.3 grams that [ __ ] is whoo and it is some fight like they out michelle sorry y'all I got loud beer sorry about your earphone users Oh things we can have it now that was tasty Wow that was smooth what's on a scale of one to ten one being that [ __ ] ten being that good [ __ ] of the flavor critique of emergency we're gonna give this it's hard to put my finger on a number for this because I can't recognize all the flavors um I've kind of I feel like I've never tasted had this flavor on my mouth before so I really can't put my finger on it I can't compare to any other weed I can say that I will give it a we're gonna give this uh eight we have to give it a eight um I can't give it a little number just because I don't recognize the flavors that would be a poor critique what I can do is give the flavors their own merit which is delicioso can you say delicioso it's delicious what I recommend it to my friends absolutely I would recommend you guys if you haven't tried emergen-c give it a shot go to your local dispensary you pick up your pack or emergency and smoke that [ __ ] y'all cuz I'm gonna tell you man I think it's every worth every bit of that eight I'm kind of like like a new print Oh yesterday I didn't know make the video I had got this weed yesterday and I promised one of the subscribers I'm really sorry man that I promise you a 99% chance that if I got the weed that I would make the video I really apologize that I didn't make the video but here's the problem why I didn't make the video I know you guys would have wanted me to make it anyway however yesterday after a month two months three months I took some shrooms ooh I took about a gram and a half of some penis envy good lord so by being so long since I've done it man it was a weirdly spinors I was sitting out in the park in my car smoking and I looked down at my arm and my arm stopped my hand my skin started turning into snake skills and then it turned into regular skin didn't start a pulsating snake scales regular skin pulsating snake skins regular skin pulsating then I could see the lawns my veins going through my arm go like wow if for some reason my sister looked really funny to me I feel like she had a big ass hit a little it was just a weird trip but it was a good trip I haven't done it so long nature was so beautiful if you ever do shrooms ever in your life do soon even if it's for your first time make sure you do shrooms outside make sure you properly dope so you don't have a bad trip see I've always I've always gave it to people and dose like I'll give you like a gram of gram to have built according to you because if you don't somebody too much like one of my friends man she had a bad trip she wanted to go hard I know sir probably not I'm saying up separating it up into gram baggies like five of them and she just wanted to take them all you know we had got him together she just want to take them all I was like get him since she took I don't know she probably took about two and a half three grams this is penis envy these are the best shrooms on the market you guys are one of the best anyway she's driving home and she told me the road disappeared I the road disappeared she's like yeah but the fun that you do she was like only thing I knew to do is hit the brakes see when you take shoes man your higher mines gonna take over at some point yesterday when I was driving I'm stopped at a stoplight I got my foot on the brake but for some reason the cars beside me are moving why I'm slamming oh please my [ __ ] these cars move and I put the car in park group cars are still moving I was like okay this is the point that your higher mind takes over you know the car is in park and your foots on the brake you look down the ground is moving but you know that your car in the movie you don't feel the vibration this is a whole bunch of [ __ ] I looked at my hands and my hands were doing this [ __ ] but I wasn't moving I was just looking at him I was like wow it was good trip yesterday God isn't over that though deals are pretty good true I enjoyed it anyway before I take shoes every time it's like damn don't want to take these man who it's a weird feeling at home I'm so glad I took happy Wow yes I believe that that was probably the best in and it's still worth every bit of their name let's get back up in the air Daniel hmm she's that one took my breath away more ago I forgot here Wow do not snort your orgasm I was kind of nasty my bear job damn now that was a hack I have no idea look at my eyes baby look at my odds yes this is an exotic I love exotic hi who I'm exotic hard makes you happy a mission you guys are smoked like I know all of you guys have smoked exotic I know it but maybe you don't get exotic on a regular try smoking exotic on a regular for a whole week straight that's all you smoke is just exotic and see how that should make you feel man it's almost like it's almost like CBD like it does something to you metaphysically you know on the internal parts of your body you know I'm saying I don't know all the big words and [ __ ] but you know what I mean now starting relax now I'm trying to get a little more comfortable with being in that okay all right here we go on a scale of one to ten one being execute on want to be that [ __ ] you gotta have on a high critique of this emergency by C junkie genetics this is a really interesting it's not a technical high but it's a pretty good high of five nice quite lovely indeed so we're gonna give this high eight we're going to give you the same number although the high is a little better than the the taste I would have to give it you guys know there's two different ends of the spectrum I might have to give this a high eight the the flavor was a mid eight the high is a high eight low nine definitely a recommendation for your friends definitely it's a beautiful flavor you guys all shits aside so would that be a said wow that will really kick my ass right there buddy what's that being said you guys I hope you guys have a awesome day man I hope today is better than yesterday and hope tomorrow cause them all you guys think gotta go home

exclusive review this time we got from the men's company animal mints indoor flower tlc 33.85 1000 184 milligrams cbd is less than two percent made by sea junk seed junkie genetics but famous by

mints silver pool so [ __ ] would like to say i get the fake [ __ ] but they're the ones really getting the fake [ __ ] be getting that bomb [ __ ] but yeah i tried the animal moments by dr greenstone insane farms and let's try this mints let's see if they're the same or different in that curry smell this is a mix of groceries cookie with thin mints let's see if there's any difference nice and crystally like green mugs i had quite some showtime but it smells really minty that's where the men's company got the strain name from a little bit of purple a little bit of deep purple not too much really smells like earthy o.g minty killers always some say sherbert sunset sherbert mixed with thin mints yep that's what it is i definitely get the sensei sherbert smell [ __ ] bomb and [ __ ] like i said burner is a [ __ ] the main guy that put all the money into his company cookies but then again there's the breeders which is a sea junk seed junkie genetics that's a main grower just like jega

episode of waking baking this morning we have another strand I'm not I don't think I've done a review on this one yet I've smoked it before but this is Cushman's I'll see that nice looking but Cushman's Cushman is the evenly balanced hybrid strength 50% indica 50% a sativa created through a potent cross of the classic bubba kush ex animal mint strength perfect for any fan of a super minty flavor Cushman's bring on the brings on a well balanced effects that it hits the mind body and evenly levels of potency okay work that out I'm gonna read the whole paragraph that's on it you guys seen

you haven't subscribed to the channel please go and subscribe to the channel hit that post notification bell so you don't miss any of the cool videos but there's something that I said it wasn't gonna address but I need to address it so um one of the comments yesterday or a while back ago was of those packs that you have are fake is [ __ ] listen it has the name of the week on the pack it has the company that it came from and it contains the weed that says it the way that it says on the packet that's the weed is in the package how can it be fake I'll tell you what to do if you think anything I do is fake unsubscribe don't subscribe to me just go about your [ __ ] business man keep that negative [ __ ] off my page man it's about weed ain't nothing I put on your face I don't do fake [ __ ] man I'm trying to bring a service trying to educate people on what cannabis is to buy you [ __ ] boys want to do that dumb [ __ ] man with that negative stuff I'm not a negative person sorry about the [ __ ] boy thing but I'm not a negative person man I'm an uppity person not OPP like I'm good I'm better than people but uppity like I'm up you know I don't I don't bring no negativity on anybody I don't spray that [ __ ] so please don't spread it on my channel um there was another one a guy I respect his comment he said that um he said that uh he said he had the snowman strand before but he paid $30 for it and I'm paying way too much for mine so I told him I said you know I said maybe well perhaps we're not in the same area and perhaps this stuff that you bought is not dispensary great maybe a street level on the stuff that I get is dispensary gray it's only under the exotic mark all these are dispensary grades I'm not saying that you didn't buy dispensary grade I'm just saying where I'm at that's what they sell it for so I'm not broke so if I want the good weed I paid for the good weed anyway I think you guys were stopping by thank you for joining us we got the ice in the in the bomb we got the iPad get that out of the way now let's get to critiquing baby you guys do understand that there's levels to this cannabis just because you have um you might have the same kind of weed that I have the same namely that I have what yours may not be dispensary level and beyond that this is exotic level I really appreciate you guys tuning in that was really tasty I didn't taste no [ __ ] mints I don't look the [ __ ] they talking about maybe on the back end I taste a little minting it's just so little really you got a search word that's men got a little mint but maybe I'm trying to convince myself but anyway it's a full flavor too it's an interesting flavor Wow they're called we don't want cheese I do now that I have walked away and came back I do taste a little mint eNOS I don't know if I'm trying to convince myself with that or if I actually taste our D taste men I do anyway that is a nice taste the mint flavor is getting stronger now the first time I tried makeup Cushman's I tasted no maintenance that's because of a street level street level cannabis it's hit or miss you can get a good flavor one or not anyway let's get back into the flavor critique this is really tasty I'm getting really buzzed already I'm trying to take smaller hits on the hack up a block that's it we have to take I see my homeboys man how many times I hit this every time I smoke which all my homeboys that's not one hit to them I mean it will fill this this whole chamber up until it's like yellow ass smoke and just when you think they're dinner like then it's chamber this woman you think that they're at the end of their suction yes well you good just be this baby who yells [ __ ] smoke come on you're like yeah damn I want to try that too ain't for me man honestly I haven't seen any brothers that can hit the ball like that I'm not trying to put a race on anything but it appears everything is about race I'm not trying to put a race on it but all my black homeboys man they hit the barn like me they might may not hop ha couple um like I do but they hit like me but all my white friends man do news professionals that should be up it might even go back I've seen people hit a bong do a dab hit and drink a beer and then blow it out and it was an old light when y'all seeing this [ __ ] on our YouTube that [ __ ] was crazy okay on a scale of one to ten want to be in the best ten being the worst of the flavor critique of this Cushman's so I have to give it a five takes average to me sure it has a little minty pizzazz to it but it's just average tasty nothing might pop in my mouth like when you smoking Sour Diesel a [ __ ] Bobby no I didn't do all that so I give it a 5 don't get him wrong Cushman's ain't no slouch would I recommend this to my friends you know I would recommend this to older people because this is something like since it you don't even want to UM I guess this pack is fake too huh you know you don't really want to hack up alone so I would I would say that this is good for old people you know it's not really too flavorful it doesn't really make you hack up a long course it makes me hack of a long I told you guys before you guys already know but yeah I think it'd be I would recommend it to my older friends and yes there's people over to me just that is really good though but still only why hold it up there I'm not being sponsored by anybody they're not sponsoring me I just want to show you guys in Pigeon it's okay no taste like excuse me better hi-yah Kenny and we're back better yeah it was a lot better that was smooth there was no confidence I said it was smooth you see that no it was right anyway so let's go on the own on the hi critique um one being the worst ten being the best on the the buzz of the Cushman I would have to give this I will give it a seven for the buzz like I said this is something I would recommend for um older people or maybe if you have a um hang on okay my family so maybe if you have a indicate you might want to mix some of this with it because it is up up up or high I mean I feel it right here man like right across my face it's not a body high for me I feel none of the indica none of it at all I feel all sativa like I can go play badminton right now I'm just playing you know but I could go to the beach if that [ __ ] was open hope you guys are staying quarantine and stay safe let's see you guys I love your comments please continue with the comments or please make a statement put anything on there that you want to man but let's just please keep it positive I

"[Music] what's up everyone welcome to another cannabis critique today we are talking about cake mints off of uh the ozone line from ascend wellness this one comes in at 22 thc let's get in to the breakdown i got a lot to say about this one uh the look this is another one of those weeds that looks very very exotic visually before you get your hands on it it is very very impressive it has a ton of external trichome coverage i mean it looks like it's just covered in like a powder almost and it's got a ton of different colors going on it's like a yellowish green and then a bunch of purple throughout the buds and the buds are very uh pretty relatively dense uh i i would say very very dense actually uh but they're not very big so overall i gave the look only an 8.6 and that was because this stuff was one of the driest buds i've ever had but uh i recorded a clip of it so you guys could hear just how crispy it really was but that's why i took off a little on the look so i gave it a 8.6 out of 10 in the looks category ah the smell of this one was pungent it was a weird smell uh my my my buddy dan over at dan's buddha bodega if you haven't checked out his channel definitely check it out he described it as fruit and ass and that is exactly how i would describe it it's like super stinky weed it has a this is a weird smell to it and you get a little bit of fruity notes but it's mostly like this very like funky funky smell i gave the smell a 9 out of 10 not because i enjoyed it just because this weed actually had like a pungent odor and most dispensary weed that i'm picking up lately just doesn't have much of an odor so i gave it a 9 out of 10. now the high of this one it's kind of one note uh if you don't like indicas that make you sleepy definitely stay away from this one because that is exactly how this one is it doesn't hit you right away it's kind of a high that builds and builds and builds but it gets pretty strong towards the end and it will have you feeling uh pretty tired you also get some mood boosting effects from it but it's it's kind of just a one notor but if you're into like the real heavy indicas which i sort of am uh you'll you'll enjoy it so i gave the high a 9.1 out of 10. uh the breakup not too much to say on this one i broke up pretty nicely not too fine and it had a lot of keef on it from those frosty buds so i gave the breakup a nine out of ten it was very good uh the taste was kind of a little bit disappointing and i think that was because this bud was so dry it was so crispy it was kind of a painful smoke not as painful as i thought it was gonna be by how crispy this weed was but it uh overall had kind of a a faint sweet and then you get like that funky note from the smell of it it kind of tastes kind of like it smells okay you get a little bit of sweetness and a little bit of funkiness going on but mostly tastes like pain uh because this stuff was so so dry so i gave the taste a 7.8 out of 10. so overall that brings the score of the cake mints from ascend to an 8.7 out of 10. i say it is a good not great indica strain but i think it would be great for pain relief and sleep if you're looking for that and watch out for the dry mouth on that on this one it will creep up on you so 8.7 out of 10. and if you enjoyed this cannabis critique to be sure to like comment and subscribe for more", "x-mKwTPhxNw": "[Music] what up and welcome to another edition of canopy where we are bringing to you honest and unbiased cannabis straight review so today we are going to be reviewing kush mints by the medicine room and high class now i picked this up over at the ponderosa relief center cushman's is no stranger to the channel we have reviewed it before here but for those of you who have never tried cushman's let's go ahead and talk about it this is a hybrid strain that is a cross between animal mints and one of my favorite strains of all time bubba kush so some beasts coming together to create this animal mint so i am very excited to try this out so let's go ahead i want to bring it up on screen for you guys to check out then we'll go ahead and take a look at it together okay so you just had a chance to check out the cushman's let me know what you think in the comments below i can tell you i am so excited to break into this cushman's is just one of my absolute favorite strains um all of 2020. now i picked this stuff up here um a couple weeks ago from ponderosa relief center i see that it has a harvest date of 10 23 so october the 23rd is when this stuff was harvested um i believe i picked this up on the 13th of november today just so you guys know is december the 1st so we're about a week a month and a week from the harvest date which honestly this should be perfectly cured it's so weird because they put an expiration date on this bud of 11 9 which i picked this up four days after that so i don't know i can't really explain that to you but some of the uh medicine room buds that we have been reviewing and the high class bud has just been so good so i'm really excited about this this cushman's here so let's go ahead and pop the top and see what this stuff's all about wow the first thing is first the flavor on this is on point it's like a mixture of a sweet minty kind of pine there's some gas in there almost like a little cookie or gelato sunset sherb type flavor this is like one of the most dynamic smells i have smelled in a long time and god the only thing i think it's lacking is just like the robustness of the terps i mean because this stuff it smells great but i really gotta stick my nose in and i'll tell you when i ground this stuff up oh my god it's smell honestly it's probably one of the best smelling strains i've ever reviewed on the channel so if these terps were louder it would be perfect but they're just not that loud let me look at the bud holy hot damn this stuff is frosty frosty frosty the snowman let me i mean these are dense buds it's frosty on the inside and they're like we're talking about like nice fat trichomes on here now one of these buds doesn't look as good as the others it's like one of these buds it's not like the others um and that really is bumming me out the other thing is you know on this bud here there's just like the the orange hairs are there right they're there but you really got to look for them they're like hiding and embedded in within the bud and god i mean if it wasn't for that oh purple undertones underneath the bud i mean this is some unbelievable looking bud i am just bummed out that like those orange hairs aren't a little more spur like um a little more prevalent on this bud and it's funny because from one bud to the next like this one bud that wasn't created equal really isn't even close as good the other ones i got like it's it's it's good but it's not nearly as good so this must have been like maybe a lower on the plant yeah i mean honestly it looks really really good i think there's probably still a little room from the improvement on the looks just a little bit it's probably like just a little bit um but let's do this since we've smelled it we've looked at it already let's go ahead throw this sack on the penny pincher test so before i got started today i wanted to see if ponderosa relief center was penny pinching they've never penny pinched before so let's see if maybe we can catch them penny pinching this time so let's see if this uh cushman's by the medicine room was weighed out accurately by the ponderosa relief center it says 3.6 grams on the label let's see okay so the time has come for the penny pinchers test let's see if this kush mints by the medicine room and high class weighs 3.6 grams and let's see if the ponderosa relief center weighed it properly so let's get the scale turned on here i will go ahead and put a dollar bill on the scale just to make sure that that weighs one gram and this is calibrated perfect let's go ahead and get our measuring cup put on here i will tear that out and let's get the cup or jar open boom you heard the top and let's see how this weighs oh yeah that is a past 3.7 grams big ups to the ponderosa relief center for weighing out my cushman's by the medicine room and high class accurately oh yeah that is a pass that's how you do it ponderosa relief center 3.7 gram eighth now that is how it is done big ups and thank you guys for weighing this sack properly i really appreciate that honestly i i'll tell you between the smell and just how bomb this stuff looks oh am i excited to try this stuff so today i'm going to be enjoying the cushman's out of my arizer xtreme q desktop vape i've got this bad boy set to 375 degrees fahrenheit as you see right there i've got my whip which is basically just a silicone tube that gets the vapor from the vaporizer to me the end with the screen on i just cleaned that out that's going on top of the vape bowl itself so this bowl sits right on top of the heating element right there um now the other end is going into my scientific inhalations triple filtered bubbler now i'm only using two of the three filtration chambers i've got distilled water in the second an organic cotton filter in the third that'll filter out any potential remaining impurities that did not get purged out in the final stages of growing and in that flushing process and then i've got the first chamber which sits in that bulb there i just left that empty that would typically hold carbon and prevent ash from reaching the water but you guys know there's no ash coming from this vaporizer so if you guys are ready to blaze let's go ahead puff down see what some of this cush mints from the medicine room in high class are all about okay not not a huge rip but i did get already some of that nice sweetness it's coming in with the mint and the pine flavor from that bubble kush right behind almost a little mentholy a tiny bit minty just so far and again it wasn't a very big vape rip so let's dive in for the second one and see how the flavor develops so not a huge rip but i'll tell you what i can feel it i mean there's no denying i've got sweet in my mouth right now i have got pine mint the kush flavor a little bit of gas there's some creaminess my god that's only the second rip and this is coating my mouth now when we talk about flavorful strains this is what i'm looking for now i am praying that this stuff holds its own through the end of the bowl if the flavor holds through this could be a perfect score in the taste department i'm just letting you guys know in advance so while i'm finishing this bowl let me bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under the magnification of 25 times macro lens you can get a little bit of a better up close and personal view of this cush mints by the medicine room so here it comes now okay so you are looking at the cushman's by the medicine room and high class and wowie wow is this dense and look at just how fluffy it looks it's almost white to the naked eye with just those light green undertones i really love how the light greens undertones are offset by those few dark green leaves you can kind of see there at the top and then how about those beautiful orange hairs now these are those very short and thin orange hairs they hug very tightly to the butt you guys can see like there really aren't any hairs that are trying to jump off of this but that is for sure um i really am curious um just to see how big these trichomes are because i mean under this uh macro lens i mean it looks like this stuff was just dusted with frost but we'll certainly see about that and the other thing is talk about a great manicure job this bud was trimmed right up to the nug no excess leaf material so a great job trimming this bud um you know from what i can see here okay so what did you think of the cushman's under that macro lens was that not frosty so i was saying in that um uh video that it's like i can't tell if this stuff is frosty or if that's just like admit it just looks white under the macro lens no you guys it is that frosty i mean this stuff is frosty as it comes um you know maybe not frosty as it comes i don't want to give them too much credit but i mean honestly the amount of trichomes on this bud are absolutely amazing this stuff reminds me a lot of miracle alien cookies i gotta be honest but god trichomes look so good this bud i just wish ah god it's tough because the looks are one of the like the amazing amazing qualities about this bud but you know i don't even want to get into that yet truthfully there's a lot of amazing qualities about this bud and very few that i dislike to be honest um and as i'm sitting and thinking about this rating it's like man i wish it i wish it was a little higher but to be honest i think where i've got the rating kind of written out already and in my mind i think that's exactly where this stuff is but boy this stuff is a treat a treat a treat so let me go ahead and give you my rundown on how i rate all of these reviews and how i rate all the strains i should say so all of the strains i will rate on a scale from 0 to 10 0 being the worst 10 being the absolute best i break that down to 4 different categories look smell taste and potency it's that simple i'll sign up to 2.5 points each in each of those respective categories and then give you guys the final rundown at the end after i've tallied up my total in those four categories anything seven or above is gonna get my dank thumbs up approval anything seven or below will not if it's seven or above i will also let you know if i would pick up the straight again and if i'd recommend it so let's show you guys the looks let's start by talking about the look jar appeal or bag appeal of this stuff so i'm going to bring it up on the screen one last time so it's fresh in your mind and then we'll go ahead and give you the final thoughts and run down on this cushman's by the medicine room and high class okay so you've seen it multiple times i don't think we need to harp on it any longer here now this bud i mean first of all like i you know i like getting big nugs in my eighth i guess when you get nugs like this these are okay these other ones kind of are a little more inferior those are like popcorn nugs and it's kind of a shame because i bought this stuff deli style so he was picking me out the biggest nugs you guys um so to only still be able to get nugs like this size a little bit of a bummer a little bit of a letdown but i mean how does it look it looks really really good i think the only discrepancy i'm seeing is honestly from like this one bud which is a little larpy and kind of a little less dense than the others to the you know the one that i puffed today and the other one that i'm looking at this other big boy here it's really beautiful and honestly i wish i could give this a 2.5 but i've just seen so much amazing looking bud that like not only does it have to have the crystals and the trichomes and you know the bud structure um you know it's tough for me this looks like a machine trimmed that definitely is gonna give it a knock for sure um i don't think that they hand trim this i could be completely wrong um big john you were the uh head grower up there while this stuff was going around why don't you comment and let me know buddy um keep me posted man um but you know listen the leaves are trimmed right up to the butt i just i think overall this stuff is good it's not great most people even though i really think it's between a two and a two point five and this one nug this one nug is is awesome but um you know i kind of go to go i'm going based on the hole here now the smell i think this smell is a perfect 10 after you break it up i truly do and i mean that sincerely it's so dynamic it has it's got everything it's sweet gelato sherb um mixed with pine and menthol and like a little creaminess and it's it's got it's just got everything you want in a strain but it's just not loud like here i don't smell anything here i'm starting to smell it and then you know once you get your nose in there it smells so great and pungent um but you got to grind it up to get there for me it's a 2.0 in the smell let's get to the taste the taste the taste the taste translates you guys i it didn't last quite as long as i would have hoped it would have but it did change to more of like a creamy gassy flavor that lasted throughout the rest of that bowl and i will tell you i enjoyed that thoroughly it's really close it's between a two and a two and a half but in this category in particular because the flavor was there and it was so prevalent it coated my mouth um and what was there was again it's dynamic and had some creaminess and the kush from the pit pineyness from the the bubba kush in there um man i just i really liked it and i i think it's it's going to be a 2.5 out of 2.5 in the taste for me now let's get to the potency this is a balanced hybrid i am getting some good effects in my mind some good effects in my body just a nice 50 50 blend i'm actually still pretty alert i could go function on this and do whatever i needed to do during the day but my my body is still chilled out a little bit of haziness in the head not too much heaviness around the eyes or anything like that but definitely majorly chilled out i feel good i feel medicated but i don't feel overly medicated and this is just that good like my whole soul is kind of lifted like i talk about clean meds you guys this is just that nice light pressure on the head where you just feel lifted you know um and your body is just light honestly i really like it i think it's good it's not great in the potency perspective um so i'm gonna go ahead and give it a two in the potency so if you've been following it's a two in the look two in the taste a two point five uh excuse me two in the look two in the smell 2.5 in the taste and then a 2.0 in the potency it's gonna be an 8.5 for the cushman's by the medicine room and high class so it is absolutely getting my dank thumbs up approval for sure you know that and then the real question that's on everybody's mind right now is would i buy this strain again would i pick this one up again here's the deal you guys for me i really like cushman's i like balanced hybrids drains and i love how this stuff tastes and the effects are just good i mean you're not gonna get blown away by the effects but they're good effects i absolutely would pick up another batch of this stuff again i mean you might be paying premium tier to go buy it deli style you know 45 bucks an eighth or whatever it might be um it's gonna be worth it you guys in my opinion i would absolutely go pay 45 bucks for this stuff again um and i'm so i'm excited i'm glad i didn't buy just a gram of and i've got the rest of this eighth smoke here because this was enjoyable i might actually pack another bowl right now i'm feeling so good maybe i can take that up a notch you know bring it to a 2.5 with a second bowl um but that's my test i only want to have one bowl and be fully medicated so um you know there's always room for more but uh yeah it's gonna be an 8.5 they passed the penny pictures um with a 3.7 that is huge and big ups to the ponderosa relief center for that um and yeah if you guys uh haven't tried this cush mints yet by the medicine room in high class you are missing out now if you have let me know is it 8.5 fare keep me posted in the comments below and then let me know what you guys want to see me review but until the next one you guys take care of yourself and one another and i look forward to seeing you guys soon peace", "DWBE83gzLpE": "how's it going everyone welcome back to my channel thank

I've smoked a blunt or any tobacco products on my channel I stopped smoking tobacco I want to say it's about a year now guys that I stopped smoking tobacco like from regularly purchasing it so I can roll my trees you know I stopped purchasing it just because it was affecting my lungs I noticed every time I smoked uh Swisher's I would have a hard time breathing after a while after somebody just passed by walking way I would have a hard time breathing everyone with smoking tobacco products especially backwards I don't let backwards this big thing right now a lot of people love them I personally like the what flavor is that called can't think of it right now guys I don't know that's how you know let's see you guys know that I'm not a big backward person it's the great the gray bag I'll tell you guys that I don't know I forgot the the taste of the flavor of it but it's a gray bag and backwards that's the only one I personally enjoyed but other than that I don't really like smoking tobacco products guys I know a lot of people have you know the discussion about Swisher's versus joints and honestly I would go ahead and pick joints it's it's better for you and you can taste the weed better I believe they're made out of rice papers they're made in al-khoei Spain and it says the birthplace of rolling paper and it says non-gmo and for vegan people guys it's as authentic

well-balanced ozone brand hybrid that crosses cushman's with lemon pound cake now when you open this jar and just let it sit for a few minutes like you opened it and then went and got a drink came back when you came back the room would be skunky but if you put your nose straight up against the bud it's fruity but like fruity with ass or sulfur it's sweet it's i don't like it the smell is i mean it does have a little bit of citrus on top of it so it's not all bad now this isn't a bad looking flower either it's got your dark greens it's got little purple spots some orange hairs and a really good coating of trichomes the only thing that i didn't like about the look of this flower was that it was really really crunchy i really don't like it when it's that crunchy because it means it's going to be harsh as hell but let's give it a benefit of doubt and go ahead and take it all right well here we go nice trovia slanted cheers salute [Music] okay i get a little bit all right so right off the bat it has this little there's a little pain feeling it tastes like pain with a little bit of a bloody finish so yeah pain with a little bit of a bloody finish the flavor is i don't know it's just pure fire so i am getting a head rush um what do you say we go ahead and let me get back to you with the effects all right guys well i've given a little bit of time and let me tell you the effects of this flower are more leaning on the indica side i find it to be a little more cerebral and relaxing slash sedating than i do seeing it's you know energizing now that doesn't mean that i got the couch lock and i do have you know somewhat of a boost of creativity i think but not to the point that you know you're you're jittery or you know you it feels like you just can't slow down you know whatever this is really pleasant it gets just keeps building and building and building and building the peak wouldn't be for another i'd say half an hour 35 minutes and afterwards it leaves you with dry mouth and the munchies so if you're looking to eat this is a great strain for you if you're looking to not eat i'd say skip it and find something with a bit more limey but all in all this was an enjoyable flower i was a little nervous with that that awful smell but um you know the the gas ass or ass gassy smell but it really turned out to be a nice experience i'd say go ahead and check this out if you're smoking to relieve anxiety depression and stay relaxed throughout your whole day this strain is for you that just about does it for me here i'd like to say thank you to all my friends family subscribers viewers haters lovers everyone elsers and also last but not least thanks for the view", "9mgBQLpOvQM": "hey what's up you guys shadows here again with another episode of shadows we'd review now today on the show we're gonna be going over Phoenix farms and moments this one is a cheap when it's only 35 bucks for eighth but it was bomb last time we got it the nugs were real small and dance there's a whole jar was a bunch of popcorn mugs which I wasn't very happy happy about but let me tell you it is a really good strain and it gets you really stoned and for 35 bucks you cannot beat it this the smell that you get out of this and the flavor the overall high everything is excellent so you guys gotta try this again give it another try this is the Phoenix farms animal mints now the first time we got it the nugs looked like this let me show you they look like this it was just a whole bunch of little junk and this is how the piehole was that I got last time by Phoenix farms and I was like dude everything from Phoenix farms is bad it's all like popcorn mugs honestly their popcorn eggs sometimes or not they're they're pretty bad but the the strains that they actually have are really good so if you get the jars before you buy their jars on the Phoenix farms shake it and hear what it sounds like if it sounds like a bunch of little rattling balls on the bottom of the rocks if you like that that's you think that that's great then you'll love it but shake it up if you get the bigger mug one it'll come out awesome dude I got this last one I saw the next and I went and I bought a whole ounce of it because the price is good the medics were all big they were a little bit on the leafy ursine super frosty the smell is very minty it's very menthol II and then once you break it up it smells like corned beef so if you know a lot about original strains of weed the original strains that have been bred into all these different types of weed this when you break it you can smell the corned beef smell that's from the train wreck and then that minty smell and it's coming from the Girl Scout cookies so that's Girl Scout cookies crossed with with trainwreck and let me tell you the high from a dis match this meant that with my fingers to get to smell a little bit but the high from this is intense you guys let's look at it under the microscope just so I can show you how bombers is and for 35 bucks really you cannot meet this stuff it's really good which is 35 bucks is a lot but in my local dispensary that's the lowest tier bracket and if you look on here it is covered with trichomes there's trichomes all over this stuff and the heads are still there so it's been held handled pretty well listen I would say it's about 50% of the heads are still left on the buds and I'll fill you right here let me get some good pictures look at this you guys here I'm gonna bring this thing closer so you guys can see BAM look at that look at the amount of crystals all right there all right see all those are here so it's very finicky when I move this microscope but look at all those trichomes and all the globs real heads this does been handled pretty well especially for a $35 price range this one's pretty good and everybody that I smoked it with is all veteran smokers and everybody loves this stuff so if you get a chance try the animal mints by Phoenix farms it's awesome we're gonna do it right now now I know I usually use my three-foot roar but I got a new buddy over here and I'm gonna give you show you his card cuz I know he wants to show off his card these guys right here these guys gave me a 3-footer they saw that I've been using my 3 foot roller and that is really expensive and really valuable and they're like man if anything happens to that you're gonna be really sorry bro so they made me my own custom 3 foot mom as close as they could get it to the roar it doesn't quite seal as perfectly as a roar but it's as close as I've seen yet so if you guys get a chance check these guys out to the cave they did an excellent job with this 3 footer and we're gonna try it right now testing there's farm animal mints let's do it you guys got your pieces at home get out some blood you load it up let's smoke together so this stuff it smells up the whole closet when I when I open this jar I have tons about in here tons of Bud and as soon as I open that jar this is only thing you can smell it is an overwhelming menthol II smell it's nice and smooth and like when you smoke it probably because the menthol and it is really good really good the head high is good the body height is good you won't be looking for another hint in 15 minutes it's good it lasts a long time I highly recommend this one you guys I tried it a bunch of times that's why I'm redoing a video on it because last time I was I do these mugs are small it's not that great but if you can find one with the bigger nose man is this it is off the chain you guys will love it so grab your pieces let's do this one together right let's do this here's my new 3 footer yeah buddy that's in it but then you also get the overwhelming body high with the sweats and everything from the Girl Scout cookies so it's an excellent blend of the two you guys its animal mints by Phoenix farms it's usually in the lowest tier bracket at my local dispensary but with all the shout outs I've been giving it and all the wealth the people have for this probably gonna go up hate to say it but them better they are the better the reviews we give them and stuff they they like to bring the prices up so I'm just telling them that hey if you keep it at 35 you can sell more make just as much money you don't have to tax everybody and you know there can be a mid-grade one that everybody knows and everybody likes so hopefully we can keep it that way but shout out to Phoenix farms animal mints give it a try you guys it's the bomb I also wanna make my other shout out to the cave I don't know where my thing is here it is I am to the cave thank you for that 3-footer and they got another one for me to unbox on the next one they ordered me a fresh doll drawer throw them straight from Germany so these guys are the badass so check them out the cave all right I'll see you guys on the next one late", "inS42xE3eYQ": "what's up y'all it's your boy shelton with another fine

some wheat and a bowl of rice let's get that out i don't need that in there although that was some good stuff too that's why we're going to save it i'm not blowing it on the road on the road on the ground oh rudy tooty fresh and fruity i'm just messing with y'all oh my god if you're new to the channel go ahead and smash that subscribe button hit the post notification bell so you don't miss any of these videos it's around five o'clock in the morning y'all it's uh what is today's date oh you ain't trying to tell me today's date huh that is crazy today is well why is it doing that i don't know we're gonna find out though now i'm really interested today's date that's a damn shame that's why i hate apple products man because apple products they're [ __ ] they're they're weird man you got to do weird [ __ ] with a man to get them to tell you something why wouldn't my ipad tell me the date right up front the date should be right there on the first page right there i gotta go on the internet to find out what today's date is nathan william so today is uh august 25th 2020 tuesday anyway let's get back up in here y'all oh we got the bomb packed and we fitting the smoke let me stop hugging my ball make me look like trump hugging that damn flag with his crazy cell let go oh this is gonna be a hard one here i guess that's the mini part because i taste some type of like cinnamon or mint it's like my tongue tastes like it's cool you know that's weird i guess i've never smoked a mint before hmm it's weird because it really does have a minty taste to it i don't know nothing about the oreos i don't taste no oreos but my mouth feels like i took a hit off a newport or something like like that cool sensation wow that's really cool i've never had that with a wee before it's not a taste it's a feeling that's weird my mouth feels cold but it has no like peppermint or it has no cinnamon taste it has no taste like that it just feels cool wow that's weird like a menthol taste that's cool but weird there's a little sweet taste to it i guess that's the oils but it doesn't taste like oreos all i really taste that's really pronounced is that that menthol or minty taste that's weird because i smoked some of this yesterday and i didn't taste it while i did taste it but i had just got done eating some hot sauce some hot sauce on it so i kind of threw it off i thought it was like the hot sauce but that's a minty flavor that's pretty clean that's neat that's the second hit and i'm starting to feel a slight bug the slight buzz is coming right behind my eyes what is this what kind of i wonder what what um is this an indica a sativa i don't know let's find out it's a mostly it says oreo mints is a mostly indica variety from third coast and can be cultivated indoors that's really all i see on it yeah so it is mostly ending because i was going to say it feels like it's mostly a sativa but i am uh i do feel it right behind my eyes which i used to think that that was um either a hybrid or or something else but now that i'm starting to pay attention a little more it seems like that most endings start right behind my eyes it would make sense because you know you get kind of sleepy so it wouldn't make sense but that is a really nice taste and the buzz is really starting to kick in now i can tell i'm gonna be super hot off this a perfect waking bait to get super hot there's nothing like getting stupid high early in the morning man i don't mean a high that you want to pass out on just before that pass out huh you know i mean just stupid highlight you just what was it it had to be saturday like it was saturday i made a video and i was so hot man i had to take my mom to her dialysis thing and i was so hot it it was to the point that i was having fun driving but it was like laboring to drive like that [ __ ] my scene straight i felt kind of dizzy like wow you know when you had to draw like this you know you get drunk yet dry like this that's why i felt like i almost had to draw with one eye open that's like crazy [ __ ] but this is quite tasty i got a slight burn on the top back of my throat it's nice though wow it's really that minty flavor is really nice i wish i could taste the oreos with the milk but maybe i just don't recognize the oreo with the mint it's a really good flavor though it has a mild expansion rate when it hits your lungs too it's not like soon as he looks you had we that soon to hit your lungs and expand your lungs although i'm coughing it's a really really low expansion rate let me see if i get my air straight okay and we're back i'm just playing y'all um yeah well i'm getting i'm getting extremely high this is only like the first bowl and look how slow it burns you guys it's still half that bowl pack you can still see green right there it's still half this bowl packed you guys that's crazy and i didn't hit it like three four five i don't even know how many times i hit it man something i hit it hard though how many people you know act like this at five o'clock in the morning [Music] one being a good [ __ ] ten being no wait a minute one being that [ __ ] 10 being that good [ __ ] of the flavor critique of backpack boys oreos and mints we're going to give the flavor of this i ate it's a nice strong a2 because i've never had that cool mentholy well they call it mince or menthol a cool peppermint taste in my mouth from weed and it's it's good because it's mild but i know it's there it tastes good as [ __ ] y'all eating a lot it almost deserves a nine for that minty flavor but that is a nice flavor i like it do i have a new favorite maybe i do so about the uh the young dude that got shot by the police the one that got shot seven times the black dude you know i really don't like to assign colors to people anymore but but his his color is imperative to the story so color like he's a crown or something his uh ethnicity is imperative to the story so the black dude that got shot um he was there to break up a fight he's breaking up two females in a fight this is how the story goes he was breaking up two females in a fight he's seen the police pull up as most black men do they try to leave the scene when the police pull up because police is killing us at an alarming rate all you got to admit that [ __ ] man so anyway he sees the police pull up the police draw down on him immediately bomb they got the gun out he walks around the car he's on this side of the car passenger side as he's walking around the car the police are behind him there's like three cops behind him he gets all the way around to the path to the driver side of the door opens up the car door and reaches in the car before the police shoot him i don't know what he's reaching for when he reached in the car he may have been just trying to get in the car i don't know the whole story but what i do know is that they shot that boy at point-blank range in the back seven times that was none of that was necessary when he was on this side of the car on the passenger side of the car as soon as he took some steps and they said freeze don't move and he kept moving he was supposed to tackle or tased or maced at that point he should have been more than likely he should have been tackled but if they was too scared to tackle him taser's ass bomb you know one of you [ __ ] got a taser or a stun gun taser bomb so he's hitting the ground throw the cups on him find out what's going on but anyway the story is that he was in um he was in bad condition he got shot seven times but now he's in a stable condition and i'm not even sure but i think he may be out of the hospital i'm not sure about that but anyway he's in stable condition and he is alive it's crazy man they're shooting people in the back they tell us that is completely illegal to shoot someone in the back completely illegal but for them it's not illegal isn't it illegal for everybody to shoot somebody in the back if you shoot somebody in the back the theory is that they're leaving the threat is leaving now as a police officer if he's if the threat is leaving me but he still has society threatened you know he can still kill somebody else then i have to do something they don't care maybe i can shoot him in the back but if there's more officers they usually have more officers than they do suspects or or whatever he in this case he's a victim but more suspects so if there's more police then why can't y'all just overpower him and take him down you guys ain't scared of him you just want to kill black people that's all that is man that's all that is man i don't care what nobody says that's all it is now there was at no point that that man should have been shot i hope he sues the state i hope the police gets the only the bad thing about a man is that the only way you can meet this type of violence is with violence now we we place our trust in police all these years you guys for many many years and it was it was cool to place your trust in police right up to like the 70s or or the mid 70s after that man that's when they started realizing oh these [ __ ] need oh [ __ ] we in charge it's like they don't understand that they're working for us so now they're working by themselves and they're doing their own thing and they have the law to back them up now isn't that some [ __ ] they can do any [ __ ] thing they want to they can pull you over demand that you give them either your id anytime the passenger if you're a passenger in the car give me your id and you go okay here when you don't have to give them [ __ ] [ __ ] them [ __ ] the police oh yeah we're back in who oh [ __ ] wow they say to me on my social medias hey man all police ain't bad you know my answer to that is well show me a good one if all police ain't bad show me a good one just because me as a cop didn't shoot that dude in the back i'm still i'm still a bad cop because i watched it happen and and not only that i watched it happen six times six more times after i seen it the first time after he shot the first time the police should have grabbed him bomb they should have grabbed hey man oh the thing is is that the police policies are [ __ ] up their policy is that you're supposed to continue shooting until the threat stops now i guarantee you you shoot somebody one time bomb that threat is stopped that that is stopped but your adrenaline is pumping so much you just want to keep pulling that trigger because you got the law behind the law says that you can keep pulling this [ __ ] trigger now somebody i forgot who it was i think it might be um i forgot who was i'm not even gonna say the name he said that they should bring the law back that you can shoot somebody in the leg to stop the threat you know what cops policy is now two in the chest one in the head that's their policy when i was going to security school that's what they was training us in security school needless to say i didn't finish security school because of that [ __ ] two shots i'm security well that's not police training police police train two to the chest one in the head that's messed up oh and the bad part about it is that they do they shot in the back his kids was in the car that's what makes it even worse his kids was in the car that's sad man i'm glad that man did not die guys got a purpose for him obviously anyway you guys i'm getting really baked this really starting to kick in it feels like it's a instant high but yet a creeper at the same time you know that creeper weeding [ __ ] so i got high instantly after like the second or third hit but it's slowly creeping it's like [Music] yeah that's what i'm talking about that is really good though i would most definitely recommend this to my friends i can't put my fingers on all the other flavors that are in this you guys so i deeply apologize for that but that mint flavor is definitely there there's a sweet taste on exhale when i breathe out through my nose but it doesn't taste anything like oreos to me i've actually never had that flavor before it's not oreos and it's not berries maybe it's just the mince mixed with oreos that gives it a weird taste i don't know it's not really weird but it is a pleasant taste trust them believe hey if you're new to the channel smash that subscribe button hit that post notification bell so you don't miss any of these fire ass videos baby oh yeah smooth yet seductive has legs it creeps up it's really nice i have a really really nice buzz going on i can't see this being in indica well i told you guys this before i can smoke an indica on waking bait because i had just got up so indica doesn't make me sleepy you know what i'm saying perhaps indicas only make you sleepy like if it's like if you've been up for a while if you're already halfway sleeping or just a little tired you don't just eat a little tired and you smoke somebody because maybe it might put you to sleep but i can't see indica like now i have smoked some indica man that just man one we had one indica it was a mango mango kush i don't even know if it's indigo but it was this mango kush that we had that was so potent me and my nephew stop smoking it man because every time we smoked it we would wake up think that some [ __ ] how you wait a minute man we was just smoking and now we waking up we had all smokes and there's like six people in the house we all smoked a couple blunts of mango man and next thing you know everybody was waking up like what the [ __ ] happened man have you ever done it where you just lose time like you pass out you don't know you passed out all you know all you remember is this damn you look around everybody else sleep you're like what the [ __ ] we did it again smoke some more oh hell no man the alien's gonna put this [ __ ] here y'all they said dating us man so they can come in and booty probe us [ __ ] out of here i don't know why they always say that aliens booty probe you [ __ ] out of here don't you think their technology is way more advanced than that maybe they're trying to get something i don't think it's a booty probe i think they're trying to get something you know what i'm saying they're trying to pull something out of you because the [ __ ] are way more advanced than probing you through your booty [ __ ] out of here that is really nice i think i might have to smoke another bowl of that not with y'all though i think i might have to continue the party but first of all on a scale of one to ten one being that [ __ ] 10 being that [ __ ] of the flavor critique not the flavor critique of the high critique of this backpack boys oreos and mints we're going to give this high critique the same number as we gave the flavor we're gonna give it a eight two eight you guys we're rolling two eighths so um i think that's a good thing and um it's uh really really tremendous and uh we're gonna just really do a great job you sound nothing like trump i wouldn't want to sound like that big ass mother i don't know i just you know it's not that i hate trump i just think that he got in over his head i think he's it's it's more than he thought it would be perhaps he took the the presidency on a bet or something you know i can be president if i wanna know you can't trump you're crazy watch and um money can buy me the president's presidency and maybe god and there was like damn this [ __ ] is this [ __ ] is difficult hey bomb that um see he don't know what to do because it meant you know anybody that this president you should have to have been in politics before the only way that you should be allowed to be a president is if you've been a senator a governor a judge you know some [ __ ] like that that's the only way you should be allowed to be president it shouldn't be no average joe like kanye west being a [ __ ] president get the [ __ ] out of here man this ain't the [ __ ] land that are free what wrong with y'all just plain old so anyway you guys i hope you guys enjoyed the video i hope i hope

percent THC damn near 30 percent THC so you guys know this one's gonna be strong and very potent and I wish when this dropped I got more than just one because this was my favorite and still is my favorite strain that jungle boys has recently dropped this isn't one of my favorites so with that being said and he it was limited drive to that's not saying like it was limited so if you got some you

strains and one of my favorite crosses right here but yeah you can see you got two Nuggets left a nice round shape Nuggets not too big not too small you see the trichomes just listening deeply each little corner of these Nuggets so with that being said let's get around the bag so we can see how she truly looks I hope you guys are ready for this alrighty then since I showed y'all how she looks when she's sending that home that's fine and see that she looks when she comes out hope y'all ready for this - nuggets in there that's too big not too small check out that little sister first that is sent this strainer really surprised me you can see how like circulate these nuggets are like I was surprised on how like all those shaped these nuggets came out but yeah you can still see the trichomes this deeply deeply embedded there these little crack and crevice like it's just right so yeah even though these nuns came out small they pack a punch and it's not all about looks you know sometimes I have to remind myself it's not all about history looks that's got to taste it and see that's the one for you but man look at those Tricon keep it on the back and understand that even underneath see let me just get super close this even works yeah Wow look at that even when a small nugget this bird is covered almost want to break it open right here let's see seething we can do very condensed nuggets yeah I can't even and even break it is so convinced that this is what I was talking about even though she's small she still packs a punch you can just see the trichomes are all over this Shane do every crack and every crevice that's always good to see so with that being saying I don't even think I need to break into the other one you guys got an idea of how this is looking unfortunately it's not on the menu anymore but this is a cross between white fire 43 and jungle cake white fire 43 jungle cake oh I hope you guys are ready for this one coming out of twenty nine percent THC damn that thirty percent THC that's higher than those $75 eighty I'll be buying that cookie is like that a Jerry Payne and that London cello those don't even be in the thirty percent THC that's alright they don't even being a 30% off they'd be like nineteen maybe sometimes twenty and maybe sometimes over twenty five but yeah if you spend $75 on an eighth I'm gonna least expecting it to be close to 30% or over thirty percent THC so shout out to jungle boys for this one let's break it down get into the bow you can see how she truly tastes look at that oh you can see think that losing right here on my left hand that family get it right they're not little crevice you see that the THC Chris's stretching look at that look at that look at that vanity right there you see no

honest and unbiased cannabis strain reviews so today we are going to be reviewing cush mints by pitchfork now you guys cushman's is a hybrid strain it is a 50 50 hybrid strain that is a cross between one of the most popular strains of all time bubba kush and a relatively new strain of animal mints so we have got a very well balanced hybrid in this cushman's i picked this stuff up at the health for life cape creek location so i am so excited to try this stuff out so before we get into it i'm going to bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out and then we are going to take a look at it together all right so what did you guys think of this cushman's i know we didn't have very big buds to photograph today but i still am very curious what you guys think so let me know in the comments below but let's break this bag open and see what this stuff is all about you guys okay so i've smelled like london mints before and this is very very similar this cushman's i'm getting definitely that like classic kind of piney kush flavor but there's something different it's like you know they say it's a little bit minty and the animal mince comes from like the cookie and wedding cake varieties and i'm smelling a little bit of sweetness from that side of things from the animal mint side um but let's pull this nug out and see what this stuff is all about oh my god you guys what i know this is small mug let me try and block out my face here to see if this zooms in on this probably look like an idiot just covering up my face right there but anyways you guys wowie under the light this stuff is straight up glistening like trichomes like crazy you guys it almost no joke this butt is so crystally it almost looks white it's unbelievable and i was so impressed with the tropical heat that uh we tried from pitchfork so man i mean oh my god like the bottom of this bud it's just all crystals you guys and there are these tiny short little bright orange hairs they're not really thick and and they're actually on the thinner side but they like kind of hug right up to the bud they're not really those protruding hairs that protrude out but i can see the leaves were trimmed right up to the blood this does not look like it went through an auto trimmer and while the smell isn't super super strong straight out of the back and look at that you guys talk about some hang time look at this stuff just sticking to my finger right now you guys wow holy cow i'm so excited to try this stuff out these are really really dense buds you guys like very very dense um and it is pretty dry it's not super super malleable for sure but one thing i want to tell you guys about this flavor and the smell when i ground this herb up to put into what we're going to be enjoying this out of today which is my air riser extreme q vaporizer i've got this bad boy set to 375 degrees as always so when i went to ground this stuff up you guys i will tell you that all of that flavor came out it was like it had that kush the the piney aroma like the evergreen aroma and then i was also getting some sweetness in there from the animal mint side of things so boy oh boy am i excited to try this out so i have got my arizer extreme q vaporizer that i'm going to be feeding into my scientific inhalations triple filtered bubbler this thing is literally sparkling clean you guys brand new purified water here i've left the first chamber empty which is where carbon goes that would catch typically ash that would go in this water but we're vaping today so there's not going to be any ash and then the third chamber here i've got a brand new organic cotton filter to filter out any remaining impurities but honestly these guys at pitchfork i think know what they're doing so i have a feeling there's not going to be any impurities in this bud so without further ado if you guys are ready i'm ready to try out this animal mint from pitchfork and see what it's all about so start your engines and let's get this party started oh wow okay so this is crazy again i feel like this was the same thing that happened last time with the pitchfork weed i know i didn't get a huge rip that couldn't have been smoother like you guys oh and now i'm getting it like kind of the cookie sweetness like just the subtle sweetness from that animal mint mmm my god that tastes so good but that was buttery smoothie you guys i'm diving in for the second rip i'm not even gonna wait because i want that flavor oh my gosh you guys what a flavor this is so unique and cool at first it was that piney kush then it changed into like a sweetness and kind of a minty i'm back to the kush and now they're both kind of combining in my mouth oh my god i feel like i just had like an acoustic or something you guys no joke like what an accurate name oh my gosh that flavor and taste is so on point you guys i literally just want to eat this stuff all up so while i'm finishing this bowl which i can't wait to do i'm going to bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under a 25 times magnification lens so you can get a little bit of a better up close and personal view of this stuff so here it comes now all right so you are looking at the cush mints by pitchfork and wow you guys what interesting looking stuff you guys can see this stuff is absolutely as frosty as it gets covered with trichomes it's got those quintessential bright orange hairs perfectly interwoven throughout the buds all of that leaf material trimmed right up to the bud on this stuff and boy oh boy that perfect lime green coloration this stuff really does look nice all right you guys so you just saw it what did you guys think of it so here's my take they say good things come in small packages these are small little buds oh my gosh you guys i am gonna rave about this bud for a minute like the flavor and the potency like you guys see a big smile on my face like as i was just ripping i was just like enjoying it so much that i just kind of like got lost in the process of vaping it i just kept searching for that flavor and it's like it's just it's like a sweet kush like if you add kush but it was a little bit sweet and london mince is a great name for this stuff a tiny bit of the mint flavor you guys a tiny tiny bit but like i'm getting more of a sweetness that's coming from that um you know the cookie genetics that you know you would find in an animal mint or whatever and i will tell you guys that just the taste and potency those two alone are just absolutely unbelievable i love the effects this stuff is like very much a 50 50 hybrid but it's it's so heavy like this is not for a novice for sure you guys i can't believe this stuff is 35 bucks a day this is like this is what's so funny about this industry you guys there's these new brands and stuff that people don't know about like pitchfork that are coming up that like are putting out products like this that's like this is screaming more than half of the other stuff that we're paying 45 to 50 bucks for you guys so wow that's all i'm gonna say so i'm gonna give you guys my final rundown on this stuff i want to rate this stuff out of 10 and before i do that i'm gonna bring it up on the screen one last time for you guys to check out because i want to start by talking about the appearance of this stuff and give that my rating first before i break down the other category so here it is one last time okay so you've seen the cushman's by pitchfork multiple times let's talk about the look of it you guys like to me this stuff looks amazing it really really absolutely does there's no question about it but like would i say it's the best looking bud that i've ever seen no i'm not gonna say that and even though it's like insanely insanely crystally i mean [ __ ] you guys i was like wanting to give this a 2 out of 2.5 and basically everything that we're rating here is out of 10 okay i rate all of the strains out of 10. i have it broken down into four different categories the look the smell the taste and the potency or how effective the medicine is each of those categories gets two and a half out of the ten points again coming to a total of 10 points so in the look category i mean it's so frosty that it's like it's hard to say that it's not a 10. because it's like there really isn't anything wrong with it you guys i mean it's just the blood structure is not like my personal favorite i don't know that i would think it's like it's not what i think of when i think of what a 10 bud looks like but like how this was grown is a 10 and the way this butt looks is a 10. it's a 10 out of 10 on and for this but so you know what you guys i can't believe this holy [ __ ] i'm going to give this a 2.5 in the looks category this is actually crazy how this review is shaping up oh my god wow 2.5 out of 2.5 in the looks category the smell you guys it does have a good smell but it's not just screaming so i'm going to give it a 2 out of 2.5 it's really good it smells like just like sweet like push honestly you get like that kush piney flavor but it definitely has some sweetness there um so i'm going to go ahead and give it a 2 out of 2.5 there from a taste perspective absolutely 2.5 you guys i absolutely love the terpenes on list love the way that this stuff tastes and from a potency standpoint you guys i put this at a 2.5 and honestly i think it really does deserve a 2.5 i mean this stuff is potent it is like it's really really kicking um it's not the strongest stuff that i've ever had but like as an indica uh uh sativa hybrid it's a 50 50 balance here it's really kicking um i am getting kind of that like like i don't know how to describe it like a heady kind of like beanie on my head kind of like it's pressing pulsating on my head and i'm not a huge huge fan of that but the cerebral effects i really am a fan of so man maybe i'm gonna bring this down because yeah i i'm gonna bring the potency down to a two even though it probably deserves a 2.5 but you guys if you were doing the totals there that's the taste of the 2.5 but look at a 2.5 the smell of the two and the potency of the two this stuff is a nine i'm nine out of ten for the cush mints by pitchfork 35.08 they're giving this stuff away you guys they're giving it away and you know what's funny only the people who are buying mid-tier are getting the benefit of knowing about this brand or the people that come to our channel so how about that you guys wow talk about amazing 9 out of 10 for the cushman's by pitchfork you guys keep up the great work i cannot wait to try more pitchfork products they are on fire and they are screaming so with that being said we've got some great reviews lined up if you guys want to see anything reviewed definitely leave your comments below or find us on instagram and shoot us a comment or message over there um we are always looking to find the best quality medicine for you guys so if you guys have something you guys want to see reviewed definitely let me know as we are always on the lookout for the elusive tents i am looking for the tens but a nine is close and that is an a and we are stoked about this cushions by pitchfork so until the next one you guys you take care of yourselves and one another and i will see you guys soon peace [Music]", "z_5Ee9if-5s": "I've got another exotic strain today guys ever heard of mochi if you all don't know you're about to find out coming up [Music] hi I'm strings and this is trains the bay if you're new here I review strains around the Bay Area I also have a second channel where I pretty much do everything else which I'll link in the description down below if that sounds someone yeah if that sounds like something you'd be interested in which I'm sure it does consider subscribing and hitting that Bell button to be notified every time I release a video and our goal for every video is 15 likes but I think is very possible so you can go ahead and do that now or whenever you feel like it and hey at any point during the video check out my links and show notes in the description if you're looking for bonus pipes or any other accessories such as those you can check them off down there and I'll link them down there so go ahead and check those out thank you guys very much so mochi is actually coming from the cookie family lineage so you guys know that it's genetics are top-notch its parents are actually sunset sherbert which I did a review on and Thin Mint Girl Scout cookies if you guys didn't know about those those two are equally standalone strains cuz they're great on their own but combining them to just kind of unheard of it's it's almost unnecessary it's kind of crazy to be honest with you this train is an indica leaning hybrid so you got to keep that in mind when taking it in or smoking it because yeah it might slump you out and make you pretty stoned so if you're looking for something to pick you up and really motivate you and boost you for the day this is not that strain yeah and as you guys can see the buds are incredibly dense they're very beautiful and have great great awesome appearance as you guys can see there's a bit of a purple color to it as well there's Jade green flowers and really really bright red hairs so this is a good strain if you're really wanting it to treat moderate pain and stress relief um it really does give you calm and creative vibes so if you really want to chill out this is that strain for you mochi is also known as gelato 47 or more to gelato so if you guys see any of those names just know that it's the same thing it's mochi alright some of the effects you can be expecting to feel on mochi are to be sleepy to be relaxed to be happy to be hungry and to be tingly as well some medicinal benefits are to treat depression to treat insomnia nausea cramps and lack of appetite some negatives are dizziness drowsiness anxiety dry eyes and dry mouth so make sure not to smoke too much because like I said this is a really strong strain leaning towards the indica side so you don't really want to smoke too much and the flavors you can be expecting a taste are minty flowery and pungent alright guys it is about that time I'm about to grind this up so if you have any bongs pipes blonde spore joints or anything of that nature go ahead and pull that out so we can smoke together so let me just grind this up real quick and we can go ahead and do the smell test [Music] alright guys it's done grinding so I'm gonna give it a quick smell see how it is Wow goddamn that's encrypt well it's actually a bit flowery to be honest with you guys it's not super gassy but it's a different kind of a smell a little bit fruity to be honest with you guys as well so I'd say flowery and fruity but very very pungent it is a strong smell but Wow credibly nice Wow yeah nice he just smells like candy actually it smells like tropical starburst that's exactly what it smells like it smells like tropical starburst tropical skittles something like that 100% so go ahead and check this out this is great the smell man even though it's not a gassy smell like I said I really enjoy this one this is a 9 out of 10 seriously this is a really new interesting smell for me so tropical tropical fruit flavors that's exactly what I'm smelling this is great alright guys I'm just gonna pack my bowl and take this hit so you guys should already have yours out by now and if you don't hurry up and pull it out cuz I'm about to hit this in a second all right guys here you go as you can see a pretty decent sized bowl so this is what I'm gonna hit make sure you guys have yours out and let's do it together alright guys Cheers [Music] alright guys I'm gonna go ahead and start the timer right now and right off the bat it's a little minty and extremely flowery and like I said it did smell like tropical starburst but the taste is not there at all it's more flowery and minty like I said but it doesn't negate the fact that it does taste good it tastes incredibly good I'm gonna give this a taste of solid 8.5 out of 10 it's not gassy like the og like I really like but good flavor is good flavor so yeah more minty and flowery than gassy and fruity but if that's your preference man this is far for use okay it's great I can kind of feel the the indica effect starting to creep in getting harder to talk now my thoughts are getting a little bit more sedated it's getting harder to think and getting harder to put my words together so when we just relax for a second and which I can interview alright guys it's about two minutes and 30 seconds in and before I forget I just won't let you guys know I got this strain at Secret Circle this is one I did not have to pay for myself again so thank you very much Freddy for that I'm gonna link their stuff down below they are my favorite delivery service in the Fremont's last Union City area I've been going to them pretty recently within the past couple of months but I do go to them consistently and I do actually buy flour from them just not this particular one so thank you again Freddy if you want to check them out go ahead and check my link in the description below and you can go ahead and order from them if you are an MMJ patient in California all right guys it's about three minutes and 20 seconds in so far and I can noticeably say that my brain is fried it's getting really hard to think I've made several takes of several of these scenes already because I've just been messing up so yeah definitely this is not the strain to take if you have important events coming up if you have to do a speech if you have to be you know in tip-top condition when you're talking to people yeah this is not for you it's even just talking to myself is pretty hard and really good in the constraint I can kind of feel the relaxing effects on my body starting from my head down it's really heavy on the shoulders right now everything else is not too bad but just sink it into this chair definitely a really strong in the car so if that's your thing this is the stream for you all right guys it's about 4 minutes and 25 seconds in right now and I think I'm gonna cut it off the effects are still slowly creeping up although it did hit relatively fast it's still kind of creeping up so although the effects are fast hitting it still does creep up a bit so keep that in mind when you do take this train and don't take too much because like I said you don't want to get too high this is definitely stoning me out I hope you guys enjoyed this review if you did please like and share it with your friends and don't forget kids don't do drugs give it all to me oh and hey real quick before I forget guys I have free

"UomlGyAEOG0": "what's up everybody got a new review some lemon cookie lemon cookie i don't know if you guys can read that but looking so far so good got a nice gram got a good texture to it so yeah that's the lemon cookie all smells really good looks really good nice texture everything", "ar9KMP32Qww": "hey how you doing welcome to dan's buddha bodega where today we're going to review cushmits so let's just get right to it [Music] cushman's is an evenly balanced hybrid from ozone that crosses animal mints with bubba kush now bubba kush is a very famous strain and actually one of my favorite strains to have in rosin and now i've never had animal mints so now that that's out of the way let's take a quick peek now the odor of this flower is actually really faint but what is there is very earthy with just a little hint of of mint or berry on the end it's really nice and as far as looks go this actually looks a lot better than i was expecting it had real nice greens purples the orange hairs and lots and lots of keith okay we saw we smelled it let's go smoke it all right well here we go mastrovia slanted cheers salud okay so kind of an earthy herbal flavor right up front not too harsh on the exhale there's an oily mint taste it's not bad it's just unique actually actually it's not that bad i'm starting to get a little bit of of a head rush here what do you say we go ahead and give it a little bit of time for the effects to fully take hold they should have named this six flags mints because it is a roller coaster now let me explain in the beginning it starts with a very cerebral energy boost and about 20 minutes after that you peek and once you peek the sedating effects of the flowers start to kick in so from an energy boost to calming and euphoric to sleep actually i found myself many times reaching for this at bedtime making it perfect for people that are smoking to fight insomnia but if you're smoking to fight anxiety i would say steer clear from this one it has the potential to cause some serious panic but if you're a veteran smoker and looking for a wild ride please go out and try cushmance alright guys well that just about does it for me here i'd like to thank all my friends family subscribers viewers lovers haters uh commenters everybody that makes this so special thank you if you like the video please go ahead give it a thumbs up if you haven't

safe out there don't let it run a get you alright peace and love", "1JbzbVabvvM": "what up and welcome to another edition of canopedia where we are bringing you honest and unbiased cannabis strain reviews so today we are going to be reviewing animal mints by soul flower oh my gosh you guys that's trying to focus there it goes you guys now if you guys are like me have never tried animal mints let's go ahead and talk about it this is a hybrid strain that is a cross between thin mint girl scout cookies animal mints um uh and excuse me animal cookies and possibly some blue power in there some people believe this also could just be a thin mint girl scout cookies with some uh fire og in there but like to be honest i'm actually guessing that this the first thing that i thought even before i started researching the strain itself was a thin mint girl scout cookies with um with um and uh you know an animal um animal candy or animal cookies you know whatever it was you know there's there's a bunch of different animal strains but uh that was what i first thought it was but anyways um before i get into this review i'm gonna bring it up on the screen for you guys to check out then we're gonna take a look at it together okay so you guys just had a chance to check it out and you know what i'm curious about from you guys is what do you guys think of it so let's go ahead and talk about it so if you checked out my last video i talked about my experience at soul flower and honestly if you haven't seen it yet go back and watch that video because i went ballistic i don't think i've ever gone ballistic in a video like that but i was sharing my experience at that dispensary and how i had the bait and switch you know switcheroo pulled on me and i got sold as my free uh you know buy one get one my first time patient this animal mints in their gold category it's 30 bucks an eighth you guys that means they're not even 10 bucks a gram uh maybe 10 you know if you're rounding up with tax or whatever um but you know they have silver gold platinum and diamond here so this is the second tier you guys so we can't expect this to be you know absolutely out of control to be honest i'll be surprised if it is but you know what you guys i have been surprised by some 35 ace that i have seen that is for darn sure so 30 is not far behind let's see how this stuff stacks up you guys um you know i i know based on the look of it you guys kind of know what's coming but i still want to get into this review so you guys let's go ahead and talk about this stuff so you know in my opinion i mean let me just pull some of this bud out here you guys because it's a little bit it's a little tough to see um it's a little tough to see here so you guys like it's not the worst looking bud i've ever seen at all not by any means or any stretch of the imagination and here's one of the buds that actually was in the picture there that you guys were looking at just so you guys can see what i'm looking at i hope this focuses i know i don't have like some fancy phone you guys were doing this budget style on the old iphone you know so um anyways you guys it's like it's not bad looking stuff it's it's just really dense it's you know kind of like a like a darker green honestly and you know i'll tell you guys that like to me personally it's like it's not like i can rant on it super hard but it's like i'm kind of wondering like where are the trichomes you guys it's not really crystally and i mean i can tell this stuff was just run through a machine i mean uh and when i say a machine like an auto trim machine they just put the butt in there and it just chops off the leaves you know and again it's not the worst but it's like there's nothing to write home about nothing special and straight out of the jar the smell is like real subtle you guys like i had to kind of chop one of those nugs up till i got some of the um you know flavor to come out and it's kind of like a minty flavor this like a sweet minty is the flavor that i'm getting but you know um that's that's what my take is on it and this stuff rip it's like it's a little bit malleable i guess from a freshness perspective it's not horrible so it's not like just absolutely crumbling into little pieces you know but i'm still excited to try it i haven't tried this strain and i'm not sure this is going to do it justice you know just based on the fact that there's a gold tier flower but i'm certainly still going to be optimistic about this stuff you guys so today i'm going to be enjoying this animal mince hopefully enjoying this animal mints out of my arizer extreme q desktop vaporizer got this bad boy set to 375 degrees fahrenheit there i'm going to take the male end with the screens in it that one is going to go into the vape itself the other male end without the screens it's going to go straight here into my scientific inhalations triple filtered bubbler i left the first chamber empty which actually sits in the down stem there um where carbon goes that would catch ash that would get in the second chamber which is basically just my purified water so i've got some brand new purified water i just cleaned the piece i've got a brand new organic cotton filter in the third filtration stage there that'll filter out any remaining impurities that were left in this bud here so let's go ahead we'll jump right into it this is the animal cookies by soul flower if you guys are ready let's fire them up all right you guys so i had a little tingle in my throat i didn't like that honestly when it first went back it was not as smooth as it should have been um very generic tasting kind of like earthy minty earthy okay you guys so yeah the flavor for me i'm just not digging it it's not smooth it's not smooth out of the vape honestly it's like a little bit minty like kind of earthy um i'm just not digging it honestly you guys so i'm like i'm hoping this develops and it gets better through the process i'm honestly not optimistic it's kind of reason i don't buy this type of flower i'm still upset that they bait and switch me on this stuff but anyways you guys i'm still going to finish this bowl i want to see how this stuff progresses and while i'm doing that i'm going to bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under 25 times magnification macro lens so here it comes right now all right so you are looking at the animal mints by soul flower and you guys this stuff is really dense it is just packed like a little marble and it's got that real typical dark lime green color or i should just say dark green color with some nice bright orange hairs there that really hug tightly up against the bud they're not super thick not super thin but like where are the trichomes you guys this bud basically has little to no trichomes at all even under the magnification of this macro lens so yeah from my personal opinion i don't think this is the best looking bud or even anything close i mean it's it's really got a lot of uh room left for improvement in my opinion from this animal mints okay so you guys just had a chance to check out this animal mince by soul flower so you guys what did you guys think of this under the magnification of that macro lens i mean you know to me it's not like this is awful looking bud there's no question about it it's not awful but it's certainly not that great you know all things considered um you know and that's you know what we're going based off of and there's a lot of stuff i want to talk to you guys about with this strain i just finished puffing it and i really i want to go through this with you guys um because i think we got a lot to talk about so um how i do these reviews you guys is i rate all of these strains out of ten okay i break that down into four different categories the categories are look smell taste and potency or the uh you know effect or how effective this medicine is so um let's go ahead and i'm gonna talk about the looks um first and in each of these categories you guys they can basically earn up to 2.5 points each in their respective categories you know hopefully adding up to 10 points so since i want to start by talking about the looks uh or the back appeal of this stuff first i'm going to go ahead i'm going to bring it up on the screen one last time and then we'll go ahead and i'll give you guys my final rundown on this stuff okay you guys you've seen it now multiple times it's fresh in your mind let's go ahead and talk about the looks of it you guys i've been going back and forth i'm between like a one and one and a half you guys the thing is i'm gonna give this a one and the reason is because first of all i'm pretty damn positive this stuff was just machine run bulk grown probably outdoor grown honestly um you know greenhouse at best you know i don't even think i just think this might have been just outdoor honestly um you know it really it doesn't have a lot of like redeeming qualities because it doesn't have thc crystals you guys i mean we looked at it under the magnification of the macro lens and there's very few thc crystals so i'm only gonna give it a one in the looks department you guys um and in the smell department i'm also going to give it a 1 out of 2.5 i mean when you open this there is barely hardly any smell at all like when i broke it up i mean it's there is a faint smell and it smells like kind of minty but like when you break it up there is a smell so like i'm gonna give it a one it smells again kind of just like you know a thin girl scout cookie is what it kind of smells like um now the taste i'm also gonna give it a one you guys it wasn't the worst i've ever smoked but oh my gosh i really to be honest you guys i didn't enjoy smoking this stuff myself personally um you know i'm gonna i'm gonna honestly that that's what i i think a one is more than fair in the looks uh excuse me in the taste department so that's only a three right now out of ten you guys um in the potency you guys man i was gonna give this a 1.5 but i truthfully i feel like this stuff is just like you know kind of come on quick just fade i mean it's it's not even like i'm not really getting a lot of medicinal effects other than just kind of a haze and this isn't like a good clean it doesn't feel clean honestly i don't feel like i don't really i just i don't like this um the strain i mean this is coming on to me like a hybrid um [Music] pretty balanced but like i don't like i just don't i just don't overall like the way that it's it's making me feel i mean and i you know um i i gotta tell you guys i mean you know in the potency i'm gonna give it a one there's only a four out of 10 you guys and honestly you know i think a 4 out of 10 is is really probably what this stuff deserves maybe a 5 out of 10. you know but i'm not being generous anymore with these strains you guys i mean a 4 out of 10 is probably what this stuff deserves i mean at 120 bucks a half i mean i know there's other half ounces that you can pick up for 120 bucks i mean um that are way better than this you guys so you know 30 bucks an eighth really isn't much of a deal uh at all i mean spend the extra 10 or 15 bucks you know and get a better sack i mean so you know to me we're not going to recommend this at all absolutely not um if you guys want to see what my experience was at seoul flower why i ended up with this freaking boof uh snickel please watch my last video on the orange sherbet strain review from soul flower and it'll explain a lot you guys but yeah not pleased with uh soul flower um and that has nothing to do with this strain that they're reviewing uh that i'm reviewing you guys so my experience in the dispensary has nothing to do like i said at the beginning of this video these are unbiased honest reviews you know so uh you know i went i had to per make a purchase to get this stuff so it wasn't like this stuff was it was uh you know completely free you know first night vision buy one get one you still have to buy something to get something so you know it's not like it's free uh in the grand scheme of things you're still paying for something to get something else you know so um you know for me i man i don't know i don't have a lot of good things to say right now this stuff really just missed on all cylinders in my opinion it's going to get a 4 out of 10 animal mints from soulflower but thank you guys so much for tuning in let me know if you guys have ever tried out this animal mince and obviously you guys i know there's other better animal mints who are some of the growers of this strain that you guys think i should try out because i would love to try them out and compare it to this stuff you guys so until the next one you guys take care of yourselves and one another and i will see you guys soon peace", "N3hBwjUedTY": "[Music] hey lehmans welcome back to another video of mine so recently i was thinking about my past when i used to trade a lot on the game and i was very obsessed with items on animal jam more specifically the beta or rare items on the game such as raccoon tails dj headsets aviator hats royal tiaras archer hats and more all of these items i listed have some sort of value on the game and that's because of how they are labeled as rare items they are labeled rare because they have been on the game for a few years without coming back to the stores items in the store are just not as good as betas or rares that's for sure and this is also why people are always trading they love trying to get all these super good rare items and i'm going to talk about the rarity system and why people care so much about it and things about why we're so invested in trading and beta knowledge but before we begin i wanted to mention my giveaway i'm hosting for pink bowtie and animal jam mobile it will end when i reach 13 000 subscribers and its giveaway video link is down below in my description and in the pinned comments section good luck if you participate and now let's get back to the main topic i'm liam puppy subscribe if you haven't already and let's get started with the video so obviously it's known that we all love our rares and betas in animal jam it's one of the most known things in the game after all i think that it honestly makes up a lot of our community and people it can be good and bad at the same time i always see people that are really upset because they don't have rare items and so they go on to hate people with rare items say things like how they're always terrible people which is farther from the truth of course we always get the oddball beta person that may be considered rude but that doesn't all of a sudden make all the rare beta people bad jammers also there's another way of thinking as well that rare people will dislike unrare people because they are simply not good enough or whatever they try to use as their excuses this is so mean and i honestly hate the fact some people judge others because of their rarity and beta level on the game it's wrong and you really shouldn't you could be missing out on an awesome friend or buddy so with this all out of the way let's talk about why we care so much about the rare and beta items in animal jam the reason why is because the items are generally uncommon and hard to find not just everybody can get these items and that's why so many people want these items basically people will try to have what they can't have and that's the main reason why they are considered to be such desirable items they have left the stores a very long time ago and will likely not return anytime soon this really makes them unique and uncommon compared to many other items on the game that's why jammers are always wanting them and trading for them why they are always such a big topic and discussion with other players on the game it honestly seems like a major part of the game resolves around the trading and rarity system alone which is really wild to think about also jammers want to have rares and bettas because it makes them feel good there is some sort of an acknowledgement from jammer to jammer when you have rare items on your animal or your trade list people definitely see you in a different or whole new way depending on how rare you are that is which again is questionable whether that's a good thing or not but you can't argue with the truth it's just how people are in the game so of course a lot of jammers would prefer to have betas over not having any it's just the nature of logic for the game when i started getting into trading for the very first time i immediately wanted to have whatever was good at my rarity level which was the arctic wolf spikes from treasure hunt or the sheep ram horns yeah that was considered rare to me we all start from somewhere just keep on trading and jamming on anyways many people love having bettas and rares so they can wear them around on the game and sorta flex i guess that or they really just like the items and feel proud of their accomplishments i mean it's okay to want to show off i don't see that as a bad thing at all whenever i get a new item i always wear it in hopes people will see me wearing it and think it was cool i think that people automatically think that when you want to show off an item that it's bad or terrible thing which is so untrue just wear it and feel good about yourself ever since i got into trading i was very involved in the trading and rarity system in general i always wanted to know everything and what everything was worth and what trades were under fair over for my items it was just super important to me at the time it still is to me to this day just not as extreme as before i could help others whenever they asked me what trades were fair for their stuff or what their items were in other items basically i was pretty helpful to the community for a long while i think so at least as that's what i was really known for back in the day now i just make videos which i honestly prefer way more trading got pretty stressful at times but i still look back and miss some good trading memories i mean i always like to talk about my past on the game i am right now so you would come to assume i do miss trading and investing my time to the rarity system it was always just super fun to learn about items that were very rare in the game or some new glitched item that was accidentally brought into the game that like only has a few variants to one variant or drama about how an item was brought back into the game in some weird way it was really scary for sure but exciting too it's just kind of interesting i guess i don't see trading or taking time to learn about the rarity system as a bad thing at all so if you're a part of the community for that then keep on having fun trading and collecting rares and if you're new to the game then i highly suggest trying to trade for rares and betas start learning about items and what they are worth and just have fun jamming on animal jam when it comes down to it anyways that's all i had to say for this video i hope i informed you of the rarity system or trading aspects that you didn't already know or just entertained you to say the least comment down below things that you love or dislike about the rarity system and its community on animal jam it's been lima puppy thanks for watching subscribe if you haven't already and i'll see you all next time [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "sIef1QWnbYg": "hey guys it's soda here and welcome back to another video someone's very happy today aren't you big man you're a big man really oh okay today i'm going to be answering some paint related questions i asked you guys to give me some pet related questions on the community tab and i'm going to be answering them today i get a lot of questions asked to me like over and over again so it'll be a good idea just to make a video where i can answer some frequently asked questions from you guys and the birds are out yuki's in a very talkative mood at the moment he likes being in front of the camera so pretty boy pretty boy oh my goodness this is gonna be fun one of the most common questions that i do get asked a lot on a lot of my videos is how i deal with having birds as well as like my anime figure collection because right beside my birdcage and people always like oh be careful they're gonna destroy your figures even like one of us got yuki everyone was telling me to move the figures because the birds will destroy them but actually um my birds don't touch my anime figures at all they never go near them i don't know if i just got lucky and my birds don't care about my anime figures but they just don't on like the rare occasion where i've seen one of the birds like going close to that mma figures i just move them away it's really hard i don't know why i get a lot of comments about that but the only thing is that my anime figures do get covered in like bird dust because cockatiel is a very dusty bird so they leave this kind of layer of like bird dust everywhere so i do have to dust my anime figures kind of often but that's about it it's not really too bad i definitely will one day get a glass case for my anime figures now the question they commonly ask is what i do about the birds pooping everywhere basically the secret to that is um you let them poop everywhere you can't really stop a bird from pooping they poop every like 10 to 15 minutes um that's just what they do i mean i've heard of people training their birds to poop in certain areas like pooping in their cage only i don't know how easy it is to do that and i don't really care i don't really mind just cleaning up their poop it's very easy their food was very small thankfully you know bird poop has never grossed me out so to me it's very easy to clean it the annoying thing is when they poop on my keyboard yuki really likes my keyboard so you will often feed them that that is a bit of a pain to clean up it's just poop it's just part of owning birds why you always have wet wipes the best way to get rid of poop are you ever considering getting rabbits or guinea pigs i talked about this a bit in my pets i don't want to own video i've never really considered getting rabbits and kidney pigs and i don't think i ever would i mean them could change in the future i know my boyfriend really likes rabbits so rabbits could be an option very later on one day my own house i would probably rather have rats than rabbits and guinea pigs yeah i do love them it's just not something that i'm you know thinking of owning uh soon i wasn't a good fish you got from trademe doing i do get asked this a lot too even though i've talked about this in other videos but yes they're doing great they're in this tank behind me um you can see one of them yeah they seem really happy one of them is actually turning like gold they both used to be white and now one of them is oh my gosh one of them is turning like orange which is really cool so yeah they seem really happy and i'm really glad that i rescued them because they're living their best life in that big tank over there and it's nice to go together with some friends too does tofu love yuki do they like to sing together do they ever fight yes tofu and yuki get along very well they are both boys thankfully they seem to really like each other um the thing is tofu is a lot less pain than new years because tofu is a rescue so yuki is very close to me and comfortable with me and tofu likes to kind of watch him like asia before tofu was sitting on my chair while yuki was sitting on me and tofu was it in my head but tofu isn't very comfortable with me touching him too much so he just kind of watches but he loves to follow yuki around um they always are like in the same areas it's really cute and yes tofu has learned all of yuki's song so now they sing together and it's so adorable tofu never really used to sing any songs so now that he lives with another boy that also loves to sing he has learned all those songs that's really cute sorry if you can hear the uh profile by the way it's because the birds are flying around so that starts to get a bit loud i know they've never fought before i don't think it's very common for cockatiels to actually fight each other usually there's a reason to why cocktails fight like they're in a too small of a cage or they're fighting over something like food or something like that um usually they get along very well other cockatiels so they've been fought before thankfully you know i was a bit worried about that because tofu is you know a bit different to yuki but no that's never happened before which is really good none of my deals have ever fought before so also ren doesn't get along well with everyone too the same with brenda she doesn't really uh go close to me so she's not often like seen in my videos because she is she's up high somewhere like just sitting there she's very very shy so there has been times when she lets me like scratch her little head but that's very real when she does that because she's extremely shy but she does get along with everyone she lets tofu preen her which is really cute sometimes uh tofu and rin get a little freaky with each other uh so that's interesting and then yuki just watches them and anyways let's move on how did you get your dog to get along with your birds i want to get a dog but i'm scared to this dog will eat my birds i'm not really sure what you mean because my dog does not really get along with my birds i don't put them in the same room together ever because dogs are printed animals birds of prey animals they're not supposed to grow together so i've never put them together before i don't ever plan to put them together and i don't recommend you ever do that because there's a huge risk involved i only let the dogs in here when the birds are in their cage and vice versa so no they don't get along because i never put them together and i never will because i don't want anything out of my birds you know there has been rare occasions you might see online of like a dog and a bird getting along together it's still very risky and i still don't recommend it you know it's just they're totally different animals they can't naturally communicate with each other so it's just not natural and it's just very rusty how old are cockatiels and where did you get them so yuki must be about a year and almost a half old i'd say yeah he's probably a year and a half old same with ren they were born very similar times you can rent both from a breeder here in christchurch who hand raises cockatiels so they are both hand-raised even though they're very different as for tofu tofu was actually given to my boyfriend for free because the original owner did not want him anymore so yeah we got tofu for free uh trophy was very chaotic when my boyfriend first got him he was very bitey he would attack your fingers and bite really hard and he would scream the previous owner had very young kids which we think that maybe the kids tried to like grab him all the time and stuff because he was terrified of hands um but now tofu is a much better behaved bird he still has his moments and he still has weird obsession with mirror things because he used to have a mirror in his previous owner's cage which mirrors are very bad for birds that can cause a lot of behavioral issues and unfortunately he does have an issue with mirrors obviously we don't keep any mirrors in the bird cage but if he sees anything that has a reflection in it he will obsess over it even like the um the locks on the cage because they're reflective he can see his reflection in it so he sometimes resists over those which is really sad um and shows you what a big impact mirror toys can make and why they should not be sold as bow toys because they're actually very harmful but he's actually getting over that and he's getting a lot better so very proud of that little guy also i think tofu is about four years old and three four he is a bit older than the other two so mostly this is questions about my birds people love the birds so i guess this is kind of more like a bird q a when are you posting coca-cola care i've already done it go watch it okay i got a lot of questions asking me how much money i spend on like animal food how much i spend a week or a month and stuff like that the thing is i don't really i don't really keep track of that to be quite honest so i'm just gonna kind of guess but i don't really spend as much as you might think because i buy pretty much all my animal food in like big amounts so for birds i buy huge bags of pellets and seed and that will last me like months so i don't often have to buy any food for them for vegetables i get vegetables from my parents garden my same thing i buy big packs of mouse food like every few months dogs i buy like a big pack of dog food every month fish food lasts like months as well i just buy a lot of blood worms at one time or a lot of whatever i'm going to feed them you know it doesn't cost me that much money if you buy things from bulk which will cost more at the time you end up saving a lot of money so yeah i don't really know what to say to that because i don't really know how much i spend in a month because it just depends it's not an exact amount you know obviously i still buy like new toys for them probably every month for all my animals so it just totally depends are you planning on getting another mouse this is another question i've been asked a lot so in case you didn't know my mouse cornflake passed away recently a few weeks ago so i just have two female mice now and honestly i don't know all my passing away was really sudden and heartbreaking and the girls are over a year old now so they don't have much longer either so it's it's really hard you know i i don't know i don't know if i want to keep having mice just because of their short life spans obviously i don't want one of my girls to pass away and then one be alone so i'm not sure what i'll do when that happens i don't know it's it's it's hard to own small animals that don't have long lifespans and i don't really know if i'm gonna be able to handle that to be honest so who knows what is your process of cleaning those huge fish tanks and did any of your birds ever break a blood further well in your care and if they did how did you go about handling it cleaning fish tanks is probably like the easiest thing to do honestly it's like the easiest enclosure i have to clean very it takes like a long time especially when you have multiple tanks but it's fairly easy there's not really much difference in cleaning a big tank than there is cleaning a small tank in fact cleaning big tanks is actually easier i just use a siphon to change the water i scrub any alley off with any in there add fresh water at prime you know check the parameters if something is off and yeah clean the filter like every month or every two months um with the blood for the question i have had yuki break a blood feather a couple of times when i first got yuki he was very clumsy for like quite a while cockatiels can be known for being quite clumsy all the time when they're young he had a lot of knife rights when i first got him um which is what birds can get where they just something scares them at night and they just you know flap around like crazy in their cage and often they can hurt themselves doing that so it's quite scary i do sleep in the same room as my birds so if i hear them having a night before i quickly turn my light on make sure they're okay it doesn't happen as much anymore but it used to happen a lot with vikki and yes a couple times he did break a blood feather in case you don't know birds uh when they're molting they often can accidentally break blood feathers which can bleed a lot and if left untreated can sometimes not often but sometimes they can bleed so much that they die because they don't have a lot of blood it's not super common for that to happen um but it is still a possibility so it's a wee bit scary i was already aware of what blood fillers were when yuhi first got his one but i still was kind of like freaking out about it and was like really worried so i did take him to the vet to get it removed because that's the best thing you can do is remove it so it stops bleeding because it's best to remove them if you leave them sometimes they can hurt it even more second time it happened i put a like flower on the feather to make it stop bleeding but then he broke it like again so i got my dad to remove it for me but yeah it happens to like every bird owner but yeah it's always a bit of a scare when your bird is like bleeding that happens to you uh and you're worried put some flour on their wound maybe take them to the vet to get them to remove the blood feather or you can carefully do it yourself but i'm always a bit scared of doing myself so i get my dad to do it would you ever get in the dog in the future if so what breed i'd definitely love to get another dog one day it probably would be a while away when i have my own house but i would say i definitely would because i love dogs i'd probably like to get another long hair choreo because i love chihuahuas i would love to get a rescue one one day there's a really good trial rescue in my ear that i've been following for a long time so in the future one day it would be nice to get a little rescue to a while i think that would be pretty cool anyways guys i'm getting this video here obviously i couldn't answer every question but thanks for watching this video thanks for giving me some questions to answer i'll see

placing here back with another video today is going to be a strain review and for review today we actually have some wedding cake so without further ado as you guys can see I'm in nature here actually just in a little forest near my house so hopefully you guys enjoyed the scenery today but anyways let's get right into the review it is wedding cake so obviously we're gonna give you the genetics of wedding cake which is Girl Scout cookies crossed with a cherry pie so that's what makes a wedding cake and let's jump right into this review basically wedding cake was bred by cookie fam genetics they bred all those famous hype strains like Girl Scout cookies gelato and a bunch of other stuff so yeah without further ado I can't give you guys the looks of these buds because I don't have a nut I will show a lot of pictures at the end of the video so I'll give you the smell of this wedding cake which is something very very unique it has like a very just dank doughy vanilla cookie scent in my opinion it's like really really really good it's very hard to describe when you crack open the jar it's kind of like a doughy vanilla just dank muskiness that just hits your nose it almost smells like when you're baking cookies or like croissants or something like it's really crazy but yeah so I'm gonna give you guys basically the looks on the looks of these buds were just dense frosty just rock-hard just amazing beautiful nugs I'm gonna show you guys all the screen shot at the end of the video a quick tip for you guys if you guys want to learn how to light a joint properly this is my way of doing it you obviously want to get the end lit get a cherry going and then just spark it up all right so as you guys can see this joint is burning nice and white the ash this cannabis was flushed very well the grower is actually fat farm craft cannabis Co I'll put the link in the description and you guys can check out his Instagram an amazing amazing grower he actually grew this zombie curse that I reviewed not too long ago but let's get back to the review for the wedding cake so as soon as you pull this it has like thick dense milky smoke but the flavor is like I said it's a doughy vanilla kind of cushiness like it's it's very unique I've never had a strain that tastes like this or smells like this it almost has like like a baked goods kind of reminiscent taste that just coats your mouth like I said very vanilla a very musky dankey cookie just overall an amazing amazing strain another thing I want to let you guys know as you guys can see I'm wearing my portugal jersey let me know who you guys are going for in the World Cup it's been an amazing tournament so far and I can't wait to see who wins I have a feeling it's gonna be an underdog team but we'll see but yeah good luck to your team in World Cup as well let me know who you guys are cheering for in the comments as you guys can see nice white ash beautiful color nice resin ring going right around the joint it won't be able to focus sorry guys I'm using the front-facing camera I actually have my phone lodged on a like a broken tree branch right now so that's how I'm filming this going woo but for the effects of wedding-cake it is a very very very nice hybrid strain it's an indica dominant hybrid I would probably say an 80/20 75 15 or 75 25 kind of like something like that very very heavy just hit you right behind the eyes you just start getting very relaxed and mellow and just stress-free and it's just an amazing amazing full body relaxation no pain in your body like I said if you had any depression or anxiety it would just completely wipe it away and just coat you with an amazing feeling of just being uplifted and happy and just in a good mood and like you know an overall good enjoyable high but at the same time like you're stoned - it's really nice Wow another person's walking by right now so just might see a dog or something in the video yeah I'm kind of in like it's kind of like a ravine kind of path or bike path kind of thing it's not really like a forest or like a park it's kind of a weird area but either way who gives a [ __ ] I'm just smoking a joint anyways if you guys didn't know kind of Canada actually legalized cannabis and it's going to be coming October 17 2018 so go canada baby so I'm gonna get into the ratings out of ten for this wedding cake for the looks out of ten this is a very very nice-looking bud big frosty dense nugs I would have to say out of ten I would say in 8.5 out of 10 very beautiful nugs frosty dense smelly sticky so that's for the looks the smell the smell is also an eight and a half out of ten it's not the best smelling strain in the world but it's very unique and it's almost kind of like one of those dessert kind of strains that you smoke after dinner right before you hit bed or you know just when you're chilling watching a movie it's kind of like a treat when you smoke a joint of wedding cake like how it makes you feel it's so amazing so that's for the looks for the smell is also an 8.5 out of 10 look smell taste the taste comes through exactly like the smell it has that vanilla doughy cushion muskiness that just coats your mouth and just sits there I would have to say it's pretty unique there's not a lot of strains that taste like this there's a few maybe cookie strains that might have that dough anus in there so for the taste I would also have to give it an 8.5 out of 10 what else can I say look smell taste the effects the effects of wedding cake are in my opinion really really really good for an indica dominant hybrid it's exactly what I want I'm clear-headed I'm able to speak properly without stuttering without feeling foggy but at the same time I'm very relaxed and like very stoned and you know very mellow right so it's an amazing feeling I don't think you can really get better than that for indica hybrid effects in my opinion a great daytime smoke and nighttime smoke whenever you want you can even wake and bake if you actually want to I won't really put you right to bed but yeah overall for wedding cake I'm gonna have to give it a solid 8.5 out of 10 it's just that a really well-balanced strain it hits all the marks looks smell tasting effects it's really dank you know the Terps are there so in my opinion it's a very solid strain make sure you guys can get a verified cut of wedding cake if you guys are looking to pick this up so yeah this has been I'm always blazing's review of wedding cake hopefully you guys enjoyed it and I'll see you guys in the next video have a bake day guys [Music] [Music]", "-DSDahD3fMo": "[Music] look what I've got here this is a butt of something called cush mints and we tried other Cushman's from other cultivators but this one is from ember Valley and it was recommended so we're all excited to try it this flower you can see it comes in this jar and it says ember Valley Cushman's indica flower and this flower has 24 percent THC and today we're going to try it out of paper cup and you can see I've got vapor Cup set to 330 we have vapor and the strong and we're really looking for the best and the best is the perma-grin smile the flower that makes you smiling you just can't even take it and I call that the something-something so let's see if Cushman's has two something-something so this flower was a super enjoyable vape super enjoyable it really has light to almost no taste it's one of those crazy flowers has no taste but it's just so powdery light and it just keeps going and going and going and my notes I wrote down great bait and it is a great favor but we're looking for the best and the best is the best something-something so what did I think of Cushman's I'm giving this flower an 8.5 it was good in every way but for me it just didn't have the euphoria and that's what it's about we're looking for the grinning happy unbelievably hard to find flower and Cushman's by ember valley is 8.5 it's a really good flower and if you want to try it try it I think this is a good flower this is a doctor if you want to see vapor cuff you can see that vapor Cup calm this thing is through the roof good I'm telling you if you need a vaporizer if you're tired of smoking you're gonna see there's wheat savings with this thing it doesn't stink up your place it's really something if you like the videos please subscribe if you

with another review um we're looking at another one again by quest really really like this company i'm excited to try all their strains um so this one is cushman's and so this one is sitting at 28.3 thc i think this is one of the highest thc flowers i've ever bought from the uh from the lp market i mean i'm sure it is yeah 28.3 thc super super high and it's sitting at point zero six percent cbd um so again quest singular focus is to deliver their customers cannabis experiences beyond the ordinary quest in my opinion is the leader in exotic strange with citizen stash engage uh close behind the hush mints is a high thc hybrid that is a 50 50 split of indica sativa cushman's is bred by crossing bubba kush and animal mints cush mints is a strain for those who enjoy a minty flavor with incredibly strong mouth coating taste of creamy kush and gas quest is a small batch high grade cultivator they hand trim and hang dry their plants all plants are nourished by glacial water which runs naturally through their cannabis estate the glacial water happens to be perfectly ph balanced to the level cannabis thrives on the quest is located in creston valley in the kootenai region of british columbia and if you're looking to invest in quests they are under the parent company decibel cannabis company which we'll have on the screen okay so let's have a look at here this one was packaged on july 16th so really really fresh okay cushman's this one was sold out in most of the stores around town so i had to drive through a different town to get to get it actually i'm gonna stop harping on it but once again um quest just get rid of the box um not for me for the future uh let's have a look at this here from what i've been told this is very uh aromatic so expecting to smell it like as soon as i crack the seal yep you can smell it right away very pungent again uh integra boost pack which is really cool good job on quest for doing that wow uh yeah yeah very pungent um so we'll get you guys a good look at that okay now that we've learned a little bit about um cushman spike quest the last thing i need to do is test it out for a rating so i'll go do that and i'll be right back [Music] [Music] all right guys after testing out the cushman spy quest really impressed with this one as well this company is uh really doing really well um super impressed uh so on this one here um super high thc so it was a very hard hitter it was very smooth for how uh how high uh thc content it is 28 uh the burn on it was good really good effects really good taste it was nice and sticky the only knock on it if there if there was one was the the ash wasn't super white or anything like that but uh it burned really well so i'm gonna rate this i'm actually gonna rate this one in nine point four out of ten really well done uh until next time guys", "RFla0p-aqiI": "[Music] look what I've got here this is a big butt of something called cush mints and almost the whole bag was this one giant bud and we're so excited to be reviewing flowers again in 2020 and this is actually the first review of 2020 I took off around 2 weeks to let my body dry out I've been using a lot of flour lately and if you use too much flour it doesn't work the same so today we're getting back in and we're gonna start off with cush mints and you can see this flour comes in this bag and you can see it says cush mints and it says mints here it's got a little security seal of authenticity here and this flower has 34 percent THC whoo ha that's a lot and you can see what also makes this unique as it says C junkie genetics and also down here on the bottom it says cookies California so this is going through cookies in some way we're not really sure how but we're going to try it out today and we're going to figure out if cush mints has the game so you can see I've got paper cup to set to 3:30 and I've got vaping the straw so let's check it out cush mints have a paper cup at 330 degrees Wow so this flower has a weedy taste with a little bit of OG in it and og if you don't know it's kind of a pungent taste so this is a weedy light og taste this super smooth and it's a great vape but we're looking for the best and the best is the best something-something does Cushman's have the best something-something I tried this flower and I tried it over and over again because it was almost there I'm giving this flower and 875 it didn't hit the 9 and the 9 is really hard to get much tri flower this is a good flower if you like cookie strains and you want to try a unique one Cushman's might do it for you but for me this flowers in 875 it's a good one thanks for joining in the front made 2020 the best flowers ever if you want to see vapour cup you can see that vapor cup calm I'm telling you this thing is a weed changing experience you can just taste everything so well it's so smooth it's just wonderful if you want to see the top 30 flowers I just posted the top actually 22 flowers video and you can

if you like the videos thanks for joining in and please subscribe this is a doctor party all my friends [Music]", "UKeVf5n-yTY": "[Music] what's up you guys it's valuable on the perfume down and i'm back with a very very exciting video i am so excited to bring you guys this reveal today is national fragrance day as you know i have some other things going on like a giveaway on my channel but i'm really excited to bring to you guys this exclusive we're not exclusive but like a new scent from our favorite bath and body works i'm super excited you guys are gonna love it i can't wait for you to rush to the store to actually smell it for yourself the weather is warming up and this is the perfect time to release this entire fragrance line like i'm super excited so we're just gonna get right into it we're gonna go through everything i've got my yellow and my orange one because i feel like it's appropriate for this fragrance and let's get right into it so the name of this fragrance is sunshine mimosa now i do believe they had other fragrances in the past maybe like a lotion and a fragrance mist that have this name however this is an entire line this is like an entire line my dude and i know i just know that you guys are gonna love it especially this is for my bubbly citrus people okay so let's go through the notes that it actually says so it states that it has bright bubbly champagne and fresh citrus and i have to say that's exactly what it smells like sorry for the background noise i am outside the weather again is really warming up so i wanted to get outside and i think it's appropriate for this fragrance because this is definitely again a bubbly fun sunshine fragrance we're gonna get some leaves on these trees soon and this would be perfect okay so back into the actual line so they have everything so i'll just go through and show you guys what they have they have a fragrance mist of course i think the packaging is so beautiful it looks like sunshine it looks like a sunrise or a sunset and then it has like three sparkly um like almost i think it's like silver or gold specks on it along with an actual like a sun burst on it so that's so beautiful i don't know if you guys know but orange is like one of my favorite colors orange and yellow so when i received this i was like literally screaming because i love orange so we have our fine fragrance mist love that of course you can like douse yourself in that it's really great for the summer when you don't want something to be super strong but along with that we get a full fragrance an actual perfume which i'm really excited the size is a one point seven fluid ounce this is the uh de parfum and it is in the same scene it says again bright bubbly champagne fresh citrus really really love that again the packaging is just so freaking beautiful look at that it's gorgeous it's like an iridescent orange kind of a color for the top but overall just freaking stunning okay the next thing that we have is a body scrub i did utilize most of these products i did use the perfume and the fragrance mist today and then i also used the foaming sugar body scrub in the shower oh my gosh i really really liked it but we'll go through that a little bit more individually and then they also have a body cream i usually like a body cream over a body lotion especially for the winter but since it is warming up they also of course do have a body lotion which is definitely hydrating as well so again everything in the same scent but they have a body cream if you prefer the cream or the lotion if you prefer the lotion a lot of people like to go with the lotion in the spring summer because they don't want something that's super thick even though i feel like their creams are really good for like keeping hydrated but then also dissolving into the skin really quickly so either one works perfect today i also utilize the moisturizing body wash which i really like i'm all about hydration as you know the moisturizing body washes have cocoa butter they have shea butter um they also have coconut oil so if you really really want some creamy lather instant hydration then definitely go with the moisturizing body wash if you like the regular shower gel of course they have that as well which has vitamin e and aloe as well um and again i just love the packaging i think it's so beautiful and then of course since this is like spring summer themed we're going to be going hopefully fingers crossed on vacations or even staycations or even if you just want to pop this fragrance in your bag and you don't want to take the full bottle then you can go ahead and pick up the rollerball which they have as well so that's super super exciting um oh actually i'm sorry it's not a roller ball it is a perfume spray so that's that's even better because if you know me and you know my channel i'm not a huge fan of rollerballs i prefer a perfume spray so they've got something for everyone so the actual spray i think that if you like champagne toast you would really like this one i feel like it smells kind of similar in the same family with like that sparkly brightness to the fragrance however they've definitely turned up the citrus note so if you like a juicy citrus fragrance then you will love this line so i really really do like the fragrance mist and i didn't realize how strong it was until like i sprayed it i doused myself i was in the living room and then i went into the kitchen went back into the living room and i could still smell it like really really strong so these scents really have some performance some punch and then of course the perfume is going to have even more impact than the fragrance which you can use one or the other you can use them together of course just depending on how fragrant you want to be that day the foaming sugar scrub i love a sugar scrub to begin with but this did a really really good job of being abrasive and really getting like dead skin off of my skin so of course it has the sugar exfoliants in there but it also has the vitamin e so it's hydrating as well it's not going to like rob your skin of any hydration which i really really like and then of course it's foaming so it's also going to like be your soap as well if you forget your soap or something like that this will do a good job of like cleansing your body and making it super soft love that of course again i do love a body cream i feel like it really adheres to scent to you and sometimes i found that like i could just use the body cream and i don't even have to use a fragrance like it's that strong and i've i see the same thing in this body cream really really love it super hydrating nice it's thick so while it's still a little bit chilly even though it's warming up it's definitely going to keep you very hydrated after you get out the shower the actual i didn't use the shower gel but of course everyone loves their shower gels i think it's going to be great for getting you super clean in the summertime but then also the scent is just so delicious and so juicy and bright and citrus again i did use the moisturizing body wash and oh my gosh the lather is so creamy like they are not lying like i love it it's just so rich it just feels so luxurious it feels like you're treating yourself to a spotting like literally i love it so much i'm more than likely going to buy a backup of of this um just because i really really like it and you know what's crazy i think that if you've been following me you know that i'm probably not i always say i'm not a huge fan of citrus scents like i don't feel like they usually work for my body chemistry this works with my body chemistry so that's saying a lot it just smells so freaking good if even if you don't like citrus like i feel like if you want a summer scent this could be the one for you so and then another thing i want to point out i know this is like should be the standard this range is dermatologist tested and then it also is not tested on animals as well so that's something i want to point out because i know that really matters to a lot of people as it should so i really like that and then for the body lotion again i i opted for the body cream today um but i really like the body lotion as well we're actually i think i used the body lotion yesterday but as you know they're both like super hydrating it's just kind of like which consistency do you like better this one's a little bit more liquid so you know some people prefer that some people want more of a cream you've got both in this collection really really like that as you can see i didn't even take the plastic off of the now that i know it's the actual perfume spray but i'm definitely going to pop this right in my purse after this because this is going to be my summer scent if there's anything that's making me like that will make you want to purchase this is the fun bright poppy colors and again it has like like that glittery kind of a look and actually you can feel it it kind of feels like raised glitter on there but it's just so beautiful the packaging it really puts you in the mood for summer and i'm just like super excited i hope that you guys can get out to the store try out these scents if you have already then let me know what do you think about them do you typically like citrus bright citrus scents do you like champagne toast because i feel like if you usually get champagne toast in the fall in the winter then you should go ahead and get this one for spring summer but let me know your thoughts let me know if you have any questions and i will catch you guys in the next video peace [Music]", "LMKmCEoEdiw": "I think at the shaker you know it's up gotta come back and share this with my dude just picked this video ain't [ __ ] compared to what it's doing in person this is animal needs this is what you call pressure I'm not lying this is heavy gassy stinky purple beautiful it's Louden heaviest fake pressure smoke the blunt felt like I was taking debits forever", "vYQR7jxSVFA": "[Music] hey everybody it's clint from canadian cannabis culture back with another review got another one from quest today i just picked up my ex-wife this one's called ex-wife it's sitting at 24.2 percent thc 0.06 percent cbd really excited to try this one i'm a very uh my favorite type of strains are usually like og kush type of strains um ones that are very piney i've found a bunch of them in my life uh but i've found it's been hard to come across so far in like the lp market i'm hoping people uh somebody one day will cultivate a strain called pine tar og i think it's probably my favorite strain of all time i think i've only had it like twice in my life but every time i've had it it's something to cherish for sure when i looked this one up uh the thing that intrigued me is that it basically said that it's an ogs um people who like og it's a it's kind of like a paradise for them uh and it's supposed to be very piney so expecting big things because that's exactly what i like so ex-wife is an indica dominant bred by crossing ghost og and trophy wife so ghost og is like an old school strain and trophy wife is fairly new so that's a kind of a cool combination said to yield phenomenal amounts of thc 24 yeah that's definitely pretty high this one was packaged september 17th so super fresh ex-wife is said to have a sweet and gassy aroma with the taste of fuel with a creamy nose burn it says and some say piney slash diesel which is what i'm hoping for the dominant terpene profile for ex-wife is uh b carefully a bisabolo and linol quest's singular focus is to deliver cannabis experiences beyond the ordinary quest in my opinion is the leader in exotic strains in the lp market with gage ignite citizen stash and simply bear organics really close behind them i just find that quest has a lot of really good exotic strains like on their website it looks like they've got about 20 and i'm excited to try them all a quest is a small batch high grade cultivator they hang dry and hand trim all their flour which is really important all their plants are nourished by a glacial mountain water which runs naturally through quest cannabis estate glacial water happens to be perfectly ph balanced to the level that cannabis thrives on quest is located in creston valley bc in the kootenai region and if you're looking to invest in quest they're under the parent company decibel cannabis company which i'll have on the screen okay so i've already harped on this enough so i'm not going to really go on it too much but just get rid of the box quest i think they're working on that right now actually so eventually they'll get rid of the box it is a very nice box though my preference and i'm sure they don't really care too much about it even though they are a very nice company i'd like to see it no box glass jar somewhat similar to simply bear the glass jars are just very very nice and i find that the the flower usually stays is kept really well in it and it's super easy to reuse or recycle okay so let's have a look at it here sealed for your protection okay so this is really nice they've got a uh integra boost pack in here which is really nice to see uh and it was packaged not long ago either so doubling up definitely get you guys a good look at that okay now that we've learned a little bit about ex-wife uh as a strain uh and uh quest cannabis the last thing i gotta do is test it out for reading so i'll go do that and i'll be right back [Music] [Music] [Music] all right everyone after testing out the uh ex-wife by quest the taste on it wasn't what i was hoping for um it was really good it was basically just really uh kind of like gassy fuel diesel kind of a taste definitely a little bit creamy as well but it didn't have like the tiny kind of taste that i was looking for um it was still good though still tasted good it burned really well the ash on it was nice and white so very clean the effects on it were nice and strong for sure and it didn't take very long for the effects to uh for you to feel the effects it was pretty smooth um it definitely has in their description that it has a little bit of like a nose burn which which it definitely does so it's it's smooth overall but it definitely has a little burn to it so overall really good i'm going to rate this one a 9.0 out of 10. until next time guys", "sQF8-dl5fls": "[Music] yo guys what is going on ethan here today we are going to be reviewing some of my orange cookies wax so hopefully that does look good on the camera i don't know how the lighting is but yeah hopefully you guys do see that so it's more of like a sauce and we're gonna be hitting it off of my blender so i'm

weekend [Music] every week is fashion week for me you", "QHvP5l9-VyQ": "hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today's review we are taking a look at a new to us capsule brand from the folks at get zen we are looking at their cannabis infused capsules today this is the high thc line where each capsule has 25 milligrams of thc uh for 750 milligrams in the total bottle uh like all of our wheats reviews we're not going to be doing all 750 milligrams at once we're going to be taking four capsules for a hundred milligrams uh and that is what we will base our review off of so i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach california uh for i believe uh with taxes included uh around about ninety dollars uh so pretty expensive for these 750 milligram capsules uh certainly on the upper end for what i've seen in the area uh so we've got some decent expectations for them uh and on their website they've got such wonderful boilerplate uh text as this let's let's give you a read here gitzen is on a mission to improve the quality of life for patients by manufacturing the highest quality of cannabis capsule and other cannabis products our goal is to bring honesty integrity and accountability to the cannabis market and change the way cannabis is perceived by the medical community in the general public how noble i'm sure they are uh fulfilling that mission uh with the absolute utmost zeal every day of their existence so uh let's get into the product review here uh here's our little bottle uh it's got some lab testing results on the bottom that doesn't really give us more than just the number there uh which actually comes out according to these lab testing results to about 821 milligrams 10 more than advertised there's one of these like little funky stickers that you can pull away to get more information than you occasionally see on these pill bottles oh and uh back here we just have uh the ingredients which uh is more elaborate than i would have thought and now i am seeing that this is actually um rso in here or at least as advertised this is uh not just any um thc distillate it is rso rick simpson oil doesn't really change things that much it's just a different extraction method uh let's get that sticker off and get to the promised effects of these pills which are high euphoria we shall see i'm realizing now i have no liquid in here with me so good old-fashioned dry swallow it is and here are capsules ah okay these are quite a bit different than what i have seen these are just little gelatin capsules but instead of like liquid filled there's a very dry amount of i guess rso there at the bottom uh just kind of splattered in there i'm not sure how well it's showing up on camera uh but it just looks like somebody just took a little dropper of some really sticky goo and put it in this capsule um not very appealing looking but you know uh you gotta do it one way so here we are here is again our 25 milligram capsule uh let's give it a try down the hatch it goes one and two no taste believe it or not other than the elegant capsule two all right that's half of what we're gonna be doing for this review we're gonna do all 100 i'm gonna take about i don't know uh 30 minutes to an hour or so before i try these next two but once i do about uh 90 minutes to two hours after i have my second half of this dose i will come right back here guys to give you those most important part about all of the reviews the wrap up thoughts are these get zen high thc capsules gonna get you high for that guys you'll just have to stick around and i'll be right back in just a bit thanks for watching welcome back to weeds guys it has been about two and a half hours since i had my first get zen capsule i was about to show you the logo again but i ripped the sticker off i can't do that uh and about what did i say two and a half hours inside my first probably about 90 minutes since i had the second two the other half of my dose and these capsules work pretty well they're good uh the rso oil in there will get you quite high i'm still pleasantly high two and a half hours later um i'm not sure however that they are worth the premium over some of the other capsules uh of a similar strength at a lower price or higher milligramage um uh so if they are cheaper at your dispensary or if they're the only ones capsules they have available and you like capsules these will certainly do the trick but i don't think that they are necessarily worth a premium over anything else if um if they got some buddies or some papa and barclays or whatever in there and there's you know cheaper than these you're fine using those uh but these get zen will certainly get the job done so i'm gonna give them a thumbs up but again it's kind of a qualified thumbs up uh these are good but you don't need to spend the extra expense if these are more expensive than any other at your dispensary anytime we give a thumbs up we like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that is not weed related we can give a little recommendation of very simple quick easy one this week just finished or re-watching the 2012 uh movie killing them softly uh which is i think available on netflix the stream right now stars brad pitt uh was a legendary bomb the year it came out but it is a great great film pretty quick like 90 minutes to get through too uh super cynical super dark uh about um oh uh what is the movie about uh it's it's about [ __ ] you pay me that's what it's about i guess uh so check out killing them softly on netflix and if they're not too expensive check out get zen capsules the high thc especially if you like the capsules they'll get the job done and that guy's then is gonna do it for this cherry on top it's gonna do it for the review until we see you for our next one stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then goodbye", "iq5eo2Xb-vI": "what's up youtube it's your boy medical market sales bringing you the indico jk this is the la kush cake cush mints x wedding cake let's get a roll

see it says mints jealousy and it says see junkie genetics and it also says cookies manufacturing so this is they're involved with cookies name all we love cookie strings cookies isn't really good they have really good strings today we're gonna try it out of a paper cup and you can see I got paper cups set to 3:30 so here we go mint jealousy mints jealousy at 3:30 out of a per cup so this flower makes a lot of vapor and I would say this flower has a weedy taste with OG in it maybe you know so funny as you get all these derivatives of flowers or they mixing them up and in the end no one knows what these flowers really are their brothers their sisters and their cousins and they're genetically putting them together it's really unbelievable so this flower is very strong so it's not for the beginner person it's strong but it's not the strongest and it's smooth and it's not the smoothest but it's not really about any of those things we're looking for the perma-grin smile flower the one that you can get just a few times a year and for those who really watch these videos and you're on the hunt like I am you know what I'm talking about there's a few times you get a flower you go oh my god so we're looking for that and it's so hard to find so is mints jealousy that this flower is an eight point five and that's a good strong heavy nice flower but it's not the nine and we're on the hunt for the nine so I would say if you like mint strains this one is smooth and strong so maybe that's right up your alley but for me I gave this flower in 8.5 this is the doctor if you want to see paper cup you can see it at vapor cup calm if you like the videos please subscribe if you want to see la best flowers and I'm telling you that you can really get better flowers by going to wheat

everybody jb here checking in respect my region.com here today to do a quick marijuana madness 2021 versus pre-roll review so today's two products and today's two brands are two of the best of the best in california and actually connected owns alien labs so those of you that don't know they are intertwined there's press there's there's articles google it look it up um but the cool thing is is that both of these brands are two of the top companies in the state of california in terms of cannabis alien labs down there in arizona newly as well so today's connected review is going to be the connected gushers one grand prix roll today's alien labs pre-roll is going to be the atomic apple so for the atomic applicable apple we are looking at 25.52 thc 28.43 thc a delta nines packaged on november 20th the gushers coming in at 24.32 0.06 i'm sorry that's on the thc .06 on the cbd 24.82 on the thca and 2.55 on the delta 9. this was packaged however a month earlier than this on october 14th so packaged by leaflets incorporated packaged by leaflets incorporated i think it's pretty self-explanatory the way we're gonna do these uh marijuana madness reviews you guys are pretty simple it's basically the taste test and the west coast weed tour but two products at the same time there is a sweet creamy very gassy smell followed by a sweet creamy berry gassy dry hit so that's exciting okay gushers is known for all of those flavor profiles so i'm excited to check that out it's going to be delicious and the atomic apple okay sweet sour and sweet sour with the tint of pine so these are both supposed to be one gram pre-rolls right one gram one gram so these are both supposed to be one gram pre-rolls but unfortunately there is a big difference in size one gram pre-rolls big difference inside the bottom here is the connected the top is the alien labs so wow that is huge all right that's not looking good connected what's going on man these were both i think like um maybe 22 dollar pre-rolls both of them so that's just unacceptable again just to show you guys the difference wow here we go i'm gonna just because of that i'm gonna start with the atomic apple sorry connected but that's what you get when you cut cut it a little short and actually you know what i kind of want to grab the scale this is going to be a first ever marijuana madness scale check because of the review we'll do it after the taste test i want to get get through the first couple hits first on this don't want to take away from eating this it's smooth there's big good berry there's a slight pine it's not as it's not as potent and pungent as i like it's not really hitting me it tastes delicious maybe the high is going to be a creeper but for me i feel a little bit energized i feel focused i feel i feel like my body is definitely high and tingly but i wouldn't say that it's very much a heady strain maybe if you have anxiety issues you know that might it might be sparked up a little bit but for right now this just tastes really good but not much on the high um i'm gonna have to give this an 8.5 on the taste test it tastes really good but just not as good as the dry hit unfortunately um let me go ahead and grab the scale you guys bear with me like follow subscribe we're not playing games great time to like follow on subscribe to respect my region on all social media you guys because we've got to do a scale check because even right now i'm smoke this pre-roll is still smaller than the alien life so we're going to check this here we go you guys see it zero zero it says it's a one point one which means that this well right now this became well let's see you know this says it's a one flat but we already been smoking it so it's a tough sell man i joined that shorter than the others it doesn't have as much weight it's tough all right here we go let's dive over to the amy i'm sorry let's dive over to the connected let me put this cherry out real quick all right there we go that's good over there here it goes here it goes here it goes right y'all as i mentioned good great time to like follow and subscribe go follow any labs go follow connected show some love this is marijuana madness these are both two of the best cannabis companies in california you know creators of a lot of genetics purveyors of premium weed so here we go last one was an 8.5 on the taste test it was cultivated and packaged in november 20th this is october 14th cultivated package this one has a better flavor i'm going to give this one already it's a better score it's a different terpene profile you know i went into the city compassionate character booth i said look i got this concept i got this idea i need to do the best products versus the best products the best brands first the best brands i need one and the labs one connected she said this one sold out exceptionally fast this was quite literally the last one at city compassion and caregivers there was a bunch of gushers left but you know it's all good the white ash on this is insane the other ash was a little darker taste test wise i'm gonna give this a 9.25 it's very much delicious you know maybe even i don't know i might have to go up to a 9.5 let me see i don't know it's [ __ ] good 9.75 i'm gonna go ahead and do it it's not only sweet berry and gassy pungent the ash is insane i'd like to see the terpene profile on this pre-roll to justify you know and know what's going on there is two point five percent two point five five percent of t uh delta nine twenty four point eight two of the thca it's an incredible pre-roll if the atomic apple tastes really good i think it's a delicious sativa leading hybrid if anything but in comparison to this connected one overall it's going to be the taste test is going to go towards connected the overall score as well i'm going to give the the dupe tube for me really kills at this plastic [ __ ] uh and no terping profile so for me they're gonna get a 9.75 in the taste test but they're going to get a 9.25 overall 92.5 overall because plastic no terpene profile there's just a lot of things left to be desired on this um the atomic apple very much delicious it's energized sativa but the smoke of it did not match that explosion of flavor you got on the dry hit so because of that big shout out to connected coming in hot with a shorter joint than the atomic apple but a more flavorful more flavorful and an overall better item so big shout out to connected shout out to alien labs too and city compassionate caregivers for providing the canvas today uh i love everyone for the support really appreciate you guys again be sure to like follow subscribe to respect my region everywhere and i will catch you guys in the next taste test love you all peace", "3zo_twYcDCY": "hey welcome back to dan's buddha bodega i hope you're ready to freshen up because today we're going over face mitts [Music] that's right today we're going over face mints it's a new indica heavy hybrid from cresco that crosses face off og with cushmits now i've never had either of those strains and to be honest i've never even heard of cushman's but i'm always open-minded so let's take a look at this now when you go to smell this the first thing you're going to get is like a citrusy uh almost sour scent to it um almost kind of like oranges or or orange tang i don't know there's something in there that might be a little sour or or tangy but but it smells good i hope the smell transfers over into the flavor now when you look at this buddy light fluffy dark buds with brown hairs this is a brunette you're also going to see a nice coating of trichomes it looks good it smells good what do you say we go ahead and see if it tastes good all right here we go nastrovia slanted cheers salud [Music] okay so there is a little bit of an orange flavor in kind of a eucalyptus or even minty on the finish damn now again i get a little bit of orange and a little bit and a little bit of mint but the flavor oh man it's really really subtle i mean yeah it's uh it's almost it almost has no taste at all all right well maybe it'll come come through for us on the effects all right guys well i've given a little bit of time and i gotta tell you it's not bad i thought that just like the red lion haze before this was going to be a mediocre flower for someone that is beginning in cannabis this would be could be a bit much it starts off with a nice cerebral buzz and it comes on hard and comes on fast and then after a little bit of time it transfers into a decent body buzzer body height making it a decent strain for alleviating pain this would be a good strain for you as long as you took it easy you know eased into it because too much at the beginning can definitely cause some anxiety uh in the um inexperienced the only thing that i would really say i don't like about this flower is the dry mouth and the fact that they're using a machine to trim it i mean every time i see those little holes i get all freaked out like there's there's you know uh earwigs or tribbles living in them you know like you burl but so if you're looking to alleviate some pain uh calm down and have a little bit of euphoria this is a good strain for you i'd say hop in the car go ahead try it out i don't know how much longer cresco's gonna have this strain well that about does it for me i'd like to say thank you to all my friends family lovers haters subscribers viewers uh everybody and last but not least thanks for the view", "h4ZsQl4p0tA": "welcome back everybody it's your boy fiesta

that good jazz love y'all peace", "Bd6tLCeMYLc": "[Music] look what I've got here this is a butt of something called sugar cone and it's from connected cannabis and I've been very lucky lately I've been getting some great new cultivators and connected cannabis definitely has it going on so you can see sugar cone comes in this jar and this flower has 22 percent THC and it's an indica and today we're going to try it out a paper cup I just loaded the vapor cup straw so I have about one bong hits worth of flour and the end of the straw and this thing is gonna heat it up and it's gonna release the water vapor and I'm on a very low temperature it's at 330 degrees you can see the vapor in the straw so this is an outdoor flower so let's check out sugar cone by connect to cannabis so I really don't buy that much outdoor flower I it doesn't vape as good and I tried alien labs Planet Doce and that actually baked really good at a vapor cup and it's an outdoor flower so I was so curious about connected cannabis this flower accent is a very good taste and it's smooth but it's not the smoothest and I would say it goes the taste goes south really fast it's definitely you can tell the difference between an indoor and outdoor flower butts so just great just flowers an indica and what do we think we're looking for the best it's not about the taste it's about the perma-grin smile so what do we think I'm giving sugar cone and eight you know there's just better flowers and so it's not was a bad flower it's good if you like connect to cannabis it's definitely worth the try but for the doctor and this flowers Nate if you'd like to see vapor cup you could see it at vapor cup calm if you want to see Ellie's best flowers you can see it on weed entertainment.com thanks for joining in on the dr. party on my friends [Music]", "dOr-KK3IAJk": "yo guys what is going on ethan here today i'm going to be reviewing this shrieker cart from rise over in florida i don't know what other

i have tasted already and it is a pretty good car as you can see it may be a little bit high already but this cartridge does i can't even talk right now that's how good this cartridge is so it does smack let me hit it again i said let me hit it again and this was my first hit on the video so this already tells you cheese but i do want to thank you guys for all the support you guys have been

and i'm not being like biased because they gave me the cartridge if it was ass i would say it's ass so this this is a good card [Music] this is the battery that comes with it so i don't know what voltage it's at but i'm just using the one that came with it because i didn't want to [ __ ] around the batteries and get one that was too hot for this and mess up the cartridge but yeah this is a really good battery and a nice cartridge as well i like how on this battery you don't need to hit anything so you just charge it and then whenever you want to use it put the cartridge on and you just inhale and it turns on by itself so so i want to let you guys know like i've been seeing a lot of people saying like oh i don't have the right equipment to start the youtube channel i don't have this i don't have that i want to show you guys that i'm recording this one like this video on my phone instead of my other camera just to show you that you guys don't need every little thing to start a channel like i started using my phone and i'm using it again on this video just to show you guys that you guys don't need all the equipment just start a channel so yeah it's it's kind of cool and i like seeing the channel grows and i get to meet more people so i really like engaging with my i guess the people that subscribe to me and that follow me so i want to thank you guys a lot this video wasn't going to be long it was just a little review on the cartridge and like i said already it is a nice cartridge this is just a half gram they do make full grams but obviously it do cost more but i

but i'll i'll see if i can put it in the description i'm not gonna be 100 sure and i'll try to pop it up on the screen that's going to be it for the video this card is good like i just said a couple

the time hey it helps very much I greatly appreciate all you guys thank you all so much for the love on the merch drop let's dive right into it so today's video we are talking about a growing problem that I have been noticing more and more in my DMS we're talking about fake exotic now some of you guys out there might be wondering what the [ __ ] is fake exotic but I assume most you guys know what I'm talking about here we're talking about those cookies packs the runts packs the jungle boys packs that are obviously not real those are the main three but there's a bunch of other like fake packaging brands where they aren't actually real weed brands it's just packaging companies that sell the [ __ ] to anyone right now for those of you guys who are uninformed there is a very large trend going around in the weed smoking community where people will take some fairly decent weed and put it in a fake knockoff dispensary look-alike bag and then sell it for $50 an 8 which is unacceptable absolutely ridiculous so today we're gonna break down how to differentiate between a fake and a real bag and we're also gonna talk about some information that you guys probably need to know about this now first and foremost I'd like to say here that if you were cab going to buy weed from your plug and he's ever got some some quote-unquote exotic that is prepackaged in a bag like this you should generally run to the [ __ ] hills you should fly as far away as you can you know what snitch on that [ __ ] guide you'd call twelve six nine that dude bro [ __ ] that guy alright he's selling fake [ __ ] and here's why 99% of the time this is exactly what happens people will go on sites like DHgate or Aliexpress or Amazon and they will buy a bunch of these fake bags these pre-made bags from [ __ ] Wuhan or some [ __ ] right get them mailed to him open them up seal them all you know fill them up with some decent bud and ate the bud seal them up and sell them now there's one dead giveaway to these bags that really tells you right off the bat that they're fake right and I don't here's the thing before I ever made this video I figured that a lot of this stuff is like really self-explanatory but ever since I made my reviewing subscribers weed series I've received a concerning amount of DMS of people like flexing these fake bags like a shocking amount of DMS which I feel need to clarify this the number one way to tell if your cookies runts or jungle boys or any kind of pack is fake is to look at the coloring that is the number one way the best example of the throw on here I think there's two in particular that are always a really easy way to tell we're gonna use cookies as our first example here we're gonna use the gelati and the sticky buns bags now you look at sticky buns in gelati right the colors are very vibrant the legitimate bags the colors are super vibrant popping gelati in particular it's a different color for each letter of the word right super vibrant colors and you guys have to remember that with all of these weed companies with all of these legitimate real-deal packaging's right the colors are always really gonna stand out the colors are gonna pop like crazy like it's meant to draw your tension in right so they're gonna use high quality coloring high quality printing on the real bags on the fake ones now the reason I use sticky bouncing gelotti's because it's so easy to tell with these to write the colors always come out faded or dim and worst case scenario they're not even the same shade right but essentially every time when you're buying these fake bags you have to realize they're printing these in a lower resolution right they are printing these with very like just worse material worse quality then the real brands are using right and that's gonna reflect in the print right and the best way to look is just honestly even go online right go on if you guys live in Cali you know go on the cookies website and look at some of their information on there or watch youtube videos where people have some real packaging and do a compare and contrast and you'll note it's almost right off the bat that the colors are [ __ ] I mean even from the images that I've thrown on screen in the past couple minutes here you guys should be able to tell in my side-by-sides that yeah it's it's a pretty blatant Lorde particularly the sticky buns and I I did my research here pretty much every single print of the fake sticky buns I could find had this [ __ ] coloring right and all of them do cereal milk is another really bad offender a cookie strain and then you move on to other brands right let's look at runts and jungle boys for a minute right runts is another one that is pretty obvious because runts their packaging is arguably even more vibrant and popping than cookies right their packaging is just color just Bank Bank BAM right and with them once again just look at the brightness in the contrast of those colors right look at the look at the resolution of the print actually look up close and see okay it is that resolution bad you know is it almost like blurry you know when you when you look at it real closely because you know if I were to take for example I've got a cookies bag on my shelf actually here if I take this bag and I look at I hold it really close to my eyes that text doesn't look like it's bad quality or blurry like I don't have to hold it far away from my face to read it as clearly as I could imagine right 20/20 I can hold it as close as I want and that text still looks great quality with a fake bag that will almost never be the case if you look very closely at the bag you'll notice like hey that image is kind of blurry right it's not looking good but moving on from comparing the bags like I said there the comparison in looking closely at that that kind of blurriness is the best way there's another one that people seem to look past quite often I don't know if people look past it or if they just don't give a [ __ ] but the second one here now this is how it is an Illinois right with every bag that I've gotten of cookies in the state of Illinois yeah cookies did recently come to Illinois it's a very new development but mine dispensary guided him for the first time like two months ago I think but either way with my bag it says resealable at the top right but there's a little like safety seal that you have to pull to actually open up the bag to make it then resealable right that's how the real bags are for example think of like a bag of beef jerky right you pull that you pull the little tab off the top little strip that you have to peel like a bag of cheese from the store right peel that little strip then you can open it and reseal it right it's the same thing with real cookies bags as far as I'm aware now correct me if I'm wrong in Cali but the Illinois bags which they are actually a little bit different from the Cali ones they are like that right and that's what I've seen from a lot of my friends who are in California too now I'm not up to date on packaging I know cookies changes their packaging a lot as do a lot of these other companies to try to outsmart the you know counterfeit so of course but as far as I'm aware that is a thing pretty much consistently on almost all of these bag companies right these companies that use bags instead of a glass container right these fake ones won't have that these fake ones you'll be able to just no safety thing to pull you know nothing to avoid it you'll be able to just yank it right the [ __ ] open right there will be no thing right there will be no thing to peel off that's like a safety thing typically bags will have that and some bags some real bags you'll be able to open without that I'm not saying all bags are like that but most bags will have something like that to indicate to you that it's already been opened if there isn't anything like that that is a huge red flag and you should really really look closer at that bag but moving on from ways to tell it apart from being real or fake let's talk about the real problem with these kinds of things the biggest problem that I have with these fake cookies fake runs fake exotic fake cally packs is that half the time the weed that people are putting in these isn't even bad that's the thing with a lot of these other fake branded things like edibles or concentrates a lot of times it's bunk or it's fake but what I seem to be noticing is a common trend is whenever people put the weed in these bags it's actually pretty decent right it's not it's not always swag and by the way a little tip here I've gotten a shocking amount of UK viewers European viewers who are sending in cookies bags and runts bags I hate to break it to you if you don't live in America you're not smoking cookies I'd nobody is [ __ ] importing the Gary Payton to the UK all right nobody's taking the gelati and shipping it on a boat past customs over to UK all right I hate to break it to you nobody's doing that for a bunch of eighths all right I just I hate to break your heart right but either Webb back on topic you're only UK viewers put the cookies back down right now throw the bag away take the weed out of its decent but back on topic here a lot of the bud that these people are putting into these bags is not bad and that's my problem see back in high school when I first started smoking it was never like this there was no fake Cali bags there was just like carts were just hitting the market in Illinois when I I like was starting smoking right like like carts were just starting to become a thing in Illinois as far as I remember like nobody was hitting them right like like I got lucky and got one early on when I was younger in high school right but like nobody was [ __ ] hitting them and all of a sudden as times gone on right as times progressed these fake bags have become a thing and I miss the good old days when you could just go to the plug and you can just get that bass that gas right out of the plastic bag I don't know I just had passed I'm baked as [ __ ] dude that's like a fat dab of some mag landrace dude I'm like I'm tweaking right now but either way back on topic here so I I just I miss being able to go to the plug and know that I'm getting the best [ __ ] he has straight out the bag right nowadays it's difficult to find a plug that isn't sound this kind of [ __ ] an a in bet here come all the [ __ ] heroes of cannabis who are gonna come in the comments like Mary a goblin huh makes me laugh that you don't have a plug my plug hundred pounds of Kali Zaza ten dollars right hey keep that [ __ ] out of the comments but really it's become a lot harder for the average smoker to find a plug that isn't selling these [ __ ] bags whereas if four years ago that same plug was probably selling that same weed but for a better price and out of a plastic bag like it should have been done and that's my biggest problem here and I want to make this little segment of the video here a call to action all the plugs out there everyone cuz listen this is the Goblin viewer vase okay if you guys are gonna sit here and act like you're not drug dealers you're wrong I know a good chunk you guys sell drugs right so I'm gonna lay it out right now all you plugs out there sell your weed out the bag don't sell it out of the fake [ __ ] sell it right out of that vacuum seal right out of that ziplock dude sell it the old classic way scale it out put it in a plastic baggie give it to your cost to you don't prepackaged this [ __ ] dude and harass and shame other plugs who do cyberbully them if you see a plug selling this [ __ ] swipe up on his story and say damn dude I didn't know you sold schwag in a bag nice bro just absolutely ruin his [ __ ] day because listen the plugs you sell this kind of [ __ ] they always have like egos about their bud they're always like man I'm selling real Cali all the rest of y'all are selling fake so if you guys just [ __ ] cyberbully I'm a little bit and tell them it's swag in a [ __ ] bag they're gonna lose their marbles I guarantee it it's gonna be content for everybody so chat not I'm so used to streaming dude I said chat Jesus Christ ladies and gentlemen the comments section harass your plug selling these fake bags and remember two important takeaways from this video 1 get your bags from a dispo there's no real reason that anyone would ever sell an authentic cookies bag on the street and 2 if you really are in the position to buy one of these if you're in the position where this is your best option before you give that plug money ask him to take it out of the bag and sell it to you for a real price because I guarantee the plug might even respect that a little bit a I'm not trying to get y'all killed out there but hey I've had I've had experiences where I've had bad times with plugs and I'll hit them back up and I'll be like you know do you just serve me some bunk and a lot of times sometimes I'll be like oh my bad and they want to keep you as a customer right so be like oh [ __ ] they'll understand a smart plug will realize oh this guy knows what he's talking about he's gonna be a comeback customer because he's an experienced right but a dumb plug would be like I'll [ __ ] you so a give that a little try that's my recommendation but ladies and gentlemen hope you guys enjoyed this video hope you guys got some information out of this that you might not have known before thank you guys for watching drop a like oh and also don't forget to cop merch if you haven't already ladies and gentlemen do not forget make an investment link to the top description hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did and I will see you guys next time peace", "WVN0PeyOrNY": "[Music] oh [ __ ] what is going on youtube it's your boy turpeetown welcome back to my awesome medical cannabis review in this one i got the string cartridge again baby i'm falling in love with these [ __ ] strain cartridges i have had this one on the channel before bodega bubble gum i'm not going to get into any information about that i am going to show you the guys the info if you guys want to know the uh the lineage and all that good stuff you guys know what to do look it up online i'm done doing all that crazy stuff you guys know that there we go there's the numbers a little shaky i'm getting ready for bed i just figured to go ahead and do this review here that way i don't give a half-ass review like i did yesterday and end up redoing it right so here we go as always not opened break that [ __ ] open about a bing bada boom let's see i love these packaging too look there's my info always i love these packaging man like this [ __ ] is slick the cart is slick but one thing i have noticed about this um you know like like how the normal parts like sometimes you get clogged up and you have to like kind of pop it like pop that air bubble whatever so you get suction these do that too but like once you pop that bubble it kind of feels like it never completely goes away so you're constantly always fighting uh to get smoke i guess which i don't know if it's like that with every card but i did notice that with the last card but anyway here's that look minimal [ __ ] headspace that's what i'm talking about the color of the oil was just [ __ ] phenomenal look at it that pretty gold um look how just clearing off my finger right there [ __ ] beautiful let's go ahead give it a dry taste yeah i'm not tasting anything no no bubble gum last bubble gum bodega bubblegum i had it didn't really taste much of anything if i remember correctly like that's what i was saying it don't taste like anything okay anyway here we go oh one thing i've noticed about my my battery i guess i'm keeping in the pocket this thing here is like starting to move i really don't want to do it now but um yeah so a little note to self a note to you guys who carry your cartridges in your pocket try not to if you keep it on you can [ __ ] end up wasting the whole cart by having it press in your pocket if you're stupid like me and forget to turn it off you can in your pocket this thing literally it will slowly turn the whole way up so whenever you go out to go smoke you're hitting it with the [ __ ] thing all the way up and you're [ __ ] burning your clothes and you're gonna make your car taste like [ __ ] so that that's one thing i do like about just the inhale batteries they inhale activate batteries but don't get me wrong being able to change the temperature and [ __ ] is good too but anyway enough talk about the [ __ ] battery let's get into this [ __ ] bodega bubble gum it is [ __ ] distillate which they're they're just the cartridges is not bad check out that one that's different that's cool all right anyway here we go cheers this is a hybrid tube by the way okay cheers okay okay tasting more grape grape on this kind of like uh maybe like a grape bubble gum um you guys remember the the uh it's like a big bag it has that stringy bubblegum it has the has the picture of the baseball player with a big [ __ ] wad of gum in his mouth i don't know what that gum is called but that's what this is reminding me of just off that first [ __ ] hit cheers expands really good in your logs and i have it on the lowest setting 3.3 volt yeah that's crazy how that tastes starting to fill it in the head a little bit just just a tad little tangle that feeling it morning throat i think for me hitting this pin like really hard today kind of has my throat overall i'm really not used to smoking these these uh distillate carts back to back like this i'm really used to the to the cresco liquor live resin carts or any kind of liquid like resin cartridge to be honest but uh yeah i'm gonna turn this to this up a little bit not much i'm not gonna go all the way i'm gonna go to in between 3.8 and 3.4.3 right there right in the middle let's go cheers look i'm actually getting a little a little sweaty going on here right cheers i got it definitely like a grapey kind of uh taste not bad at all not bad at all strain you guys keep doing your [ __ ] thing man keep doing your thing i like i like the look of it i like everything about your guys's carts besides the price take the price down a little bit of course of course i'm going to [ __ ] about the price you know what i mean but anyway y'all smash that like share subscribe all that good [ __ ] another short video don't keep you guys sitting here lifting my mouth all the [ __ ] time but anyway i'm definitely feeling good so yeah stay turkey [ __ ] mama love peace [Music] you", "9Jo6OibVosI": "what's up everybody it's your boy fiesta the kid here aka i like the doodle

whose", "m2mHUTf3snM": "we are live chronic club seven seventh sesh say that three times fast here with uh michael the aging ant miggy 420 with cannabis legalization news and myself josh the talking hedge so we are here we're gonna uh review um do a product review for a dab it's called aggro couture which i either really really like that name or i absolutely hate it it depends on if it's a joke or not like if they're aggro couture and they're making fun of louis vuitton's logo i love this company if they're real and they think they're bougie and they think that they're pretentious then i absolutely hate this company though real quick just to throw those out there they're not super bougie bro they're not they're aggro mechanics this is their fancy line uh well if you're being serious with that then i think that's really funny i think it's a joke uh because you know you try to do some bougie uh anyways let's get into it we're not there yet let's get into it first off um we're going to look at seven criteria judge this just like we do all of our products we're gonna look at seven things number one we're gonna judge on appearance uh that's a scale of zero to one we're gonna look at aroma and taste we're gonna look at strength and effect we're gonna look at cure quality and care and then brand and packaging all coming up within uh within the chronic club so look at that that's like a honey you know like at the very bottom of like that organic honey you got to scoop it out with like a spoon very kind of honey consistency um right off the bat so what yeah let's let's start with the appearance here i'm gonna break this open is a one gram live resin citrus pez from um agro mechanics it's a sativa smells smells you know kind of like citrus maybe a citrus candy like a pez candy citrus good good comparison um but not like a real like real citrus uh so we'll see how that that works i don't like botanical terpenes they hit my throat makes it real scratchy cough so we'll see how this hits um again it's like a sugary consistency the um the look to it if you put my screen up i will oh thank you perfect there we go nice picture michael thank you yeah some little dab porn on that i got a few more we can go through sexy yeah good call thanks for taking those photos so yeah that's really sugary crystally um what is what type of concentrate would would you guys call this i think it's like a sugar um but is there like a term like is this a different kind of variety of concentrate well like are you talking like like what did you call a shatter hell no no yeah it's definitely not a shatter right yeah so this would be uh along the lines of terp diamonds in my classification but it's a little bit too waxy honey honey comey to really be diamonds because they're really small i mean if i was marketing this as like it's style right i would probably go about calling this like terp honey or something like you did or or maybe even like terp sugar but it's a little bit thicker than that too well the glistening it just reminds me of the diamonds like in their branding uh you know they have a diamond on there but this is a huge opportunity to take up the whole wall street thing with like the diamond hands like if you're gonna like look i would sell those diamonds or you know apes holding diamonds or something i think that's a perfect opportunity to take something and and uh and pivot it right so like this is not cannabis isn't necessarily bougie right so you're trying to sell something that looks like louis vuitton calling it couture i think that's hilarious so take that somebody actually take it and run with it who's not trying to be serious like these guys and do something like the wall street bets diamond hands and run with that i think that would be super funny this you're like you're not gonna no one's gonna see this and be like oh i relate to this louis vuitton looking like get out of here with that so real people don't but there's a lot of people who are like you know there there's a lot of people who are consuming cannabis in the market space right now because it is a thing that you can do and there are a lot of people who live on clout i just want you guys to like like here's clout that's the gucci dab mat that i have fucked the fuck up dude yeah real real too like real real gucci dude uh steve lee steve lee got a stack of these they were actually mouse pads and they're highly collectible and really freaking expensive and i wasn't supposed to like spill dabs all over it but like i'm like okay cool i'm gonna use it sure so i'm not gonna keep it pristine because it's gucci but part of that cloud i get it i get it they're looking for the high-end brand on the looks i mean it is a really nice looking product um it's it's pretty pretty good consistency and i mean it's got some some like you know stick to it it's just kind of hanging out in the jar there it's not moving around much the terps are definitely definitely like present and you can see it with like miggy you said that glisten just makes you want to get up in there right yeah i mean i was able to hold it for at least 10 seconds before it started crumbling on me like i had it up there in a whole piece and then i started crumbling because of the sugary texture and i was like oh shit gotta put it back in the thing so i can uh scoop it up but i mean it smells good it smells and just the little bits that are left over like on my hands when i was interacting with it one thing that was interesting it was almost like sand right like it's just if you go check those little bits that started to crumble it's got really density to it so you know it's kind of a kind of an interesting little layer there where it's at not quite diamond stage past the sugaring you know doing all the the interesting texture stuff i dig it i want to smoke this so let's let's do the um let's let's uh what's it called score it is it is this going to be um a 1 or are you guys going to give this a fractional little point for appearance how are you guys feeling on what it looks like i'm going to give it a full point i thought it was nice and bright and orangey um i thought the appearance looked really nice i thought the um packing we won't get there yet but everything else looked good yeah solid one totally yeah i'll give him a full point on the on the appearance here too all right um so what about uh i'm gonna mute him real quick [Laughter] what about the uh the smell or aroma um i smelled some you know pezzy like candy type of um smell to it um so it wasn't like a full citrus but it did smell good i'll give it three quarters of a point um i'd like to see what it actually tastes like we'll get to that uh next uh on taste but first up aroma i'll give them three quarters of a point for aroma what about you michael you know i'm getting um a little bit of sweetness and to me it's coming across more like almost like that hashy sweetness on a really high thc flour so it's got like you know basic kind of a clear thc-ish aroma to me like that's the sweetness i'm getting i don't catch a lot of fruit flavors or anything out of it it is pez which is uh you know kind of uh i i'm not sh i'm pretty sure pez is a descendant out of the uh the hash plant family um there's a couple more fruity stuff but yeah i mean i'm about like you know halfway through i'll give him a half a point on the aroma there's nothing really punching me in the mouth here or the nose what's the difference between live resin and live rosin rosin is heat and pressure live resin is a type of marketing that is uh should mean that the plant was processed freshly fresh fresh that they chopped it down it probably flash froze it right because uh it's better to process it when it's been frozen and then grind it up and process that plant so live resin it hasn't had a chance to die and it hasn't been cured before being processed okay ideally i mean i'm not a huge concentrate person i'll have to give it a full point just because i did smell that citrusy i mean smells terpene to me all right different things come across differently so um as we dab this we're gonna taste it that's next up on our uh seven criteria for um you know a successful dab or whatever we're calling this so what um when you guys hit this tell me also what apparatus you're using um i guess uh i'll go ahead and start i'll show you what what i got down here so this is the vape exhale so um we've got the the glass part here this is a glass filter that fits on top of here like so um so i'm going to go ahead and put some concentrate all up into here drop it in let that warm up a little bit and then i can either use this piece to put on top and then hit that but you know we kind of like the little glass i wish i had a little an electronic piece but uh wait for this to cool down uh just you know good old dab rig gabby good old dabby so yeah i think it's cool now i'm about to hit it my fucking prep just dropped so about to drop load it again i'll pick you up later guys hey don't mind me i'm just going to be behind a little bit on the dabbing because honestly i wasn't certain we were going to live at these but i did have one earlier and it definitely was a dab um it was concentrating and i am dabbing mine on a little small sized chamber glass bang rig with a decent-sized banger on it oh so michael you're the professional on this one uh hot dabs cold dabs for a live rosin press i waited till this got a little colder like it was first firing red hot and then i let it chill it's about 10-15 seconds and then it's it's hitting like a goddamn champ um generally glass if it's got quartz on it i'm i'm getting it hot for about 30 to 45 seconds till the bottom is all glowy right and then usually let it sit from anywhere from like 40 seconds to a minute depending on the glass i like them a little bit low but i'm not gonna lie like twice or three times a week i take a freaking pretty hot dab like 30 40 seconds to cool down and just take a big old hot dab that's what i'm going to do right now i'm actually going to wreck myself for you guys nice do it do it do it right right this is so cool hey you know i tried not this was my first smoke of the day actually kind of sort of because i had some uh i found this in the store yesterday chicha stash nice yeah and then uh i'm actually happy that it wasn't horrible like i was like oh please please please please please don't be bad i would like to be i actually tried to get some um keef i wanted to review tommy or uh yeah tommy chong's keefe not to be confused with chong's choice because apparently that doesn't exist anymore no yeah no they don't it didn't go very well same guy is marketing it though like that's just a guy marketing and branding dude that's it well you know it calls them too because i mean this celebrity shit is just that's what it is celebrity shit i mean all they're throwing is their name on it i would think you would have a qa person somebody quality like the guy who's doing uh chicha stash used to do really preserve and they had really good quality so uh i think they're doing pretty good i'm just happy that you know what one of my childhood heroes did fucking guys real quick it's going to be you know fairly large size and then i'll let you know how it tastes to me right on hey michael when you get a second share those pictures again leave that up and then i'll just be able to take it up and take it off for a reminder we are looking at aggro couture they've got to concentrate it's a sativa live resin and um so taste i'm gonna give it three quarters um i didn't taste really any uh citrus in there it wasn't bad my throat is a little bit a little bit coated so i don't know what that is it kind of my throat doesn't like it so i don't know if it's a solvent that's in there or um it's resin it's plant resin and we're going to get to that in just a second well so live resin i love that like my vapes are predominantly live resin from avatars and that's my go-to live resin is a marketing term okay live resin like i said it means they they claim excuse me to have chopped it live processed it fresh or at least without you know curing but um you know almost all cannabis is done that way these days and um what what live resin really is and what it's marketed as are usually two different things and here's why i say that so um didn't really have a ton of flavor right guys like we totally expected a little bit more than that i'm giving it like a 0.25 points on flavor but here's what's up from the minute i saw this i knew this had gone through crc color remediation this color cannabis that is this consistent right and at the price point you got it at which i'm guessing uh hey what's up michael willett um thanks for joining us tell your friends but this kind of cannabis uh hopefully the train's not killing me here is gotta be gone through a color remediation process which basically means oh you just beat yourself brother yeah i did i just got a call from my brain i'll feel you so so it's just another part of the processing process right this is why i don't think it can be live resin because the idea of live resin is it just goes in as the plant and comes out with what it's got but this clearly went through a crc which is another filtration level right so it's usually like diatomaceous earth and activated carbon that's in the actual like processing chamber and it pulls all the colors and gunk out so essentially this started out as boo-boo and that's why it kind of tastes like i'm not so when i pulled this out yesterday and i smelled it and i looked at it yesterday it was much more orange the color seems to have oxidized and it's now a lot more um sandy color than orangey so it's lost color overnight um and i didn't i was wondering like did i leave it outside did it freeze did it you know was there a chemical like change but i think it's just from oxygen it's very pale mine's very pale here in the camera and if you just switch to my shared screen it's got that golden orange color and i actually noted that as well it was much orangier um and hell there's the purple you can see how purple it is right behind me um yeah i i think that this went through color remediation probably got packaged close to hot which is also why it kind of sticks a bit but yeah a quarter of a point on the taste that's my thing i'll go on a three-day rant on crc what um what did you pay for this um so i think this was normally 30 a gram and i got a good i thought i felt like i got a good deal with st patrick's day so i got 30 off and so i paid 21 a gram that's probably what it should be so and look at it and look at it though like it's good weed there's no no i'm not saying it's not a good dab but it doesn't match the color it doesn't have the flavor because of the crc i'm getting high so we'll give the effect in a minute but yeah i wish it tasted like weed but again you know they set the expectation with this quarter bullshit right like like you don't have a fucking ahead of ourselves that's branding oh yeah but i mean like the expectation when you go over the taste with the terps and everything like you know uh anything that you put out if you want to say this is my high-end shit you want to make it beat your high-end shit if they're they're re-processing yeah right i mean whatever how's the taste though miggy what would you give that a one out of a you know zero out of one i gave it uh a half um i felt like there was some really good taste in on the front notes and then it just it just went away and then you're kind of left with this a sappy resiny kind of on my tongue on my throat i feel the resin i don't get that off a vape pen um but i also don't rip as much as i just dab so there's that i've got it too i'm over clumped from it yeah well there is something that they were talking about josh it's in my my tongue where you're like like it's like my tongue got coated with some paraffin wax so and and to clarify what i said about resin not like live resin which is the processing these are just phytochemicals these are plant materials that came along with it which kind of you know re-reinforces that this was poop before it looked like this this was poopoo and they had a lot of plant chemicals in which probably means it was double processed which also takes away from the fact of it being a possible for it being a live resin now the other side of that maybe those phytochemicals are there because it's a live resin it's got a low flavor profile in the plant but i haven't seen a lot of that and i've seen a lot of fucking dabs so before we move on to strength and effect what's uh what's your take on taste miggy gonna go with the half point uh michael willit from ohio he's commenting that he never had a good dab but he has baby lungs because every time he tries to smoke a concentrate many times he coughs his head off right that's kind of fucking what happens with everybody bro like clearly that's that that's part of it um dabs do that i'm over here coughing and i'm a professional but temperature also has a big impact yeah we were talking about actually right before you jumped into our live here anybody else out there you definitely want to heat a banger up or even if you're vaping it's slightly different if it's out of the machine but if you're using a glass or titanium banger heat it up let it cool down a little bit titanium much less so but quartz or glass you want to let it sit for a little bit get it cool change your dabbing style let that shit sit and it's not gonna feel as like i took a dab of cannabis in your lungs but you can let it get really low and just pull softly and get little tiny bits of vapor out of a good dab and it's a whole different experience you don't cough as much terpenes are more present than cannabinoids maybe not as much um and it feels differently in the lungs but a lot of people swear by like ultra ultra low temp dabs i feel this pain though because like when when debbie was the thing in washington during medical days uh you know i'd be like i'd do a dab at a thing pay two bucks at the dab lounge whatever cough my head off and fucking good in the car and go but that's why eventually i started going into the pens because i mean it concentrates just about how you consume it like any concentrate it's like orange juice like either you're gonna have the whole orange or you can just have pure the beer good shit you know whatever that plant is like the rocks also burn off so quick you know like three four hundred degrees so maybe when you were dialing that temperature all the way up you're burning all of that off um so eventually we'll we'll uh we'll figure out a better vote excuse now that now there's open research on terpenes i was just reading about this uh in a paper um it looks like terpenes may begin the evaporation process ultra low low temperature like 140 fahrenheit and actually go through the evaporation to you know fully being sublimated process all the way up to several hundred degrees which is like a low low temp dab you get all them terps in because they're nice and low they just start getting in you it's not pouring down your face if it's the right kind you know oh my god dude i feel that now like i'm coughing like right now like even after you have the dab sometimes you know like you're just like you're just sitting there trying to breathe at the same time i guess i'm still trying to get some smoke out or something like if i take a really really big dab i'm not gonna lie man i'm gonna sit there for like 15 minutes i'm okay and then suddenly it hits me and i won't stop coughing for like 20 minutes it'll just hit me fucking crying so that's a good transition how was the effect that's the next thing on this list here strength and effect um you know i did hit this earlier and so being a sativa even though we all kind of hate that that term uh because it's more about the terpenes and really less about you know sativa indica um i say it was a really good um you know we'll call cultivar strain whatever that gave me kind of a creative uh sativa daytime not great if you're trying to focus if you're trying to work but you know good if you want to dive into a spreadsheet or some kind of artistic um you know thing whatever you're doing um i just know that it reminded me of you know my mom adhd running around trying to do something and not being able to concentrate on any of it so as much as i love my mom there is a time and place for this um i would just have to make sure that it wasn't when i need to actually get something done yeah i mean like you know weeds good for like the body high too right like to make you feel better and i'm gonna probably today uh i do have some work to do but it's gonna be like physical i'm gonna move about 300 pound boxes inside of a building so yeah i mean you don't have to think too much and then i can just be like mr robot like my body but still right now first though i got that overwhelming just like all right first i'm just going to sit down for a little bit and maybe play a game or two before you be productive like you know i want to pop off first so yeah i'm feeling it i'll give it a full point full point for uh for strength all right uh michael how about yourself yeah i had some of this earlier today and um i i dig it i dig its effect it is a little bit of adhd but you know i jump on that stuff and and uh ride it so um i'm i'm always looking for something that's you know smokeable tastes pretty good look at these uh we'll be getting there on strength though but this is also i guess 79.2 cannabinoids it doesn't have a lot of uh thc and the high thca here's all the reason for the strength of it is that thca can like turn into other cannabinoids and i think thcv is what we're both getting out of this that whole like scatter brain get stuff done look over here look over there that's usually the cannabinoid that's that's like devolving and getting you that feel and i had crazy munchies though thcv is supposed to be an anti-munchie and i i had a crazy sugar dragon after i ripped that i was like where's the sugar and i was like all right chill out i realize what's going on yeah yes it felt like a thcv kind of effect for me and i'm just i actually you know i organized a bunch of stuff and i was like fuck a green screen i'm gonna put stuff behind me and you know like yeah so cool i'm gonna try i made a decision i want to be a little bit rougher on these so i'm trying for uh not to give everybody a full point on things that they don't fully deserve but i think this one's getting a full point for effect and strength for me yeah you know i was gonna give him like three quarters or or something around there but i think for if you know what you're getting if you're looking for a daytime that gives you a creative um you know behind the eyes kind of hits you it hits you hard um almo almost like an indica effect but but you know daytime energetic you know still gives you that that uplifting effect i think if that's what you're looking for then this is great and it doesn't have to be 90 whatever it's in the 70 you know 74 whatever it is 79 total cannabinoids um i think it's good if that's what you're looking for that's what you want you want to dive into some art project whatever or you are even like yeah you want to just like get in your own mind you know miggy as you're doing some yard work i think this is it so i'm giving it a full point myself for a strength and effect because if that's what you're looking for um i think it definitely does the job what about cure i know we say this every time is that an appropriate category and if so let's move forward all that shit i said about crc insert right here because that's that's my explanation on the cure part this isn't supposedly a cured product but it's obviously processed in a way that left us all feeling it in our throats yeah we all it didn't have the taste profile we'd expect based on its aroma which is you know another layer of it i think that all goes into cure here yeah totally i don't hate crc i don't hate it it's got a time and a place but it shouldn't be on the fancy looking packaging with diamonds on it and stuff which we'll get to in a moment which is here's the thing if i'm gonna buy salmon and it says artificially colored i'm not gonna buy it right but thank you for telling me because i'm not gonna buy that and if i you didn't tell me i might have and would be upset later on when you know i literally have that red dye bullshit in the championship yeah and then i personally boycott your company for you know throwing some garbage about you for like a decade or something when you're off the market yeah man like that's how i am too 100 so thanks for they should tell us up front for 30 bucks i shouldn't be going you know what i brought coffee just in case for that very reason uh well actually it's chicory root but whatever i had to bring a warm drink to rinse my mouth out just in case you know because you never know yeah no doubt i mean it's a good experience though i mean uh i don't regret this unlike that one oh yeah i got another nice little size nugget here but i i charred the shit out of my banger because i didn't clean it so judge the hell away look at how dark that got i don't give a i don't care i don't judge i had to clean my stuff yesterday because it was nasty i want to bring like a nice clear you know i have a brand new banger but i'm not going to put it in oh this tastes like it tastes even worse because the chard so cure what are we going to give them for q or michael are you giving them like a a straight straight zero uh okay so it's somewhere between there let's see it's somewhere between zero and one okay so it's pretty okayishly done it tastes all right it doesn't taste entirely like poop it definitely tastes worse than i'd expected to based on appearance and smell um i don't like crc i'll give them a quarter of a point because you know what at least it's not terrible at this point okay i think i'm going to go mid-range i'm going to give them a half a point because i think it's i think it's mid-grade um it could be a better taste it could be a better flavor it could be processed better all of that um if that if this is supposed to be top of the line i agree i'll go half point too just for all the reasons mike said okay all right half a point for those so um quality and care quality and care of the the entire thing i mean we're not we're not gonna at uh brand and packaging quite yet on the other side of what we just talked about for cure right um you paid 21 bucks right so maybe this was on the shelf originally at 30. um right i mean we'll see we'll see most my understanding is almost all the deals that happen especially if it's a third off that's more that's almost the whole taxes being paid for no one can really afford to give you a third off on anything if that was their intended retail price unless they were already cranking the price up in this market spaces especially so very likely this was already cheapo stuff that they produced so it could be knocked down on same paths so that that brings to detriment because you know it didn't really originally 30 bucks and if it did that might have been too high for it even though that's mids as it gets um it's market yeah um half a point for quality and care for me half a point chris for 20 bucks is pretty good yeah i mean i'm going back in so it's not like yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna burn this whole thing down i mean this whole container will be used so but it's not worth 30 bucks yeah unlike last month where i literally just gave it to this guy to to show uh as a joke you know the skittles like nasty brand like i was like i didn't even want that so yeah this this will end up getting consumed one way or another yeah i mean like i won't throw it away i've had concentrates that thrown away or not used and you know never follow that i can't say that although i will say that i have reclaim that tastes better than this does oh shit there you go it doesn't doesn't hit as hard that's for sure yeah now on the second dab i'm kind of getting it i'm actually getting a little stuffy not some stuffy brained you know like there's a layer of fog between the center and the exterior of my so i don't think you guys can see all of these holes but they're all clogged so this was i soaked this in alcohol this was brand new this generally doesn't happen for uh you know i don't i don't dab a lot so weeks or months but this happened within two poles within two dabs this thing is completely clogged i can't use this anymore and so i don't know maybe i'll just end up giving this away because i don't really need that in my my lungs and so let me hit this real quick though you know what brain finally pulled forward i know exactly what it is the feeling we're getting is from lipids plant lipids which kind of shoots my crc theory out of the water though because it would have been removed in the color remediation process because of the cold temperature and the carbon we'll see i gave him a quarter for quality and care it shouldn't uh clog my my rig within two dabs whatever you're doing if the if it is the lipids reduce the amount of fat um or maybe you know i just shouldn't buy this type if the sugar wax whatever it's called is that fatty um and clogs rigs that quick like what's it doing to my lungs that's what i'm better than that is a big concern about concentrates is lipids in them um although when you get the distillate as well like out of a pens there's another concern with distillate because it's uh you know got no other phytochemicals to kind of help along the way and entourage you it's awesome yeah mm-hmm all right um moving on to brand and packaging so uh you know we we kind of made fun of well i did i i'll own it like i think i think this is really this is satire to me i think this is funny um to have a louis vuitton style brand to be bougie and uh really it's just pretentious i think it's hilarious if they did it as a joke i i would i'd be all down for it especially like aggro couture it's it's incongruous um so i i love it i'm gonna whether they they thought it was supposed to be funny or not um i'm gonna give them a full point for branding because they think it's genius um but they have to take themselves a lot less seriously if if they're real about this like if if they're serious they need to like not be serious about this yeah full point you can get a full point yeah i don't know i mean like i'm disappointed by the cost and effect you know like like again you come in this is gonna be your top shelf your your primo well this is just for brand uh and packaging right well i mean that's what i'm saying i'm going with the expectation you set this expectation and like you're saying about the bougie it's like like diego palser man like when they said they had a whole store that was going to be all top end you're like right weed's not ready for that yeah i mean everybody talks about being like the iphone store or whatever like making it more tech you know friendly to older people but now people aren't scared like like this is a bullshit concept of like spa environment out there which is isn't it fitting now that it zips and it's a discount retailer because the whole bougie shit just doesn't work dude you can just see that work in that spot don't underestimate it man there's some bougie shops that charge oh yeah you you could be that way if you could if you could afford rent to like say capitol hill area like you could be a bougie or not capitol hill maybe uh like with bellevue maybe or something i don't know you know like a hot there's there's plenty of neighborhoods where they're great have more than half a million tourists a couple of bellingham neighborhoods that are here there you go real uh lit up there i think it's a little early to to kind of focus on that in the industry personally i mean we don't even have infused coffee yet so like where's your priorities at people because some coffee um where are you guys at on on brand and packaging i'm gonna give him a half point just because i just you know i mean if it's being comedy yeah that's cool too but again if you're this is your high end for 30 bucks and as uh that that that feel me thing man that's uh it's it's real and it clogged your bones that's just gross yeah that was actually pretty damn surprising um so this is actually agro mechanics right i've actually reviewed a bunch of their cannabis products over the past years it's usually cheap on the shelves this so agro mechanics the aggro of agro couture is their flower brand of the name brand right but the uh slab mechanics is their general cheapo line of product out there on the shelves of concentrates so this is all of their own flower to my knowledge going into this brand either that or you know everybody's saying it's their own but they're so everybody's sourcing from somebody else because there's not enough brands that are growing enough to meet the need so yeah uh so these guys aren't just this brand right so they have other brands this seems more like the kind of process on the brand point i think it's pretty legit i mean they got something out there it's not just the same you know it kind of is but it isn't you know it's not the same hipster logos it's slightly different i tore mine um but i tear shit when it's in my hands it just happens i like it i like the branding i like the little sativa thing that i had just there i like how they have that little card on the bottom in the package that's pretty cool i'm gonna give them a full point on this as well even though i did not want to damn it um i i'm going to give them a full point because they are on the shelf this is going to draw the eye the look on the product is going to draw the eye too after that we're not talking about we're just saying hey branding and stuff and yeah okay yeah i get it i just uh you know it as i look at this this the bougie wii the bougie branding i don't catch on to that like like josh caught that because he's into the marketing and investments and all that shit you caught that because you're into uh you know branding as well it's all about marketing i see just uh uh uh this diamond i see it's trying to be fancy but uh you know uh the couture thing doesn't vibe with me like it's more like all right you want to be high-end you better they fucking come with it but you don't so you know i gotta be like all right you're okay it's not i'm not their demo i'm not their primary demo for this product like i said it draws the eye it makes you want to look at it i think that as far as you know cannabis products are concerned in the packaging i mean look at the back looks pretty cool it's got more info it's at least professionally done got all these little components to it um i had to straighten out uh the package is not technically straight in this photo at the top i had to adjust some perspective things because i don't know why their cards aren't square actually though uh sorry to cut you out on that i guess they only get point nine points now but you um because you've you've been to the grow though right you've you've seen their their sources i've seen i i've not i mean just looking at their products and smoking a lot of it over the years i've seen them in a few different vendor days talking about their products and things like that i mean they're they're good people looking to do good business and put good products on the market i um i don't think this is really high-end product though i don't think that they're like it looks like it might be but they're not really saying hey this is the fancy dancing because it's not 55 bucks like that's 50 bucks is is like the top end price range so this is still mids and so man i'm gonna say this and somebody might not like it but you know how uh how like monster has like monster trucks and fast cars and all that bullshit because it appeals to a certain midzie kind of brain mentality and and it's kind of like thinking this is fancy and mistaking it for you know what's really fancy i get that and that's a big place in the market man that's 60 percent of consumers are right in that like i'm shitty and just want to have a personality through the things i buy yeah and this is that target demo gotcha my wife gets suckered into that when she buys wine at grocery outlet and she's look she's looking at the logo and we're like like you're in like the 399 section here like what are you doing yeah you know if you're if you're in the four buck wine actually like i love four dollar wine i i reviewed a lot of that too before i started uh doing weed but um yeah if you're in that just just go just go with it pick your style and hope they did it well yeah i mean it's not bad stuff i'm not again a concentrate person so even it's like me judging hemp i don't fucking do that shit every day i mean like i tell you guys earlier i smoked the wash and bloodco gave me uh i think almost an ounce of three different flavors and smoking it all in three days like it was it was like oxygen they replied they sent me an email saying you smoked it already i'm like because you know we have we had technical issues for the the chong show which will happen again happen next week but like when it's good weed it's like you don't really notice sometimes and except for your pocketbook notices then you have to be like oh i got a yes i want quantity i got called quality instead of quantity or whatever you know like a mid i've been smoking narrows for lately just for good mids but so we've got 3.6 out of seven so that's a 52 percent so yeah it feels about right what's the other one what's the other concentrate that we did how did that rate um i think that was an 86 percent i think that got six out of seven that was from gabriel gabriel yeah actually yeah gabriel's fucking fire dude like even their their their stuff theirs that's out on the market in the mids range is fucking fire especially if it's their weed um i i don't know anything about the company other than their weed is good fucking good but that's what all good product comes down to right is a good plant because and then also course process if we go concentrates because like uh you can do something like co2 extract versus or you know using somebody like eating labs technology there's different ways that you can different differentiate yourself from everything else but it's always about the source material in the end it's always about the plant and how is purge taken care of you know and then unfortunately that does reflect in the concentrate but most people don't give a fuck about that there's like yeah check out jim mccoso with flow technology all right on flow technology if you couldn't understand that it all came through loud and clear man we all speak mouth full of smoke cool yeah he's got all kinds of crazy stuff if you're looking for like um like crystal like dried stuff for ingredients uh this is like sugar and salt kind of stuff so if you're looking for all kinds of uh techniques he's no it's wild sugar's not that hard to make neither is the salts you can infuse those relatively very easily that's pretty much the only home infusion i've ever really done is making some sugar and then yeah well what's the thing called that breaks up like alcohol what breaks up the plant um this isn't what it's about the solvent yeah it's cause that's what breaks up the the specific components right like isn't that what helps yeah yes uh well there's a whole plan really i mean there is but there isn't like a press yeah i mean rosin so rosie is the only solventless one people who say that co2 is solventless are fucking lying to themselves and everybody they say it to no offense to if one of you two says that shit but it's true co2 is a chemical that's used to strip chemicals out of the plant this definition of a solvent scientifically is is that it's the liquid that's or the substance that's used to separate a solution um yeah and that's basically what you're doing you're you're making a solution also a lot of people do co2 use alcohol they use an ethanol extraction along the way and to get to the first level and then use co2 to pull the thc out and they're like it was salvageless all we used was alcohol and co2 and that blows my mind just like own it if you're making rosin though that's the only one yeah and time that's it but if you're doing anything you should also have solvent less because as we saw in oregon in the early days 2015 2016 when the regulatory board stopped everything because of you know motels in florida exploding from eho so i always say like something's going to happen from some testing somewhere down the line if you want to keep skews on the shelf always have a solvent-less product because eventually regulators somewhere down the line are going to wreak havoc on that sector like we saw with vape gate for you know similar if not different uh they're trying now with the thc caps and bullshit but the thing is with that product the concentrate product uh in a regulated market it's how it's both safe and efficient because you know uh uh we're down to the point where nano emulsion is a thing so yeah you know even for to get to nano emulsion you have to have regular extract it's all about the the plant first and then the plant being squeezed or mixed or you know because water hash is a thing you know that's you know there's just different ways to break the plant up but then when you're taking that broken apart you you shake it up again you put it in a centrifuge or a fucking you mix it with alcohol you to get to the next part you know because this is clearly not something that was squeezed with heat this is something probably i don't know man it is butane and propane yeah this is a hydrocarbon mix for sure but so like even okay so so josh you said you know you need to have a solvent-less uh option what are the real options that that producer processors have for solvent lists though i mean they can make hashish which you know is cheap takes a lot of keef and and you know doesn't sell for a lot of money there's not a huge uh cost to it though they can make bubble hash which is if you're doing it good and you're going to sell it well it's got a specific market it's got to be really really good and that's costly and has a very low yield right and then for concentrates maybe you can do rosin but right it's flower or plant rosin right straight from flower particulates it looks dirty it's dark every time right and if you're doing bubble hash rosin which might look beautiful might i've seen some that was like whitey white white and just amazing and uh it's got ultra low yields though the bubble hash has low yields and the rosin has low yields and you're looking at like a two percent yield out of that shit when you might get 18 out of bho so it's hard to say what solvent list options they actually have you know you could do selective drops though like we've seen with lyra canagars he'll do a selective drop at selective stores and he sells out by the end of the weekend so when he drops it on a friday morning um if you don't get it within the next 24-48 hours um you know then they're sold out so that's that would be my suggestion is just to have that skew on there as insurance isn't that how it really should be though essentially in this market like like every every grower every farm should sell out eventually because if you have a good product and people pull off the shelves like when when it was medical and there was a fair market competition you always had great call quality weed but now you got these people just trying to keep their name on the shelf so they're partnering with other farms to you know take their flower slap their name in it and throw it like that just seems like a shitty business way way to do business that's a consequence of the market model we have in washington though man yeah it just is because there's no vertical vertical integration man dude you hit another nerf um there were 33 3 400 ish licenses at first right josh thinking can craig not like 33 17 or something like that we're down to under a thousand there's under a thousand active licenses right now man so how the hell are is that happening well it's happening because the model was built on a lottery system there was no funding available there's no infrastructure behind it it was not vertically integrated and the market was at a point where the taxation at 37 47 effective tax rate fucks every grower because they're getting the they're the first guy they have the biggest amount of costs and the least amount of of profit protection too yeah yeah and the least amount of protection because what happens if a store gets one bad crop like product line from a brand oh well they don't buy them anymore they fucking get something else in the space they take the shelf above it and fill up space and everything's okay nobody's the wiser happens to a farm they're done what's funny is a thousand stores only operating right now and cannabis was what 30 pandemic the second that's total crops your processor and license is what i'm talking about okay but still i mean just uh because during the medical times there was thousands of stores everywhere dude like literally thousands and everybody was making money everybody was you succeeded by being good period yeah that's how mostly you know that's the legacy people like washington budko and troublizing you know they got high price points because the everybody expects like okay it costs this much to you know they're not rolling they're not i mean they're doing okay but they're not retired they're probably growing their views but nobody's nobody's getting rich quite it's going to revert to this same you know buyer behaviors that everyone else has so it's going to be price and convenience so there was a report that just came out from mj business daily that showed pre-rolls had increased 20 percent over the last year um jim belushi's farm had rolled like quarter million joints last year that was 35 of his revenue and it's all about price and convenience people want to grab it they want to you know burn it and go they don't want to spend you know money on a rig like vape exhale they don't want to carry around you know a dab rig or a torch they don't want to have a bong the majority of people just want to be able to buy something consume it and then move on have it be portable all of that it's about convenience and price yeah no totally agree like fake pens and everything and then and then when you're a high consumer like that and then you realize like the the waste that you produce and the guilt that's occurred yeah that's tough i mean there's layers to it there's reasons why the the licenses are reducing but a big part of it like the whole point of that was that you you don't buy cannabis the same way you used to in medical days i was not here for medical cannabis i i'm a carpet bagger who showed up in 2015. that's someone that's called me plenty of times i've been told that dude i care right um but so like you don't deal with cannabis the same way you can't go buy it the way you did in 2014 and so you're not competing at a shelf space for just who's got the best quality who do i like the most right now it's who's got the flashiest brand who cut the right deal for the store who's got the right growing methods you know like who are they getting their weed from like you said miggy everybody's buying each other's weed right like they have to because there's fewer brands than there are sha space for them and the market just shaped that way so whose weed are they getting even you know maybe you trusted them last week because their weed was good but they got a bum deal and they still got to sell it because they don't have the choice no one's got the choice of just saying ah fuck it i'm not going to sell this batch because it's no bueno like you might that's how it used to be that's how it used to be in the medical times was like uh if a store said you have shitty weed we're not gonna buy your shit like there was not this obligation now it's mold to gold we'll take anything go ahead and blast it and we'll sell it and that's words will always tell you oh well the customer demands it just like the customer demands the highest thc percent no they fucking don't that's like pepsi saying our customers don't demand single-use products be eliminated bullshit the all the smoking important for us is the market created by the lcb right this was nothing to do with like because the market that existed before was total about quality in in quantity and like it it was we're still not there yet like that's what i'm so sad about this is all bullshit like so i'm looking at this thing like the the plastic here and then the plastic here you know why not just do this with a tamper seal i don't know i don't there's other there's better ways to do shit but you got to sell it i mean until they can get some you know augmented reality virtual reality where you know you're on your phone and you incentivize this is the best weed i've smoked this is the mostly this actually is the jar from uh some of the the most expensive wheat i've smoked in weeks and this is how it's sold it's got other stuff in it now but they look like this and it's in the shelf and jar like that and that's what i'll pay 50 bucks for um i'm not paying 50 bucks for anything that's coming in a clam shell i'm just not and that's that's that's my point of view on the marketplace some people aren't like that but i think the old and that's the old school way of getting it right like i like those little makeup jars worth um i'm with mickey on this one we don't need the clamshells we don't need all that bullshit and we can't we can find ways around it but consumers don't just buy from what's the best like i was saying now it's the brands and it's what the store got a deal on what the word of mouth manager yes is good you know you know it's all about the shelf space you know that's what that's what 502 created because yeah but you won't need that if you can utilize technology like vr ar and gamifies you come in and you have your your phone and once you hover over what you're looking for you know through filters or whatever and then it pops up and somebody tells you about hey we got this aggro co tour and you're like do i want to buy that or not no move on to the next thing they're going to be other ways if something like that or or the next thing whatever but there's going to be different ways with technology to not have to look at this because when you go in that's not helping anyone when you have hundreds of products that uncle likes and you're looking you're so overwhelmed by 2 000 skus you're like i don't even know so you even go online and then you have your own filters so there'll be something at some day where it's like you know what was that one mobile game was it uh mario or something where you're running around and you're trying to grab uh there's quite a few of those but pokemon go oh yeah that was pokemon go oh yeah yeah no so so level five interactive scott mckinley's uh producer of the dab roast he's got a vr app that works pretty good that i've seen a few different brands using i just think that you know consumer adoption with the tech we currently have is holding back ar everybody would do it if google glasses had actually like been able to continue and there you go and we had our we had our wearables and we could have an ar viewpoint just by like bifocal ar fucking gimme that's what it's going to take and i think that's what it's going to take to make virtual conferences a reality because right now the the conferences i'm seeing mj bizcon was a big flop everything i've seen is a flop from conferences and expos and everything else so until they do vr with some kind of hardware like you were talking about michael and they can integrate that i don't think they'll ever substitute live events no but it'd be interesting once all that happens because the people who who have compromised immune systems or can't travel for whatever reason will be able to finally be there as well digitally did you you know i thought the emerge technology was pretty cool um that's the best i've seen so far yeah yeah but you know and and back to like it's funny how josh and michael you guys at the same point about how i don't buy weed the same as i did 10 years ago right within medical times right and uh uh but did you have a pterodactyl deliver it no but i used to be able to smell it and fucking know like and and touch it but now i just walk in the store tonight and i'm realizing about tenders because i don't give a fuck right i wanna i have a price point and i just wanna know what you guys recommend like that's it like i have 20 bucks today and i buy i like that idea of being able to trust butt tenders i wish i lived in a world where i could trust blood tenders well i'm just saying they're not gonna they're all stoners they're you know they're gonna give me and if they're pushing shitty shit then it's like you know well if your store's carrying it though it's their job though you know i mean like like the reason they get the shitty shit is it's cheap and the reason why it's cheap is the reason they get it too is because they can profit margin it and then because it's cheap it's an easy buy because most people don't have a lot of money and all they need to do is push a little bit and the owner gets a little incentive and he turns 55 000 profit in a day that he cost him like a 400 spiff and his team all pushes the same shitty shit for a day like that happens man that's that's no i guess you have retail and so i'm i'm i like personally i'm gun shy of trusting blood tenders and i i'm i know that you build relationships like a mofo so like i would trust your blood tenders if i were you the stores right like the reef dude i like the reef and and they're all pretty knowledgeable in downtown seattle right uh uncle likes to on the other hand there's some dumb motherfuckers that i've i've met that don't have like i walked in you guys familiar with the filters for glass pipes they look like jumping jacks right and i call them jumping jacks and that guy just looked at me with a blank stare and i'm like ah fuck this place you know man cal props made of glass so my wheels can stay i dude a security guard fucking had to explain to him i'm like i'm done oh wow i haven't used those in a few years but the last time i did i like went into one head shop and i was like dude i'm gonna buy five of these and the guy was like no one ever really buys them i'm like oh that's cool so i gave him like 25 bucks for him and he pulled out a sack and gave me like 30. he's like no one ever buys him just take the rest of them here's a series of uh ironic events is i feel the same way about uh the joint and so there's the joint and bearing and so i'm walking my puppies and so i ended up like stopping by the joint and beerian uh saw this online 30 off saint patty's day so i ended up getting this aggro couture live resin dabs from a place where you know you walk in and it's a new it's a new bud tender every time i'm in there and i only go in because it's it's you know convenient well the joy also has no soul i mean that's what i'm saying like there's some places you can tell like because i mean we all know that owner with his whatever history and i mean i knew when they were in uh medical times you know like a lot of these guys made money and are not really nice people you know off whatever but you know what props to you for making your money you know like uh what's that other guy they have a hard guy i mean like i don't care like that that's why i do the activism done that shit because i want people to have boat trips and vacations it's what it's about you know pay your kids and shit mike like michael you got your thing going with your advertising you know you're not a carpetbagger man you're legit fucking player you know oh yeah no people have told me that though so i'm jokingly saying it i'm okay with who i am i like me all right but i do here's the thing that happens when i do go into stores and i try so hard not to do this but um if you could uh could share that for me friend i feel like this guy every single time when i go into the store and i don't want to i don't want to be like a dick about it and be like come on but sometimes people tell me things blood tenders just say shit that i know that's not true or like we'll talk things about a brand because they're they heard some nugget it's kind of like other stoner wisdom you know you know what i mean like uh how it stays in your hair for 17 days or whatever all the bullshit that we've learned stoner wisdom i feel that's kind of like filters into the bud tenders as well sometimes when they're not experienced you haven't been there for a while yeah and so i try so hard not to go into a place and be like the fuck are you saying and why because i want to give everybody a chance and and you know i like product so it's a tough boat for me i i trust no one but i love them all and there's a few butt tenders out there like if they say i should try something i will like go find it i'll drive halfway across town to get it i got my go-to's but then if i don't see the price or the thing that i want to get then i just well there you go i don't know anything else so let's go with what you would do i'm going to be seeing a lot of bud tenders on a 20 this is the fifth year where i've gone to uh 20 stores on 420 i'll probably split it up three days like i did last year social distancing all that stuff so i'll do seven stores a day um we should meet up on the 24th for the next chronic club i'll go shopping on the 18th to 19th and 20th of april so would you like me to get one product or should i get a you know chronic claws you know sack of of stuff because it is it is 420 so what would you guys like you wanted something that that's you know 80 off or would you like a variety of things and we just do like an unboxing of uh of stuff and just gets super high on the 24th yeah i'm i'm down either one because i mean if you get one thing it's gonna be really expensive and good if you get multiple things it's just gonna be like well i'm i'm open as well um it's up to you guys i'm gonna be going to seven stores in tacoma seven stores in seattle and six stores in everett oh wow you should film the bartenders like have a question for each one of them like i have this will be the fifth year in a row i've had at least three questions for the um guy that comes in i always ask how many people have you had how many expecting then when i see the bud tender i say what's your favorite strain and what's the number one product that you're seeing being sold and i just tally that up and well that's good intel i mean that that's legit intel but look it's a small data set but it's interesting to see what happens yeah mickey wants some culture shit though i'm thinking well no just just ask them if you know what the intro category system is like see if you get stared at or if like they're like oh yeah man that's a thing that's in you that i don't really know much about because doctor shit but like it's a legit fucking you know why cannabis is uh i could tell them like i have a podcast it's called the endocannabinoid system do you know what that is and then just look at it with a blank stare like yeah yeah dude hell yeah dude i saw it i was on youtube right yeah totally totally oh man hey guys it's a good hour though rose yep yep we should balance michael do you have a preference on uh santa claus or i think we should premium pack it up with uh let's get something good we've had a few like poo poos along the way let's get something we know it's gonna be like or at least can go and thinking like this is gonna be good yeah we'll get some fire coming on the 24th uh going shopping on april 20th so you have to come back to the chronic club and find out what it is all right wrecked because i'm actually going to be on a tea break till then so i'm going to get wrecked on that show guys all right

naturals island sweet skunk uh sativa um i tried it before it was really nice uh pretty early today i got a bunch of stuff to do but i'm gonna smoke some um i got a three pack see it's nice and sealed try to show you anything on it i'll add like all the other videos i'll add a description on the of all the details they have online on it pretty cold out i got my hoodie on today but uh i went up i'll show you what they look like it's really windy and cold today feels like the coldest day it's been they look like big joints they look like really big joints these are half gram joints but these are the biggest half gram joints that i've ever seen they've got nice little labels on the filters um so really smooth tastes like a lemony skunk island's sweet skunk it's pretty big it's a little bit strong he's like lemon skunk it's like like a lemon kush and a skunk number one pretty strong it's got like a little dry taste in the back of your throat it's not bad it uh leaves like a sweet taste on your tongue really good okay think it was 15 bucks for these uh three pre-rolls and i think it's probably probably over two grams it says 1.5 grams but i think it's over two grams i've actually bought this week before it's funny story there's a street performer a chick she was dancing in the cold i had no change to give to her i felt really bad at first i knew how many people would give her money especially in hamilton so i had a pack of these in my pocket and i gave it to her and she's like oh i don't smoke queen and she's seen it it's like oh it's bar marley weed she said i'll smoke that she took it it's very harsh it's uh it'll grip your lungs it's very strong and smooth at first but it's very strong it's just stevia so i should feel up i got some computer work to do so see how well it goes and i'm about halfway down the joint and i think i'm good so overall price i've rated some other joints that tastes a lot better for example uh cush sticks it kind of has a similar buzz but much better taste so overall i'll give this one 4.4 on price it's fair price big joints really big joints but uh the aftertaste is horrible thanks for watching you", "9g17u885MO8": "[Music] look what I've got here this is a beautiful green bud of something called planet Doce and it's from alien labs and we love reviewing alien labs and I got this flower and buds and roses dispensary in Studio City and they have great parking over there so if you get a chance to go over there they really had some top-notch flowers over there and you can see this flower comes in this jar and it says alien labs and this is outdoor flower and it says planet dosing and this flower is a heavy hitter 27% from an outdoor flower unbelievable so usually I always think that outdoor flowers aren't as smooth as indoor flowers and I think that she has a ruled definitely generally true but once you get to alien labs outdoor fire let's see if they outdoor flower can be really smooth out of a per cup so this flower has a og gassy taste I would say more gassy than even og and this bud is sticky and lately a beginning lot less really sticky buns Gary Payton really sticky and so is planet dos a very sticky and for an outdoor flower this flower of apes and tastes great smooth it's not as smooth as up indoor flower but it's generally smooth so what did I think a planet dough saying this flower strong really had a hazy feeling it's an indica hybrid and in the end we're looking for the best something that gives you the perma gorringe smile that's what it takes to get the nine so what am i given planet Doce I'm giving this flower in eight point seven five I would say that it didn't get the nine because it didn't grin me out I would say it's strong but for me personally I like the indoor flowers better but I'm gonna keep trying anything from alien labs and this is a smooth flower for being an outdoor flower growing dirt because in the dirt flowers you can actually maybe taste a little bit of dirt from the vapor cup I think so you can definitely taste the difference anyway we're looking for the best and planet Doce by Elling Labs is definitely worth the try thanks for joining in if you want to see vapour cup you can see that vapor cup calm I'm telling you this thing is through the roof good and you'll save a lot of wheat and it's just smooth as silk if you want to see LA's best

welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we're back again for another stray interview today we are checking out a cross between two strains that we reviewed individually actually super recently I didn't say within the last five reviews probably yeah we've got the biscotti crust with the gushers white connected this stuff is so fireman so a little bit about how I picked this up I actually just went down a family vacation down to Disneyland and I ran out of weed on the first day classic right [ __ ] classic Funkmaster done another four so started panicking about seven o'clock and I was like damn I had this homie that hit me on IG but said he wasn't free till about nine o'clock yeah this stuff looks crazy both structures insane anyways I'll make it short and sweet got the stuff from connected in Santa Ana look through about eight strains on the show which we're all pretty decent and this was the last one she pulled out and one word that I want you guys to really look for and when he bud tenders are talking is fresh she said I got this fresh new batch of biscotti gushers and I said I want to see that she pulled it out I gave it one whiff and you know what fresh weed smells like I said I'll take four of those no when it's fresh you know - fresh yeah it wouldn't be the CCC if we actually remembered the extra no definitely wouldn't I didn't even get this joint lit so it's all good we're stumbling out the gates on this biscotti gushers but we're about to get real lit with you guys and go into a little strain revision so you showed me this stuff yesterday and right away I really wanted to smoke some we held off until today had a lot of [ __ ] to do this morning and I was able to come back here and finally get the close-ups on this stuff so I'm really excited to finally be able to get my hands and break into it a little bit mm-hmm I gotta say one of the two best strain reviews that we've done in the past couple months I would say is definitely the biscotti by itself and the gushers and after taking a pull off this the combination is amazing too I mean it tastes they literally taste like they [ __ ] each other so of the first two that we reviewed the biscotti and then the gusher so the biscotti was also from connected and the gushers was from big Smoky farms right which of those two did you like better wait Cushie gushers was from crisper breakfast or fish for breakfast is the one who bred the gusher stream but the backs that we got was from big Smoky farms yes I'm sorry okay and then was the next question which one did you like better Scotty or the gushing I personally like the gushers better yeah see I actually like the biscotti better but I did like both both were really fire so when I first thing when we cracked this when I open these jars I wanted to see which way this was gonna be leaning heavier which characteristics I was gonna find first I know based off the look I see more of the biscotti look on this one yeah the look okay but on the smell mm-hmm I get gushers which is honestly what I look for in a cross if I wanna cross two of my favorite strains I want to get the look of one and the smell of the other most of the time right most of the time that's what you're looking for so this is honestly a great cross by connected here it's got that sweeter fruity more than the gushers I'd say well I'd say that is the overpowering one but there's a little bit of that gelato in there too which to me I've never really been able to differentiate between the scottie and just other really good gelato you know right for the most part it's it's pretty much the same turf profile and high at least for my palate and I'm definitely getting a little bit of both in there but like you said I think it leans on the smell a little bit heavier towards the gusher side looks a little bit more the biscotti side how does it smoke in the joint Europe in yin um you know I was I'm gonna keep it 100 I was expecting a little bit more flavor to punch through and I'm not getting it I'm hoping it comes through on the bomb it definitely tastes good do not get me wrong I'm not hating here but you know and it definitely did get me high though I'm definitely kind of rambling a little bit not rambling but like it's hard to like put my sentences together a little bit that effective that one in there yeah it's got me very like cerebral very high very inside my own head it's like tough to put sentences together I'm gonna go and hit this bomb and see how it tastes it tastes really good out of the bomb I'm gonna tell you right now this one is bong weed in my opinion you know I take this joint maybe just a little bit tighter than we would normally roll on yeah or at least that's how it's smoking this stuff's super sticky so not gonna it's crazy sticky you gotta roll it a little bit looser you know that tastes a lot better out of a bomb it took me a while to get that lit so I did roll that a little too tight I apologize maybe that is docking it a little bit on the flavor maybe once it gets gonna get a little bit more flavor but out of bong tastes pretty good that's up there man I mean this stuff is really good like I said I'm not trying to hate on it by any means I'm just giving my honest opinion definitely taste is better out of the bong like you said I think this is bong we let me go ahead and hit the joint one more time a couple more times so basically for me this is just really interesting because it's super rare that we get to you know not necessarily smoke a strain but like when we do a review we sit down and we really kind of lock into a strain or maybe pay more attention than we normally would just smoking at casually right so being able to sit down and review the gushers and then review the biscotti really close together like that was within the last month and a half yeah I would definitely say so yeah and then to have this right here is just super interesting to see the cross on I don't remember the exact ratings that we gave the other ones I know the but I think the biscotti was a 10 if it wasn't a 10 it was like a Niner 9.5 and then I think I gave the gushers just a slightly lower rating like an 8 or 9 okay I totally forget you know if you guys want to know more about these strengths individually the gushers and the biscotti you can go ahead and click that info card right up there but yeah across on this honestly is amazing you know very good characteristics and like I said it's fresh and you know I don't think it's gonna pass a stick factor just because it had a great little sticky note sticking to the table more than my fingers yeah no it's definitely sticky so this is this is another one of those bugs right that's gonna have more of the insect expected yeah so outside of the bud still pretty sticky but inside of the bud you could stay there all day that'll stay there for a while you know so I think this stuff definitely fresh as you said but I think jarred at the perfect time because you bought this what four or five days ago yes yep no I think it is perfect like I said man when the bud tender like I looked at like eight strains and I was like yeah it's cool but you know I'm gonna keep it real for the price you know sixty five dollars or something like that out the door you know I was like kind of cringing a little bit and then she pulled this out and I was like you know I would gladly pay that for this you got this at the connected store I did so I've never been there what's their store like experience honestly they're building out the front of it right now and the front of it looks super nice but I had to go in through like this side door and you know it was nice but you know it wasn't nothing spectacular but they are building out the huge front and if you want if you go there you'll know what I'm talking about and it looked nice honestly that they had really nice staff did branding and good flower if they had the alien labs I picked up the gelato 41 - it's already gone I believe to that before I even got homeless it was so far but yeah I mean good staff you know pretty store and I'm sure when they opened up the front it's gonna be dope Connie goes to a point that we were talking about a few weeks ago - how like you brought home a bunch of fire flavors I think all of them had some version of gelato and them in one way or another oh yeah like I said man gelato is the new new family favorite these days it's just getting bored out but you know it's not a bad thing it's fire though it is it really is gelato is fire man the 41:33 25 one thing I have noticed is some of the gelato I would not say this stuff from connected none of the stuff from connected I've seen but some of the other stuff I guess more some of the black market gelato that I've seen that does look and smell like gelato for the most part some of it tends to be a little bit unstable genetics oh yeah like you do see kind of some of those little half forms see the previous lines yeah like no super white seeds yeah I mean you're gonna see that it's just like these some of these genetics haven't been stabilized I haven't found any in these jars yet but you will find it in like some Street gelato I've seen it in dispensary weed and black market weeded this way and it just seems like you know maybe not every Fino of it is super stable you know I'm not sure where everyone is getting their cuts that they're doing for a lot of this yeah oh that's what I'm talking about it tastes good through the joint the bomb is what gets you that crunch to the head yeah I'm not digging this joint my bed mmm you can't wait a mall I'm curious if it what if it's really good Bobby there is not a particular joint it's definitely bong weed and it's probably that should he join that I'm telling you I'm gonna put these on blast right now I don't like these stuffable combs by raw or any stuffable harmful blow your own I'm going back to roll my own I gave these a shot maybe there's someone out there maybe you guys like them I don't well we got that Fox for free of those 50 packs or the 50 pack gives three cones so we've been using them for the videos lately you don't like them dude I feel like they if you grind up the weed they usually work better you know it's they smoke like [ __ ] if you break it up by hand and stickier weed like this just doesn't yeah [ __ ] that no no smash away if you roll your own I'm gonna roll my own from now on as far as raiding this stuff I'm gonna go I'm gonna lead off with buzz I think it's pretty obvious to you guys if you guys watch all of our videos we're a lot higher I know and I'm super high this shit's hitting at 27 percent THC that's that's that's that's a lot and I'm definitely scrambled like I said it's hard to put sentences together so I'm gonna say the best feature of this sweetest is the buzz I'm gonna give it a 10 yeah I like the buzz I like the so buzz I'm gonna give 10 I'm just gonna bang it out like this it was 10 flavored 9 look eight and a half only because there's some of these buds that are not trimmed up as well as some of these prime knows I'm not about 50/50 in my jar over here not knocking on anything yet and what else is there smell [ __ ] I could give the smell like at nine and a half so I don't know what that averages out to but this feels like a solid nine to me mine okay that's a very solid rating I like the pure biscotti a little bit better I like this definitely better than the gusher I'm gonna take it right now I'm gonna take my rating to the 10th scale you guys will see it on me in a second but so the two best features is this weed is the high at a 10 and I'm gonna give the smell of 10 as well but there are a few flaws like he said the trim job and I think he could be a little stickier for how fresh it is even though it is pretty gummy I like my wing just a little more stickier and I'm being super critical guys like connectives killing it they're one of the hottest brands out right now smoke super clean to the smoke super clean it tastes clean it's got good expansion but it doesn't make you cough too much it's literally super fireweed to sum up I got 10 on the high 10 on the looks I got and I'm sorry 10 on the high 10 on the smell 8.5 on the looks and I'm gonna give it overall nine point two nine point two nine point two you heard it here first guys boom definitely impressed with the quality of all the stuff that we've been seeing from connected especially over the last six months or so in a time where you've seen in my opinion a lot of other brands who had sustained good reputations for quality and consistency a lot of them have taken a little bit of a dip in the last six months and I feel like connected has kept steady or maybe taken a step up slight step pro at least with the stuff that I've seen you know all the stuff that we've reviewed from them on the show has been really good all the stuff that you know we tried that we hasn't made its way to you know you yet it all gives me really not like this I'm super high and I think that doesn't for another streamer VGA for the CCC I'm Danny and I am Shane we'll be back with more great gang do your thing do you think we have this mofo with some paint doubt cuz smoking penetrate so sticky Yoji smelling breaks and swiping on the best to alleviate distress so he gets to the chest wooden roaches the rest", "Ih8fFSPb73M": "damn so after first leg guys this looks beautiful it's nice clean it's white what's up guys it's your boy jose from the bay back at it with another video today we're going to be doing a little strain review guys because we got something interesting at work today and also like man i think that's worth the cash out guys because i don't usually buy like dabs are this expensive because this did run me up to like a hundred dollars after taxes i don't usually get stuff like this guys i feel like it's expensive and i do run through them really quick so i feel like damn am i really ready to drop a hundred dollars on just one single gram of dabs or concentrate and i was like damn this might be the one guys so this is what i ended up picking up that boom by popping select it's called the the strain itself is called gargoyle melon berry um it's a live rosin butter so it's recommending guys that you burn it at like a lower temperature than usual i usually stick to like the green color into my puff coat i think that's going to be a good a good temperature to like um burn this at i feel like blue might be a little too soft green might be just bright enough red might be a little too hot and then white is definitely way too much guys we're going to go ahead and give it a shot on this color and then after that if that's not enough i'm gonna bump it up to red and see how we we like it there um again i don't think i've ever spent that much money on concentrate guys so that was a hundred dollar gram right here basically um it's eighty dollars before taxes and after california tax and excise tax it does bump the price up hella more um so we're looking at maybe like a hundred dollars per gram um it is a hybrid strain the total percentage of thc in this in this product itself is 79 guys so it's pretty high um i like the packaging i like the black shout out to papa select this is not paid advertisement at all but i just love the product i haven't bought it myself but i have attended other events that they host and they always stab us out and the products always fire so i'm just i'm excited to see what this tastes like guys i'm rocking their merch too because shout out to them bro i have hella shirts they give me hella shirts hella merch so shout out to you guys you guys are dope um let's go ahead and taste this guys i'm excited i like the packaging [Music] flavor as nature intended in small batches is what they said on the packaging guys so i like the packaging guys um it's nice and black it has a little let me show you guys that as a little people at the bottom that not a lot of dabs have so you're not able to like actually see what you're buying when you're buying dabs they come in like sealed box and you're not able to see what you get until you actually get home and open it and a lot of the times you're disappointed because it's like damn that's not the consistency that i actually wanted um so when i looked at this one guys i was like damn that consistency is perfect for like the puffco guys it's a butter or it's a batter so it's thicker than other like sauces and all that sort of stuff so this is just going to break down a piece and toss that straight into the puff coat damn so after first leg guys this looks beautiful it's nice clean it's white i just got it out of the fridge so shout out to cat cat said that like when it's cold you're not able to smell it because like the terpene profile is it's like frozen or it's like cold so you're not able to smell it so right now it's not as cold but it is kind of cold i can kind of smell it and you do smell the melons guys i'm excited to like actually try this i feel like it's gonna be a bomb ass experience guys man me show you guys real quick mina tell me have you guys doubted something like that before comment down below let me know what you guys are smoking on guys this looks fire guys i'm not gonna lie i don't think i've had anything like this before so i'm excited guys um let's go ahead and give it a shot let's take a little baby dab for now it doesn't focus guys but you guys can see that that's a little dab let's see what's up let's just try it let's give it a shot let's taste it let's not forget the pearl i forgot i have a pearl guys let's put that in there boom we're gonna let that warm up let's see is this hundred dollar dab worth it guys comment down below before i try it what do you guys think do you guys think it's gonna is it gonna be worth it is the flavor profile gonna be there is the high going to be there let's see what do you guys think how's everybody's day going so far i had just got out of work i'm uploading a video right now this just vibrated cheers guys hope you guys are dabbing for too it's nice and smooth is what do you think that process was pretty good guys that was pretty good i'm not gonna lie but let's go ahead and give it a shot on a bit on the higher temperature let's go ahead and clean that out what do you guys think do you guys think the higher temp is gonna be better guys i think the flavor was pretty nice right there at a low temp it was a pretty decent cloud my head does feel a lot more relaxed i feel like i was stressing out a little bit for this so i feel like this is mellowing me out a little bit you know with the melons let's see let's go ahead and give it a shot now at the that was green let's try it off on red what do you guys think should we put more dabs too should we make it a fatter dab you guys see that you see that [Music] how many of you guys own puffcoats and for those that do own puffcoats do you guys use the sesh mode in it um comment down below if you guys use the slash mode kef told me about it the last time that we were together and i was like i haven't like used my puff coat to its fullest potential just yet i feel like i'm still tweaking with it but as of now i'm really happy with it um that sesh mode what it does is it extends the period of time that the like puffco heats up so if you do it for one set for one session i think it does like a 10 second heat up and if you do the sesh mode i think it extends it for another 10 something like that so it allows a longer burning process when you're like i guess dabbing you know what i mean so we're going to go ahead and give that a shot i'm going to double tap it that's going to turn it on it's going to do a little warm up that preheat setting and close this up so it doesn't dry out who's ready oh damn [Music] [Applause] i just double tap this so you can reheat [Music] [Music] guys it's been like 10 minutes after that like last dab and i feel like it's settling in a lot better now i'm a lot more chilled out my eyes have definitely dropped i feel like i'm ready for another dab but i don't know let's raise up the temperatures let's see what's up guys i think i'm gonna this time go on white and i'm gonna load it up a little more guys let's see let's see how much damage this thing can really do to me let's take a batter dab [Applause] you see that guys that's a pretty big dab for the puffco but we're gonna try to make it happen and i think that's gonna be a waste but all right guys let's see it's gonna be on white guys so food damn [Music] uh yo guys it's been about like 15 minutes since that last dab that i took on white and i'm blasted guys this stuff is really good i feel like from the first time from like the first step that i took that was at like the second to lowest temperature um let's see let's take a look so it goes from 450 degrees so the first step that i took was at 500 degrees and i i kind of liked that one the best because i found to have the best flavor out of all three um it was a little bit of a low temp and there was not a lot of clouds and i found that i had to re-heat it up twice in order for me to finish the like small amount of dabs of concentrate that i put in it but it was it was more worth it at that point because i got more flavor out of it and i feel like when you are spending 100 the flavor better be there you know and obviously right now guys i'm super stoned so i feel like the the highs there definitely is definitely there too guys like i'm i'm stuttering my worries at this point but um yeah at 500 degrees i really i really enjoyed the the dab and then i turned it up again and then i went to 550 which is on red um at that point it did burn a lot faster i did get a lot thicker clouds i did cough a lot more um i felt too right straight to my head right at first and then my eyes and at that point i just felt my eyes just shut and then they felt heavy at this point my eyes still feel heavy um i feel a lot more relaxed i do feel this a lot more in the head though than i do in the body um but i am hella relaxed i did i do enjoy this i do i will find myself purchasing this again or more of the papa select brand i think that they're a really good really good company when it comes down to extracts man this was grown by tar heel cannabis so shout out to tarot cannabis let me go ahead and link all their information i'll link all their information but yeah guys um when i took it at the hottest temperature which was on white that's about 600 degrees guys and i think at that point and that put it was hella hot i coughed right away um but i did i did enjoy it i feel like that got me hella high hella fast um but that's honestly not what i was looking for like i feel like i want to enjoy i want to enjoy the flavor i want to enjoy the high um let's see how long this lasts guys so it's been about like 15 minutes but i did take three pretty decent sized dabs so man i think i'm kind of getting ready for bed guys i don't know about you guys but man it should boil zap in the bed i hope you guys enjoyed that was a little quick strain review that was the puff coat let me know what you guys think man thank you guys for watching another video we've hit over 12 000 subscriber guys

resistant before opening I'll tell you that for nothing see what we got inside he's back on that  lovely lady ain't name o Terps is out for each I would say there's a twine stick a French Paris pack twine to it you are right", "5U0WkEfka2U": "what's up it's your boy today i'm gonna be smoking a cigarette this is the last cigarette of my pack oh no it's time to smoke another pack of cigarettes uh anyways let's get this bad boy sparked up this is a marlboro southern cut uh this is a sig that i got my friends into uh uh so first off the effects i'm a little sedated uh it's more of a natural tired feeling as opposed to an artificial tire feeling you know like uh kind of like smoking a cigarette makes you feel like you know kind of the calmness you feel after you exercise not that i exercise but i have before and after you exercise it's a similar feeling to smoking some nicotine uh what is the smoke like it's a cigarette it's better than other cigarettes for sure marlboro is a pretty good company you know their cigs might not taste the best but they're really [ __ ] good tasting for what they are they have a very unique taste marlboro cigarettes do anyways i'm done with this thing uh i'm probably gonna puff on it here and there but i'm gonna put it out for the most part uh so so what i'm going to be sparking on is a uh fiore pre-rule it's an indica and the strain is snowball date of birth 10 21 2020 so that's when it was i don't know what that means i don't know what date of birth means thc 18.34 cbd point zero six but the terps are a whopping two point four six so the bud tender told me you know it's only an 18 point blah blah percent thc pre-roll but because of those high terps it's going to be a very intense very hard smoke so whoa and i can already smell those terps jeez they uh they told me that these fiora pre-rolls are the best you can get they usually sell them for about [ __ ] 20 bucks at other dispensaries i got this one for 10 bucks so let's do this and they said snowball oh my god mother of pearl that is a strong aroma and taste very full not in a bad way it's a very pleasant smell oh so the burnt the burnt smoke the burnt smoke the smoke coming off right now from this burning it smells like uh incense in the flavor that is the freshest cannabis flavor i think i've ever experienced in a pre-roll uh man i could just let this burn and smell it oh that smells good jesus christ and the taste it's got me in a time loop okay oh so i can feel the effect in my legs predominantly i can feel it in uh my arms and my chest a little bit uh i definitely feel it in my like my calves and my ankles and my feet so basically what i'm trying to say this weed made the bottom half of my body really stoned uh now now i feel it in my chest equally but man uh this is a this is one i would smoke if i was in pain uh because i'm not even in pain right now and but it's the painkiller uh effects are working and i'm not only am i not feeling pain in general but i'm feeling like a lack of pain from this whoa so again just in case you forgot this is a fior indica one gram snowball pre-roll that i got for ten dollars and they usually retail for about twenty uh see that's the thing i wouldn't pay twenty dollars for this but i would pay 10 for it and i'd be getting more than i paid for it which is part of the reason i'd pay 10 for it but they've got these priced to 10 so for what they are right now this is the best bang for the buck this is one of those companies that they uh they don't just shove [ __ ] weed into pre-rolls and send them out they grow their own weed apparently the wheat they also grow wheat like instead of pre-rolls and apparently their weed is just the densest [ __ ] ever so that's what they put they put their choice weed into the edible or the into the pre-roll and holy [ __ ] it has me feeling like i'm the captain of a spaceship to put it lightly what man this is the kind of weed that i want to be growing myself i would love to be able to grow my own weed that's this good and then roll up some joints and i have some friends and family over i'm like hey guys try my homegrown and then they start smoking on it and they're like as high as i am right now that would be so cool man i've only smoked this much and i'm i'm at the point where i'm like should i put it down which i never do but you know what i mean but that's impressive that means this is about five times my dose which means i got my money's worth [ __ ] it should be if i'm spending 10 bucks you know i used to uh i actually picked up tobacco because when i first started smoking weed i uh i really liked the high intense highs but there was always the 50 50 chance that it would be a bad high you know i would get anxiety or some [ __ ] so i started smoking cigarettes so i could get really high and if i got too high i could be like you know spark up a cigarette and be like and it would uh it would calm me down now i'm just [ __ ] absolutely hooked which is unfortunate do you want to know why it is unfortunate because when you're hooked to the tobacco your pee pee it turns blue now i don't know if you've ever seen a blue peepee but basically it's not normal um if you don't believe me look up blue penis on google images make sure your parents are standing right behind you anyways uh i'm done with that sig that was so fun oh yeah i love cigarettes but i've got the universe's most beautiful creation in my fingertips i'm not even capping guys i swear to god blow up my nose watch this you can't see that smelled good though smell really [ __ ] good felt really good too i love blowing weed out of my nose you can't do that with tobacco i mean you can but why the [ __ ] would you i'm sure some people do that's not something i am going to do man when i'm smoking tobacco it's just like purely to get my mind off of wanting to smoke tobacco i like do it don't think about it but weed it's such a different thing it's such a religious thing to me it's so cosmic the first time i did weed it was the most cosmic thing i've ever experienced i remember i smoked out of a bong and this guy was like hey dude you want to hang out with me and buy some weed i was like sure he's like this guy is gas it's going to be our first time trying gas because it was like we weren't really stoner stoners back then and uh anyways the guy goes i've got a couple strings and we're like you do because it's on the street when it's illegal it was illegal back then so the fact that we could pick strains that was [ __ ] insane and uh he was like yeah i've got blah blah blah blah blah and cat piss and i was like cat piss no [ __ ] way let me see that i smelt it it was the dankest [ __ ] ever i could totally tell why they call it a cat piss and just from that strong strong smell i knew i was in for a [ __ ] high so uh he he was nice enough to let us try it before we bought it [ __ ] so anyways we're trying gas for the first time he's letting us try it before we purchase it we're already gonna purchase it just from how it [ __ ] looks but now we have the opportunity to try it so he loads up the bong my friend takes a hit and his eyes are red as [ __ ] and he's kind of like absolutely gone he's like whoa and he's like hey can i put on a song so me being not in his body i'm like oh i can handle this he didn't die or anything oh no he died and i was soon to find out because i was about to die too so this was my first time hitting a bong and it was my first time smoking gas so i load in this cat piss into the bong he hands me the bong i take a hit i don't want to look like a [ __ ] so i [ __ ] milk i i take a snap pretty much which means i smoked the whole bowl in one hit and uh i remember i go blow that smoke out all of a sudden the song turns on and everything is different all i remember is a hand coming towards me it's slow motion and it looked like everything was like frames like in in picture frames constantly flashing frames like constant pictures being taken and it grab the hand grabs the bung and he's like you feel it i'm like i i remember i think i said like i have to go to the bathroom and i just like stood up because i thought i was like what is happening and i went to the bathroom and i was like i remember it was like like everything was like oh distorted and like it was so cool anyways i fell in love with weed from that second just just from that that bong rip and uh i'm i'm pretty high right now i'm blasted man uh fior or whatever the [ __ ] whatever your name is where's that thing i think it's fjor you guys have some gas um jesus christ you are mad scientists uh and the fact that it's for sale for 10 bucks a gram at some dispensaries you guys are gods you are getting people they're the most potent medicine they could possibly ask for and in the world of weed it's different than pills you know like we're not tr we're not getting the most potent oxy you know it's weed so anyways cheers to that my goal is to be like 115 still smoking weed i want to be old the old grandpa the grows weed and has his own strains out and makes music records videos paints draws gloves deeply you know what i mean anyways you guys i'm i'm shaking my [ __ ] leg right now because i'm trying to like my body is trying to like control the high because that's how good this weed is man cannabis is so awesome i'm just like in a [ __ ] shed but a couple hits of this and i'm on a planet floating through the stars floating among the stars flying through space the motherfucker's spinning that shit's weird so shout out to my buddy adrian who has covered uh bro i'm so sorry i'm gonna smoke you out to the max after you heal bro you just gotta take it easy you said i can't remember if you said baths or showers were helping but whichever one helps keep doing it and uh i know they say don't smoke weed but you're not actually combusting a weed bro you have dabs you can dab i'm pretty sure uh more than likely covid plus cannabis concentrates does not equal death uh so anyways bro smoke up feel better anyways uh so i just released a new song i have so much more uh [ __ ] to write about like a friend who's come back into my life i want to shout out that person and say what's up where'd you go [ __ ] just kidding no i'm not i'm totally [ __ ] around but man i forgot snowball that's what the strain is this [ __ ] is fire fire oh here it is yes fiore probably means fire honestly they've earned that title this product contains cannabis a schedule one controlled substance which means it's up there with coke and heroin does that make sense to you no it does not uh cannabis products if it does get [ __ ] please get off of this [ __ ] video or i swear to god i'm gonna psychically enlighten you and you're not gonna like it [ __ ] uh cannabis products may only be possessed or consumed by persons 21 years of age or older unless the person is a qualified patient good it says may not should i would be pissed if it said they should not women should not use marijuana or medical marijuana products during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects or while breastfeeding yeah if you take drugs while you're pregnant you're a [ __ ] mom if you do substances well you're pregnant you're you're if your wife is doing substances well you're pregnant or your husband is telling you to do substances or doing substances around you [ __ ] them that [ __ ] is", "Ib0cMUfybJk": "hey man I just got some [ __ ] man they said the new moon rock man is she I just broke it down but man look at this [ __ ] this was covered on the top food they see is the new moon rock I just kept man I don't know about these are looks like help me out where should i smoke say is the no moon moon rock", "-sd13Ho4VCE": "so yeah you guys uh i'm not condoning drug use don't use drugs but um here are the best movies to watch while you're high first thing i'm going to recommend is ted think about what this movie is this is a movie about a grown man hanging out with a teddy bear and just like smoking in the teddy bear talks in like bangs and does other silly stuff that teddy bears shouldn't do ted next we have scooby-doo i think we really know what scooby and shaggy are all about they're all about eating food and doing other stuff that we know we can see through that we can read that subtext you know we know what they're all about there's some jokes in this movie you'll find really really funny and scooby-doo's just awesome to begin with so watch scooby-doo and i'm talking about like the live-action one the one with like matthew lillard as shaggy and then you got freddy prince jr as the hell is that guy's name fred next you got harold and kamara i feel like these are movies designed to watch when hi it's a movie about two stoners and they go on these crazy adventures just watch any of them start with white castle and then just work your way through them i think there's like three of them i think there's like two of them and then like a christmas one still need to see the christmas one so yeah really what it boils down to is kevin smith watch any kevin smith movie while high and you're gonna have a good time but not like anyone like i'm thinking like dogma or clerks or clerks 2 or jay and silent bob strike back but the one that the one that i'd really recommend though is mall rats i think this is just a good time it's like kind of the most endearing kevin smith movie to me at least i don't know why because it kind of got slammed in terms of in terms of reviews but yeah mall rats is a good time and i'm sure it'll be fun when you're you know next i'm going to give you a david lynch movie eraserhead you're going to watch this movie and you're just going to say i get it and you're totally not going to get it at all but you're going to think that you get it a razor head is like a really like mind-bending weird avant-garde film that you'll just like you'll have no idea what you watch but at the same time you'll completely understand it so erase your head there you go also you get some really cool visuals in that one so yeah next we got the big lebowski you got the dude you got walter and you got donny these three guys they go on an adventure they're trying to get the dude's rug back and it really just brought the whole room together this is like the best coen brother film in one of the funniest movies ever and it's so like calm about the way it goes about its humor it's very it's very cohen brothers i'll say that jeff bridges as the dude is one of the most iconic performances ever and especially like also like walter you know john goodman playing walter it's just great you got steve buscemi it's just such a good movie great performances the the movie is like really stupid but it's also amazing cohen brothers are just they're on a different level you know alright i got two more for you i'm gonna lump these ones together because they're similar we have the naked gun the first one watch the first naked gun and airplane these movies are so stupid they are dumb but they are the funniest things that you'll ever watch ever these movies have like barely any plot at all they're really the the movies exist just to make you laugh there are jokes every 5 to 10 seconds literally for those of you who don't know what i'm talking about first of all shame on you second of all i am serious and don't call me shirley if you've heard that that's from airplane and you might think like that's not funny my mom says that or my grandma said well it is funny okay watch this movie because it's hilarious which movie both of them watch both of them at the same time watch them both at the same time no don't do that watch naked gun and then watch airplane and you're just gonna laugh for like three or four hours straight it's just a great time so yeah those are the greatest movies to watch when you're high or drunk um don't drink and don't do drugs goodbye", "SyNz0vfTmec": "hello everyone my name is Sylva willowy and today we're gonna take a look at toothless right here which is one of the new how to train your dragon the hidden will Spin Master figures and this is the singular figures you just get one dragon and there's a few to choose from we have hookfang now we have toothless and we have strong fly so there's actually also a light fury edition of this singular figure but it's not on here and here we have the picture of toothless and then we have to strike class symbol right here and it says toothless so this is kind of a special thing that the box is a little bit crooked but this is a special figure because this is actually one of the best in my opinion figures for this collection for the hidden world collection because toothless looks very cute he looks just like two of us would and that's a very important thing because a lot of the other toys from the hidden world I have found look very dirty and not that great at all but this one is definitely a s31 so will you just take him out and see what he is all about so here we have him out of the package I just took him out well quickly so his wings are obviously movable they are articulated my wing sadly has some issues weighted right here this is from the mold I'm pretty sure there's a bit of a burn mark it almost looked like did a place where the plastic cover which didn't really fully cover so there's a little bit of where there I'm just gonna treat it as a scar on him but I'm pretty sure that all of them will have that they all have these small singular clues here where the coating Connor was smelled it onto him but yeah other than that his wings are very movable they can go very high up I think it will very low which is super cool very very very articulated then we have his legs which can go backwards and not so much forward but like this and then the same for the other one he's kind of stuck by the tail fin so I can go like this extend then we have two front limbs they can go forward and they cannot go backwards so much on you force them so this is probably that's as much as it can go that's the max so that's it's saddening and the same over here cannot go back that much but it's common for these toys I like them when they can go back but they normally can't so it's not really a surprise and his head can also turn which is lovely very cool it can go all the way around yes again so that's very nice his tail cannot move I think no you can't I mean you're kind of yeah you can you can turn it it has a turn joint too but not too much kind of that extend not really that much but a little bit the tail is very short which is just a shame I think for them otherwise it's pretty cool details are nice on the tail itself because we have two of the spin on the right side and then the prosthetic one on the left side and you can definitely tell the difference between the two which is always cool and we can see the contraption here that hiccup made so that toothless can fly on his own very cool the tail is very short sadly which i think is a shame with a long like the longer tail and a bigger one because he's flaps here are normally really really back but they're not quite that big here and there little bit krugen not the same size so that's a bit of a shame he has this scaly pattern all over him which looks alright it's not the best but looks all right he has also scales on his ears which is very nice and on his face as well in front of him face is very cute take a look at that super super cute and some very nice details definitely adorable and he has really big ears which is very cute as well and he's one solid the head is one solid piece of plastic it's kind of joined down here but the ears are like on top of the head some of the other toys the ears were like their own separate piece of plastic but this is all the same mold which is super nice I think and you can stand pretty well on his own stands pretty solid there you go and then you can have the wings wherever you want she's also a nice feature when you can really just move them so all in all I really like this guy I do believe he is the best toothless figure from the hidden world I think he has some really nice details he's the one that looks most accurately the head is all shaped correctly and he has a cute expression so he's definitely the best of you want a nice figure from the hidden world collection by Spin Master I would recommend this one because it is by far the best from what I've seen so definitely a good one I'm really glad I picked him up he was very very adorable you should be able to get these online or I do a local toy store I found mine locally but you should be able to get them pretty much anywhere so thank you so much for watching I hope you found this review helpful and hopefully I'll see you again so long Dragon Riders [Music] you", "y33uzLSj7EM": "since I smack there I

it's back with Jiang", "HRlmG8kjFLA": "hello YouTube Donald here quick little update and some more chela saying on the delicious candy now you may remember in an earlier video I pulled some of these branches back tied them back to the trellis to make more light available to this interior here these small and branches which were down below went getting direct light because they were shaded by the massive plants up top so by bending these big branches back and allowed more light to penetrate down in here because it's the big leaves here but some people will just cut these families off if they're shading other parts of the plant on the flowers I'm a little reluctant to do that because the plant does need its leaves to make food for itself and I want to foliate the thing so I'm bending the back and I'm gonna give you I'm going to show you if you look here see these little flowers down here they're shaded and it was the same with these I just pulled this one back you can see here I use my floral wire I put a very loose loop around us on the branch then I tied it off I have to one of my little screws underneath it I just use these screws as little pigs to wrap the wire around that makes it real handy here you can see these these smaller flowers founded here when this plant was standing straight up these big families were shading them the little flowers weren't getting direct light but these aren't gonna do like the sativa this is an indica and these little flowers down here I've got to produce their own branches and start growing straight up they'll stay kind of you'll stay kind of small but they won't produce their own branches but at least they're getting more light and then it's also allowed more light done into some of these even long branches here so I'm going to I'm going to do some more pulling back here and getting or something as simple as this spending it over use us branches off I get a little more like that so that's the whole deal with jealousy I'm gonna do some of that and then it check the conditions of the reservoir also some of these stems are turning red let me put my my blue lens over my camera lens and you can see the red on that leaf stem well that's a nutrient deficiency I have to add cal-mag to my solution to prevent that and get rid of that so so I have some work to do today I'll check that solution for you in just a minute that kind of way now and I'll get back to you so we're gonna take a look at my cactus plants while I talk a little bit about what's going on and the grub temp the pH in the grow tent is of the nutrient solution is 5.7 it's a little low I like to keep it in around 5.9 so we're gonna have to make an adjustment for that the nutrients the concentration of nutrient is that around 510 ppm so there's room to add I'm gonna have to add cal-mag because those leaf stems are turning red and that's a sign of a nutrient deficiency so I'm gonna have to add cal-mag but don't forget when you add even these additives in small amounts it's still going to boost your ppm so you don't want to add so much then it's I mean you want to add the recommended level that's on the label of the nutrient solution but you got to be careful because you don't want to get routeburn if you get that concentration too high you will chemically burn the roots and you plant to die or at least suffer and you'll get a lower yield so and and the level of solution in the tub is exactly at 10 gallons so I don't need to add solution to it it's right where it needs to be I need to adjust the pH and I need to add Cal mag to get rid of that nutrient deficiency so I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to siphon out one gallon and I'm gonna replace it with a gallon of pH adjusted plain tap water with enough cal-mag to treat 10 gallons and we'll see what happens cal-mag isn't going to increase the the concentration as much as my base nutrient what the cal-mag is an additive so it's not going to increase it like my base nutrient would so I think I think this might be what I need to do to eliminate that nutrient deficiency without boosting my ppm to a caustic level so I'm gonna cut away from here now say goodbye to my lovely San Pedro brothers these are the San Pedro cacti these little worm looking things here were to have a lot of I bought them because they said they were fast growing well they're not there's some other variants of the San Pedro cactus right here these these spiky things here but all these are little worm-like things here they're really cool though I mean I sit here sometimes and I I stare at them and they they seem to want to talk to me I hear voices these are actually mescaline producing cacti now they're not anywhere near large enough to be harvested that could take years but I like them and maybe someday again enough of them and I'll have myself a time all right back to the marijuana alright I'm ready to make amendments to the nutrient solution I'm going to use my funnel just to keep things neat so much splashing around you don't need to watch me do that I'll kind of way come back all right so I adjusted the conditions in the nutrient reservoir my initial pH was five point seven that was a little too low on aiming for five point nine and my concentration was right where it needed to be but it needs cal-mag to get rid of this red red stems that's the nutrient deficiency so even though my concentration was high enough it didn't have the right amounts of other other nutrients the kalman obviously calcium and magnesium so if I just added cal-mag to my solution it would drive the concentration up and it might burn the roots so what I did was I siphoned off a gallon out of the reservoir he placed it with a little more than a gallon of just plain tap water treated tap water to remove the chlorine and to adjust the pH I into that bucket of fresh water I added the recommended amount of kalmec I put in thirty milliliters of cal-mag it's three to five milliliters per gallon I have ten gallons I want to keep it a little on the low side when you're adjusting your nutrients always try to keep it to the low side because you can always add but if you go too high you'll burn those roots you're done so be very cautious I like to keep my nutrient levels as low as possible just to avoid that so and then I poured it in and I checked the conditions again and it came up perfect my pH is now 5.9 or I needed it to be and my ppm is five hundred and sixty which is perfect I like to keep it between 500 and 600 so that worked out well now I'm going to finish tying back these tall stems see these tall branches so I can get some light down to lower parts of those branches and that's going to be a struggle because the biggest tallest ones are way back here in the back and it's hard for me to get at it mighty when wrote entus is hemmed in on three sides I got a couch over here I got a wall over here I got another wall on this side so it's only open in the front it's hard for me to get back into these back corners but I'm gonna try when I'm done I'll give you I'll give you a view of what it looks like all right I've done some jealousy that's a tying back tying up tying off of this one now I pulled this one back it's opening up some white space in there this one I had to tie back to the duct cuz if you have anywhere else to do it just lay back in that far corner it's hard to get out but now it's providing it's it's not shading these little flowers down here here's another little glance down here that was way down low there's no starting to grow up matches we're now growing up but weren't before and these little branches in here this one this one this one this one regions down here these will all wait down below in the dark they're not growing very much because they were shaded by the tops of these other classes all unfortunately I can't get back to tie this one back but I don't think it's shading anything back there here I've tied some of these little branches I've tied them back and now we're getting light down in here saying yeah this this tall plant here was shading this branch and this little branch down in here so by pulling that back I'm getting a light down into those branches now so it's all about yields it's all about yields I'm not worried about gaining potency I've never had any trouble getting potency maximum potency out of my plants my struggle has always been with yield so that's a wrap for today folks thanks for watching tell your friends be sure to LIKE and subscribe

might still be tracking okay Debbie Debbie's like always first so I'm gonna be trimming someone's bud right here from my new neighbor he is a very nice guy in any way um we had a fence that was down between our property and I helped him fix the fence today and we're going to put a gate in there so we can go between the two properties which is really cool and he was showing me around his lot and we were talking about all kind we had all kinds of conversations and [ __ ] and he um he had somebody that he grew last year and he hooked me up purple punch right here this is the purple punch and I'm trimming it right now trimming the leaves off of it not gonna take long at all to get this thing trimmed up so you guys get a really good idea of what this bud looks like we were out in the sunshine him and I and I held this bud up in the Sun and it is covered covered with [ __ ] trichomes she got down never got I'm gonna get him through mom always told me not to look at the that line does not make sense at all I don't even know why he wrote it like that I mean why didn't he just write it so it made sense you know you could have said mama always told me not to look directly near the Sun with my eyes or something he could have come up with something better than that hey Slovenian hey Cathy re still going with the stoners thing huh Slovenian huh that's too bad really hope you're gonna see grow past that [ __ ] son calling yourself a STONER so- should have more pride in yourself brother take more pride in your cannabis and your cannabis movement you know stoner is so [ __ ] negative and it's so [ __ ] played out you know by people who just don't get it every time you come in here man it's what I think about you I say wow there's that guy there's that guy slob me and he just refuses to [ __ ] get it there's that guy he just refuses to get it that's funny I have this name because my government Lowell I don't I don't care I don't care what your [ __ ] government is okay look stoners is negative okay it's relatable to somebody who sits on the [ __ ] couch all day and doesn't accomplish or achieve anything doesn't help anybody hey man I'll go [ __ ] about your government I'm not talking about your government I'm talking about you and the way you represent yourself and the way you choose to represent cannabis I'm not talking about your government [ __ ] your government who gives a [ __ ] about your government you know you don't like your government start calling cannabis you know your government wants you to call yourself a STONER bro trust me your government likes that you call yourself a STONER your government thinks you're a [ __ ] loser and you're calling yourself a [ __ ] loser you understand that you're not offending them you're just hurting yourself you know when are you gonna [ __ ] realize that bro it's a negative term you know there's nothing [ __ ] funny don't you [ __ ] Lowell at me when I'm having a serious conversation with you about that [ __ ] seriously bro you're you're just you know you're this [ __ ] close I've tried to give you week after week after week after week of time to think about this [ __ ] and it just doesn't seem to get through to you it doesn't get through to you you know why is it so hard for you to [ __ ] to comprehend that you've got a [ __ ] excuse for it every time I bring it up and it's always a dumb excuse you don't want this blood you know what's this just buzz Rogen's here like he wants to eat this [ __ ] hey Brian what's up son I'm not pissed off I'm just you know I'm just trying to make a point to this guy and I'm just wondering how long it takes to get a point across to somebody you know you try you mention it you're casual you mentioning and you're casual you mentioned again you're casual you mention again you get an excuse to mention again you get an excuse in Vince again you get another dumb excuse oh I have this name for my government what what so your government is forcing you to disparage yourself what it doesn't even [ __ ] make sense you should consider it I'm not telling you need to change puts logging in you should stop referring yourself as a stoner man it's detrimental to the movement man it's not positive and and if there's yeah it's like what air and I just said you might as well just call yourself a pothead you know you're not attracting people to your movement you're not bringing them in you're not including people you're excluding people people don't want to be considered a STONER it's negative man it sounds dirty it sounds disgusting and it sounds dumb you call yourself a cannabis user and people are gonna be like oh yeah I want to use cannabis too you get to use cannabis one and you're not a STONER you mean you're there's there's not some some negative [ __ ] persona attached to it no I'm not calling myself a STONER anymore pothead is better I I think I think stoner and pothead are the exact same thing buddy I think stoner and pothead are the exact same thing they're negative they make you look bad they make me look bad when you're on my live stream all right you know me allowing someone to be on my live stream with the name stoner makes people think it's that names okay I don't think it's okay okay I think it's [ __ ] stupid and it puts the movement down anybody waking up to all the fear-mongering that has voluntarily shut down the free world Edie suck my dick you're a [ __ ] idiot it's not fear-mongering bro there's two million cases around the world all right you [ __ ] idiot why don't you go run around dude you go spread yourself around all right and see how that does for you [ __ ] off and stay the [ __ ] off my livestream you weren't miss trust me God people are so [ __

I'm glad that you're finally listening to me about this I really am uh you know I brought it up so many times is what people but when I bring it up finally I'm getting frustrated and people like oh why is he so pissed off I don't know if it's tough I'm just trying to get through to somebody guys I'm just trying to make a point to somebody and I want to be passionate about it so he'll finally listen to me and it'll make sense and other people chime in and say yeah that makes sense that what ney just said makes sense it is a negative term and when he's letting that guy on here calling himself stoner and then I have to talk to you and act like I'm your friend and blah blah blah hey what's up Slovenian never used the word stoners it's a pain in the ass it makes mine it's like if I let somebody come in here call themselves pothead heard marijuana Mike or [ __ ] reefer Ronny or whatever the [ __ ] you know that guy comes in reefer um reefer um Sutherland I finally told him I'm like dude I'm not letting you [ __ ] come in here with that name anymore um it's done the whole reefer thing it [ __ ] ends right now and if you don't like it to [ __ ] bet oh I like that name yeah I'm sure you do and I don't give a [ __ ] you know I understand that it's got enough you do with with um you know trying to put down the cannabis movement but unfortunately the word reefer does you know that's awesome I finally got through I hope so man I hope I got through to him I hope so we'll see you know cuz I've been I've been pitching that at him for a very long time and he just chooses to ignore me finally you guys started chiming in and you guys that helped so much when you back me up thank you for that you know what no man let him know why let them know it's [ __ ] it's it's it's pissing us off well I don't know why we have a problem with it you know this is why there's the whole reason why and it's a really good reason you know it's a really good reason okay so I wanted this to be nice and trim before I showed it to you hopefully we'll get a oh there we go look at this this is my neighbor's purple punch look at that just gave it to me so cool okay poor cannabis etiquette no it's just somebody's name with something stoner and I don't like the word stoner and I'm asking them I'm asking him to consider changing the name you know because it's so offensive and it's and he comes in here all the time and it's just not helping the movement and I don't want people to think that it's acceptable it's not acceptable it's not acceptable terminology anymore we're not gonna put up with it anymore you know it's time we grow up and it's time people start finding out about cannabis and stop this this stigma that these stupid words like pot and weed and marijuana and reefer and dope and stoner and pothead you know and all of this [ __ ] keeps people from realizing the truth here's the truth potheads not the truth stoner is not the truth look at me do you know what I did today I [ __ ] busted my ass all day today I'm still smoking cannabis all day I've been up all day with this dog down in my grow helping my neighbor repair a fence to all kinds of [ __ ] man [ __ ] I'm busy man you know that's not a STONER I'm not sitting here playing video games all day eating [ __ ] you know Doritos and and and netflix inc all [ __ ] day are you [ __ ] kidding me I'm active man you don't believe it look look look at my [ __ ] belly I know I'm not I'm not in shape and I'm fat but you know much weight I [ __ ] lost a lot I couldn't have done this [ __ ] five years ago it would have been so embarrassing I'm actually kind of proud all this I know I got I got a little bit of thing going on here but if you guys could have seen me [ __ ] five years ago you would have been like denim that [ __ ] lost some goddamn weight I have I've lost a lot of weight and I'm feeling better than I ever have mixed cannabis seem like a negative so understand man you know I know we're not gonna get laws I don't wanna [ __ ] laws passed I always say no law regarding cannabis I just want people to [ __ ] respect it learn about it and understand they have access to it you know I'm talking to my neighbor he's an incredible grower this [ __ ] looks [ __ ] great it smells so dank Ygritte last year and the smell on this [ __ ] is incredible I could smell it from my quad it was on the quad I could smell it on the quad from 10 feet away okay that's how strong this stuff smells this is sherbet right here let me just tell you this he doesn't know a lot about concentrates and things like that he doesn't know a lot about panels he's experimenting with it he's learning about it but he doesn't have that knowledge that you get when you're watching somebody or you're networking and you're learning and you're studying and you're watching somebody who's always doing it we need more people like him who can grow like this to learn about this and if you know you keep calling yourself pothead smoking your weed and you're he's gonna go smoke his pot he's gonna smoke his weed he's not interested you know it's not gonna [ __ ] interest him you say hey we've got a cannabis community what what's that that's on the internet man it's a whole group of people we've all decided to start calling it cannabis because we want to make people more aware of what it is and how the government's been lying to us since nineteen you know the 1930s the late 1920s about cannabis and hiding it from us and hoarding it and right on ran man I appreciate you buddy why they call it pot it's from Spanish origin for steeping buds in some kind of tea Spanish origin yeah I don't know about that I don't I don't know about that John I don't know you and I don't know where you got that information from and I know why you think you know where the word pot comes from I've never heard that before but like I said dude I don't know you I have no idea what the [ __ ] you're talking about you know all I know is it's disparaging it's a put-down it sounds like [ __ ] you know when people take a [ __ ] on the pot and then you refer to this as pot yeah that's negative I don't care where the [ __ ] word came from originally it's [ __ ] negative stop [ __ ] saying it you sound like a [ __ ] idiot especially when you refer to yourselves as a pothead you sound like an idiot pot saying if he chokes pour smoke pot Oh a pot really pot what is that pot you cook in a pot what it doesn't even [ __ ] make sense you know so we're we're trying to reach as my friend says Nick 420 California a higher standard here and you know that higher standard involves the the the way cannabis appears it's it's its presence you know it's always around we like to call it pop we dope marijuana reefer why because we've been indoctrinated to think that those are cool words to call it but it's really cannabis and you don't like that word because it doesn't sound as cool you know what's cool getting more people access to cannabis that's what's [ __ ] cool you know what's not cool you thinking that a [ __ ] word makes you cool that's what's not cool words don't make you cool you know helping other people like going out and helping your neighbor build a fence that makes it cool you know your neighbor giving you bud that makes him cool you understand the difference you know calling it pot that doesn't make you cool that makes you a [ __ ] idiot it makes you uneducated it makes you somebody who doesn't understand it completely and it definitely makes you someone who does not know how to respect something by calling it what it is so this is no I'm just starting this is the just starting the review right now this is the sherbet right and I'm just gonna trim this one right here so you guys can see I'm not gonna spend a lot of time trimming this was completely untrimmed when I got it now his outdoors are more tricky than mine but the the buds aren't as dense it's an interesting difference I'd like to find out why you know I'd like to find out why minor are definitely denser but his are definitely more tricky and and get the best of both of those you know dense and tricky but I don't know what kind of nutrients he's using I don't know anything about his grow tech we talked about compost he said he's going to start composting but this was not grown when with compost you asked why they call it pot a couple of days ago John Besser John Besser do I know you John personally yeah I'm just gonna block you cuz I don't know who you are I'm just gonna block you I have no idea I don't like it when people call me neighbor it's [ __ ] weird send one of my buddies a text we'll see who answers that all right um during Lisa I rode straight Durbin steve-o Morocco Amsterdam fake gree as what's up victory as it's an interesting name Cali fruit would have been frosty what's up Nate Eli hey Eli what's up oh it's my buddy in it okay all right oh all right that's funny that's my buddy I knew I was gonna get you one of these days ah all right so my buddy John who I dunno claims that this word pot comes from Spanish how the [ __ ] did you find that out what they have - god it's like it's a slang word who does the [ __ ] um the origins of slang I don't know but I'm gonna Google that [ __ ] and try to find out myself Wow you are right from the 1930s the word came into use in America in the late 1930s right right right when they were trying to ban it because of course it sounded like [ __ ] and he's right it did they did take the word from proteger Yaya a potty joy gaya potty gaya I guess or pata gua that came from POTUS yonder Goya a wine or brandy in which marijuana buds have been steeped it literally means the drink of grief interesting John thank you for bringing that to the show and once again I don't give a [ __ ] where that word came from it sounds like [ __ ] I would never refer to myself as a pothead I would never refer to cannabis as pot I will only call it cannabis but thank you John thanks for explaining that to me where it came from I don't give a [ __ ] where it came from you know what I mean it sounds like I took a [ __ ] on the pot you know I took a [ __ ] on the pot you still want to smoke it you know it sounds like somebody took a [ __ ] on I took a [ __ ] on the pot hey don't sit on the pot for too long you know a toilet your your you're gonna refer to cannabis as a [ __ ] toilet how long have they been referring to a toilet is the pot I wonder probably since the [ __ ] 1800s I wouldn't be surprised you know oh yeah let's let's refer to the cannabis as the same thing as as as what we sit on when we take a [ __ ] you know oh but it comes from this wine from the Spanish yeah it says pie so we're not going to call it all those other cool words we're gonna call it pot right I wonder why I wonder why that word because they're trying to degrade it they're trying to put it down and in the 1930s they were the worst at putting it down that's when it was the worst we've just been riding that wave since 1937 but when they came up with that [ __ ] word and they Americanized it they were doing it because they wanted to put the movement down they wanted to put cannabis down they wanted to use another word that was negative that people would start using and latch on to so it would bring cannabis down so once again doesn't matter where these [ __ ] words come from they're negative they were all brought here to put the movement down and you want to call it the right word call it cannabis that's all call it cannabis I never call it but cannabis unless I was a team but what reefer madness eating pizza for 10 goddamnit Iceman was here just in time and I've got to do the strain review okay so we'll do the purple punch first he said it

flour three months oh yeah Greg I got a Hornet in here I have a [ __ ] microfiber towel [Music] it is how you catch a hornet and their pollinators so you don't want to kill them right you want to let them go so they'll keep pollinating outside so this is how you catch a hornet you can take a microfiber towel fold it up into like four like that you'll be fine they can't sting through that and they just go up it flew away look at him look at him go where are you going where are you going come back over here you Hey there he goes wait till you goes back on the window right and then just do this wrap them up right don't crunch it and now there's a Hornet in this microfiber I'm gonna go outside I could have take the microfiber throw it on the UM throw it on the table and open it up and he'll fly away I can release it from my hand that's all I'm gonna do right now it's super simple to do and that you know they're just trying to get the [ __ ] out and if you know how to do this you won't get stung now if you're you do not want to do this with a bulb a bald-headed it's called a bald-headed Hornet they're black and white don't [ __ ] with them don't do that I mean I will cuz I'm a pro but you gotta you gotta be really careful cuz you piss one of them off it will [ __ ] your world up [Music] he said he said he said he said you guys like that it's simple look a microfiber towel you take hit you take it like this you fold it in half once right and then you fold it the other way in half right and then you could catch them like that and as soon as you catch them you can fold it really gently one more time and they they're there sting in this thing repeatedly sting sting sting sting sting some of them are and some of them don't some of them if you're not you're not hurting them and they don't feel threatened they'll chill in there and they won't be stinging this thing and when you let it out you'll see they're they're not like stuck in there trying to sting it know some of them they'll sting it once or whatever they're all different they all behave differently a bald head a bald-faced hornet I said bald-headed a bald-faced hornet they're called that [ __ ] won't stop stinging and it won't stop biting and it won't stop singing it won't stop biting it wants to kill you it wants you dead it doesn't [ __ ] care and its whole life mission is to [ __ ] your world up you

them or you're gonna catch them Inlet or open up the window or you and that doesn't work that often opening up the window very often they'll fly to another window it sucks so I learned you know I was like I didn't want to hurt them because they're pollinators I want them to survive and how do I get him out of the house the easy way [ __ ] it just takes a second man you know microfiber or a towel a hand towel works great can't tell look Brian when I approached that Hornet it saw me and it flew away did you guys see what happened it flew a circle around me it flew a whole circle all the way

with me but you could definitely hike my property for an hour easy you just take a couple trails go up here go up there all on my property and you're just you know you can walk the perimeter of it which you can't do you can't walk the perimeter of my property it's impossible to traverse cuz there's these man's Anita's you can't I've have got to have it cleared they're dead dead hardwood trees they're piled up everywhere and you just can't get through it so but there's trails all through there man it's pretty cool they take the dog I mean he's still sleep and the dog is still sleeping but he'll be he wakes up periodically throughout the day he'll be ready good go on the YouTube [ __ ] on the Facebook channel I mean you know but the broadcasting isn't very good it cuts in and out remember that bro so as I hike around the property it's gonna cut in and out so on your store all the same kind yes yeah no no no Greg they're all the same time it all comes from the same bucket it all comes from the same bucket all the ones that you see on the website those are long gone it's also extra-strength now it all looks like this it's the heavy [ __ ] really good really well-mixed really smooth consistency you know it's got that really smooth you want to put on your lips mmm that's smooth we could see could we see them sometime yeah I gotta put this thing on cellular that's out a hundred percent charge I wonder if the dog wants to go outside he perked up when I said that each lady bring him I'm heating up the plates on my rosin press right now they're probably just about heated up get me some of that parchment paper and rock some of that yeah I was gonna press some doubts please donate so we can get top-of-the-line home Internet yeah you could say that if you want it was it would help me with that sure I would love to get cable oh my goodness that would be fantastic but you know it doesn't it doesn't run up here yet so maybe it will whoa yield yield yeah I just don't know how the plates are yeah I couldn't check the temp on it I guess and I have to get up there they're up there you ready you ready for squishing some God damns they're ready for the goddamn fishings at the count of nine all right now I got parchment paper there there is a roll of it there is a roll of it and I thought it was hopefully I've gotten yeah I think I got another boxes paper Wow parchment paper yah yah yah yah yah Jimmy doors live yah yah yah a floating my own satellite yah yah yah yah yah yah yah yah yah yah yah yah yah yah yah yah yah yah yah yah yah hey now you know don't be like that don't be like that don't be like that don't do it we gonna squish around he's I told when I looked at I said man these strains look like they're gonna put out a lot of oil there's a lot of tricks for sure a lot of strikes look at that done by hand a little hand drip in there okay now we want that to kind of lie flat in there now what's okay to do is we can use the buds that are not trimmed you don't have to trim but it's when you're squishing them pretty cool huh so we'll just grab one of these untrimmed buds right here and well kind of squish it together a little bit take that stem out of there we don't want that stem in there just kind of smush this together here okay plates are ready all right we're gonna go on over here to the rosin press right yes and we won't put the pressure on to three times the oil is already coming out pouring out of this one so six tons that's going to be good for this one this one is it's pouring out so fast I don't have to go look at this oh it's great really nice a nice boil there so let's do this so refers to that seven times 180 degrees really nice return on their I can already see it okay let's come over here had a blotter ready to go here I'll bring this to Aaron I'll bring the bud so I can see what it looks like after it's squished it smells nice and we'll try a dab of it and then I'll bring this over to him let me see how easily it scrapes off of there [Music] Rogen's waking up yeah it's great to start off the paper let's try a dab of this I think Aaron's going to like this okay let's try 8k Aaron's tab son you guys say about that and his stuff is all cured so ready to go no law regarding cannabis cannabis is intense for all cheers everybody aka arrow yeah it really retains the flavor of the bud holy [ __ ] okay well I'm gonna go run that over to him you guys take care thanks for watching my show hope y'all had fun I'll see you on tonight's show 710 or something like that maybe later all right stay in take care and go watch some Jimmy door Jimmy doors live on YouTube right now I'd suggest go watch him all right guys trendy Asda burgers on IG trendy has Devers on Twitter and if you go over to Jimmy

door maybe I don't know I don't know I don't I don't know I don't know you guys take care I will see you bye bye by", "L4e662moQ6o": "hi this is sheri ann richerson from experimental homesteader calm and what you're looking at is the YY 0 UT I spelled it because I'm not sure how to say it Himalayan salt lamp it weighs between three to five pounds it has a dimmable switch and it comes with 3 15 watt little night light bulbs the lamp base and body on this are two separate pieces and i'm going to show you that this is what the lamp base looks like I do not know if the lamp base is made of wood or plastic it is very lightweight it looks like wood but it's very very smooth this is a natural product so it does come in various shapes so if you order one it may not look exactly the same shape as what I have up here because again we're dealing with a very natural product okay if you run your hands over this lamp which I don't know why you would but if you do it does have a rough feeling to it um it is Himalayan salt I mean plain and simple that's what it is so it's going to feel a little bit the rough and you're going to have a little bit of salt flake off either onto the base onto the table possibly onto your hands but it's dry salt so you can just you know rub your hands together and get it off you can use a dust cloth or something similar that's dry to just the salt off of the table or the lamp base if it bothers you what you do not want to do with this lamp is use anything that is damp like a damp rag or anything like that because again this is salt and it will melt it okay which the way this works it absorbs moisture from the air and then it rear elisa's it back into the air as negative ions that is because that little light bulb in there is actually heating it up and helping with that I leave mine run 24 7 that way there's no chance that my lamp could absorb so much moisture that it would just melt away now I have had these lamps going on probably three years not this particular one but different ones and i have not had that issue but like i said i leave them run i keep it very dry and you know if anything needs to be wiped down i use a dry cloth to do it with they are very easy to use basically you just set them where you want them and you plug them in there is a dimmer switch on this so it is easy to turn on and easy to turn off it's like a little wheel and you just spend it I'm going to demonstrate okay I prefer to keep mine at about a medium light level I absolutely love the soft glow and so these are also a natural ionic air purifier they didn't create these they actually mind these out of the Himalayan mountains so what you're looking at is a completely natural product what I like least is that some of the salt does come off I would never set this right next to my computer because I would be afraid some of those little pieces of salt that come off would get into my computer and do some damage so set it away from anything that's electronic on a shelf above a computer would be perfectly fine that's actually where this one is but I would just not set it right beside because you know computers have openings in them um the size is really a decent size I mean you can see I have a picture frame sitting there I have a vase of flowers above above it so it's not overly large um it's very manageable very easy to lift and move and clean around if that's what I want to do and as far as cleaning like I said you do not want to use anything with moisture on that's not even a damp towel if you have to clean it choose a dry rag and wipe it off but I could tell you I've never really had to do anything with mine they pretty well take care of themselves they don't seem to collect a lot of dust and um I'm just very happy with them now my other one does set further over on the base then what this one does so i suspect i will have to just that face from time to time but i will just lift that a himalayan salt block off set it off to the side go ahead and dust my base make sure it's dry and then put it back on if you have any additional questions do feel free to ask me this is what the dimmable switch looks like and you just slide that around you can see it says off and on and so that's what that looks like I just wanted to show you and I also wanted you to show you the light bulbs like I said it comes with three I have one in my lamp these are the other two that are extras that I will hold on to until I need them thanks again for watching and have a great day", "-GHl7Sf7Pz0": "alright ladies and gentlemen this is my

and venom like a snake and oddest of all it lays eggs like a bird so much of its life is spent underwater or underground that the life of the platypus is still largely unknown an irresistible challenge to filmmaker david pereira i've always been fascinated by the mysteries of how platypus have their young and over the next three years we're going to take you on a journey to discover what happens deep inside their nesting burrows it's a truly amazing story maybe she's active by tracking its daily life researchers will help her reveal the most intimate moments in the life of what is surely the strangest animal on earth [Music] the high plateau of tasmania the southernmost link in a mountain chain that stretches the whole length of australia's eastern coast [Music] when the winter blizzards blow in from the southern ocean life here gets tough yet even here the platypus thrives its thick fur provides near-perfect insulation as it forages for a sparse living in the frozen towns the spring four turns mountain streams into torrents humans are rare in the remote tasmanian wilderness but platypuses are plentiful there's prey to catch with their probing bills under every rock shrimps and worms and the larvae have aquatic insects i've looked for platypus up and down the east coast of australia but the wild rivers of tasmania are the greatest place to find them but even here they're difficult to see they seem to meld into the water and rocks and then suddenly disappear when europeans first encountered it the platypus seemed almost too weird to be real the name comes from the greek for flatfooting yet it was the creatures duck bill that most fascinated 19th century zoologists 200 years on we're just beginning to understand what a remarkable instrument it is in fact there's a lot about this secret of animal that we're only finding out now as the early naturalists discovered the platypus is not an easy animal to study its burrows may run back into the banks for 30 meters and they soon learned to be cautious they found that the venomous spur of an angry male caused pain and swelling that lasted for weeks so it wasn't until the 1880s that scientists confirmed that the platypus really did lay eggs by the early 1900s they were learning how to keep platypuses alive in captivity in 1944 naturalist david flay successfully bred from a captive pair called jack and jill months ago david play noticed jill was building a net he knew she was building up her milk supply he then dug down and uncovered the burrow to his delight he found a youngster already well grown but this would be the only platypus born in captivity for 50 years and even today little is known about how they breed in the wild a quiet valley in northern tasmania in the headwaters of the south esque river [Music] an unassuming farm dam proves an ideal site for biologist nina kosh she needs to trap a female platypus the first step in an ambitious project it's really unbelievable that these farmlands can be such a good place for platypus to live in they seem to be enormously productive ideal habitat for females to breed in i heard about nina's work in tasmania and came over to join her perhaps she may be able to help us in our quest to find breeding platypus nina has been fascinated by the platypus ever since she saw one on tv as a child now she's come all the way from germany to take part in a two-year study the aim to find out more about how female platypuses raise their young first nina measures the platypus's exact dimensions the tiny craters in her leathery bill are receptors some are sensitive to touch others to the minute electrical impulses emitted by her prey just keep what i don't know be probably old enough not happy enough next nina attaches a tiny radio transmitter to the platypus's fur it needs to be tested thoroughly before next year's full-scale breeding study nina decides to call the female shy after a platypus character in a children's book [Music] within days nina has identified the precise location of one of shai's sleeping burrows on an island in the dam we trade drive for a couple of days now and we could follow her to this island and she's sleeping right here in her door and we are going to put an infrared video camera in so you can see what she's doing in her bow [Music] just before dawn shine returns to sleep for nina and her partner marcus yutesh this is the first view of a platypus underground there she is she's coming in next year they'll try to get a camera inside the burrow of a breeding platypus that is absolutely great wow a few weeks later nina and marcus find a baby platypus near the dam it's only just emerged from the nest soon after they find another bigger youngster this baby looked much more like an adult it weighs 610 grams so double the size of the one that we caught before he released his baby in one of the farm dams and then it started immediately to to feed along the border of the lake we tried the next day to see it again i sat on the pontoon and paddled towards the little bloody puss he just stopped feeding and suddenly even came closer to me he was by far more curious than afraid nina is hot this will be an ideal location for next year's study [Music] the only other animals on earth that are even distantly related to the platypus are [Music] like the platypus the short victor kitna has looked much the same since the age of the dinosaurs it too has evolved a highly specialized mouth not a bill but a beak which can be used as a crowbar if need be and a long sticky tongue to pull ants and termites from deep within their nests despite their different lifestyles the echidna and the platypus share one crucial characteristic they're the only surviving members of an ancient group of egg-laying mammals the monotremes faster peggy rizzmiddler and mike mckelvey have been tracking and studying echidnas for 15 years what they've discovered about the echidna's breeding cycle may help david pereira in his pursuit of the platypus that's whisper up to a dozen echidnas at a time may be carrying transmitters it's always worth seeing what hari is doing what hari's doing is looking for a mate mostly echidnas lead solitary lives but when a female comes on heat males will gather from far and wide but the females emit ascent and the scent is called a pheromone and it's something that humans often can't smell but obviously the the males can smell it the pheromone of course would be able to go cross-country on wind and attract the males and we've seen males cross this peninsula several times and then eventually end up with a female harry and several other males are already here and whisper is on his way yep he's there whisper joins what's called an echidna train a group of males all paying court to a single female okay signal bro over here a train can stay in place for up to a week with the males constantly jockeying for position they must be patient but ready for instant action mating will take place just once when the female decides that the time and the partner are right to try to capture the elusive courtship ritual of the platypus david travels to the far north of queensland here in the tropical rainforest the mating season has already begun [Music] this female is feeding hard to ready herself for the rigors of motherhood every 40 seconds or so she must surface to breathe this is when she's most vulnerable eyes and ears are open wide alert for danger but as soon as she dives she shuts them tight using only the sensors in her bill she's built up a detailed mental map of her feeding ground [Music] and she knows its inhabitants too especially the resident cormorant [Music] the white-faced heron minds its own business [Music] the cormorant mines the platypuses [Music] each time the platypus dives the cormorant follows snapping up shrimp and small fish flushed out by the foraging platypus [Music] and if the platypus rests too long between dives the cormorant lets her know it [Music] in this particular river system almost every pool has several resident platypuses and a single quant ready to exploit them [Music] the other inhabitants of the pool give the platypus no trouble at all the azure kingfishers are peaceable neighbors too they may occasionally snap up fish and shrimp she drives to the surface but at least they don't harass her to dive for them most platypuses have a broader home range than a single pool this muddy tributary to the mainstream is a favorite feeding ground catapulters make their way up the creek at all hours of the day and night to feed [Music] they can sense the vibrations of their prey through the receptors in their bills [Music] [Music] i've been here for about three months now and been desperately trying to find a place where the platypus are courting i think we might be under something here this is firm flat it appears to be dominated by a male and he does his patrolling and again it appears that there's a female i think is just coming up to her burrow or area that she spends a lot of time at now as the light begins to fade the platypuses start to make their way further up the narrow creek there's even better feeding where it runs through cleared farmland but the platypuses will only venture there at night this is an ideal crate to film platypus with an infrared camera i really like using infrared cameras because you can capture behaviours at night that no one's ever seen before we put up a red light the platypus can see the red light but they don't seem to be disturbed by it sitting there beside the bank of the river with the water running through my boots and the legs of the tripod and the water as the animals slowly worked their way up towards me they would stop and glance up and then keep on coming they were totally unafraid in the first hour after dark six platypus passed me and then a water rat appeared water rats are about the same size as a platypus but much fiercer a few nights later david parrott sets up his infrared equipment on a bridge overlooking the main river just below the bridge a big male platypus has established his home range but tonight he has a challenger from further up the river the resident male is grooming himself on a log apparently unaware of the intruder despite being caught by surprise the resident male has won the encounter easily he hasn't had to use his most damaging weapon the poisonous spur on his hind leg is fed by a venom gland that in the breeding season reaches its maximum size day and night now the big male patrols his home range he spotted another male lurking behind a stump without hesitation he steams into battle whether platypuses regularly use their spurs in these encounters or whether they're weapons of last resort we don't know in this case the resident male is triumphant and a female is ready to be courted [Music] the male grasps the female's tail and the courtship dance begins [Music] the dance can continue for 20 minutes or more whether the female is courted and mated by many males or just one is something else we don't know for sure [Music] finally it looks as though the male mounts the female and mating takes place [Music] the bare patch on her tail may be a sign that she's been courted often in recent days now she's returning to her nesting burrow one or two eggs perhaps even three are on the way hillsville sanctuary in southern australia much of what we know about platypus mating and breeding has been learned by liz fisk and his colleagues from the captive animals at hillsville sanctuary [Music] for 10 years a male and female platypus have lived in this elaborate artificial world through a maze of tunnels pipes and tanks video cameras record their every move two years ago for the first time since david flay's success in the 1940s fisk managed to breed platypuses in captivity [Music] for most of the year karina the female will have nothing to do with in the male but spring is in the air at hillsfield sanctuary david pera has already been manning his remote cameras for two weeks today finally the preliminaries are over and the serious courtship has begun [Music] the moment that she's ready to mate can be fleeting ann is determined that he's the one who'll be around when that moment comes [Music] but her attempted escape was all part of the ritual karina soon returns to the dance [Music] two years ago this couple successfully produced twins [Music] judging by the way the courtship is consummated the signs are good for this season too [Music] summer has come again to tasmania and its wild rivers are swollen with melting snow [Music] in a quiet backwater as temperatures rise and the days lengthen a female platypus is collecting material for her nest she takes leaves one by one in her bill and jams them under her tail [Music] to safeguard it from flooding she's dug the entrance to her borough several metres at the steep bank [Music] [Music] so [Music] over the next few days she'll make dozens of trips like this until the nesting chamber at the end of her long burrow is lined with sticks and leaves back on the southeast river nina kosh and marcus yutish are joined once again by david pereira for the start of a new season's work in the early afternoon we go down to the south esque river and set up a series of nets these nets were originally designed to catch eels but they're also really good and safe for catching platypus as well they position the nets across the water flow to trap the nightly traffic of platypuses as they feed up and down the river in the late afternoon the platypus come out of their burrows and start feeding they're very good at avoiding nets because their sensitive bill can pick up the water flowing through the mesh many evade the nets but eventually we catch one judging by the dates that last year's youngsters emerged from their nesting borough nina and marcus have worked out that the females will be laying their eggs very soon now is the time to fix radio transmitters to them this one has a large bear patch on her tail a sign that she's probably been courted intensively yeah that one all the animals this might be a mating mark all the fur is away from the tail surface they discovered that she's one of the females they trapped and tagged last year in fact it's their old friend shy 80 17 let's try we got shy back we'll come back great after several weeks exhausting setting nets up and down the river nina and marcus managed to catch seven females each one is fitted with a new transmitter and released back into the river exactly where she was caught [Music] for nina and marcus it's the start of another period of intense work tracking all seven females for hours at a time they find there's a wide variation in the platypuses behavior some feed mostly in daylight others sleep during the day and feed all night some travel a kilometer or more up and down the river each feeding session others including shai feed in one pool most of the time where's the strongest signal coming from no she must be sitting in there shy sleeps in the same burrow each day nina and marcus want to pinpoint its exact location because there's a good chance it's where she's built a nest and is nursing her that young here and it's getting weaker which can be 10 game 10 maximum game i only have like one i would say it's about here it must be around here i'm at this point it gets weaker here but it's exciting look at another burrow yep and we should this one looks a bit this one looks a bit different than the others okay you should mark the entrance meanwhile peggy rismutter and mike mckelvey are still keeping track of their echidnas you think try again from here oh yeah right suppose that cyprus weeks ago this female was at the head of a mating train she should by now have laid an egg okay i'm just going to feel first very tight i'm going to pull the pouch open there it is there's the eggs it's an egg there's a girl 10 days after the egg is laid a puggle will hatch in the egg the echidna develops an enamel covered egg tooth it needs this egg tooth to actually rip open this leathery shell and then pull itself out onto the mother's belly [Music] inside the pouch it's really moist and humid because that's what the puggle needs right now as far as we know it two grams it has to breathe through the skin tiny though it is the puddle can safely be removed from its mother's pouch for a minute or so at two days old there's almost no difference between a baby echidna and a baby platypus less than two weeks later it's already a hundred times heavier than when it was hatched the baby echidna by now has a discernable beak just as a baby platypus would have a recognizable bill after seven weeks in the pouch the mother leaves her young one in a burrow returning every five days or so to let it suckle instead of nipples the mother has specially adapted pores clustered in patches on her tummy as the baby suckles the mother expresses the milk through her skin it doesn't need its eyes i think it's like all very small animals they go on scent and so the young is scenting where the milk patch is at six months the young one is almost ready for independence back at the southeast river marcus and lena have decided that the time has come to try to take a look inside shai's nesting borough canada [Music] shai has been feeding regularly for 16 hours in every 24 returning to the same burrow each day to sleep they're sure she's nursing young it's late evening shy's already left the burrow to feed nina marcus and david have at least eight hours to try to get a glimpse inside the nesting chamber first marcus drills a hole carefully into the burrow roof frequent measurements over the past two weeks have taught him exactly where and how deep to drill meanwhile david sets up and tests an endoscope with a tiny video camera mounted on its end so down is like that was really exciting going down into the nest chamber for the first time those are roots coming down into the top and then we saw the entrance to the chamber itself [Music] the nest was a really complex structure it was tightly woven leaves wrapped around with sticks and roots there was even some green plastic in amongst the leaves that's when our frustrations really began over a period of 17 days we went in six times into the burrow but we just couldn't penetrate the nest and then at last we got the endoscope through the nest wall we first glimpsed a tiny bit of flesh through the leaves and then another period of frustration half an hour trying to get a glimpse of the bill [Music] yes the bill looked huge through the endoscope but it was really only a centimeter long the front feet already had claws and then to our amazement we saw there were two babies not one crammed into the tiny nest three weeks later we went into the burrow again and we found them immediately it's incredible they're grown enormously now they were covered in a thin layer of fur or even visitors inside the burrow the ticks are only found on platypus and already they're feeding on the blood of the young ones their bills are now large and very dark we think the young are now about six or seven weeks old we're eager to see how the various parts of their body have developed their front feet have webbing between the toes and on their back foot is the beginnings of a spur the smaller one is female the larger one has a much bigger spur it's obviously a mile we called him bigfoot the nostrils are huge we think they're probably used to find the milk patches of the mother and here the smaller one is rubbing the tummy of the larger one as if it's trying to suckle it was a revealing three hours in the burrow nina is spending hours each day by the riverbank recording shai's feeding patterns it's light summer on the south esk and vast numbers of insects are hatching from the river it's an ideal time for shai to be feeding her young she's just feeding enormously she spends 16 hours out in the river and she just goes along the river and wherever she is just feeds unbelievable hungry little female [Music] a nursing platypus will consume up to half her body weight in food every 24 hours [Music] most of it consists of tiny morsels which you must somehow find and separate from the leaves mud or gravel on the riverbed when she gets to the surface she chews with a sideways motion of her grinding pads separating out and swallowing the food [Music] in a single feeding session she may dive up to a thousand times [Music] [Music] tonight the team planned to go into shines burrow once again so while nina tracks shy to make sure she's out feeding the team drills a new hole into her nesting chamber this time they're installing a tiny remote controlled camera that will be able to film shy feeding her young without disturbing her illumination comes from miniature infrared lights which she can't see and as well as the camera there's a microphone to pick up sound inside the burrow that's the big one the babies are now about 13 weeks old their eyes are open their bills are fully formed and their coats have grown thick while bigfoot plays with tree roots in the roof of the chamber the smaller one is perhaps getting ready to take on solid food nina warns that shia is on her way back to the burrow as she approaches the nesting chamber she unblocks the earth and plugs which she set there to protect her young then she's through into the chamber here we go within minutes the eager young are greedily suckling from their mother's milk patches but the team is about to see behaviour that no one has ever seen before the young stopped suckling and then began to rub their mother's are they taking food from her perhaps getting a taste of those little animals that they themselves will be eating in the next few weeks or are they drinking her saliva maybe getting some of the bacteria that will strengthen their immune system we don't really know what we're seeing in these extraordinary pictures soon shia's had enough she busily rebuilds the nest around her young so and then she's gone leaving a tangle of tails and bills behind her [Music] ten days later on watch as usual beside chai's pool marcus and nina spot one of the young platypuses in the water bigfoot the male has emerged from the nest the team watches enthralled as the last chapter in the drama they've been following for months unfolds bigfoot needs no tuition from his mother minutes after his emergence he's swimming and foraging expertly along the bank he asserts his independence swiftly within a few weeks he's traveling with upstream from his mother's pool soon he'll have to leave this rich feeding ground he's trespassing on the home range of older larger males as bigfoot begins his journey of life our journey of discovery is coming to an end we know nothing of what he does in the next couple of years in fact i feel that we've only just scratched the surface in understanding the platypus one of the most mysterious animals on earth [Music] hmm", "eth7IiT9lxA": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so just what i needed for this film the world's deadliest spider i'm denzi klein for many years now i've been taking a close look at the secret lives of spiders and my perception of them is a very different one i'd like to invite you on a journey into the world of spiders it's a journey that'll astonish you and perhaps change your attitude to spiders forever [Music] while spiders themselves are usually disliked their webs can often inspire us with their beauty and the weaving of an orb web is the ultimate in spider craftsmanship long before the dinosaurs spiders were already using silk to catch their prey and it's from their first random snares that the classic orb whip evolved to start a new web the spider lets out a strand of silk to be carried by air currents to a point of attachment [Music] once the line's caught the spider can start her web an orb web can take an hour or more in the making here it's compressed into a minute first the spider lays down a set of lines radiating from a hub rather like the spokes of a cartwheel next a wide spiral scaffolding holds those radial lines in place the spider moves inwards now laying down a much tighter spiral she's using the sticky silk that'll glue her victims to the web the scaffolding no longer needed is eaten by the spider as she goes [Music] given 400 million years or so you can do a lot with eight legs a real or silk and a pot of glue [Music] the webs of different kinds of spider can vary greatly and each carries the unmistakable signature of its maker perhaps a few lines of embroidery there's one spider that places more than embroidery in her web and she uses her silk in a quite ingenious way she's found in australia and her story begins at night on the leaf litter of the forest floor [Music] the spider attaches a leaf to the silk thread that brought her safely down to the ground [Music] like a worker on a construction site she hauls herself and the leaf up into the air but what can a web building spider want with a simple leaf why all the effort to get it several meters up to her building site well unlikely as it seems when the leaves place at the hub of the web it'll form the spider's retreat or shelter but not before she's done some work on it believe curler actually uses a spider version of origami as she weaves from side to side the silk dries and shrinks and it's the shrinking property of the silk threads that curls the leaf into shape it's a job that can take hours but spiders seem to have infinite patience [Music] now with her shelter completed a spider can turn her attention to the getting of food so she's setting up her permanent insect trap right outside her front door she uses her legs to span and measure the intervals and attach the sticky silk to each radial line in turn web spiders have extremely poor sight amazingly it was by touch alone that the spider found her leaf and changed its shape it's by touch alone now that she weaves the intricate fabric of her web [Music] and there it is the perfect web a work of art to us a deadly trap for insects and for the spider its only means of survival origami is fine if you've got the time but some leaf curlers are lazy so what's wrong with recycling an empty snail shell spiders have other uses for silk besides making webs this enormous ground-dwelling spider uses her unusually long spinnerets to weave a retreat spiders have a number of silk plants in their abdomen each producing a different type of silk the spider simply controls which silk comes out depending on the purpose to make an egg sac a sort of spider nursery soft silk is used as a lining while tough silk will cover and protect it [Music] a silk thread can be used as a safety line if the spider misses its mark [Music] silk's also used for communication between the sexes it can turn out to be a male's lifeline as we'll see later in an australian suburb as people retire for the night a large female spider comes out of hiding and displays a unique use of silk dinopus the net casting spider gazes into space while her long hind legs work rhythmically below she's weaving the first stage of an ingenious catching device at a rate of about 200 strokes a minute the spider combs out a special kind of silk with a row of bristles on each of her hind legs the combing action can be seen here in slow motion she attaches the finished threads and now starts combing with the other leg what started as a ribbon of silk has now become a rectangular net but how can a scrap of fabric no bigger than a postage stamp catch anything that would make a meal for a big spider well appearances can be deceptive it's the incredible elasticity of the tiny silk net that makes it an efficient catching device the spider's ambushing spot is directly above an insect highway her night vision is 12 times more acute than ours and she'll detect the slightest movement [Music] dynamics special silk has a fuzzy texture it entangles whatever it touches but this large end has a ferocious sting so the spider must immobilize it further thy numbers can make several catches a night but for each one she has to weave a brand new knit not all spiders hang about in the air to catch their prey the earliest spiders lived on the ground and used ambushing techniques as many of their descendants do today down under my feet there's a whole underground world of burrows and holes and hideaways among the inhabitants of a trapdoor spiders best known for their skill following the barrows are so well camouflaged they're remarkably hard to see unless you know where to look most spiders live for only a season or so but the spider i'm looking for could have lived safe and sound in its burrow for more than 20 years somewhere on this little patch of ground there's a secret door a door with the best kind of security it's virtually invisible it's the hinged lid of a trapdoor spider let's see if she's home at this time of the day there's no risk of the spider jumping out it's down at the bottom probably wondering who's lifted the lid on its hiding place like all good security doors the lid fits tightly enough to keep the spider's enemies out a trap door spider's burrow can be more than a meter deep it's lined with silk perhaps for the spider's comfort at night the spider can detect the vibrations of passing insects with its feet sensing with incredible accuracy whether a passerby is a potential meal all spiders are carnivorous and most kill their prey with venom injected through their fangs these spiders can go without food for months if necessary but on a good night some strike it lucky trapdoor spiders and their close relatives are distinguished by large downward striking fangs the venom is produced as droplets at the tip of the fangs and injected when the spider strikes but it's the high toxicity of its venom that's made the sydney funnel web spider the deadliest spider in the world fun webs live only in australia hidden in burrows under rocks and logs natural prey of these spiders are the ground-dwelling insects that share their habitat [Music] the venom of the male sydney funnel rib is five times more toxic than the females it's because of his wandering during the mating season that he often comes into contact with people and for some the consequences can be deadly many people have died from the bite of this spider it's taken decades of research to find an anti-venom and reduce the number of fatalities but this is still a lethal spider and the problem is that sydney gardeners can accidentally dig them up and set them wandering [Music] so [Music] this may look like a dangerous game but the cat's not actually at risk among backboned animals the funnel ribs venom is lethal only to the primate group which is bad luck for people [Music] so [Music] research into the sydney funnel ribs venom continues it's unfortunate that by encroaching on the spider's habitat we have put ourselves at risk there's another dangerous spider common around australian homes a subspecies of the notorious back widow of america she's the red back seen here with her egg sac the redback's permanent insect trap is made up of extremely strong vertical threads beaded at the base with a contact adhesive a minefield a maze with no way out but death and insects enter at their peril this ant seems to have some misgivings she's cleaning her antennae the sense organs that warn her of danger perhaps she's aware of the assassin waiting above her [Music] redback spiders and their relatives use a special comb on their hind feet to wrap their victims [Music] in slow motion we see the silk as a ribbon of rainbow colors to the end simply a shroud in the course of evolution when insects developed flight the spiders followed them upwards not with wings but with all kinds of aerial traps and snares species of nephilim are found in warm climates everywhere and they're among the biggest spiders in the world they often build their enormous webs in tropical gardens where exotic flowers attract large moths and butterflies this giant spider builds a web so large and strong it's been known to trap small birds but it's actually designed to catch large insects [Applause] [Music] [Music] the spider has immobilized the butterfly's wings but they'll form no part of her meal slow flying insects are easily caught but with such a web even the world's fastest flying insect a dragonfly can be stopped in mid-air spider silk may look fragile but theoretically if it were big enough this web could stop an aeroplane in flight there's something else unique about nepalese web these tiny spiders are permanent guests squatters if you like as a rule anything moving about in a spider's web is likely to get snapped up but this is a special case the little spiders feed fearlessly on the crumbs of neville's meals it's an association between two species known as commensalism which simply means feeding at the same table the commensals clear the web of tiny unwanted insects in return they get to share the real feasts with their giant hostess many forest spiders don't make webs or nets to catch their prey they depend more on speed a tree trunk frequented by insects may be the venue for a small spider highwayman called tamar but hers is no ordinary pounce and grab stratagem [Music] by slowing down the action we can see how she contains the ant between her two tail-like spinnerets she girdles the ant with silk to immobilize it only then can she safely move in for the kill biting her victim before she eats it at leisure thomas ambushing spot is also the retreat where she lies up by day protected by her low profile and camouflage colours while tamar whirls another spider uses a different technique [Music] jumping spiders cross the open spaces of their small world by leaping launching themselves at high speed with their front legs if a spider lands short of its mark it'll swing safely back to its starting [Music] point jumping spiders are the extroverts of the spider world two of their eight eyes are enormously enlarged for daylight hunting it's the two big eyes that make these spiders seem less alien than most jumping spiders are found all over the world many of them are strikingly coloured but because they don't make webs and most of them are under a centimeter long they're often overlooked jumping spiders seek their insect prey on plants a sunbathing fly can be a real challenge [Music] so that fly was too fast even for a jumping spider [Music] but jumping spiders are efficient predators and they'll even tackle other spiders once they keen eyes of spider-potential meal it's just a matter of time [Music] spiders have exploited all the surfaces of the earth except the deep oceans but all over the world in freshwater ponds and streams there lives a spider that actually includes fish in its diet dolomedes the fishing spider is an angler that uses no bait and surprisingly no silk and fishing line the hairs on the spider's legs act as hydro fuges or floats they prevent the spider from sinking through the surface form while fish swim below the spider peers down at them for him one small fish is as good as a feast when the spider dives it's the hairs on his legs now covered with air bubbles that bring him back to the surface so he dries his legs carefully between dives the little fishes see the spider's distorted shape above them but show no fear and that's their [Music] [Applause] undoing spiders can't eat solid food they must crush their prey and pre-digest it then suck it up as a liquid this one's turning his catch into fish soup so flowers attract all kinds of flying insects so it's not surprising there are spiders around to prey on them what is surprising is the kind of trickery used by some of these masters of deception a garden like this can seem very pleasant and peaceful to us but for an insect it can hide a thousand perils any flower could conceal a predator waiting to pounce and if you're as small as an insect a spider like this can seem much larger than life speaking of size here's the true size of the flower spider flower spiders are found globally they don't use webs or traps to catch their prey they use their wits and the flowers become their innocent accomplices insects that visit flowers by day have keen sight for color and movement so the spider must blend with the color of the flower and sit absolutely still [Music] a flower spider may have to wait days for a suitable catch to arrive and even then it won't make its move until the victims at the precise striking distance [Music] hmm [Music] flower spiders will even catch insects much bigger than themselves daisy flowers are perfect ambush sites the tiny yellow florets provide a feast of nectar they invite prolonged visits from many kinds of insect or potential victims for a lurking predator [Music] the spider's camouflage is so good it even falls this butterfly into landing on it for many spiders camouflage is effective not just for attack but as a defense against kenai predators the idea is to pretend you're anything but a spider and it works so long as you don't give the game away by moving [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh any lump or bump on a tree may turn out to be a spider this one looks like a bit of debris until it walks away [Music] we ourselves can be as unaware of the spider's amazing deception as their predators are believe it or not there's a spider in this picture the flat shape and camouflage pattern of panda cities help to conceal it hairs on its legs hide the shadow that might otherwise give it away in this case the disguise is not just for defense as a tiny bark mantis is about to find out [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] some spiders do more than look like their surroundings they actually look like their prey you can tell this is an ant by her two antennae and her six legs but she has a double a spider the spider has eight legs it waves the two extra ones about to imitate the ant's antennae there are many different species of ant mimicking spiders in australia and each one specifically mimics the ants it preys on no one knows quite why this particular ant mimic performs such elegant eurythmics perhaps it's to attract the ants attention [Music] this spider resembles in almost every detail the tree dwelling weaver ants of tropical australia it lives in the ants territory and preys on them exclusively the spider has the advantage of being able to hang safely on its silk thread while it feeds on its victim [Music] but living in enemy territory with the numbers stacked against you is risky these ants are ferocious hunters [Music] the spiders weary of the ants patrolling above [Music] when things get too hot for it the spider drops on a safety line it rarely happens but this time the hunter becomes the hunted and the spider's the loser [Music] it's one thing to look like your victims but mimicry can take much stranger forms [Music] australian meat ants live in large mounded nests at the center of well-worn foraging tracks alongside their trails and nowhere else a strange little basket works structure can sometimes be found it's like a miniature lobster pot and it's made by a spider unique to australia that feeds only on these ants not surprisingly it's called the lobster pot spider meat ants forage for food on the vegetation around their nests and trails sooner or later one of the foraging ants comes across a lobster pot and investigates but what's this perhaps the spider simply wasn't hungry another ant investigates and this time the spider comes out [Music] she seems to be tapping out a message the way two ants would do it they're greeting on meeting but the ant doesn't respond and the spider retreats never mind there's no rush and there are plenty of ants around [Music] again the spider taps out her tactile message and lures the ant into her parlor [Music] there's no mistake this time the unsuspecting victim is seized by the neck and the spider gets her meal [Music] the question is has this spider cracked the code of ant communication until we ourselves learn the language of the ants how shall we ever know of all the spiders that hunt by night the australian magnificent spider wins the prize for deceit she catches her prey by an astonishing confidence trick the magnificent spider is a renegade orb weaver what she's combing from her spinnerets is all that's left of the classic web of her ancestors the single thread she dangles looks like a fishing line beaded with sticky drops but the chances of catching a flying insect with it seem pretty remote what's more this spider is a gourmet feeding only on male moths of a particular kind incredibly the spider lures her victims with the same scent the female moths use to lure the males for mating you could see she's stolen their secret formula to use as a decoy when the male moth homes in on the scent the spider is already swinging for her supper and her trap line turns out to be more than a fishing line [Music] [Music] my so the spider gets her supper but the moth ends up in the arms of a very different female from the one he set out to meet one of the mysteries surrounding this spider is what actually triggered her off to start swinging her trap line one night a passing car gave me the clue it was sound so i thought i'd try out some other [Music] sounds of course what the spider really responds to is the vibration of the approaching moths wings but i thought i'd experiment with some different frequencies well that seemed to work all right now i'll just try humming [Music] i don't think she liked that very much she's folded up her trap line and eaten it the sex life of spiders is truly remarkable before a male goes in search of a female he has certain preparations to make on a special thread called a sperm web this large george spider is depositing a droplet of white sperm fluid the fluid comes from the spider's genital opening halfway along his body now he picks the droplet off the sperm web and sucks the fluid into the special meeting organ to the tips of his palps or feelers it's with these that he'll apply the sperm to the female for all male spiders the reproductive process involves what can only be described as masturbation followed by artificial insemination of the female but directly after sperm induction come the rituals of courtship that are vital to a successful mating down in the grass two link spiders are starting an affair for all spiders that hunt actively by day courtship is highly visual the female link spider eyes off her suitor they say some females like hairy legs but eight of them the female won't respond until he's identified himself with the correct signals as one of her own kind the male uses his conspicuous black palps to indicate his intention to mate he does this by tapping the female with his front legs and waving his palps [Music] she seems to lead him on and then change her mind [Music] maybe it was his legs it's among the little jumping spiders that the most elegant rituals of spider courtship can be seen [Music] this little female from the tropics can probably recognize her potential mate at a distance by his back face and white side whiskers but he still has to establish his identity not with his palps this time but with his distinctive black legs first he has to get the female's full attention and that's not easy [Music] but he's persistent and follows her the male makes his approach with precise ritualized movements of his front legs like sending a semaphore message but the female plays hard to get [Music] the rituals of courtship and mating are unique to each species eventually this little female lets the male approach and stroke her head this puts her into a trance-like state and the male is able to tilt her abdomen and proceed with mating [Music] spiders are highly sensitive to touch and vibration and communication between males and females is usually tactile this male net casting spider is on the line to an unmated female he's fully prepared for mating and he's presenting his credentials in the special language of his kind and it's worked this tangle of 16 legs means the females accepted him it looks a bit of a mix-up to us but the spiders know exactly what they're doing [Music] the male's applying one of his fully charged palps to the genital opening on the females underside part of his palp swells like a balloon as he pumps the sperm fluid into her under pressure meanwhile the female simply gazes into space perhaps she's thinking of england the coiled duct or embolus that transfers the sperm is withdrawn from the female and retracted back into the male's palp the whole process will be repeated with the other pulp female spiders need to meet once only they can store enough sperm to fertilize several batches of eggs males can mate several times and this one's cleaning his pups in preparation for his next mating many people believe that female spiders always eat their mates when the sexes are about the same size there's little risk but the females and andrews cross spider is a giant compared with her [Music] and the mate that courts her courts death when a male spider approaches a female on her web he takes his life in his hands he must quickly identify himself as a male rather than a meal to start with the little male sits very still on the opposite face of the female's web he's made a hole in it so he can slip around to her side but make a dash for safety if she attacks now he certainly seems to be risking life and lim to convey a message to the female the message goes something like this look i think you're a very lovely lady and i want you to know i'm your kind of guy and we're going to get on just fine together so long as you promise to keep your mouth shut if she doesn't bite his head off of that he'll go onto the next phase [Music] his object now is to lure her onto more neutral ground the outskirts of the web he plucks at the silk thread playing a tactile serenade that she hears with her [Music] feet she comes out to him [Music] and they meet [Music] but there's something sinister going on behind the male's back why is she pulling out that ribbon of silk it looks as though he might be in trouble he senses danger and leaps away but not too far the experience seems to have left this spider a little unbalanced not from shock but because he's only got seven legs left the female's eating the eighth one the drive to reproduce is strong and the male makes another approach if he's lucky he'll succeed if he's even luckier he'll survive one thing is certain a males and andrews cross spider is unlikely to die of old age while some female spiders show a certain lack of affection for their mates when it comes to motherhood it's quite a different matter take wolf spiders it's not easy to look in on their family life they tend to shut the door in your face so it's best to look for them at night by torchlight spiders of all kinds seem to come into their own after dark webs are everywhere but the spiders i'm looking for will be on the ground the best way to spot these tiny hunters of the night is to hold the torch right up close to your eyes and shine it on the ground you could see something quite intriguing like their namesakes wolf spiders are active hunters that run down their prey in the torchlight the spider's eyes light up like lamps it's their two large eyes that catch the light the ones that give them their excellent night vision when you get as close as this you can really see how big those eyes are but there's something even more remarkable about wolf spiders the females show a degree of maternal care that you simply wouldn't expect among spiders like all spiders the female encloses her eggs in an egg sac a cradle lined with the softest silk the best way for this active spider to keep an eye on her future offspring is to drag them behind her wherever she goes rather like pushing a pram in reverse but few spiders risk putting all their eggs in one basket a magnificent spider has finished the first stage of her egg sac now she's laying her eggs pouring them out like water from a tap she can lay several thousand eggs over a single season now she has hours of weaving ahead of her before the eggs will be safely enclosed every species of spider makes a different kind of egg sac the net caster rotates hers as she weaves both male and female spiders have silk glands but only females can produce the silk used for egg sex [Music] this female seems to have a marvelous eye for symmetry and yet she sees nothing of what she's doing her only guide is her sense of touch as she progresses she uses several different kinds of silk the final layer is colored for camouflage [Music] like a jewel box a spider's egg sac is open to reveal any green spiderlings [Music] [Applause] the newly hatched spiderlings stay close to their abandoned nursery until they've molted there's a certain safety in numbers [Applause] these young spiders have spent the first few weeks of their life cushioned against the elements and safe from predators very soon now they'll be taking their chance with both [Music] [Applause] female huntsman spiders have a strong protective instinct they guard their young ones and even provide them with food as they cluster around her mouth any disturbance and the whole cluster reacts in unison [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the wolf spider we saw trundling her egg sac behind her carries maternal care even further it's she who breaks open the egg sac to let the hatchlings out and now wherever she goes her spiderlings ride piggyback clinging to special hairs on her abdomen [Music] as season follows season all around the world new generations of spiders explode into life and disperse many will span the spaces of the earth using silt and bridges others will launch themselves into the air to be carried far and wide they've even been found as high as 30 000 feet most of these young spiders will live only briefly preyed on by birds insects and even their own kind those that do survive would need no apprenticeship in the crafts of survival a baby magnificent spider already swings her trap line like an expert though she's smaller than the tip of my finger and guess what the scent she's using now lures a much smaller kind of male moth a young net casting spider makes a perfect miniature net a tiny all-breathing spider a born engineer with a genetic blueprint is making its very first web but is not easy when there's interference from the sidelines getting sorted out in a confined space with so many siblings around can have its problems [Music] but soon it all goes like chocolate [Music] these little spiders will eventually spread out into their separate territories spiders generally are an anti-social lot you could call them arachnophobes but there's one striking exception in the tropical forests of australia new guinea and polynesia a large spider called cetophora builds an enormous communal web one of these communities may contain many hundreds of spiders each with its own closely defended territory and its own orb web but the webs are densely linked together to form what looks like a giant mist net [Music] when the satophora spiderlings hatch from their egg sacs this beautiful floating city becomes their permanent home well that's the world of spiders you know it always surprises me that spiders are so universally feared when out of 40 000 or so different kinds of spider in the world fewer than a dozen are potentially dangerous to humans when you think about it we really always fight as a debt they are undoubtedly our best and safest form of insecticide but for me as a long time traveller in the world of spiders it's been a privilege to share with you just a few of the secrets of their extraordinary lives [Music] [Applause] [Music] you"}
