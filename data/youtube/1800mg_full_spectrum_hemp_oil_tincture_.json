{"fXqFWTGU-_s": "This video is all about full spectrum CBD oil benefits What is full spectrum CBD oil and why is it better than regular CBD oil? Check it out. Hey guys My name is Johnny Ross. I am a student at the University of Kentucky right now And I just did some research on CBD so that you don't have to if anything in this video is helpful for you I would really appreciate it if you would stop by my subscription button over to onder and Smack it maybe leave a comment leave a like if you don't like it. Let me know why share the video Don't forget to stay to the end because there is CBD there so full spectrum CBD oil is a type of CBD oil So if you're not really sure what CBD oil is in general, you can check out the video in the card above Basically CBD is one of 104 cannabinoids which are chemical compounds found in the cannabis plant These cannabinoids are particularly Medicinally useful for things like pain recovery mental clarity Inflammatory relief depression and anxiety relief and a ton of other cool stuff CBD is really helpful for humans full-spectrum CBD oil is CBD oil that has been extracted from the cannabis plant which includes all of the chemical compounds that the plant produces this includes terpenes flavonoids cannabinoids fatty acids and even THC when you extract all of the compounds from cannabis in Context of each other. They're more beneficial for you therapeutically Did you say that was th seed that now I did say there's THC in there Some people want THC free oils and that's totally understandable but a lot of times the THC content in a Seabee full-spectrum CBD oil is actually Point 3 percent or less so it's a trace amount of THC at best and it's not going to get you high You're not gonna feel any of the effects of that but it is going to help with the context of all the medicinal benefits that all the cannabinoids terpenes and flavonoids have for within that CBD or full-spectrum CBD oil is different from broad-spectrum CBD oil and CBG isolate exactly as it sounds is 99.9% CDD it usually comes in a powder looks a little bit like cocaine, but it's not cocaine It's CBD. It has wonderful healing effects for you but you do put it on your gums or under your tongue broad spectrum CBD oil is a CBD oil that has been doctored to contain many of the cannabinoids terpenes or flavonoids But they are usually select by whoever's mixing them or producing them and very generally speaking Broad-spectrum CBD oils and never have THC not even a little bit So you might ask why should I care? because full-spectrum CBD oil is actually clinically proven to be more beneficial for you than CBD isolate or even broad-spectrum a study that I'm going to put in the link in the description compared CBD isolate effectiveness to Full-spectrum effectiveness, they found that CBD was producing anti-inflammatory and anti What when they increase the dose there was a drop-off in the effectiveness they then remedied this by adding CBD to a full plant extract full-spectrum CBD and the dosage and effectiveness both rised together so like I was saying CBD in the context of all of the chemicals that the plant cannabis Produces is more effective than CBD itself, and I just wanted to show you guys this it's not Super relevant, but it is relevant. There's a website that has a terpene slider so you can go see what effects you want And then it will tell you what terpenes and flavonoids that you should get in your oils That's pretty freakin. Cool cannabis has over 400 known chemical compounds that it produces the majority of medicinal benefits come from cannabinoids like cannabidiol and THC terpenes and flavonoids also have medicinal benefits, but they're not unique to cannabis A lot of essential oils are actually made from terpenes and flavonoids These chemical compounds are generally responsible for the way that a plant or oil smells or tastes Flavonoids are more responsible for the things but pigmentation as well So what colors are in your plant because full-spectrum CBD oil comes from a certain plant. It is actually very important to know what strain your CBD oil is coming from so You know what specific medicinal or therapeutic properties that you're getting in that oil because it's relevant to the genetics of the strain of cannabis That it came from that's what I got for you guys today except for one more thing Which is a link in the description to get some broad-spectrum CBD oil from a veteran-owned American company that sells CBD called pure American hemp oil Try them out first link in the description below and generally thank you guys so much for listening once again I appreciate your time. If you appreciated this time with me that we spent together just now intimately consider subscribing consider leaving a comment nasty or nice doesn't matter and leave a like or just keep watching different videos on my channel because they're interesting and maybe they would Benefit you Thanks for watching guys. Peace If you're not really sure what CBD oil is you can watch this video right here click the card above and Eat my the majority of medicinal benefits come from cannabinoids like cannabis can it be debited can't cannabidiol and THC", "HYMd4rhjF0A": "it's another beautiful day to watch another video and for me to be here with you right now I just want to talk about full-spectrum hemp oil what it is and what the difference is between it and regular CBD oil so full-spectrum refers to when the pure oil extracted from the hemp plant contains all the same cannabinoids and compounds found in the original plant cannabidiol is actually very very beneficial it makes up over 90% of the cannabinoid content in a plant it's non psychoactive and it's the main focus of the benefits of hemp oil full-spectrum hemp oil contains cannabidiol as well as everything else that's included with it so in addition to all the other different cannabinoids in a hemp plant full-spectrum hemp oil also has a great variety of essential vitamins minerals omega fatty acids flavonoids chlorophyll and terpenes health benefits of a full spectrum hemp oil go beyond just the therapeutic benefits of CBD itself the array of cannabinoids and other natural constituents and compounds that are in the entire hemp oil like the whole oil work together in what's known as the entourage effect and together these compounds all work harmoniously to magnify their therapeutic properties this mix of cannabinoids essential nutrients proteins essential fatty acids they'll work together synergistically to encourage homeostasis and balance in our health full spectrum hemp oil comes in tinctures edibles they also have like lotions and capsules available you guys might want to know like does it show up in drug tests did hemp THC is a very minor constituent and only appears in under 0.3% by dry weight so this extremely low level of THC in hemp makes the hemp oil the full spectrum hemp oil non psychoactive and safe to use for all ages and today we're gonna be checking out this brand called Veritas Farms which is a farm-to-table full spectrum hemp oil company located in Colorado they also have capsules and gummies as you guys know I have been going through a lot of anxiety lately I do have CBD oil but I'm also you know trying out different brands just to see what's different and what I like and so far various farms has been really great transparency and sustainability is really important to them they use organic ingredients as much as possible they grow extract formulate bottle label and ship all from their farm locally they are third-party tested and they also emphasize so much that they're not a CBD company they're not a THC company they offer full spectrum hemp oil which offers the benefits of the entourage effect this one is strawberry flavored but they also have a salted caramel flavor that I was interested in trying out but I wanted to go simple first so I got strawberry I just placed dropper like straight under my tongue I like using the oil tincture for immediate effects for anxiety and stress the gummies and capsules would be the best for sleep because they set in a little bit later and one more item from various farms that I really really have been loving is this full-spectrum Fido cannabinoid rich lotion and we're talking about full spectrum but CBD for sure is really really good for inflammation stress also like joint pain I've been using this on my face lately my skin has been breaking out my like bumps on my chin have been going away had these little things go on they've gotten better this has been really really good for my skin anyway that's my little talk about CBD oil versus full spectrum hemp oil if you want to learn more about full spectrum hemp oil make sure you look in the description below but now I'm going to go I need to take some of this because it's time to go wake my grandma up so I can get her all ready for the day my parents out of town I'm her caregiver for the day which stresses me out a little bit because being a caregiver is very it's really stressful and also when it's somebody that you are related to can also be I don't know it's caused me a lot of anxiety lately so I've definitely been taking advantage of this full spectrum take some of this [Music] [Music] so I really wanted to go to yoga class today at the studio but my brother I guess wouldn't be home until later so no one could take care of my grandma and it kind of life are shaded me a little that I had these plans that was really excited about because it's by a teacher that I've been wanting to go to but that like it didn't fall through and I'm really really rigid with my schedule and I get really frustrated when things don't go my way because I'm like a control freak I especially like when it's things that I'm planning for and then I'm excited for and then it just like doesn't happen for some reason and it's harder for me to be flexible which is really interesting because this morning I was reading a little excerpt from this book called don't sweat the small stuff it just lies around the house they're just simple ways to keep the little things from taking over your life so before I knew that my brother would be coming late and I wouldn't be able to go to this yoga class that I was excited about I read this excerpt said that says be flexible changes in your plans like once we get something into our mind a plan it can be tricky to let go of it and just go with the flow and it's hard for me to go with the flow is it more important to stick to my original set my rigid schedule or to go with what I planned them to be available for my grandmother is missing that yoga class worth getting upset over just because plans didn't fall through the way that they were meant to be the more general question is what's more important getting what I want and keeping my plans or learning to go with the flow clearly to become a more peaceful person you must prioritize being flexible over rigidity most of the time it's also helpful to expect that a certain percentage of plans will change if you make allowances in your mind for this inevitability then whatever happens you can say here's one of those inevitabilities in this little expert you said like you'll feel more relaxed yet you won't sacrifice any productivity you may even become more productive because you won't need to expend so much energy being upset and worried and I think that's a big thing it's like okay I need to just relax accept the fact that I missed a plan that I wanted to make today well rather than worrying about it and rather than be upset over it I could just make more plans and now I have space and room in my life in my head to just clear it out just relax and plan something better and do something else in that time I feel like this little rigidity that I have is what makes it hard for people around me to to like ask me for things or talk to me about things because I'm so rigid with my plan and I'm like me I don't want to change anything and that's what he says - it's like it'll make the people around you feel more peaceful and relaxed around you that they won't be walking on eggshells to ask about different things my mom definitely tiptoes around me because I'm just really rigid with my plans and I'm like very set in my ways and I get like upset over small things that change those plans so I don't know just a little a little tidbit instead of going to that yoga class I'm just going to do yoga outside in the Sun and enjoy it and also be present over here compromise being flexible me and although this might seem like a normal thing to most of you guys to me it's not and this is something that I personally struggle with and I hope I'm not alone on this but some of you might just be like what the heck Amanda it's just like a change in plans just go and do something else like it's not a big deal to most people but it's a big deal to me [Music]", "MlKEp5kFqss": "row row row your blood fool the CVB break it down roll it up line it up hit it no more is 8800 work you know what I just realized I'm not rolling a blunt today

we have a product that I really really enjoy I'm gonna do a lot more reviews this year on things other than just the actual flower I'm gonna review a lot more CBD products and one of my favorite CBD products is tincture this right here is a honey lemon tincture it's 1500 milligrams and it's full spectrum CBD that you take a look at it this comes from let me get Michael let me get my influence at home and this how'd I do it oh yeah oh yeah it's the ozone Oh close close close Oh that's right sue me it's coming from Monroe farms it says to suggested for best results is to drop under tongue and hold for about 30 to 60 seconds one milliliter equals 50 milligrams of CBT the ingredients are MCT or derived from organic coconuts also help extract organic flavor organic stevia leaf extract extract of honey and lemon it's an all around the product it says that it's about you got to get about 30 servings per container um I like this product a lot mum reforms has great tincture see what I reached out to them and I ordered some one of the latest said they're not too proud of the bottle itself per se I don't think it's nothing wrong with it you know it's a bottle of tension but hmm almost [ __ ] some [ __ ] up it's a bottle of teacher I'm more into what's inside the bottle to see if it's actually gonna do me any good I've lived with this product for about a week now it's amazing for me you're not always gonna be in a situation to where you have access to be able to smoke the flower although I do think that smoking gives you the benefits and effects of the CBD the fastest tincture is excellent I use it throughout my workday and I'm sure that goes so you guys I got a one milliliter of it you see how it has just up that's like oh [ __ ] him it has a slight color to it so you're gonna put it up on your top [Music] now I'll put it up on the tongue you can still taste it I'm gonna do it another little jump on top of the tongue so I can just give you a little straighter flavor profile the honey is it's prevalent it's in the forefront you can really taste that honey I like honey hence the reason I really like this lemon honey tincture the lemon profile the lemon is there too but it's light it's not as strong as the honey is in it and with tincture I for me I found that it usually takes about 10 minutes maybe 5 to 10 minutes to kick in some people said 15 minutes there's just so many benefits from it everyone just can't smoke period everyone is not gonna be able to enjoy that CBD flower like that I have a friend who I gave a bottle of tincture to and she uses it she uses it for headaches she said it has done amazing things for her for her when she gets headaches you take some of the tincture and before you know it her headache is gone she also told me ladies she also told me that she uses the tincture for cramps she gets very very bad cramps and it just has her bent over sometimes so she'll use though she use the tincture for the cramps my aunty who is a she had a tumor removed from the back her neck she uses the tinctures she actually prefers the tinctures over prescribed medication I'm not trying to influence nobody in that way I'm just sharing the story of what my auntie does she swears by this CBD tension she swears by it she swam back she swept back I get it oh she swears by it it's been about three or four minutes and I can slow this off feel the effects coming in um it's it's gonna calm you down it's great for me it's great for my anxiety I can what I really like to do is I can have a meeting or something at work or if I'm going to be the client sometimes it you know stressful situations can cause that anxiety to kick in or or because that nervousness to kick in so I found that by taking the tension that it really helps settle that anxiety settle those nerves a little bit so that I can walk into that meeting confidently so I can meet that client confidently I can take this I can stand up in front of a group of people and talk fluidly and not be nervous I like the 1500 milligram there's a thousand milligram there's 1500 and I believe Monroe Farms also has a 3,000 milligram I've never tried the 3000 I want to know I want to try the 3,000 milligrams because the 15 milligram the 1,500 milligrams it usually I usually do - I'm not gonna lie I'll do one in front of the time I'll wait about 15 seconds let that kick in and then I'll do another one I'll do that one on top of the tongue and I won't even wait for that I'm gonna be honest I'll just go ahead and swallow it because I just feel like it's gonna kick in and I really like the 1500 I like the taste of the tinctures I really like the ease of access to them because even if you want if you don't want to just be doing drop something depending on the flavor of your Oh your tincture I like to add a droplet fool in my coffee I also drink a lot of water during the day I took a lot of water and what I'll do is I'll get my bottled water and I'll put me two or three drops in that bottle of water because I'm gonna be drinking on it so why not be getting me some CBD at the same time that's true it is it's kind of oily so it kind of sits on top of when you shake it up it's a little bit uh oil droplets other than your water it looks it can look kind of funky it can look kind of funky bleed bulid oh it's really really good like I like it a lot so I put it in my water and Monroe one wrong hemp is that they have good products I haven't I haven't had a strand of flour from them that I didn't like this is my very first tincture from them and like I said I've been having it for about a week living with it using it on a daily basis and I really enjoy it I plan on keeping me a bottle of it on hand I like to have it not only for myself but I like to have it for others around me that would like to try CBD and they're just not gonna smoke it so you know if I have with me and work and a co-worker's has a headache or putting them a little anxiety coming on I just wish they could relax a little bit I'll give them some of my teacher I'll [ __ ] with them and it's kind of like a it's kind of like a nice open door kind of open up to the CBD world because

"dBjFJRXboI8": "Marten Carlson: Hey guys, Marten here from\nMattress Clarity. Today, I'm reviewing the Populum Full-Spectrum\nHemp Oil. You've probably seen online a lot of videos,\na lot of articles about CBD oil. I want to talk a little bit about the science\nbehind that. I want to talk about the Populum here, my\nexperience with it, the benefits I felt, and some other things to consider. Let's get started. [music] Marten: I want to talk about the science behind\nCBD. First I want to say, if you want to see a\nlist of my top picks for CBD oil, Google Mattress Clarity best CBD oil. What exactly is CBD? It stands for Cannabidiol. It is a phytocannabinoid, a compound found\nin Cannabis sativa. One of the other phytocannabinoids which we're\ngoing to find in Cannabis sativa is THC. While THC is going to have some stony properties,\nit's going to give you that more of that high feeling, you're not going to get that feeling\nwith CBD taken from hemp plant. While THC is illegal in many states, CBD oil\ntaken from hemp plants is legal in all 50 states. Definitely keep that in mind. In terms of what exactly CBD can help you\nwith, while it's not going to give you that stony feeling, it can help with anxiety, nausea,\nand inflammation. Last but not least, it can help with sleep. As a person who deals with anxiety and that\nhas sleep issues, that's why I want to try out CBD oil. I want to know why you're interested in CBD\noil? Is it to help with your sleep, help with your\nanxiety, or for some other reason? Leave your answer in the comments section\nbelow. I want to see what everyone has to say. Now let's look at the Populum. Before I talk about the Populum, I do want\nto say I am not a doctor. If you're considering adding CBD to your medical\nregimen, or your sleep regimen, do talk to a medical professional. With the Populum here, you're going to have\nthree options -- 250 milligrams, 500 milligrams, and 1,000 milligrams. For the potency I went with a 500-milligram,\ntheir most popular potency. What exactly is in here? First off, you're going to have your CBD oil. This is a full-spectrum hemp oil. While some are going to be CBD isolates, some\nof those competitors are going to get only CBD oil, this is full spectrum. It's also going to have some other phytocannabinoids\nthat naturally occur in hemp plants. In here as well, you're going to have some\nphytocannabinoids such as CBG, which is also going to help with nausea and have anti-inflammatory\nproperties. In addition to that, you're going to have\nsome terpenes. Terpenes are essential oils found in the hemp\nplant, and those are going to have properties. They're going to help with the flavoring,\nalso give you some more sense of well-being. In here, you're also going to have hemp seed\noil, grape seed oil, coconut oil, and cold-pressed orange oil. There's a lot in this bottle. These extra elements are going to help with\nflavoring, also going to have some amino acids, help with your metabolism and your immune\nsystem. There's a lot in here. If you want to know exactly what's in this\nmodel, don't worry. Every bottle is going to come with your lab\nresults. You're going to know exactly what is in this\nbatch of CBD oil. It's also a third-party tested. While it's not FDA approved, you know exactly\nit's in this bottle. It's tested for quality and effectiveness. How do you use the Populum? It's very, very simple. You first, unscrew the top here, and it's\ngoing to be a dropper. In terms of how much you want to fill it with,\nit does depend on how long you've used CBD oil for. If you're just getting started, Populum recommends\nusing 8 milligrams to 8.5 milligrams. This is the 500-milligram potency so it's\ngoing to be about a half a dropper. Once I have that, I put it under my tongue\nand then squirt the liquid under my tongue. I'll leave it in my mouth for 30 seconds. They also recommend you can work the liquid\non your cheeks with your tongue. After the 30 seconds, take two deep breaths. You can drink down the liquid and you're good\nto go. Let's talk about my experience with the Populum. I'm going to break that down into three sections\n-- falling asleep, staying asleep, and then the morning after. In terms of falling asleep, this worked very,\nvery well for me. I took it for a few weeks. Every night before bed when I'm watching TV,\nI would take this about 30 minutes before bed, and it definitely calmed me down. My anxiety was less and I deal with anxiety. Before bed sometimes it was hard for me to\nfall asleep. With the Populum, I definitely fell asleep\nmuch more quickly. In terms of staying asleep, I slept through\nthe night with no problem. However, that's not usually a big issue for\nme, staying asleep, so take that into account. But it did not negatively affect my sleep. The morning after, that's where I had some\nissues with the Populum. Waking up, I did feel a little bit groggy,\na little bit washy as I'm started out my day at work, out of it a little bit, having trouble\nfocusing. I will note this is my first time using CBD\noil. I lowered my dose over the next couple days. It did seem to work itself out. But keep that in mind, if you're just starting\nto use the CBD for yourself. Let's talk about some of the pros and some\nof the benefits I experienced using the Populum. First off, it made it easier to fall asleep. If you're looking for a CBD oil to help you\nfall asleep more quickly, definitely ease you down into a nice state of relaxation before\nyou sleep, take a look at the Populum. Also, if you want something to help you stay\nasleep all night, the Populum worked for me in that respect. If you want to sleep throughout the night,\nthe Populum could also work for you. I'm also a big fan the fact the Populum is\nfull spectrum. You're not just getting a CBD isolate, you're\nalso getting other phytocannabinoids. You get the full effect of the hemp plant\nwith this full-spectrum hemp oil. Lastly, speaking about the third-party testing,\nI like the fact they bring in outside scientists to come in and test this product to make sure\nyou get the best quality, the best effectiveness with the CBD oil. Let's talk about the cons. Some of the things you might want to consider\nif you're looking at the Populum. First off, I experience some morning grogginess\nthe next day. If you want someone's going to help you wake\nup clear-eyed and refreshed, the Populum might not be the best match for you. Keep this in mind. If you're looking for something with a lot\nof potency options there are only three with the Populum -- the 250, the 500, and the 1,000-milligram. Some other companies are going to have five\nor six options, so more options for you in terms of potency. Also, this CBD oil is not FDA approved. That's not necessarily a con for the Populum\nbecause most CBD oils are not FDA approved. But keep this in mind if you're going to add\nthis to your medical regimen. Lastly, in terms of price, right now it's\n$99 for a bottle for the 500 milligrams. That is very affordable for a CBD oil, but\nif you're comparing this to other sleep supplements, it might be on the pricier side. In the end, I enjoyed my experience with the\nPopulum. It helped me fall asleep more quickly, stay\nasleep, very much a nice experience overall. I will just note, if you're looking for something\nto have you waking up feeling more refreshed, you might want to look elsewhere. That's about it.

about the difference between full-spectrum broad-spectrum and isolate based CBD hemp extracts [Music] I get this question all the time and it is honestly a pretty confusing topic people throw these phrases around without really knowing what they mean but today I'm gonna tell you exactly the difference between the three so first let's just talk about what this spectrum really is in full spectrum a broad spectrum and the spectrum really refers to the different compounds that are in the natural extract so when you think of a CBD oil it's not just CBD that's in that oil there's different fats there's different terpenes potentially different cannabinoids and other things that create the full picture and so in that sense a full spectrum product would be just that it has the entire full spectrum of naturally occurring compounds that are found in that extract so on the totally other side of the spectrum would be what's considered an isolate and as that sounds it's the CBD that's been stripped away and isolated from all the other naturally occurring compounds in that extract and then in the middle between an isolate and a full-spectrum extract you have the whole range of broad spectrum and as that sounds it doesn't necessarily have the full set of compounds but it has a lot of them or most of them for example at uncanny wellness we remove the THC from our products so that is technically part of the spectrum which is why we don't call ours a full spectrum extract instead it's a broad spectrum extract so it has the CBD it has the terpenes the flavonoids and all those other naturally occurring compounds in the extract a common misconception that people have is that you need THC in order for CBD to work properly there is some truth in that because THC and CBD work synergistically together but you don't need the THC for the CBD to work going off of that something like an isolate would work it just doesn't work necessarily as well as a full spectrum product so full spectrum is going to have apps everything in it as such if you remove any part of that spectrum whether you're removing the THC or even if you're distilling down and concentrating what's in the extract you're getting into the territory of broad spectrum so really most of what's out there in the market is gonna be a broad spectrum and not a full spectrum because full is just a very absolute phrase and as a natural result of the processing and extraction and refinement in to that final product form you do lose certain parts of that spectrum another important thing to understand is that the spectrum a full spectrum broad spectrum directly relates to what's known as the entourage effect and the entourage effect basically says that when you have CBD in conjunction with the other naturally occurring compounds that it's usually found with it has a greater amplified effect versus an isolate which is just CBD has no entourage has no other components of the spectrum and is less effective than a full or broad spectrum product so you can kind of think of it like there's more entourage effect happening the more full the spectrum is and as you start taking things away you're removing naturally-occurring compounds from that spectrum you're losing members of the entourage and over time you go all the way to an isolate format which has no entourage effects happening whatsoever the nice thing about a broad spectrum extract is that you can do something like THC removal which is what we do and that's nice for people that may have to get drug tested or just don't want any trace THC in their system or maybe they want to give it to their kids or a pet or they're a pilot or any reason like that they can still enjoy the benefits of the entourage effect and of a broad spectrum CBD extract without having any residual THC because the legal limit for hemp products is 0.3 percent THC so a full spectrum product could have at most 0.3% but you could easily remove that making a broad spectrum or end up removing everything for an isolate for most people the best option for a CBD product is going to be a full or broad spectrum extract isolates are kind of the pharmaceutical reduction of CBD it strips it away from everything else reducing its holistic nature and making it more controllable as such isolates are the cheapest form of CBD available and a lot of times people will actually just throw isolate into a product to make it a really high milligram count and then end up charging you more even though you're getting a lesser quality product so when you're out there trying to figure out which CBD product is best for you it's fair to either ask the company or look for where it says it on the label to see is it isolate broad spectrum or full spectrum and that should help you decide exactly what you're looking for so in summary on one end you have an absolutely full spectrum product that's gonna have the most other compounds besides CBD and it's going to have the most entourage effect on the other end you have an isolate where the CBD is stripped away from all the other naturally naturally occurring compounds there are no extra compounds in the extract and there's going to be no entourage effect and then in the middle you would have the range of broad-spectrum extracts that don't have all the naturally occurring compounds but have most of them and you're still getting the benefits of the entourage effect because of the turbines the flavonoids the polyphenols and all of the other array of compounds that are naturally present in a CBD hemp extract so that's it that's the breakdown between full spectrum and broad spectrum and isolate thank you so much for watching if you enjoyed this video please give it a like leave a comment down below if you want to share your thoughts and make sure to share this with friends so that they can understand the difference between these three forms of CBD as well that's all for today see you next time peace [Music]", "Ig6wsfxfNv8": "hey guys Dallas Norton with pure spectrum here today I'm going to be telling you all about how to use our hemp oil tincture our tincture comes in two different strengths a normal strength and an extra strength normal strength comes in a 15 milliliter and 30 milliliters serving size extra strength comes in a 30 milliliter and 60-million or serving size our THC free hump oil contains the full spectrum whole plant profiles including terpenes omegas flavonoids and other trace vital cannabinoids it's infused with an organic MCT oil and boosted with our pure CBD isolate finally third-party testing ensures purity and potency there are several ways to use our hemp oil tincture the most common way and the one that we recommend the most is doing this sublingually by placing the full serving dropper underneath your tongue holding it there for at least 30 seconds to let it absorb and then swallowing the rest down our tincture works best when taken consistently we recommend taking one to two servings daily and the time depends on your name", "s4LCzj5l69M": "[Music] have you ever wondered what exactly is meant by the phrase full spectrum cbd oil is there really any difference between a full spectrum product and say another type of cbd product let's take a look let me go ahead and remind new viewers to subscribe to the way of leaf youtube channel we deliver the industry's most accurate and up-to-date information on all things cannabis and cbd anyway back to the topic of what actually full spectrum cbd oil is it's really pretty simple cbd is just one of more than a hundred different compounds naturally found in the cannabis sativa plant a full spectrum cbd oil well contains pretty much all of these compounds a product like cbd isolate oil on the other hand contains just the cbd compound by itself after it's been filtered and fractionated off during the manufacturing process depending on what exactly you're trying to achieve full spectrum cbd oil can actually work better than a cbd isolate in fact research shows that when cannabinoids work together rather than isolated by themselves they're potentially more effective in terms of a therapeutic benefit this phenomenon is known as the entourage effect but we'll talk more about that later as far as what a full spectrum cbd oil actually contains they can include a variety of natural ingredients found in hemp and other types of cannabis these ingredients include things like phytocannabinoids essential vitamins and minerals beneficial fatty acids like omega-3s and omega-6s plant-based protein and fiber chlorophyll terpenes and flavonoids also it's important to understand that full spectrum cbd oil can come from both hemp and marijuana most of the cbd products you see for sale online and in places like gas stations and grocery stores are made from hemp that contains 0.3 thc or less full spectrum cbd oils can also be made from marijuana these oils have higher levels of thc but are only available in dispensaries in states that offer legal medical or recreational cannabis one of the most important studies relating to full spectrum cbd oil took place at the hebrew university of jerusalem in 2015. the study compared the performance of a full spectrum cannabis extract with one that contained cbd only and concluded that at least in mice the full spectrum oil was more effective for pain and inflammation in fact authors of the study claimed the whole plant cannabis extract was ideal for clinical use as compared to isolated cbd another great quote we like to use in order to describe the effectiveness of full spectrum cbd oil comes from dr ethan russo in a 2019 publication in frontiers in plant science dr russo's paper claimed that one molecule i.e cbd is unlikely to match the therapeutic potential of cannabis itself as a phytochemical factory in other words while pure cbd can be effective it appears that full spectrum cbd oil is the better option for therapeutic purposes do you have any more questions about what full spectrum cbd oil is is there anything that we left out feel free to join in the conversation by leaving a

off the CBD oil man his mess around your brain man you can't be too relaxed right yeah that's CBD [ __ ] it saves vacations for me I don't stress out like it's it's it's I think it's one of the best things I've ever tried for anxiety it's it's weird and I didn't even know I had anxiety until I started taking CBD I think these little jammies these are this is uh this will [ __ ] you up though this is one in one one part CB don't put this one but yeah it does not put this in your you can put in your butt but you will get no nervous you're gonna get paranoid but it's it's a weird like the CBD THC high is a different high because CBD does something to alleviate anxiety it sort of just leaks makes you comfortable with your own demise lets you do the existential angst is the flames don't seem so hot so you like yeah we're all gonna die yeah but right now we're not dead cool look at the colors let's feel that feel the warmth the Sun but this uh this is not like funk this is not functional like you don't wanna I don't do this if I have anything super important to do but but just CBD oil hmm I just find it it did puts you in a great place okay like it but I'm journal not topical its internal yeah topical is really good for muscle aches okay it's really good really the probably the best thing I've ever found for like a alleviating soreness and stiffness and stuff like that because I found I was yeah in Europe all of a sudden discovered that they actually had ibuprofen like cream to put on ibuprofens terrible for you alright really really bad what I found out was that if you let your pets lick it they get liver failure and die so don't did you guys accidentally didn't know I had a person who works at the Humane Society I mentioned you know mentioned that I found this stuff and like I just in desperation and Europe like she had some storm muscles and uh she's like don't let your pets like that cuz they were trying to kind of figure why these kittens were dying Oh God my friend Cameron Haynes is a runner and he runs marathons and runs ultra marathons he runs he's 240-mile Moab [ __ ] ridiculous runs that last three days and he was having like all this joint pain so he's taking ibuprofen every day of st. taking 800 milligrams not just once but sometimes twice a day and he was just constant aches and pains so dr. Rhonda Patrick had been on the podcast she was talking about the dangers of ibuprofen and about what it does to your gut biome and how much it [ __ ] you up and it actually creates inflammation and actually can cause stress or it can cause strokes rather and all sorts of horrible horrible things so I call him up and I said hey man that stuff's fine to take every now and then for a headache but you can't take that [ __ ] every day you just can't do it and you're you're [ __ ] your body up just get off of it and I sent him the recording he listened to it he's like Jesus Christ I don't have a stroke so he gets off of it all his pain goes away it turned out his pain was being caused not just by the running but by the fact that he was creating inflammation by destroying his gut biome by taking 800 milligrams of ibuprofen 2 times a day so the idea of like fixing himself was [ __ ] him up crazy death chasing that yeah yeah so [ __ ] ibuprofen okay well we don't I take it every now and then but you can't take it every day so you're a liar no I mean just saying don't take it every day but if I had like a bad headache I'll take you some Tylenol or some [ __ ] it's not Tylenol right Advil yeah yeah it's it's it's just not something you're supposed to take all the time yeah I never realized it was doing what you said yes I was more achy than I should be and then like you know bad night out you didn't drink enough water right okay boom coming ahead yeah then you're fine you can still do that but CBD does that too it's better better for you than all that stuff seems to be no side effects okay all right the side effects is people think you're a hippie that's the only side effect right", "wmAOe_klMKY": "[Music] hello looks like Alistair is making a transaction here of some kind I don't know what you think you're gonna get out of there hey sweetie are you cold hey Connor all right yeah it's no one all right okay so we're up in Lake Tahoe area is that for cove on the Nevada side so we came up here originally to my sister Eden because we're not certain on all the Utah laws regarding CBD oil now it doesn't mean that you can't take it in Utah they do sell it I think some people say like hey you need a card from a doctor it really just depends because we were uncertain about the laws we decided to come out to Nevada so anyway yeah because we were uncertain we just came out to Nevada my sister lives out here in Reno so we came up the mountain to Tahoe she's gonna meet up with us here and give you guys a little bit more information I also want to stay in fatica Lee we are not legal counsel you are responsible you do your own research find out what it is you need to know and your local laws hi my name is Ian Wakefield and I am a full-time cannabis consultant and I also run a cannabis coaching business on the side yeah and why are you here what are you doing well I'm Robbie's oldest sister and I'm here to help with Ian's issues that he faces with his autism with some CBD oil okay and what kind of this can you pull it back to your face love it yes this is the harmonious brand CBD it's a full spectrum that's different from a distillate in that this contains all of the compounds of the hemp plant versus distillate which would only contain the CBD itself so this is better than what I just said find over the shelf at like my local mall or like that absolutely also because you may find full spectrums here and there in that way but you won't always have somebody who has put their lab testing next to the product online there is always going to be current lab tests for every batch with the bottle okay and in full disclosure we are using this for free thanks to the generosity of Ian sprint Eden's friend at harmonious I'm Eden Eden Ian we screw it up sometimes so there they're gonna offer this this to us for free so we could try it out yeah so that's nice yeah very nice of them yeah anything else you want to say about it or huh you know I stand by a hundred percent i I tell everybody about it that I can and especially people who are afraid to try THC or you know any of the heavier products this is a really really great alternative well and that's another thing too so THD THC versus CBD why don't you tell us maybe just very briefly the legality involved but also you know how THC is a neurological inhibitor or that kind of thing yeah THC has many medicinal benefits that are we're still exploring in science and the legalities kind of put a damper on that because federally it's not legal to actually perform lab testing on actual cannabis in the United States this is from the hemp plant cannabis is cousin and it has all the other medicinal medicinal compounds that you're going to want but yeah as far as something that has higher THC in it that's going to be where you're going to need to be in a legal state and and deal with it on your own make your own decisions accordingly mileage may vary no this is fine this is this is over-the-counter type stuff yeah yeah you can order this this is this is legally able to be shipped throughout the United States without problem including Utah including Utah yeah so we just found out about this recently and sorry if my voice is a little bit muffled behind the mic but we just found out the laws change so rapidly that Utah has legalized CBD oil over the counter I think it's okay to give it to minors in Utah we were unsure so we came out here to Nevada because I knew my sister would know better than most in accordance with local laws and customs and things like that yeah this is completely legal to give your kids the FDA is trying to step in and stop CBD from being able to be given to pets and kids and things like that and we're working on fighting that because CBD isn't regulated though that's why I prefer to go to this brand because he does things through state regulations so even though it can be shipped Internet you know anywhere you wanted to go it's still above board for a product that you know is going to be regulated you know that this is going to be factual okay awesome yeah was anything else you wanted to say I'm just really grateful to Brandon and Anthony and the guys over at Harmonia CBD for being so generous is to offer us this opportunity to see how we can help Ian with CBD oil okay how long I'm gonna do another Tong three drops one two three that's it hmm three jobs three jobs to start yep sweet drops looks perfect oh good it's better than a half one because a half one makes my likes crazy I just like your spirit on does how was it taste I taste a low flame a little fight yeah what would you say to people who just say you're judging your kid you're just making them passive and zombie like that would you have to say about that well at first I'd say that's not true that's not what happens I mean Ian's as talkative and has as much of his personality as ever he's he's a bit calmer and I'd argue that this medicine isn't really for us the parents it's honestly more for the kid they're less anxious they're able to sleep better they're able to concentrate better on the tasks they have at school and the tours they have at home and whatever choose for their mind - I think it's highly beneficial yeah and that's been for a spiritum so we think so far of the oil well I'd say the biggest difference I've noticed between risperidone and the CBD oil is that risperidone immediately makes in sleepy and he is actually more tired and more lethargic on her Sparrow dome than he is on CBD oil although the CBD oil has a more calming effect yarr that may not be true for so much my understandings of you in facts so I'm trying to get through this it affects people differently based on their um their body chemistry and their neurological I'm not sure why that is so it's really nice to see and reacting well to it it's still too early to tell if this will be a permanent replacement does it risperidone but again whether it's perd\u00f3n it's just there's too many side effects that long-term we think what could be detrimental especially how it makes him a little bit sleepy to begin with and then that is kind of like pacifying him not that we want him to behave that way it's just how he responded to it and so as many people have mentioned online with medications there's a kind of a cocktail that people go through where they try risperidone and that doesn't work so they try a belif and vilify abilify and they just kind of go down the list of different medications until that wears off then they go on to the next thing and we want to try something that's made available more natural a little bit more long-term the Ian can take and not have any major side effects so far the only side effect we can see that I guess you could say was major was that he woke us up at 4:00 a.m. and he goes daddy I'm hungry so he he had the munchies for a lack of a better term so one of the things we did want to mention is we're starting out small and we're working our way up so we started a very small dosage and we monitor Ian's heart rate and things like that so I put my hand on his wrist I did a stopwatch and he was about 75 beats per minute so he did well in the middle of the night I checked his pupils made sure that they weren't dilated or anything like that and they reacted just fine another thing that is nice is the cost it's about half as much as risperidone how did you feel I feel I feel good I feel good what was the word you said fantastic you felt fantastic a little bit fantastic well that's good yeah do you still feel fantastic yeah cuz I've done a lot of I was playing with my freak imaginary friends they're right they're directors it's crowded there are there's a lot of them there's a lot of your imaginary friends yeah they're all come to a party with me and us nice dear hey everybody we're back in Utah right out here walking with Ian you can probably hear him say hey hey guys yes you are so I just want to do a quick little recap here kind of a summary of the week in Nevada where basically ending Ian's dosage on the CBD oil I'd love to continue it actually I had some pretty good results it doesn't last as long as his or spare at all but I like that it doesn't have as many side effects especially the drowsiness that comes with her spear at all hopefully it doesn't get too loud we're heading into a construction area I would have done it inside the house but the kids have been super noisy so I come out here and there's construction everywhere what do you do so anyway um basically the the Utah laws are such that we can't continue the CBD oil to the best of my understanding you guys can correct me in the comments section if you want let me know more but as I checked the last bill that was passed in 2018 was like 200 pages long I don't have time to read it most people don't and it basically covered things like epilepsy in terms of getting a medical card and autism wasn't even on that list so yeah you basically need permission from a doctor or a medical card saying that you know your child needs CBD oil I forgot to mention too if any of you are new to the channel it's been well documented that ian has autism you can see his paperwork there just because we get that question a lot because he is more or less high-functioning now and you can talk a lot of people are like is even autistic should you be giving him medication yes he is but anyway aside from all that we would have loved to continue using CBD oil and you know many people do no matter what the laws are I don't think anyone's going to come after those people we want to be careful because we're putting on YouTube and inevitably you get one or two zealous parents who are like that's it I'm gonna call Child Protective Services on you you're torturing your kid you're a terrible parent blah blah blah long story short you know they're they're calling people and just making your life miserable because they've got nothing better to do we're trying to do the best we can for our son that's the honest to goodness truth we really want Ian to be happy and healthy and when it comes to more severe autism and he's not very severe but the further you go down the spectrum the more difficult life becomes just doing basic things just feeling like you can go outside without being overwhelmed and he has a difficult time with that kind of stuff he gets overwhelmed so it helps him yes it helps us to that's an added benefit but the the first priority is to help him out so he can go to school you can go to church you can go to public places and not be overwhelmed and just make it through the day without tons of problems so we appreciate my sister and her friends for letting us have the oil for free I'm very nice of them it doesn't reflect anything on our review we just tell the truth you know how it is it's not a magic bullet it's it's been great though so far I would recommend it to those who want to try it of course your mileage may vary just depends on the person everybody's chemistry is different so yeah I hope that was helpful and if you guys of course have any comments questions let us know appreciate all of our supporters and we will see you next time", "_qNbztygtRI": "[Music] what's up gentlemen today I want to talk about a hot topic something that you guys have been probably hearing a lot about and that is CBD oil now big disclaimer right up front I'm in no way shape or form at all recommending that you take CBD oil this is something that you've got to do your own research you've got to decide whether or not it's right for you alright today I just want to share with you my experience and what I have found as a result of using CBD oil every day for the past seven months these are my bottles of CBD oil a few months ago back in April I did a video talking about my nighttime routine in that I sort of told you that I was starting to experiment with CBD oil and I was liking the results but I wasn't ready to share my thoughts I did that last video back in April about trying CBD I got tons of companies reaching out saying hey do you want to try my CBD do you want to try our CBD do you want to try our CBD the issue with CBD in this industry something that you're going to find out if you start exploring and experimenting is that anybody and their mother can create a private-label CBD company there are a lot of companies out there that manufacture hemp or that grow hemp that are like oh let's get in on the CBD market and their private labeling the stuff and so there are so many tons of different brands out there now the big issue is that you have no idea what you're taking you have no idea of the potency the strength and with CBD it is my personal opinion that you got to know what the hell you are actually taking a lot of these I would say the majority of these CBD companies out there you really have no idea and the only way you're going to be able to figure out dosage and if something's working and what you can change is if you have a super pure form of CBD oil and you actually are buying it from a company that is like in the business of standardizing things testing things and making sure that the product that they're giving you is pure and plant therapy is a company that's been around for years I have known about the because they specialize in essential oils and oil therapies and that is why the company plant therapy is my choice and my partner for this video I've been using plant therapies CBD oil for the past four months they're in the business of oils and extracts and making sure that the quality is there the transparency is their plan therapy is the best in the business in my opinion I have tried a lot of other CBD brands and I noticed the biggest difference when I was actually able to know what specific dosage I was taking and then monitor it and adjust it from there the plan therapy extracts are pure they do the research they cite all of their research guys they have done an amazing job cutting out all the [ __ ] and making sure that they are providing you incredible information something that I asked them to do for you because there are so much information out there when it comes to CBD oil on our landing page down below they have three sections that I encourage you to go and check out if you're thinking about experimenting or trying CBD oil number one is the frequently asked question you've got a question about CBD oil chances are somebody else has had that question it's going to be listed there along with the answer there's also going to be a section about the proposed benefits of CBD oil and then there's also and this is something that's incredibly important the serving chart so that you know sort of what you're taking how to sort of structure a plan that's going to be right for you and if after and only after you do all of your research you decide that you want to try CBD oil guys you will not go wrong buying from plant therapy we have a discount code there are also three different strengths there they have three different flavors you've got natural you are like unflavored you've got cinnamon and you've got pina colada I am a fan of the sentiment and the natural just doesn't really taste like anything that's it now let's talk about my experience with CBD alright so about seven months ago I decided it was finally time for me to try CBD oil I had been suffering with a little bit of anxiety I've also been suffering from some injuries from working out I've always slept like really good but three benefits primary benefits that you hear people reporting from trying CBD oil is sleep anxiety and sort of like inflammation now the reason why those three things are so like reported when it comes to CBD oil is what CBD oil is now I'm not going to attempt to try and explain what a cannabinoid is and how you've got different receptors like in your brain and in your body that's part of like the endocrine system I'm not going to go into the whole independent how cannabinoids work but if you are interested in learning why CBD oil is actually effective for treating certain things guys hit our link and go read sort of the FAQ s and more about CBD oil and how it really works but at the end of the day about seven months ago I decided I was going to give it a try for one is anxiety I have been a little bit stressed lately and not like feeling like myself and so I was you know like hey if this can help a little bit with anxiety and kind of just like take the edge off I'm good um the other thing is sleep now I typically sleep very well but I was like hey if it can improve my sleep I know that sleep is like one of the most important things that you're going to do during the day or during the night that's going to help you with so many other things and the other thing is inflammation I have been suffering because I exercise like all the time and I use my body hard I am always dealing with like some type of injury and I had something called plantar fasciitis for a few months and probably started about I don't know probably nine months ago and it just wasn't getting any better and it was a bit debilitating and so I'm like alright I got to try something because what I'm trying is not working and I did not want to go to like a position and just get like shot with like a cortisone shot or something like that I am a firm believer that nature can heal us but I'm not like some like crazy over-the-top like weirdo like never use like antibiotics and definitely get your vaccines but I am a believer in in nutrition I'm believer in supplements and taking multivitamins and vitamin b-complex and C and d3 like I believe in all that stuff I grew up on it I was in the nutrition industry for a long time and it's just something that I personally believe in for me and so I decided to give CBD oil a try I went to one of my buddies who was sort of in the business I'm like yo can you hook me up he's like yeah and so he sent me this I'm like all right I had no idea what I was doing but I was like all right I'm gonna try this at night now something else you need to understand they're really two types of different CBD oil there is full spectrum and there is broad spectrum CBD full spectrum means that it also has THC THC is the stuff in weed that gets you high now in CBD oil that is full-spectrum it is a very low dose like I think legally it has to be like under like 0.3% and and I could be wrong about that in order for it to be sold legally but I didn't want to take anything with THC I don't smoke weed personally not that I have anything against it I know a lot of people some of my best friends some of my loved ones absolutely do smoke weed it's just not something that I like I don't like the way that it makes me feel and so I decided to go with a broad spectrum full spectrum CBD has everything including a little bit of THC I didn't want that and so I went broad-spectrum and so I got my bottle I was like all right he's like yo use one dropper I'm like all right I had no idea what milligram I didn't know anything about that but at night before I went to bed like after I brushed my teeth and did all that I took a dropper under my tongue held it there under my tongue for about a minute swallowed it and that first night I slept like a frickin rock was it the CBD I had no idea all I knew is that I slept like a rock I'm like damn I slept like super sound I didn't sleep longer but when I woke up I felt just like invigorated I felt like I got more sleep than I actually did and so I'm like yo that was pretty awesome and so next night guess what I did boom exactly again and guess what I slept like a rock so month number one through three I took it one time a day at night before I went to bed and my sleep was good my anxiety I didn't really notice anything my plantar fasciitis in my body it's still eight and so I really didn't notice anything there and then once I started doing more research I realized that a lot of people are saying that you need to take CBD oil actually twice a day and so when I started with actually I started with this one therapy I started with the lowest dosage 16 milligrams or 16 milligram milliliters 500 milligram bottle like I said guys if you have no idea about dosage that link down below there's a chart that actually will talk you through sort of how to start using this and trying it and all that's good stuff anyway took it at night but then what I started doing in the afternoon at around 11 o'clock after I got done exercising I started taking it again and almost immediately I felt this like it was weird I felt this just like calmness and I'm like could it be like the CBD oil or is it totally like placebo effect but the next day did it again afternoon along with at night and I was chill I felt better and then I'm like alright I really got to test this out and so then the third day I didn't take it and I I don't know like I said I don't know if it was placebo effect I personally don't believe it is because I was like I was chilled I felt good I wasn't all like stressed out and anxious something else that happened about like two weeks after I started taking it twice a day my foot my leg it started to feel better I wasn't all like sore and getting like muscle cramps and spasms now I'm not saying that everything is linked I'm not saying that CBD oil cured everything but I know that my foot started to feel better and so the next bottle that I got from plant therapy actually upped the dosage to thirty three milligrams with a thousand milligrams bottle and and that's when it kind of like went away completely my pain in my foot twice a day rocking this and honestly I'm on my fourth bottle now of of the plant therapy CBD I feel better than I've felt in a really long time and I was a bit skeptical from from the first time I started hearing about CBD am I you know like I was like okay this is just a fad this really doesn't work and so going into it being a skeptic and really taking my time over the past seven months and sort of analyzing and trying different dosages and and and different amounts like I feel like I have like my formula for me and I'm going to continue to take CVD oil because I truly feel for me it was beneficial and I feel great and so I just wanted to do this video and kind of share my opinion my opinion is for me I feel like it's made a big difference for me I'm gonna keep doing it but I don't know I mean you've got to decide for yourself like I said there's a ton of information out there there also a ton of brands you've just got to be careful you've got to make sure that the brand that you're buying is pure you've got to make sure that you know what you're doing and you don't just like try like one milligram this day and one milligram that day and just like all over the place typically you don't just try something once and feel like amazing for me I don't know if it was placebo effect I don't know if it was the CBD oil but I noticed the difference my anxiety I noticed that immediately my sleep but regardless of if it was possible effect or not I don't care because I feel better I just wanted to do this video I told you that I would back in April when I sort of mentioned that I was starting to use CBD oil and seeing some positive results for me I'm gonna keep doing it for me I love it for me I truly feel like it's been a bit of a game changer in my overall well-being in health I don't know what the long-term effects of CBD oil is I don't know that it's been out long enough there could be adverse effects I have no idea but I know that for right now you know I I dig it and I encourage you that if you're somebody who struggles with something of you know sleep anxiety or maybe you know pain or some issues but but there are other things right because you know this endocrine system it's like a collection of like glands and it regulates hormones and just makes everything in your body work better and so do your research like I said there are other reported benefits but these were the three most reported and the three that I was interested in seeing if it would actually have an effect on me but at the end of the day guys you've got to decide for yourself do not do it because I'm doing it do it because you want to you have to do your research", "Hr22KInfWJg": "before buying CBD oil you need to know your choices and full spectrum CBD oil is one of them cannabis and it's byproducts are gaining popularity in many of the places both in the United States and around the world that have loosened their laws surrounding this plant the majority of the united states now have at least medical marijuana laws in place with 11 states legalizing the plant and its byproducts for recreational use CBD oil has staked its claim as one of the most beneficial and popular cannabis products being used to treat everything from back pain to seizures as you probably guessed not all CBD oil is created equally and there are actually four different types and you should know about one of which being full-spectrum so give me your attention for the next few minutes and we'll address what full spectrum CBD oil is and how it varies from the other varieties first type we'll talk about is marihuana derived CBD oil many of the early studies regarding CBD oil point to a very synergistic effect between the compounds of THC and CBD thus people who have a medical card or do not mind the high that comes with taking CBD THC might want to seriously consider this oil onto CBD isolated CBD isolate is the purest form of CBD you can possibly take it is normal for manufacturers to distill the CBD as many as four times to get the purest product possible scientists think that this may not be the best way to take CBD though since you are losing out on many of the other cannabinoids and minerals in the refinement process but if you are in a situation where you need to closely monitor what goes into your body then this is your product finally full-spectrum CBD even here we find two different variations of full-spectrum CBD oil the first type is zero percent THC full-spectrum much of the oil currently produced comes from the head plant which normally has a small percentage of THC in it in most cases this is not enough to produce the high feeling but still will leave a small percentage of THC in your bloodstream so there are a lot of situations when a consumer may want to avoid THC completely if that's your situation then this is the type of full-spectrum we recommend last but not least is full-spectrum CBD with THC full-spectrum CBD is also commonly referred to as whole plant CBD because it is derived from the entire front plate there are a lot of benefits to consuming some face CBD in the full spectrum variety since you were able to get

dose of CVD with a higher than usual concentration of CBG using only TAC free high CBG distillate this tincture boasts a twenty to one ratio of CBD to c22 one CBD CBD ratio that means that for every 20 milligrams of CBD you ingest you also get one milligram of CBG all right so uh I guess you wonder what the hell CBG is all I'm gonna tell you kena biker all is one of more than 120 identified cannabinoid compounds found in the plant genus cannabis that's why I provide links in the pin comment so you can check it out for yourself so what has been my experience with this tincture you can

ingesting taking and CBD because I don't like the earthiness taste the earth Venus earth earth taste dirt I know it's too much I mean I've done was you know review some companies that a sit with the the the whatchamacallit the term terpenes that whoever their chemist is is the [ __ ] and so it's tweedle farms now this I said remember it's 250 milligrams so serving size is 1 mil one is 1 mil is the dropper and the serving servings per container is 15 so you can drop this right here it's saying it's 15 servings in here so you will use this 15 times depending on how you medicate this one besides when I last you too long so you're able to get this up into a 30 mil bottle and a 30 mil contains 30 doses per container but again who knows how much you will you need to medicate your body

up subscribe all that good stuff and I'll catch you in the next one come out [Music]", "0g7ZEfg3kGY": "[Music] you'll often hear me say that CVD is the most important molecule to come into functional and integrative medicine in the last thirty years now that's a big statement and the reason I say that is because of its ability to harmonize the endocannabinoid system and what that yields is what I call neuro endo immune poise it balances neurotransmitters in the brain it balances the immune system and it even balances hormones in the body now that sounds awesome but one of the things that we have a problem with is bioavailability with CBD when you take normal CBD you only get six to ten percent of it into the body now our nano emulsified full-spectrum CBD has set the benchmark for bioavailability giving five to six fold increases in bioavailability and addition to that it's giving you a very rapid onset in fact in these deliveries we can measure these compounds in your blood in as little as two minutes and they peak in the blood between 15 and 25 minutes now in our full spectrum extract we use the full spectrum all the cannabinoids including a farm bill compliant amount of THC and we blend into that our proprietary 11 terpene blend into our delivery system to rapidly give you all the benefits of CBD [Music]", "7t7Jkz8Iu7k": "as part my daily routine I always take

me tell you about it cv d stands for Canada doll which is the second most prevalent of the active ingredients of cannabis also known as marijuana but don't worry it does not contain THC so it doesn't get you high and it has significant medical properties some of these some of the treatments CBD is useful for is for depression anxiety headaches seizures chronic pain and more and I'll tell you about a few more later so why choose our product well this is a we leaf CBD tincture right here the price for this is ninety dollars it's one of the best bang for your buck in the CBD marketplace most comparable tincture is in terms of potency are $110 or more so you're already saving a lot right out the gate the quality is tough to be - it's 1,800 milligrams of high-quality full-spectrum CBD which means it has the most beneficial and therapeutic parts of the hemp plant in the product already and that is delivery method to here this is a tincture which is essentially a plant extract that dissolved into a solution and put into a glass bottle that has a dropper on top so I'll just demonstrate how you can actually use the product you simply unscrew the top squeeze pull it out place it under your tongue and then you hold it for about 2 to 5 minutes to let it fully absorb into your bloodstream alternatively you can put it on food or you put it in your favorite drink too so very versatile delivery method so what is the customer profile for CBD well stressed out Millennials is one of the biggest age 21 to 35 who use these products for anxiety depression and insomnia great example of this is a good friend of mine who had a traumatic experience earlier in life it deals with a lot of anxiety and just get stressed out easier than most so they actually used it - did you deal with their anxiety symptoms deal with their stress feel more relaxed feel more calm and just feel happier and just enjoy life more and mitigate their symptoms and then the other category is baby boomers age 56 and older we're looking for to address chronic conditions like pain management inflammation a great example of this is actually my father who ran in college in high school he's got bad knee issues he's had surgeries before had to use opiates to treat his pain she doesn't like to do but recently he's discovered CBD actually are are we leaf 1800 milligram original hem picture we have other flavors like bananas strawberries so whatever you like we started using the product recently it's been a lifesaver for him he's seen a lot of great benefits from and he's really enjoying him so some common customer concerns we get am I going to fail a drug test if I use CBD not necessarily the only way you fail a drug test is if you use full spectrum CBD and take it orally which means you are eating it drinking it you know putting in your body somehow but if you use that same full spectrum on your skin topically for skin conditions and pain you'll be totally fine you will not fail drug tests alternatively you can also use a CBD isolate which is just purely CBD nothing else added to it so you'll be fine with that as well if you take that orally some competitor threats I'd like to talk about or that there's a ton of different CBD companies out there it's really everywhere right every gas station go to every store you know you can find CBD and although CBD is an emergent market we leave really differentiates itself by being cost-effective and high quality giving customers what they need for the price they want it to some additional benefits we'll talk about is that CBD is antibacterial can reduce withdrawal symptoms can even inhibit cancer cell growth so there's a lot of amazing benefits so if you have a problem there's a decent shot CBD can be used to treat it for our marketing strategy we try to find new customers 40% of customers 21 and up would try CBD so there's plenty of customers out there who haven't tried it already we differentiate our brand so because I'm among all the competitors you know you need to develop a strong brand identity we retain customers by using affiliate marketing testimonials and rewarding return customers online advertising is great having a good online presence and utilizing search engine to be found easily online and then retail availability as well to try to get into all the local stores that sell CBD in my area so finally if

like these are also found in plants like hemp these are called phyto cannabinoids hemp is rich in phytochemicals in addition to other phytonutrients one of hemp primary constituents is CBD or cannabidiol when CBD oil is extracted other plant components come along with it this is what's referred to as a full spectrum hemp extract hemp CBD has a remarkable safety profile is non psycho toxic and has shown great promise for human health because each individual's ECS is unique the path to balance is different from one person to the next just like some days we need one cup of coffee other days we may need to by adding hemp CBD supplements to your wellness regimen you are balancing the system that's designed to balance you learn more about + CBD oil and what its full spectrum of phytonutrients can do for you", "YH63Z30fc8w": "hello and thank you for joining us here at the green dad i just wanted to hop on here and say hello hello uh and also to talk about a cbd product that i use earlier today i had posted on my instagram account about my morning routine which includes two two capsules of the host defense mushroom blend for your brain and memory function one five milligram thc bill from tech in pennsylvania and 15 milligrams one milliliter of the lazarus naturals full spectrum cbd oil and after i posted that i had a few people reach out to me about recommendations for cbd cbd oil and products i like and so i figured i'll just hop on here in case anybody else was curious or looking for a really good recommendation for a solid product and i cannot say enough about lazarus naturals their products their customer service the company they are really easy to work with they make a great product small independent form outside of portland oregon if you place your order before one o'clock on the east coast time it ships out that day and it usually ships with free three-day shipping anywhere in the us you can get different sizes you can actually get all different types of blends you can get mint you can get flavors you can get full spectrum you can get isolate you can get broad spectrum they have a whole bunch of great things your stuff your pets their stuff for your kids a lot of good stuff to choose from i've been using uh this blend for about a year now i was diagnosed with arthritis in my knee and the doctor said you can either eat better and add in a anti-inflammatory diet and a regimen of cbd and medical marijuana or we can inject you with silicone in your knees and i said [ __ ] that not gonna happen so i opted for the anti-inflammatory diet route and the cbt and medical marijuana uh route i mean you know that sounds a lot better than getting injected your knee if you ask me um but because of previous existing conditions in my kidney i couldn't take a lot of the painkillers and a lot of ibuprofen that would help with the pain and the swelling so i opted for the diet and the cpt in marijuana route wasn't a tough decision not even close big surprise i know but anyway that is how i got to getting familiar with this product um i was trying i tried the gummies which you know from you know a good company that makes a good product there's nothing wrong with gummies or anything like that i just happened to click with this product it was easy to use it was just a perfect amount well i think a lot of people don't know or have a grasp because you know we'd like to think that bigger bigger better stronger is always the case but um with a lot of like a lot of other um plant nutrients and vitamins you can only take so much of something into your system before it doesn't really do anything um major then you know the certain tolerant amount um so 15 to 25 milligrams twice a day is actually quite enough um to help regulate your endocannabinoid system and help with inflammation in the pain which is why i love this product so much it is a full spectrum product which means it is full plant and all the cannabinoids that are in it mostly well-known part is the cbd the cannabidiol extract and it can have up to three tenths of one percent of thc um and i just for believer that using the whole plant and the whole product the way it was meant to be is the best route you can get it without the teach you know if you need to because of either insurance or drug testing or anything like that but you can get a full spectrum cbd shipped to you in all 50 states it's completely legal you won't get hired from it anything like that i'm not going to go too much into the basics of cbd because i'm guessing if you're watching for recommendations you already are using it or or already have made the decision to use it there's plenty of great resources out there if you want to learn more you can go to thegreendad.net you can uh check out my instagram page at the green dad on instagram or you know thousands literally of other places out there just please don't buy your cbd gas stations seriously don't do it it's yeah anyway but uh usually i will take this sub lingually which means you take off the gap it comes with a measured dropper up into the line is one milliliter of dose [Music] and you can just literally here i'll show you i'll do it right now you take it you can see it's all natural still green just straight up plant extract is mixed with an coconut oil mct uh medium chain triglyceride because uh cannabinoids need to bond with the fatty substance in order to be processed by your body so you you measure it out you just literally just squirt it under your tongue all right let it chip for about 30 seconds um if you really want to absorb into your mouth you want to absorb under your tongue so it can get into your bloodstream it takes about anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours for it to really take effect and i'm going to wash that down another great thing about these tinctures is you can also if you don't want to put them under your tongue because it does have a very strong cannabis plant flavor i happen to like it not everyone does but you know if you want to try you can try a smaller bottle to see if it's a flavor that you like and get into but i said you can get other flavors if that is more of your thing but the other good news is you can also put that full dropper into your morning coffee you can put it into your cereal or your oatmeal blend it up again i prefer it's sublingually i like it to be concentrated to go directly into my bloodstream um if you put it in your coffee just keep in mind that since it is an oil impulse on top it doesn't actually fully mix in unless you have a water soluble type cbd tincture which this is not this is an oil so it will just basically it'll sit on top of the coffee or your tea or whatever beverage you put it in it doesn't really fully blend in so you have to kind of make sure you eat the whole layer on top so you're basically going to get all of it first anyway so you know i prefer to put it with a tincture and wash it down with some tea or some water just personal opinions you know go with what works for you but i really like this product and its flavor so it doesn't it doesn't bother me uh but if you're getting the bigger bottle of this uh this is 120 milliliters so there's 120 doses in this of the you know the 15 milligram doses in the one milliliter uh but me and my fiance usually will use uh takes about two months to go through a bottle of this size uh that is with a dose in the morning with our coffee and then about half hour before bed um you know sometimes if they're having a little bit of rougher time you can take some more so but we can usually get about two months out of a bottle of that size and that is the 15 milligram per dose you can get a higher dose of 50 milligrams per serving but i don't wouldn't recommend that unless of course obviously you have some severe issues you have severe chronic pain you have severe um inflammatory issues that you need to to cope with um or really i mean like extreme anxiety but if you have that type of anxiety you probably you know might be looking at some other alternative treatments for that but you know again like um 15 milligrams in the morning with coffee to get you going 15 before night one thing i will mention i just didn't really want to get into too much of the basics of this but i can't stress this enough one of the biggest misconceptions is that you're gonna take it oh and you're gonna paint it's gonna go away like it's taking a pill or an aspirin or something like that or you're gonna take a whole bunch in like 20 minutes you're going to go to sleep that's not how cbt works in the body what it does is it helps to regulate the system the endocannabinoid system and part of the endocannabinoid system is pain maintenance the part of the brain that controls sleep part of the brain that controls anxiety and processes that or it does it just regulates it keeps it healthy so that you can you know keep a regular schedule when you know when you lay down at night your body has different things that it goes through to prepare you for sleep and you know you're highly anxious or if you have a lot of stress or pain it can take away from your body's ability to regulate that system so what this basically does is just allows you to get better sleep it's the absence of some of the stress cbd has been found to really counteract cortisol which is released when you're stressed as well as you know all the other the things i've mentioned so that is why i'm a huge huge believer in this product and use it for those reasons another thing that you may or may not be aware of if you also smoke cannabis whether it be for adult recreational use or for medicinal if you get some of these strains that are usually sativa or sativa dominant which can kind of get that little racy feeling or a little bit of anxiety from smoking um not really paranoid or bugging out but sometimes you'll just get a little jittery feeling or your brain is kind of still you know because it's like a plant so sometimes for me some tativas are like having a cup of coffee um if you take 15 milligrams you know one stopper full of that oil about 10 to 20 minutes ahead of smoking um a plant or some flowers you'll find that it can take the edge off of some of those other items i mean it is from the cannabis plant thc thca is meant to bond with cbd and you get a thing called the entourage effect but only goes one way the entre effect cbd only enhances and helps thc thc does not have the same effect back towards cbt or cbg those items are helping the thas but again there's plenty of other resources for that one just want to kind of stick to this and get you on your way so uh yeah i will list more information about lazarus naturals in the comments and if there's anything else you have questions about or concerns or topics you want me to talk about or maybe your own personal experiences with cbd you can leave that down in the comments and i'll get back to you on that and you know if you have any other items you'd like to see me review or talk about outside of what i have planned you know that's always welcomed as well i look forward to your feedback and i hope this finds you well uh if you want to keep up to date with all the fun things we're going to talk about you can hit subscribe follow along like i said you can head over to instagram you head over to twitter the greendad.net all those fun places anyway smoke if you got them thanks for listening and i'll talk to you guys soon thanks you", "hS8_a81ApiM": "CBD oil or cannabidiol has become the hottest rage getting a massive shot in the arm when President Trump signed the 2018 farm bill opening the door for hemp to take center stage as a new agricultural commodity in the United States no longer the controlled substance it had been since 1937 hemp is like a sister plant to marijuana without the THC that makes you high and people who use it for everything from epilepsy to depression insomnia and arthritis and other maladies swear by it but doesn't work and are their wrists tonight we dig deeper with the ABCs of CBD Carrie Prue is taking her daily dose of CBD oil for arthritis and her knees she was taking too much ibuprofen and decided to give CBD oil a try facing eye pain right after she takes hers she gives it to ten-year-old Stan Lee good boy come here who has discs and her pain is just put a drop of my finger and wasn't getting relief from his pain meds and muscle relaxers there we go and that's it carries regular vet suggested she contact dr. chris peyton at western veterinary clinic to see if he could bring Stanley more relief how's family doing good dr. Payton specializes in pain treatment through acupuncture laser therapy and CBD oil made from hemp Stanley I think first came to me in 2017 and he's kind of one of my neck dogs that come in they they're hanging their head down they're really painful they move you know just just slightly and they get a pinched nerve dr. Payton who has great faith decided to put Jesus's proverb physician heal thyself into use he decided he himself would be the first guinea pig if you will he wasn't going to give his furry patients anything he wouldn't try himself and as a marathon runner he had a lot of aches and pains he was taking ibuprofen for over-the-counter drugs that have their own side effects with the kidneys and liver I would tell you in the beginning I was a little skeptical just like before I went to animal chiropractic school I was a little skeptical he did his research even bringing in experts who manufacture high quality CBD oyel to speak with his patients and answer all their questions he added CBD oil to his routine and now takes much less ibuprofen I'm just one ml underneath the tongue for 30 seconds and then swallow it once a day and I've maybe taken ibuprofen twice in three months as opposed to taking it every day that's a big deal for me and he says it's a big deal for dogs like Stanley and the 40 other pets he has using it I haven't had any patients that have had any side effects or problems from the CBD oil that I use he admits it's not a magic bullet but says the oil he sells is pure and 85% of patients both two and four legged feel better here's how it works there are things called cannabinoid receptors located throughout the human body in the very simplest terms they affect physiological processes such as appetite perception of pain memory and your mood these cannabinoid receptors are referred to as cb1 and cb2 and they are activated by cannabidiol CBD found in the brain and central nervous system cb2 receptors are mostly in organs and cells associated with the immune system assistant professor at Indiana University School of Medicine South Bend dr. Jessie say ways in it's not marijuana there's a difference between a hemp plant and a marijuana plant why do you think it's getting so popular I think it's getting popular because it works so there's been a lot of studies to see if CBD oil works to help with anxiety sleep and pain and most of them are showing that it does work Kari says she's a believer for both herself and Stanley he just gets a couple drops it's just so you know a couple drops in the morning at breakfast a couple drops in the evening it's really easy he loves it it's just we're believers you know we've we're so glad that it's become popular because it's a great alternative therapy we have a lot of friends who have used it for their animals as well we have seen great results and yeah I would highly recommend it both dr. Payton and Peggy offer agreed with dr. sayz assessment that you need to do your research and make sure the CBD you are getting is pure and does not contain THC and it doesn't just come in a tincture to place drops under your tongue I see it being one of those things that's going to be up and coming for them and I think that's going to change a lot of people's lives I think it already has there are air traffic controllers that take it there are pilots that take it so we always start with the lowest dose no matter what we do whether it's tradition or non-traditional and while not yet ready to endorse it because it's not regulated doctors say believes that too will be changing the government is now beginning to recognize that there is a difference between CBD oil made from hemp and is making that legal as opposed to CBD oil made from marijuana which will have THC in it and hopefully with that they can start regulating it and making it more commonly used with regulation okay to make it safe and to know where it's coming from okay Kari says she's using much less ibuprofen for her arthritis and Stanley is weaning off his pain meds and is a much happier ten-year-old and we have seen wonderful results he has been a different dog for the past year so the next time you're out driving in the country you may be seeing more hemp growing in the fields a new commodity for farmers and perhaps a new treatment for what ails you the World Health Organization's statement on CBD oil is that it has little to no side effects but is with any supplement talk to your doctor before starting CBD oil governor Eric Holcomb signed a measure legalizing cannabis I'll however be sure to check the ingredients if it contains THC it cannot be more than 0.3 percent it's also helped animals and people going through cancer treatment by stimulating the appetite and reducing anxiety as for treatment for epilepsy many are still using CBD oil but the FDA recently approved the first cannabis based drug called epidemics it's not cheap and can run you over $1,000 a month and for those of you who are a drug tested at work as we are CBD will not show up in a drug test because hemp will not get you

to come and talk to you today really briefly about CBD and hemp as you've heard plexus is getting ready to launch into yet another new market and it's one that we're so excited about now here's the deal you might if you're like me you've probably started to see CBD sold in other places whether it's a shop on the corner depending on which which state you live in or whether it's through another company network marketing company perhaps sharing it and maybe some other places as well maybe even your integrative doctor has started to sell it and there's a reason why it's because CED has some pretty incredible effects on the body whether it comes to dealing with discomfort or mood disturbances or wanting a better sleep cycle there's a lot of different ways that CBD can be used and part of that is because of our awesome endocannabinoid system which affects every cell in your body so what I wanted to do is just to tell you that I was able to get a sample of the full spectrum hemp oil and I started using it on Friday night and here's what I've been noticing so first of all I slept terribly in Vegas it's probably due to the stress of having to get on stage in front of 12,000 people but I was grinding my teeth and I just wasn't in a familiar place and probably a lot of you had this experience as well you're over stimulated you've got some stress oxidative stress in your life and so you're not sleeping that great so when I took that full-spectrum hemp oil on Friday night left it under my tongue for 30 seconds to get that absorption started get the blood absorbing it and then swallowed it by the way it tasted amazing very mild flavor um I slept like the queen of the Dead like a zombie I don't think I moved literally think I was just out like a light and I thought to myself well this is probably you know just the effects of convention I was really stressed out I hadn't slept in multiple days I've had an exciting time but like a lot of you are learning excitement and stress your body can't always tell the difference so I thought okay I'll type I tried again the next night because it's pretty blown away tried it again the next night same thing Sunday night same thing last night same thing that's something that makes me so excited guys plexus has massively changed how I sleep in fact sleep was one of the biggest reasons why I got excited about plexus what if we can do an even better job right how could this help so many people so I hope that as many of you guys as possible are going after your three new ambassadors so that you can be a part of trying this product we need your experiences we are excited to know what other people are discovering as they put CBD and hemp oil to the test and I am so pumped to be a part of this company my belief is higher

so here's your bottle much like the box CBD f/x have plus MCT oil 30 milliliters 500 series and again contains full spectrum CBD gluten-free non-gmo and it is vegan the ingredients are exactly the same as we went over on the box so I will over those again roll around same with the Supplemental facts we already read those off on the box and roll it around one more time and we're back to the front alright let's go over those effects that we were talking about shall we okay so I got the fact sheet out and this is for the CBD part okay you've probably heard old CBD is illegal not so CBD effects and the CBD oil contained in it are illegal for the following reasons non psychoactive hemp was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 step one there have biomass which means basically their crop comes with an import certificate signed off on by Homeland Security because we did cover it it is imported we only use CBD derived from the stalks of European grown hemp plants mm-hmm products meet the standards of the 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp which means it must be industrial hemp and contained less than 0.3 percent THC last but not least our products are considered exempt from the CSA and DEA drug scheduling practices which classify whole hemp extracts as schedule one drugs then you're like wow so yeah don't use available haha extracts from the stuff stocks of EU European grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice so there you have it guys legal alright long as it comes from Europe as long as it's industrial and as long as it meets everything else which it does you're good good now you're like well okay that covers the CBD what's MCT though got some facts on that too alright so MCT or what is it is MCTS our medium chain triglycerides okay and there are fatty acids that your body can quickly and easily break down and convert to usable energy okay MCT oil is often recommended for people with medical disorders related to absorption such as Crohn's disease because of their ability to help your body make the best in the nutrients it takes in they added MCT to the CBD tincture primarily to ensure that you get the maximum benefit from the CBD that you're taking okay so basically the MCT stuff makes you absorb alright all of the CBD goodness in there which is awesome is CBD plus MCT oil used for a ketosis or part of a ketogenic diet swap pages one of the main reasons MCT oil is used on its own as a nutritional supplement is to keep your body healthy absorbing all the nutrition you throw at it a side effect is to keep your body in ketosis essentially that's a metabolic state where your body gets energy from fats instead of carbs this promotes a healthy metabolism and it has been linked in some studies to healthier weight and body composition so I'm sure you've heard of like the keto diets and all that good stuff oh it's even keto diet friendly come on come on that's awesome it's awesome so let's go ahead and try it with the bottle just spin it around and you will find some perforations and then once you do that it's doubly perforated so you can just grab it and then bone and then just take the whole thing off oh you actually don't have to take the whole thing off just get it to where you can open the top push down spin oh yeah there we go and let's try it shall we hmm doesn't really taste like much yeah you just get like the earthy flavor of the CBD in there at the end yeah that's not bad and like I said if taste is a big thing for you there's a bunch of other CBD products that CBD FX offers that you can use again I've gone over this in a couple of the other I think every other CBD video I've done but this is the first one you've seen I'll tell you what CBDs

where you watch the side and date and I am how [Music]", "j1GmF88PxcI": "[Music] don't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel to see more videos hello everybody and welcome back to York River cannabis and today's video I'm going to be doing a very much requested video from all of our subscribers which is how to make extra-strength CBD oil but before we get into today's video if you wouldn't mind please consider hitting that subscribe button and supporting our channel also if you already have subscribed thank you very much I appreciate the support and if you wouldn't mind please give the video a big thumbs up to show that support so folks the number one request I've gotten and it's our second most viewed video on our channel is how to make CBD oil but a lot of people want to know how they can get more bang for their buck and how they can get more CBD in that oil and today I'm going to show you how you can do it but before we get into the details of how to make this exercise CBD oil if you guys are interested in hemp flour go ahead and email me I'll leave all that in the description below check out our website we have a new menu all new prices and a lot of our customers make CBD oil at home so we've adjusted a lot of our pricing to accommodate people who make their own CBD oil so go ahead and check that out and you can always email me and we accept most major payments at this point via PayPal folks the ingredients really is just one extra step to make extra strength CBD oil now this is a request for a family member this is not how I make CBD oil here on the farm to distribute so this is just as order for a family friend but I thought I would take this opportunity to share with you how you can do it at home so first thing you're gonna need to do is of course you're gonna want to have your hemp flour now again guys you can always grab this from us and again all that information is in the description below but here is some cherry wine hemp flour that our our family friend requested and we are going to make CBD oil with it now our cherry wine has a great amount of CBD in 19% to be exact so we can get more for our money by adding one simple ingredient and that is lesson 10 now with lesson 10 why does it make so much of a difference well MCT oil has a maximum absorption rate which means even a 100% ratio it really can't absorb all the CBD that these flowers have so to bump up the absorption rate you can add less ATIP and less if it has all the essential things to be able to absorb more cannabinoids so that is why a lot of people adolescent in now there is a ton of different less attends out there there's soy lecithin with granular and liquid you got sunflower lesson 10 grandeur and liquid love about capsules but I just buy liquid now I buy sunflower less attendant that is in the liquid form because I don't like soy I'm not a big fan of eating soy I think it's just in too many foods in the United States today so I went with sunflower lesson you can go with regular if that's what you prefer when you filter it out using our magic butter machine it doesn't really make much of a difference I just prefer the liquid now in order to get this started we're gonna have to decarbonise if allah grants stay the same for our CBD well as it does for this we're going to be doing 28 grams of CBD flour and 2 cups of MCT oil so that's approximately 14 grams of flour per cup now you can range that between seven and fourteen depending on your potency but we're really trying to maximize the absorption rate of the oil and the less intense so we're gonna do the maximum amount and we're going to be adding less aten so I'm going to go D carb our cherry wine flour that we have here I'm going to weigh it to 28 grams we've got our D carboxy R and you can see I've already waited and so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna fire up the oven I'm going to put it at 250 degrees and I'm going to be doing it for approximately 30 minutes so I will see you in 30 minutes with some D carb flour okay folks our flour has now been D carb is out of the oven and it is ready to go so obviously the first thing we're gonna do is go ahead and get all this flour into the magic butter machine now you all know that I absolutely love my magic butter machine you can't convert this recipe to work in a crock-pot or anything else but as always I just want my magic butter machine so first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna add our MCT oil now this was purchased online 16 fluid ounces I know a lot of my subscribers always ask me what is my favorite MCT oh oh whoa this has pretty much everything you want to look for it's organic non-gmo and of course it's USDA certified organic which is a big deal so first and foremost we're just going to take the wrapper off of this and go ahead and add it now again like I said 16 fluid ounces equals two cups so there's no need to measure this we can go ahead and add it directly into the machine now here's the change of the recipe folks it really depends on how much less attend you want to add I wouldn't go any more than two tablespoons per cup so a maximum for this recipe would be four tablespoons of less eaten but I'm gonna do right in the middle there I'm gonna probably do about three for this recipe because it's such a high CBD amount that I don't want to overdo it but I also don't want to under do it so go ahead and get your tablespoon measure and you're just going to measure it out now you can see it's very sludgy so it takes a little bit of time it's almost like molasses type texture it's very slow very syrupy so you're gonna have to take your time with it but maybe we'll just do two for this round two for videos sake but you can add whatever you want so as we wait for this to go into the magic butter machine go ahead and cap everything now here's the thing for for you folks at home here's a little trick to the trade keep your MCT oil bottle because a lot of them come with spouts like this one and what I like to do especially for family members isn't the first time I've done this for family members is I usually just refill the bottle with the CBD oil and hand it back to him and you can do that at home and that way you don't have to use a mason jar or anything like that you can just you know even put another label over top of this I use a sharpie so you know that it's cbdo so you don't try cooking with it or anything like that so most of the lesson2 is off but what we're going to do is we're going to use our trusty magic butter spatula and make sure we get it all off of the tablespoon here and you go ahead and see so that's about it best we can now now that we've added the Blessington we're gonna go ahead and fire up our magic butter machine so let me get this plugged in now folks as always same as before we're gonna go up to 160 which is the middle of the road for this so there's your temperature 160 and I do 4 hours for the texture so folks I will see you in four hours to show you the final product all right folks so this has just gone off the magic butter machines timer has gone off so I'm going to do is go ahead and unplug it and you know go ahead and get all the stuff you can off the top of the machine here this one looks pretty good right now actually now the whole lot to get off of there which is good I find that the little spatula that magic butter makes works really well for this now we got their spatula kit from the a couple weeks ago all right so now as always guys you see how it's always on the edge here so you just want to scoop that down in because that has oil in it get all that ends all right and so this process is going to be the same as we've always done with all of our other oils you always put it on the love glove or the the silicone glove you always put it on your dominant hand if your left hand and put it on your left hand it just makes things easier okay so that is the majority of the oil right there now this oil will definitely be darker than a traditional CBD whoa and that is because of the sunflower lecithin note no worries about it it doesn't really have much of a different flavor but it's just something to note if you are using the liquid less inton it will have a darker look to it and I'll show you here so you can see it's a little darker than normal CBD oil not by much but it's definitely noticeable a lot of times when I make it with the by ox you know it comes out a little bit lighter and so typically what I'll do is I'll get all the other stuff there's still plant material that needs to be squeezed but I want to show you guys this trick I go ahead and I put it right back in the bottle okay so what this does to is it frees up this Pyrex measuring cup for me to be able to get all the plant material really not have to worry about splashing any of the oil or wasting any of the oil so you go ahead and you just put it right back in the bottle and then go ahead and put all the plant material in here and get rid of it so now you're not going to get a lot of oil out of the plants but it is worth giving a good squeeze you know making sure it's all out of there get as much as you can again you don't want to waste it it's good stuff takes four hours to make so you want to make sure that you get your money's worth if you're at home looks pretty good one more scoop here all right so that's it get your uh your glove back on and you kind of shake it all down there you're just gonna give it a good squeeze try to get as much of that well as you can out of there now you can refine it a little bit more if you want I have Magic butters other screens the 190th which is what they provide with the magic butter machine works great but if you don't like any type of sediment or plant material in your oil you can't even refine it more but I recommend making sure you do this round first and then go ahead and use a different screen but yeah so we can add that we need to get a lot out of the plant material but it's enough I would say that we got a pretty decent return probably about 13 ounces out of the 16 you're always gonna lose oil so that's just the nature and there's still some in here but that's what I have for you today guys again remember if you need hemp flour my contact information will be in the description below go ahead and check it out we have adjust our prices for people who make their own CBD oil at home to benefit them because a lot of our sales are for that so we're trying to adjust accordingly and I appreciate all the YouTube supporters out there that have purchased from our farm and support our farm I do appreciate it guys but yeah that's the extra-strength CBD oil recipe I hope it works you guys at home you guys have any questions leave a comment below and you can always find me on Instagram and Facebook that information will always be in the description below so that's all I have for you today guys I hope you take care hope this recipe works for you and I will see you in another video", "5bfR8e9hdD4": "[Music] it won its Ivan kept agile calm here to bring you what will ultimately be part one in a multi-part series in my experience ultimately with the uncanny full spectrum CBD oil so I mean probably just lost your mind you're like what drugs yes CBD is absolutely a drug just like caffeine in a plethora of other things ultimately drug being something some sort of substance that is going to either inhibit or promote some sort of chemical reaction in our body which is going to give us ideally a desired effect so to that in like 30,000 foot view what does CBD where does it come from all that stuff lots of misinformation confusion with respect to it because we have cannabis and then within that we have hemp and we have marijuana marijuana of course being THC based the drug that gets you high THC and then hemp on the other side though industrial hemp which while it does have THC that drug component of marijuana they don't want thinks of over here on the side of hemp it's like 0.3 percent THC comparatively to marijuana which spans anywhere from like five percent up to like thirty percent THC significantly more so two totally different things but unfortunately hemp has been demonized for a long time because of basically back in the 70s with Nixon and the war on drugs cannabis gained turned into a Schedule one narcotic and all these other things with a controlled substance act and our war on drugs which is arguably gone as well as our war on like poverty and obesity considering we can't even keep drugs out of maximum-security prisons but I digress finally came full circle with the farm bill in 2018 which removed industrial hemp from the controlled substance act and put it over in the domain of the FDA Food and Drug Administration now that industrial hemp is easier to farm more and more companies are moving into the space of creating CBD oil can a boy do I don't know how to pronounce it but CBD based products with that there's more and more research going into you CBD both with kind of the properties as well as effects benefits things along those lines all kinds of clinical testing so to that end one of the companies that's entered the space is uncanny veteran owned company and per their site their mission statement is to be the leading voice of advocacy for CBD in the military and veteran community provide the most accurate information and comprehensive access to research in the industry to reverse the Department of Defense ban on natural CBD supplements with education campaigns in political action in order to allow access to those who have no alternatives provide the highest quality most trusted products at a competitive price I think that's pretty cool having said all that what does CBD do well start with what it doesn't do it doesn't get you high again 0.3 percent THC so if you want to smoke some industrial hemp you would probably die smoke inhalation before you ever felt the effects of THC which is the drug component of marijuana so it doesn't do that what are potential side effects of it hasn't been used in documented so there's not like tons and tons of evidence but the one kind of side effect that it looks like there is potential is basically interfering with prescription drugs that someone's already on so putting that stuff to the side what are some of the benefits of course can't make any claims because I'm not a doctor and the FDA has to approve drugs we know they can be trusted because the head of FDA is pretty much like a revolving door to the Board of Directors for like Monsanto and all your pharmaceutical companies that's what has it been shown to do well there I've been clinical trials with use for treating epilepsy and beyond that kind of this really broad spectrum of use whether it's helping with sleep-like altima sleeping disorders stress anxiety depression not to mention essentially kind of those symptoms of like PTSD and then on top of that basically other things whether it's kind of inflammatory diseases like within the body or even treating Alzheimer's all kinds of different uses that people are kind of dipping into with respect to research and CBD which brings us to the question of why am I taking CBD what am I looking to get out of it well I don't have epilepsy don't think I have Alzheimer's I don't think I've PTSD but everyone's looking at the world through their own lens like where do you even start trying to define normal I will say largely in part because of basically my journey and where I'm at with Kip Adger entrepreneurial pursuits there's absolutely some stress in my life and with that probably some anxiety and like honestly sometimes I don't sleep as well as I'd like sometimes I wake up don't get as restful sleep as I would like so if it can pretty much do anything for that that would be amazing not only for me personally the bigger picture for me is basically help me be a better father to my boys if I am stressed if I don't get much sleep that basically translate into me not being as patient as I would like to with my boys so I don't know we'll see what it does for me one of the other really important factors with respect to CBD from on canna that I've looked into doing my due diligence is the way it's made so it's produced from industrial hemp more importantly though from organic hemp why is that important well if you take something and you concentrate it the last thing you want is like concentrated pesticides like I don't want to drink roundup not good so this is made from organic industrial hemp on top of that third-party testing to actually verify it it's purity all those things and overall just even vetting them through Instagram follow mine Instagram and the overall message that they basically pushes to live an awesome life like that's it like that's at least that's what I draw from it and I can get behind that like absolutely so with that I have two of these bottles probably enough to get me through probably about two months also came with a handy dose charts right on the front of it each individual's dosage is unique dosing tips start low work your way up take one dose in the morning one at night monitor effects adjust adjust doping doping adjust dosing as needed and yeah basically give you days of the week weeks through the month and PM all that stuff so you can keep track and kind of figure out find the sweet spot for yourself so what am I going to be doing well I'm gonna be taking this you can take it with food or under the tongue I'm gonna probably just take drops under the tongue end up ultimately revisiting it probably in about two weeks maybe a month and we're in there see where I'm at as far as my dosing like what's kind of working for me and where you visited at least once if not twice more like as I go through essentially the product and kind of my takeaways at the end of it if you want to join me on this journey that is unknown at this point you're welcome to they actually reached out gave me a discount code if you guys want to pick some up and yeah ultimately I'm excited to try it and see what it does for me but as always thanks for joining us to keep badger calm look forward to seeing you next time [Music]", "phJElaVgh2Q": "Pachamama CBD teacher review is going on my well is he fans how are you doing my name is Eden and I am the owner of Wella c-calm of course if this is your first hour episode with us welcome today I will be reviewing the entire line of the Pachamama full spectrum CBD tinctures there's six options so there's five flavors and then there's one all-natural flavor all of them full spectrum tinctures I want to point that out so there are the trace amounts of 0.3% of THC nothing higher but those will not induce the intoxicating effects that you get if you smoke you know cannabis you won't get stoned so you don't have to worry about that but I'm very excited to review these Pachamama line of CBD teachers just because of the uniqueness of them there is many many ingredients such as you know goji and cacao kava kava and valerian agencia and green tea you know many of these ingredients have been leveraged for thousands of years in ancient medications so I am excited to review these because I think they will be a perfect pair with a full spectrum hemp extract and really kind of elevate the potential effects because many of these ingredients have really been studied so there's known benefits about these known health benefits associated with it that many of which pair perfectly with the potential benefits of cannabinoids you know such as CBD the trace amounts of THC and many of those minor cannabinoids you know CB and CBD so on and so forth that's present in a full spectrum tincture so let me go ahead and actually walk you guys through the six options of the Pachamama CBD tinctures before actually jumping in and reviewing them oh I do want to point out the Pachamama CBD teachers they're available in 750 milligrams and seventeen hundred and fifty milligrams so one thousand seven hundred fifty milligrams per there milk bottles so very very awesome stick around until the end where I will have I will let you know of an exclusive discount code that you can use on your first purchase of the Pachamama tinctures from wallace e-comm and you know what I'll give you a little hint if you check the description below you can access this exclusive 15% off discount code that you can use at well as c-calm starting right now so let's jump right into the appacha mama line alright so first up we got the goji and cacao mmm alright that's unique some goji berries with cacao so I'm expecting you know a little maybe a notch goji berries with I guess a little bit of a chocolate taste so I mean hey I'm excited about that then next up we got the green tea and agencia okay let's get that party started I mean who doesn't like some green tea at Trent see I'm not really sure how that's gonna taste but hey piqued my interest for sure then next up we got the kava kava and the valerian CBD teacher from Pachamama okay alright and then we got this is a very unique one I mean it makes sense but I mean some of you may be like oh that's interesting is the we got the black pepper and the tumeric tincture from Pachamama okay I'm excited about that see I see I hope you're starting to realize how unique these flavor profiles are these aren't you know for if your user restricting by a product off flavor which I never recommend you should buy it for the effects this maybe not be the line for you because this is for this line is really designed for the all natural health and wellness consumer that doesn't really mind an all-natural taste of many of these ingredients and yeah I think these ingredients are gonna be great tasting they're very unique it's not gonna be like a blueberry or a strawberry or like a fruity cereal that you see you know there's a lot of flavor teachers and even vape juices out there so I want to point that out guys these are very all-natural tasting teachers and you know you should at the end of the day when you're buying a hemp products you should be buying it for the potential effects that you're experiencing not strictly based off the flavor next up number five for Pachamama is the holy basil and yelling laying teacher okay baby here we go and then of course last but not least is the the all-natural patre mama DVD teacher which is just full spectrum hemp extract and MCT oil that's what Pachamama leverages as they're carrying agent in all of their teachers is MCT oil so you know there's only the base ingredients only what's required is what's in there it's all natural ingredients from you guessing mother earth you know Pachamama literally means mother earth so you know like the goji and cacao there's goji berry extract cacao and then there's MCT oil and then full spectrum of extract that's it guys and what's awesome all the ingredients are right on the box and it'll even say i'll walk this through once i get into each product but it even has some potential the effects right on the side of the bottle based off of the ingredients you know because you can't make any health claims around CBD or full spectrum hemp extract at all that is against the law but many of these ingredients have been studied many many times and for years upon years and they have been proven to have these effects so let's go ahead and try our first tincture and all of the teachers i'll be reviewing for Pachamama today will be the 750 milligram version so very excited i mean a very very potent option you know so basically how you figure out how much dope how much CBD you're getting per dropper full is you just do 750 milligrams or the size of the bottle 750 or if you have the 750 milligram bottle then you would just do 750 divided by the size of the bottle and that's how much you get your serving per milliliter and guess what guys that comes to 25 milligrams of CBD per milliliter which is um you know these dropper foals it's a full milliliter so let's go ahead and do the goji and cacao from Pachamama looks really good beautiful packaging very very solid you know it even has right on the side of the on all of the boxes it has a little explanation of the Pachamama hemp like where they source it from what's really awesome is that this that they say you know it's a single origin sourcing it's from it's made with less than 0.3 percent THC which is great It's Made in a cGMP compliant lab non-gmo Fairtrade triple lab tested very key all naturally sourced ingredients and it's all made in the USA with ingredients sourced from around the world you know goji berry extract cacao and then right on the side of the cacao box it says it's got focus because let me actually walk you through before I actually get into actually tasting the goji in cacao you know so what are some of the potential benefits of you know goji cacao you know goji has really high nutritional value it's an excellent source of vitamins it's high in antioxidants very very key provides immune system report of support you know if you're feeling sick this should be a great king sure to leverage and it promotes healthy skin you know goji berries contain beta-carotene which is great you know for skin health and last but not least about goji that I really wanted to touch on is it first uses were recorded you know in the year about 250 BC so like I said guys these ingredients have been leveraged for a very very long time and then you know then we got the the cacao cacao I mean you know let's kind of get a give you like the the chocolate chocolatey taste you know this is rich in minerals high in antioxidants 40 times the antioxidants of blueberries we all know how much we've been told by our doctors to eat these blueberries because of their antioxidant benefits and it's a natural mood enhancer and antidepressant very very good seat pairs perfectly with those potential benefits of cannabinoids it supports energy production sparks libido oddly yeah in case you're looking for that and it can also help relieve stress so you know all of those sort of effects and benefits that you're experiencing from the goji in cacao many of those are the potential benefits you experience with CBD and cannabinoids so that's what I'm talking about guys Pancho I really took their teacher line to the next level by pairing these ingredients with these Kanab with a full spectrum HEPA extract which i think is just a brilliant idea so I applaud you guys on that nicely done Pachamama you guys um I mean I just I love your products I love your product lines so let's do it I'm I just want to point this out just like with all my review videos I'm honest I don't get paid by Pachamama at all to do these videos so I just want to point that out again beautiful packaging so shake it up as always boom child-resistant cap and what's awesome look at that that nice golden hemp extract look it beautiful and what's awesome is right on the droppers right on the t-shirts they're actually labeled so there's one male point seven-five half mil and a quarter of a mil so you know precisely how much CBD you're getting every single time you dose yourself out so let's go ahead and there's sublingual delivery do not vape these lift your tongue and drop the oil right under your tongue let sit there for 30 to 60 seconds you know mmm wow that is taste like chocolate mm-hmm ooh all-natural taste you know I do get right when I drop that teacher the God you can accounting sure right into my mouth I do immediately start getting a I start tasting that cacao you know the chocolate the all natural source of chocolate you guys guessed it I like that and then as I swallow it I do get like the aftertaste is obviously chocolatey but I am really getting sort of a faint kind of caged I believe what would be the goji berries I mean I've never actually personally eaten goji berries so I'm not sure what they exactly taste like but I feel like I am getting a residual sort of berry taste out of the goji and cacao um so you know it's I like that I like that sort of chocolatey taste that is along with it and then the sort of berry taste kind of rounds out the flavor um you know as I always like to give flavor rating just so you guys know but at the end of day should not be buying a product strictly off of flavor and plus guys flavor is very very subjective so if I had to rate the goji and cacao on a scale of one to ten hmm that chocolates still linger in my mouth I do like that a lot I would have to give that a seven point five out of ten so actually a very solid score I'm impressed by that then next up in the review today we got the green tea and echinacea full spectrum hemp extract tincture from my good friends over at Pachamama CBD look at this bad boy you know it's just looking at this the branding of this you know it just feels like I'm about to you know eat like a green or drink a green tea smoothie earth or something you know but before just like with the goji and cacao it will walk you through some of the benefits that you experience with the green tea and echinacea you know for the echinacea for example it's great for reducing inflammation it supports and improves your immune system health which we can all benefit from next up we it can help treat health ailments and illnesses which I mean hey you can't argue with that whoo why wouldn't you want to take something that can potentially help with that and it also helps to aid in healthy cell growth and helps manage anxiety guys helps manage anxiety anxiety it makes sense while the echinacea is inside of this tincture with the full spectrum hemp extract because I mean many many people use full-spectrum hemp backstrap broad-spectrum or CBD in general for its potential anti-anxiety effects you know we live in an anxious world nowadays guys so it's that it makes sense why CBDs one of the largest use cases of cannabinoids is for you know anti-anxiety then for the green tea benefits we counted touch on that I mean I'm sure many of you do know of the green tea benefits could green teas all over the place but some of the best benefits are its anti-aging properties it's rich and anti-aging antioxidants you know that such as the EGCG which is a poly phenyl that actually increases cell turnover to fight those wrinkles guys RIT and it's rich in these polyphenols which are micronutrients that are packed with antioxidants and other many health benefits it provides metabolic support cellular support strong antioxidant properties okay and it can also help to improve brain function so I know I don't I take CDs just for it it's Jenn CBD excuse me general wellness benefits I don't have any diseases they're ailments but one of the largest use cases for me is my focus and concentration that's what I've noticed that really really helps me so the fact that having this green tea teacher from Pachamama and knowing that the green tea can help to improve brain brain function I it's just a match made in heaven in my honest opinion so let's try the green tea and echinacea full spectrum teen chef from Pachamama again beautiful packaging right on it let me take a look at this real quick Oh yep perfect they got the QR code right on the label so you can scan it for the third-party test results then they even make it super easy and let you know how much of like the green tea and echinacea and plus the hemp extract how much you are getting per dose which is very very crucial guys there's a lot of companies other than that that really make dosing very confusing for you guys as the end consumer and what's really awesome right at the bottom there's a sticker if you guys can see this but it's batch tested which is a win in my book you know there's no there's no regulations in the the hemp space yet so I just like here at Wallace II we regulate ourselves in an unregulated industry and Pachamama is following suit as well so I do applaud you guys on that there's just simply not enough companies that are regulating themselves you know and just trying to hide things from the in consumer which is not OK in my honest opinion so green tea and echinacea tincture for Pachamama boom look at that okay ooh I mean honestly like it just smells like a natural full spectrum had that extract like that's what it smells like so all right let's go hmm okay now I wonder a little different I do it does kind of feel like I have like green tea leaves kind of in my mouth but I mean that's kind of what to be expected it's natural so it honestly just tastes like for me it's like it's not very overpowering but it's very I taste the natural hemp extract you know but I just feel like I kind of just have sort of some like green tea leaves like I was kind of just like it's almost like I was sucking on like a really small small bag of like green tea leaves you know like kind of like a snus pouch you know for like true like if I had like a snooze pouch of like green tea leaves in there and I just like had it in my lip like it's very faint like it it honestly isn't a like it just more than anything it does kind of just remind me of like having faint a green tea taste in it with um you know the full spectrum hemp extract so I am a fan of it it's very very faint it's not like you don't put in your mouth at you're not like uh it's a great solid flavor all around I mean it's not like flavorful to the max but the great Teaneck Anisha teacher I mean it really doesn't taste like much I mean I taste the green tea though faintly but I mean like echinacea it's you know it's sort of like a flower and so it's not I was expecting maybe a little more floral taste which I mean I guess maybe that's a good thing they kind of muted it a little bit but I understand just take the taste the all-natural full spectrum hemp extract with the faint sort of green tea leaves that I that I was describing uh a few minutes ago but I I like it I mean the goat cheese cacao I feel like I like to go Jade cacao a little bit more just because I did like that cacao and that sort of chocolatey berry taste and I rated the goji cow seven point five out of ten on the flavor scale the green tea and echinacea I got it just because it was kind of lacking in flavor for me if I had to just strictly base it off flavor and I'll touch on the effects on everything later on in the review video towards the end but I mean I'm gonna give that a six point five out of ten on the flavor rating so it's not horrible but I mean like like I enjoyed it like I'm just basing it strictly off of flavor but I liked using it it was it just tasted like an actual full spectrum hemp extract and I like natural flavors so you may or may not so just keep that in mind next up we the kava kava and valerian root full-spectrum extract t-shirt from Pachamama so kava kava and valerian here's the cute little box I you know let's just call it cute just has got that nice little pink you know it's got some of the the benefits for the kava kava just read on the box and valerian is for relaxation so you know if you're looking to relax you know reach for this kava kava and the the valerian you know whereas the goji like the goji in cacao you know that was for focus and then the green tea and echinacea that was for recovery so now if you're looking to relax and chill after a long day you know who doesn't like to do that reach for this kava kava valerian so what are some of the potential or the benefits that have been associated with let's say kava kava you know it promotes tranquility it promotes muscle relaxation aids and feelings of anxiety so combat some of those things those anxious feelings that we're always talking about and aids and feelings of restlessness so the relaxation benefits can really help you know so you're not having that anxiety when you're laying in bed and then you could really reduce that restlessness so then you can actually go to sleep at night because guess what guys sleep is very very important if you don't sleep and your whole entire life begins to just go downhill next up we got the valerian root so what are some of those benefits associated with well valerian you know it promotes relaxation has calming benefits anti stress benefits aids and feelings of sleepiness and promotes hi-hi promotes a better quality sleep so as you can see guys up makes sense why Pachamama paired the kava kava valerian root with a full spectrum hemp extract could provide those relaxation benefits alright let's go ahead and now taste the kava kava and valerian again beautiful packaging 750 milligrams pop this box open here we go and guys every time you go to use as teacher or even an oil anytime you a full spectrum HEPA extract oil or a CBD ISIL oil broad spectrum oil you should always before you use it just just to do it just shake it up you know mix up all the ingredients and everything so there's no separation or anything so I always just sit here and kind of shake it kind of quickly you know just and then you're good to go all right beautiful beautiful bottle as always and then so and now it's also got the batch testing so sorry guys I'm kind of just looking at the label the levels really beautiful all the information you really need from this product is read on the label so if I rating the Pachamama tincture labels 1 to 10 I give them a 10 at a 10 it's very very solid everything you need is right on it they're not hiding anything from you so I applaud you on that Pachamama alright kava-kava valerian look at this oops alright so there's a full mill let me make sure you get a full mill in there oh look at that golden goodness that's how you want your full spectrum extract you know a little maybe a little bit darker maybe a little sort of a brown gold or a gold like this that's what you want that's how you know it's a high quality full spectrum hemp extract all right now look John mm-hmm okay I mean many of you guys have maybe leave a comment if you take cava cava or valerian or any of these ingredients kind of on their own on the side let me know what you take it for and some of the benefits you've experienced so I'm talking my mouth full but huh that one was very very like a natural taste with it you know the kava kava and the valerian valerian root I mean I've actually tried kava kava before and that's definitely what I taste out of it I mean like kava kava taste very very natural and earthy I don't know if any of you ever had like a kava kava tea but that it just it tastes just like kava kava in my opinion it's just a it's just a natural earthy sort of tasting a sort of an ingredient that goes in there but it's not I mean I like the kava kava valerian Pachamama teacher better than just drinking kava kava tea that I can't do that I was like but it was too much for me but I feel like it's very toned down and it's a nice mixture and I think just having like those terpenes of the full spectrum headaches fragmented with the MCT oil and then you know just that terpenes in that hemp and that full spectrum hand back stroke I really think they kind of just blend nicely together and you know at the end of the day Pachamama just their overall formulation of these products is very very solid you know it's not like you know if you eat some like kava kava for example and you were to just like dump it in your mouth they're like drink a tea where you'd be like it they just really I obviously they did a ton of our I need to make sure these formulations were perfect so it doesn't make you gag but at the same time you still know when she dropped in your mouth like okay this is a very natural teacher that I am taking right now and I can definitely taste these ingredients so if I had to you know rate the pot or the kava kava and the valerian tincture on us just based off the flavor you know of effects are most important I got to keep saying that guys I you know I think I do like that one I mean I still got to put that with the green tea and agencia I'm gonna put that at a 6.5 as well you know I mean I'm not you know it's not like I haven't had any of the three teachers I've tried they're not making me gag I'm not like well you know spitting it out I'm able to need you know put in my mouth swallow and as you can see I'm not I'm not even washing it down with water because I just want to show you I mean you could certainly do that if or even coffee you know either ooh that goji and cacao would be really good mixing and coffee side no and you want to point that out but you know just you can always rinse it down with some a liquid or something but I mean at the end of the day in my opinion I don't think the flavors are too you know they're not gag-worthy in my opinion right now number four the fourth teacher from the Pachamama line full spectrum have extra teachers on if reviewing today that I love is going to be the black pepper and the tumeric so here's a quick little look you know it's got the hem and the black pepper and tumeric box right on the side it says this is intended for you know some detox benefits so let's go ahead and discuss some of the potato and tumeric so let's first start out with black pepper you know it's a bio enhancer which you know this means that it increases bioavailability of turmeric anti-inflammatory compounds plus with that black pepper can help to increase you know that bioavailability of the cannabinoids you know the bioavailability that's crucial when you're taking a a hemp extract product as CBD isolate broad-spectrum whatever you're taking bioavailability is key you know it varies from consumption method to consumption method you know whether you're using a teacher edible capsule vape juice they all have very bioavailability so violet bioavailability if you aren't aware is the amount of CBD that is actually delivered into your body you know CBD and other cannabinoids that's actually delivered into your body after going through and being processed their internal bodily rate system so you know after being digested after being processed by you know either you're inside of your body which then delivers it into your bloodstream so bioavailability is key you know typically you know edibles capsules have a lower by a bioavailability and then teachers and vape juice are more higher up on the spectrum so some other benefits of black pepper of course is a it's a CB 2 which is cannabinoid receptor number 2 receptor agonist very very crucial and it contains the first the world's first bio enhancer piperine interesting enough now some of the tumeric benefits is it's rich in poly phenols which we talked about a little earlier which you know these are micronutrients that are packed with antioxidants and many other health benefits and turmeric can help improve digestion it aids an oxidative stress which you know this occurs naturally and plays a role in the overall aging process and this can actually be harmful to your body if you know you have extensive oxidative stress and then also turmeric helps to you know support inflammation just like cannabinoids such as CBD and you know some of the minor cannabinoids very very crucial and it has antimicrobial and anti oxidant properties that improve skin health so guys many of these things have been used you need detox it makes sense you're detoxing your body the oxidative stress you're detoxing all those harmful chemical all those harmful things inside of your body so it makes sense for these black pepper tumeric all right yeah the black pepper and turmeric are paired together with a full spectrum hemp extract who I am starting to feel very very good like I just feel like my overall alertness I just like as I was talking I just say kind of just like all that all hit me by storm at once because I mean I've been doing a milliliter of each of these 750 milligrams teamsters I've been taken I mean 25 milligrams 50s at 75 milligrams of a hemp extract that I've taken you know CBD inside of my body so I am ver my overall alertness verbal fluency focus concentration I feel good right now and just my general wellness I feel very very high the edges I'm very content in life right now so and it just it's easy to feel that way because I mean it when you're taking a high-quality HEPA extract product it of course you're gonna I mean I can't guarantee any effects but when I know the way my I react to taking CBD and I just know that I I can feel it and when I take a high quality product such as for Pachamama I I know I'm in for I know some of the effects that I can begin to expect so now we got let's go ahead and jump right into the black pepper and tumeric here we go guys look at that nice little label I like to show you guys this batch testing right at the bottom and you know they got the CRC caps of child resistant caps and they also come with those little shrink wraps that I kind of just don't really I don't really rip off I can just twist them all off but look golden goodness black pepper tumeric let's see hmm I mean all of them really do do smell like that all natural hemp extract but I mean maybe faint like tumeric or maybe maybe a little bit of tumeric a black pepper but I mean let's see I'm keep I'm interested to see how this tastes here we go whoa definitely contains that black pepper once you initially drop it and I taste the full spectrum hemp ex-truck right and then the black pepper starts to come out and as it sits in there the tumeric starts to come out but it's not like it's not like you were to pour black pepper into your hand and just putting your mouth you know that probably make you cough sneeze and no it doesn't taste like that and then same with tumeric you know it's not overpowering like you were to just eat like a handful of tumeric it's good it's I I'm surprised I thought the black pepper into work might be with the one that was like they threw me off but I like that a lot like it's very subtle though like I could see like you know that black pepper and turmeric if you're making like some spaghetti or something you know like a meal at home you could like mix that in with your food anyway I think it would just like enhance the overall flavors you know if you're cooking with black pepper and turmeric I feel like this black pepper and turmeric teacher would be a phenomenal additive into your food or whatever whatever your main I mean obviously food but I feel like whether you're making like a sort of like a gravy or like a dressing or you know pasta or something that would be a great additive I like that I'm surprised I'm saying this I like the black pepper in Toomer more than the kava-kava and the green tea and at Trent and the green tea I like that one better I mean I rated both those you know 6.5 so I mean the goji cacao that's still my favorite I mean the black pepper and turmeric I got to give that a 7 out of 10 on the flavor rating alright so the last flavor teacher from the Pachamama line is I mean of course you got two more but that's natural is the yel ylang-ylang and holy basil okay and you know right on the box it says right here these us if you're looking for some creativity boosting effects you know that's what the holy basil and yeah Lang Lang teachers for you know it's for that creativity helps stimulate your brain and help you really you know if you're at work that's where I could see this works cool let's do or you know at home when you're doing your side house or whatever you're doing reach for that yeah ylang-ylang and holy basil teacher from Pachamama so what are some of the benefits of y'all angling well I'm glad you all us it can reduce stress it promotes relaxation throughout the body and your mind okay I need some of that improve skin and hair health all right I mean the skin health out here I live in Colorado so I as hell so okay I'm getting behind that has anti-inflammatory properties and it's popular in traditional Chinese medicine now what are some of the potential benefits of holy basil I'm sure you guys basil you know probably cook with basil or have in the past so you're familiar with it so now what are some of the benefits of holy basil you know basil you cook with it you're familiar with it I'm sure I you know it helps your body to adapt to stress okay we live in a stressful world so we can all use some of that it can take hundreds of phytochemicals that have proven to be beneficial for human health all right and it helps maintain homeostasis you know balance equilibrium throughout your body that is what happens that's why you feel you know that's how CBD and cannabinoids can be so effective because it works with your endocannabinoid system it stimulates your endocannabinoid system works with those cb1 and cb2 receptors provides relief where you need it because your endo cannabinoid system is in charge of many important bodily regulations so once you take it it helps to promote homeostasis you know cannabinoids do that it helps promote homeostasis so it's even better that holy basil can help to promote homeostasis as well throughout your body you want balance and equilibrium in your body and holy basil can also protect your body from toxins and infections um what what else are some of the benefits you know it's high in vitamins A C as well as calcium and zinc and last but not least some of the most important benefits of holy basil are its antioxidant antiviral antibacterial and mewn enhancing benefits you know as you guys are starting to realize like hope many of these ingredients also play off the backs of the potential effects of cannabinoids such as CBD so it's just all of these ingredients are a match made in heaven you know Pachamama didn't just like randomly like oh we're just gonna throw these all-natural ingredients in here just for the hell of it you know they did not do that they did it because they were calculated they did their research and they want to do it to make sure that you guys at the end consumer have the best possible product with the best possible effects so let's go ahead and do the you ylang-ylang holy basil ii you know the creativity boosting effects I like that um you know I honestly am thinking that like it's gonna taste like some like basil that's what I'm that's not feeling alright so I you know I'm expecting that the you know the legal angling is going to you know taste like what am i what should I say I'm like basil I mean obviously it's got basil but also I mean some of the yelling like I don't know if you've ever tried your ylang ylang but it's sort of like like I guess the taste could be you know compared to like a honeydew and sweet complex enough to stand out on its own you know kind of like a honey sweetness flavor maybe I mean it's honestly I mean a lot of people like compared to like you know your ylang ylang should be like the new vanilla like a new sort of additive it like it's a sweetness kind of thing so let's see how the Elaine going taste with the basil whoa it's smell this one shows a little differently I can smell the basil but like the your ylang ylang I think that's like the sweetness and I'm getting all right one full milliliter beauty-full left the time hmm all right basil all the way but it's sweet that's the you ylang-ylang mmm so you know Lang Lang's like a sweet flavor kind of um basil we all know a bit you know you're familiar basil mmm you taste like basil a sweet basil honestly see I'm kind of impressed by how much I like that flavor like wow it's sweet and then it's got the basil to flag I didn't think those would pair well together but surprisingly enough they do and I mean if you're cooking with bass I mean you know that you're angling and basil mix together but I mean even if you're like making tea or something else I mean I would just I like these just right under the tongue Wow it's sweet sort of like I guess sort of like honey air like yeah it's a little sweetness of honey I guess you could look compared to with the taste of basil perfect paired it's not like too much basil it's I like that a lot you know flavor scales had to rate that out of a scale of one to ten you know I Nana I actually do like that it's up there with a go gene cacao with me so I got to give that a 7 point 5 out of 10 boom here we go so that is it for you know the flavoured options of the Pachamama line of full spectrum have extract tinctures but you know there is one more option there is if you don't like any of those I mean I would recommend trying them at least you know especially because of all those incredible ingredients that they got in there I would recommend you know if you want if you just want an all-natural option Pachamama has an all-natural option because guess what you know what's in here full spectrum have backtrack and MCT oil that is it it's no no additives nothing so this one I mean I'm not really gonna be able to do flavor because I mean it's all natural it doesn't taste like it just tastes like full spectrum hemp extract but you know I do want to use it just to you know finalize the review so I can say you know I did all of my shake it up here we go and the natural guess what MCT oil all natural hemp extract boom there we go beautiful all right boom I love it I enjoy all natural tinctures it's just I love the taste of hemp extract I liked terpenes you know those naturally-occurring terpenes I don't think there needs to be flavor I get it while some of you do want it that's why you know like it well c-calm our full spectrum tincture we have a chocolate mint that people love but i enjoy the natural so just like with ours the pocket our mom and natural phenomenal it doesn't make me again very easy to use boom it's dropped in on my tongue held it there so all it you know and the natural you know this should be really good you know if you're making like salad dressings if you want to mix it infuse it into things that's when the natural would come into play but i mean you could be making a spaghetti sauce and mix that in there if you want or even the yelling of basil you know so start thinking of it like that you can use this as tinctures but you can also cook with these you know or mix it with beverages I mean might be a little far of a stretch to make sure the beverage unless like the green tea and the echinacea that would be good you know your drink green tea mix it like that so just think of it like that but you know overall the Pachamama line of full-spectrum tinctures are incredible you know like so for example let's walk through my ratings on the flavor you know the goji cacao that was a seven point five out of ten you know the green tea and echinacea that was a six point five out of ten the kava kava and valerian that was a six point five out of ten the black pepper and tumeric that's going higher that was a seven out of ten you know the ylang ylang and holy basil I give I gave that a seven point five out of ten and you know the natural I can't really it's just a natural hemp extract so I can't really just say the flavor but overall very very solid but again guys the Pachamama did not set out to make the you know the best tasting teachers they made they set out to make the most effect give tinctures that have the greatest potential to work for you and your personal needs and I think they achieved that goal especially because they're available in 750 milligrams and 1750 milligrams at CBD per a 30 ml bottle hey guys I did want to jump back in here you know it's been about 45 minutes since I started taking the Pachamama CBD tinctures and let me tell you so I take CBD cannabinoid you know full-spectrum have an extract isolate broad-spectrum for the general health and wellness benefits because I'm lucky enough where I don't have any you know illnesses or you know ailments that are really kind of deterring me from function in my day-to-day life you know I'm not I don't have a disease or anything so I just take it for the general health and wellness benefits and the sort of the mind inducing effects like the mind boosting effects I guess I should say of cannabinoids and let me tell you so here's what I'm really experiencing right now is my general wellness health and well-being I just feel fantastic like I'm just happy I have a positive outlook on life and I'm just I just I feel good I'm I'm happy right now my verbal fluency is on point I really feel it if you guys you guys would probably start telling throughout the review video that I feel like I can just start talking and talking and talking and just the words there's no delay from my thought process to my mouth it kind of just flows so that verbal fluency is on point and then my focus and my concentration levels are really really there and that's what I become to expect when I'm taking a quality hemp extract product because like I said I take it for the general health and wellness benefits and those are the things that I really look for and that is exactly what I have noticed since taking the Pachamama CBD teaches and I feel very relaxed and just chill I'm just I'm happy in life I'm content you know and I just feel like you know what while I was kind of sitting we know waiting for the full effects of everything to kick in and for tea know where to start stimulating my endocannabinoids system I did pause this video so that I could come back and film this but I did start to notice that my mind was starting to really wander and ideas were really starting to generate in my brain so I feel like that's the cannabinoids starting to work and you know help with that you know the the sort of the mind effect so that's I'm really noticing that because especially like you know the holy basil in you ylang ylang like did mention that that does have sort of those creativity boosting effects so that's where I think that's coming from and honestly guys I feel like I need to stay here and talk with you all day and I just I feel great so the overall effects that I'm getting and the improvements in just what I'm feeling right now this is knowing me guaranteeing or expressing that you will feel the same way or anything at at that but right now the effects that I'm experiencing after reviewing the entire line of Pachamama CBD products I gotta give it a 10 a 10 10 it's a very solid line of products very unique and just the ingredients in there are just top-notch so nicely done 10 out of 10 guys so that's you know I mean hey you can't argue with the results that I'm experiencing but who knows what you'll experience maybe it'll be less maybe it'll be more who knows it is really up to you and you won't know until you start taking the Pachamama CBD tinctures and guys if you check the description below there is an exclusive 15% off discount code that you can

all on the next review video later guys you [Music]", "UdTA3AX7Blw": "full-spectrum hemp oil [Music] you I'm Erin Reed Superleague pro world's tallest bodybuilder I want to talk to you guys a little bit about full spectrum hemp oil like what that means you know there's a lot of talk nowadays about CBD and cannabinoids and all these different things it can be confusing but I'm gonna particularly talk about full spectrum hemp oil right now okay alright now full spectrum hand boil is basically you take the implant which is still in the marijuana family they just call it him because that's point zero three milligrams of THC or less when it's tested and whatnot so doesn't bit really have any THC it's not not a hemp isn't used to get you high doesn't have psychoactive properties but because it's a plant we all know that fruits and vegetables are full of amazing qualities that do things for you like cranberry is good for your kidneys garlic is good for your heart saw palmetto for your prostate it's all kind of stuff like that right well there's a lot of naturally occurring things in plants they're called phytonutrients or phytochemicals that do these things well when it comes to marijuana it kind of has its own thing going ok so marijuana obviously is cannabis that's another word for you know marijuana that includes everything can't in in in cannabis is more directly related to cannabinoids now cannabinoids are the individual chemicals the different ones that they're starting to pin down and realize have different qualities okay one of those cannabinoids is CBD one of those cannabinoids is THC THC is what gets you high that causes psychoactive properties the the CBD is has all the healing properties so having said that you can start to understand that okay we're talking about - well it turns out that there is actually something like over a hundred different cannabinoids and okay in hemp marijuana cannabis or want to call it there's over a hundred different ones but they've pinned it down to learn that CBD has all these amazing qualities right CBD so THC you know is really good for different things believe it or not it's why it's being prescribed for pain and stuff like that but CBD is also good for pain well I get to I'll check I'll get to that but I'm not gonna kind of go into it and I just gonna talk about hemp oil while like hemp oil versus something else so when we're talking about CBD it's real popular right now and if you take you to hemp oil if you take him Boyle and use a few more processes like you take the plant him and then you you do a single process there's a couple different ways you can do it to get you know hemp oil full-spectrum hemp oil has everything in it you just pull it right out of the plant okay if you go from there and now you can start to isolate the different chemicals so you can isolate CBD CBD isolate that's why it's called CBD isolate now it takes more processes more chemicals and some of these chemicals are poisonous okay that's that's kind of what turns me off about CBD by itself because of the process to get there the great thing about CBD it's so popular is it turns into like a white powder because it's completely iced so that it looks it's basically they get it down to a single like almost almost a drug form and then you can put anything you can put it in you know different foods you put in drinks you can put it in oils or lotions or whatever you want to do so there's there's that benefit to it but you know in and it has like oh not much not much flavor to it it might taste a little a little weird but it doesn't taste like marijuana okay full spectrum hemp oil tastes like marijuana okay you know and it smells like it's very strong very pungent because there's things like turbines that are in there that have they cause different aromas they also cause different things but see full spectrum hemp oil is kind of like are you gonna take vitamin C CBD or are you gonna take all your vitamins like a multivitamin okay the difference is this is not a man-made multivitamin you know with with hemp oil it basically is you know this amazing plant that has so much going on to there that all these different chemicals work well together in very small amounts they grew that way so it's natural so they work well together in those amounts and so you absorb all of this your body actually has a whole cannabinoid system that has receptors that can receive you know the different cannabinoids and they do different things now to be honest with you after doing tons of research it's it's pretty clear that they don't know everything that these cannibals can do they know a lot about CBD and a lot about THC but they don't know the rest over in Israel they're kind of like the people that are responsible for the most research on CBD I think they found it you know thirty forty years ago or something for the first time but what they figured out is if you take CBD by itself you almost have to do it in higher milligrams to get the effect that you want because it's isolated that means it doesn't work as well by itself it doesn't mean that it's bad it just doesn't work as well by itself you have to take much more of it so that's why you guys see like a lot of bottles say you know CBD 1000 or 1500 you know or whatever even 750 or 600 you see all that because it takes more because it's one thing all right now what these researchers and chemists have figured out is with all the cannaboids working together in the hemp oil extract all right it's a simpler process that requires only alcohol in the process or sometimes even pressing with heat you know alcohol we've been drinking alcohol for years it's not a poisonous thing to us you know what I mean least not in a small amount it's not like it's not like a heavy chemical but basically they're saying that all these cannabinoids working like they do together create the entourage effect you can you can look that up the entourage effect and so they're not really sure how synergistically it all works together to work so well but now we find that you don't need that much CBD you can get away with a lot less CBD because all these other cabin oils are magnifying the properties of each one make sense so when it comes to CBD I'm all healing I want the CBD for recovery for for mood like stress it's really good for me chilling out you know I'm a bodybuilder sometimes get fired up you know house [ __ ] goes you little testy I mean you know where I'm going with this my people you know okay so you know there's that but there's also other stuff going I'm gonna do a whole video on it I have like a little sunspot on my shoulder that apparently was precancerous according to the dermatologist she looked at it and was like yeah it looks like potentially precancerous they're talking about cutting it out you know I won't do that and it's been almost like a scab on its own for like a year and a half and then I started taking CBD pretty regularly about a month ago and now I'm watching it heal up and start to go away it's almost gone I'm gonna do a whole video on that just to show you I can't say that it cures anything I can't say that it's you know this this drug for this or that you can't do that the FDA won't let you so I'm not gonna say that but I'm just going to show you my experience with it so I start thinking this if I'm if I'm taking this substance this hemp oil okay and this is happening to my shoulder and I noticed that it relaxes me with my mood and eliminates stress I sleep really well if I take it before bed if it's doing all these things like it's helping me but like I think to myself what else is it doing inside of me you know if it's doing this I can see it on my shoulder and you can see it my mood I feel what else is it doing inside of me so when you guys see me promoting the products that I have it's full-spectrum hemp oil okay because I prefer the entourage effect I'm not trying to get high with CBD there's THC for that you know it's legal now in all different states everywhere and is what it is so if I want to get higher I'm gonna smoke I'm somebody with a blood THC and trust me I like my weed okay but when it comes to healing I'm literally looking at this is like one of the most beneficial things I can do for my body and so that's what I'm doing and I'm just I'm just relaying this to you because there's people in my family that need it there's friends of mine that need it and if I'm taking and I need it why not so so there it is this is a little bit longer video than I wanted it to be but I felt like I had to break it down so just know when you look at you know my product and you're gonna look at the milligram since that's what we do we're a bigger stronger faster Chris Bell okay so that that's what we're about here in the United States but you know at the end of the day like understand sometimes you know it's not always the best is just more it's not always the best all right so that that's what I was trying to explain with this video so anyways you heard it first thanks for your attention I would love to hear your feedback in

lovers welcome to I love CBD so first of all I want to apologize for being away for so long but life life has been catching up to me and I haven't had any chance to review any CBD products lately so sorry about that but uh I got some new stuff for you guys and I'm gonna start out with this one right here and this is from koi CBD so I was driving around and I saw a big billboard that said koi CBD on it and I was like wow and CBD company bought a whole billboard this is pretty impressive I gotta try this out so I looked him up heard some pretty decent stuff about him so I was like okay let's try it out and give you guys a review and let you know what I think of it so this right here is a tincture bottle it has 250 milligrams and it's peppermint flavor I ordered this off their website keep it quick turned out that they were actually here not that far away from where I lived there in California as well but I think they have other locations this is what the bottom looks like and the liquid inside is pretty clear there's no substance or anything in there see it's almost two hairs water and actually the taste is also very clear tastes like when you taste it all you taste is that peppermint and you know it's almost like you're taking water with peppermint which again you know it's okay I don't mind that the pepper is pretty refreshing I'm usually expect a little bit extra flavor or something in there but this has none the ingredients are COI prism full spectrum cannabidiol blend natural peppermint extract and the oil so pretty simple no fluff no additional stuff that it doesn't really need to be in to your CBD and no weird stuff that I can't pronounce so I like that I like that it's simple and straight to the point however the recommended dosage on this bottle has one full dropper so just wonderful dropper like we just pulled out at the bottle right now I tried this three days before I made this review because the first day I took the recommended dosage was just one full dropper and I didn't really feel much the second day I was like okay let's double up the dose and take two full droppers and I actually felt more effects at that point and you know if felt more relaxed and little loosened up some tension and you know muscle soreness also eased up a little bit I wasn't sleepy but I got good sleep when I went to bed it's pretty deep sleep as well so pretty decent so yeah on the effects part it's you know it's not bad so it's okay it does what it's supposed to do flavor-wise the peppermint is good I didn't mind it and price wise it was 39.99 off the website you can definitely find some coupons online if you search up going CBD coupons you'll find it on some website and you can probably at least get like $10 off or 10% off I'm sorry I could get 10% off your order sometimes you know special occasions or whatever they might have a higher coupon get more of a discount but you can almost always find that 10% off so yeah for this I would give it 4 out of 5 stars I'm not disappointed I'm not overly impressed either it's okay it's fine I think for somebody like me I'll probably go to higher dosage if I do get it next time not sure if I will or not but you know I have nothing against getting it again and that's it for coy CVD tinctures and yeah I also got some gummies which I'm pretty excited about because I haven't tried CBD gummies yeah before so that's gonna be coming up on next review and I'm excited about that I hope I'm not disappointed and I look forward to putting up a review on that one all right I hope you guys find this video useful if you liked it and you found it useful give me a like if you have anything to share about koi cvd drop us a comment let us know what you think and if you like CBD like we do subscribe and you'll get all my reviews and happy CBD I will see you guys in the next review goodbye", "1-qdvTBmo3I": "[Music] hi these are the sublingual tinctures from koi CBD these are called coin Naturals and they are full spectrum however THC 3 sublingual tinctures in other words they're designed to be used orally under the tongue and these products are they have a hemp extract natural plant terpenes and the carrier oil is coconut oil they come in we carry two different flavors a natural flavor and an orange and the orange flavoring is not artificial it is natural orange flavoring these are true full-spectrum sublingual textures so if you're looking for the anti-inflammatory the analgesic the anti-anxiety and the antioxidant benefits of CBD koi naturals is definitely a good choice in addition to being THC free these are 30 mil in your bottles and we carry a 500 milligram and a 1000 milligram each one no leader dropper or 1000 milligram tincture would have 33 milligrams of CBD which is right in the middle of where we see most of our customers using these products in terms of daily CBD intake for their different ailments and benefits that you're looking for the taste of these are great like I mentioned the natural it's it's very very natural tasting the coconut oil does a really nice job smoothing out the hemp extract and the orange is a very very good natural orange taste so if again taste is an issue for you if you've used CBD products before these are very very good have no fear these are very very good tasting sublingual tincture as you actually will enjoy using them again these are these see the koi Naturals CBD sublingual full-spectrum tinctures", "1iuA5wDv3Jo": "hey everyone and welcome to hemp in a pan today we'll be showing you how to make a CVD teacher [Music] so what exactly is a tincture and how is it different from other CBD edibles well a tincture is a medicine made by dissolving a drug into alcohol in this case we're dissolving the CBD on the hemp buds into the alcohol because of this CBD tincture is sort of the same thing as a CBD infused alcohol although with a tincture we're trying to maximize the amount of CBD then each drop to be used in small doses as opposed to a seaweed infused aloe Hall where each serving is most likely more than a few drops and by using the drops under the tongue the arterial blood supply under your tongue will rapidly absorb the CBD allowing it to take effect much faster than with any edible so first things first we're going to be using a lot of medicinal hemp because we need a pack a lot of CBD into each drop so half an ounce to a full ounce of medicinal hemp is needed second we're more interested in extracting as much as CBD off the hemp buds as possible then we are the taste of the alcohol so we're using the highest percentage of alcohol we can find from a distilled beverage in my case I'm going with a 750 milliliter bottle of Bacardi 151 which has a seventy five point five percent alcohol content and for those thinking why not just use rubbing alcohol event don't do this we're still going to be consuming this and most rubbing alcohol are made with isopropyl alcohol which metabolites is different from consumable alcohol and is very harmful if ingested now we need to decarboxylate the hemp and to do so Wolford grind it up onto a baking sheet decarboxylate in the hem will convert the CBB a in the hemp to CBB and is done so by heating up the hemp buds so after grinding it all up to help it heat evenly we'll place this in the oven which has been preheated to 250 degrees and we'll let it bake for 30 minutes after it's done grounded buds will have a darker baked colour and you'll want let it sit a little to have it cool down before handling it after its cooled will place the decarboxylated hemp in a jar and then pour into alcohol from here if you have the time to spare you can just cover it up and place it somewhere dark for a couple of days to have the CBD infused with the alcohol slowly over time just be sure to give it a good shake once a day if you're going with this method if you're short on time though there's actually another method available they'll infuse the tincture much quicker and that's to give the glass jar a water bath he will expedite the infusion process down to just 20 minutes except instead of beating a jar in boiling water you'll need a lower the heat until the water is down to a low simmer this is because unlike water which has a boiling point of 212 degrees Fahrenheit alcohol has a lower boiling point of just 173 degrees Fahrenheit which means that the most we should heat up the teacher is a hundred and seventy degrees to prevent any of the alcohol from burning off as you can see from the thermometer this is what a low simmer of a hundred and seventy degrees looks like but even if you don't have a cooking thermometer and actually burn off a little alcohol since we're not drinking this for the alcohol content it shouldn't matter much just know that by doing so it'll make the teacher slightly more concentrated which will have a stronger effect you'll need a place something on the bottom of the pot so the jar doesn't have to write contact with the burner make sure the water in cases the alcohol but isn't so high that will accidentally pour into the jar and be sure to take the lid off the jar I also only recommend this if you have an electric burner I don't recommend using this method with a gas stove as it's too risky to play something with this high of an alcohol content near fire alternatively if you have a sous-vide cooker in your kitchen this is much better to use to ensure that the water stays at exactly 170 degrees with a sous-vide cooker all you have to do is clip it to a side of a pot fill it with water and then set the water temperature to 170 degrees before placing the jar in note that water is denser than alcohol so you need to play something on top of the jar to make sure that it doesn't flow I don't recommend using what I'm using but it's why I had nearby so I made it work either way you want to heat the tincture uncovered for 20 minutes after that we can take it out and just leave it out to cool until it's warm to the touch now for both the long method and the quick heating method the final step is to filter out all the plant material from the tincture and here you can either use a cheesecloth or a coffee filter just place out on a funnel and pour it all through making sure to squeeze out any alcohol left on the plant material so nothing goes to waste depending on how you plan on using the tincture you either want to put it in a dropper for easy consumption or in my case a jar to store for future use as a tincture is really useful for a number of recipes just be sure to store this in a dark place if available definitely use a tinted glass jar to further protect the tincture from light and that's it", "VF26aQ_de84": "I do it guys welcome back to another episode on the I smoke youtube channel my name is Tyler Greene I'm your host and today I'm gonna talk about a another form of CBD oil we do an occasional video about CBD oil I've covered various ranges before but the range that I have today by a company called eql are something a little bit different and that is what I'm going to talk to you about in a bit of detail right here on the ice smoker channel CBD oil has absolutely taken the country and indeed a lot of the world by storm the cannabinoid cannabidiol also known as CBD is a legal component of the cannabis plant this has caused it to surge in popularity as people have realized the benefits of cannabinoids on their endocannabinoids system unfortunately we've seen some marketing practices which have continued to demonize THC which is another beneficial cannabinoid but the CBD market has grown and grown and grown and is looking likely to surpass the entire vitamins market in the next couple of years EQL is a brand sold on the hemp elf website they're also going to be sold in the leafy pop up store at the end of the month alongside the goods and the hemp elf products the reason that I wanted to make a video about this particular oil is the natural terpene infusion that has been done to give it more of a palatable taste if you've ever tried CBD oil you might think to yourself I don't really like to taste that much it's a little bit bitter a little bit planty this is basically using natural hemp derived terpenes to give a nicer flavor for the oil I'm going to show you this and and taste it right now on the channel the range itself they've got a terpene infused one and a non terpene infused one a couple of things to mention about this product one is it is broad-spectrum not full-spectrum this is something you're gonna see more of in the CBD worlds moving forward as regulations tighten but basically it is starting with the CBD and then in other cannabinoids to create a broad spectrum with with benefits of those other cannabinoids and this starts with a base of MCT oil CBD broad-spectrum isolate hemp terpenes minor cannabinoids can include CPG and CBC this is produced at a farm that they own basically so it's from seed to oil extract as well get a taste these now actually I haven't tasted it without the terpene so we're gonna do this while I've got this dropper out it's the perfect time to show you something which is that this has a glass pipette with a measurement on it now it's got no point two five mil all the way up to one mil and this says on the bottle that it is 33 milligrams per mil so if you have one full Pripet of this you can easily dose yourself and with the right amount of CBD basically what I'm going to do is I'm going to do half a mil so that's about what 16 and a half milligrams of CBD and I'm just gonna put this under my tongue like so now immediately it's not as strong or bitter tasting as most of the other words that I've got it is more of a light coconut taste and I think that's because of the MCT oil right that's what I can taste right about now there's no sort of like need to have a drink after it almost leaves like that yeah like coconut milk sort of aftertaste in your mouth do you know I mean it's not like a bad flavor whatsoever moving on to the terpene infused one this is what got me really excited is that they've done the same as this oil but then they've reinterprets from the implants that it's been extracted from - just try and keep some of that more natural hemp flavor now this is coming in a nice knot point 75 mil which is what - which is three quarters of thirty three milligrams 2922 is two thirds about 2627 milligrams I don't actually know I'm not doing maps that quickly so this has got the terpene infusion let's see how this tastes in comparison it's really interesting the terpenes definitely add a kind of hemp taste to it without any of the sort of bitterness it's like a it's very plant e it's almost like a bit grassy that kind of like area of flavor you know I mean it's not got a sweetness but it's also not got like any sour or any kind of like what I perceive to be negative flavors or to actually really cool stuff they changed the bottles they did previously have this in a darker boots or they've moved it into a lighter one I'm not sure what schools that move I did think that it was sort of photosensitive so potentially and bottles were were better for that but they've decided to put it into a clear bottle so if you're storing at home maybe store it in a dark cupboard rather than just in direct sunlight a thousand milligrams in each bottle there's a little bit of a price difference with these the well balanced CBD drops of $59.99 and the terpene infused is 65 99 if you are using the amount of CBD I'm using then you'll probably get through one of these bottles in a month in fact it's actually perfectly dosed for a month's supply I'd say if you have one meal there's 30 mils in that bottle for getting the favoring milligrams per day that's what I am taking personally I think that's a good amount to to consume from my n low cannabinoid system what do you think about infusing terpenes back into the CBD oil is it something that you could see yourself enjoying do leave your comments below and remember to hit that like and subscribe button if you're enjoying our content it helps the channel grow I'll be back with another video soon as always thanks for watching and keep talking your roller coaster going down but I never felt this high biggest right how the century [Music]", "l0AntCR6314": "hello everybody and welcome back to your word cannabis and today's video we're going to be making a CBD alcohol tincture but first if you wouldn't mind if you're new here to the channel please hit that subscribe button and if you've already subscribed thank you very much and if you wouldn't mind give the video a thumbs up it would help our channel out quite a bit so today we're going to be making an alcohol-based CBD tincture this is a simple yet kind of complex recipe only because of the amount of plant material that goes into this recipe normally if you've seen my other videos about making cannabis oil or CBD oil if we're talking grams to cup of oil so you know a certain amount of grams per cup of oil and that's usually the recipe it can be fluctuated but today we're going to be talking Elsa's 2 cup so we're going to be using ounces of flour per cup of alcohol and the reason this is is because alcohol can extract plant material the best it's pretty much the best home remedy to get the most out of plant material it grabs onto those cannabinoids and rips them off the plant material and it makes some really potent stuff and you can use it for all kinds of different applications including adding to your wine or drink at night but for today we're just making a base alcohol tincture so I've already measured out 3.3 ounces of CBD by ops flower and this runs at 21.1% CBD we've also used our trim bag recently so you haven't checked that video please do and we're going to be using some Vioxx flower trim and the reason why I have some trim here and flower is because I want to do about one ounce of flower per cup of alcohol so we're going to be making three cups of CBD alcohol tincture today but I want to use the trim to add CBD a to the mix we want this to be a full-spectrum CBD alcohol tincture so we'll be using some of this probably only about an ounce or two of trim along with the three point three ounces of flour so as always we're going to decarbonize de carve our trim because when you dakar you lose the a and cbda and it becomes CBD so we're going to be getting all of our CBD from the flower and we'll be getting a lot of our CBD a from the trend and if you haven't seen my decarboxylated technique run through it really quick today all I do is they preheat my oven to 250 degrees and I put my flower in there for roughly a half an hour you can go a little bit more you can go a little bit less it really depends on what you want your conversion to be but I like to go right about half an hour sometimes 35 minutes or 40 minutes given the amount of material I may go 40 minutes today so I'm gonna preheat the oven on a decarboxylate this and then we're going to get started using our magic butter machine and the recipe to make our CBD alcohol tincture okay so our hemp flour has now decarboxylated I did 250 degrees for 40 minutes just because of the amount of material I wanted to make sure that that was going to be fully d carved then while I was waiting for that to D carb I measured out one ounce of biotics flour trim so now let's get the magic butter machine and start making this alcohol texture okay so now we have our magic butter machine and we have our one ounce of not decarboxylated hemp flour trim and we also have our decarboxylated hemp flour so today the alcohol we'll be using is a fan-favorite for extraction this is Everclear its grain alcohol and it's a hundred and ninety proof now you can't get this here or Virginia and certain states you cannot get it in so you're just going to look for your high prove I know a lot of states is a 151 or something like that whatever the case is but the higher the proof the more extraction and this is going to give us pretty much the best extraction we can buy so all we need to start doing is gonna get our not decarboxylated trim and we're going to start adding our decarboxylated fat flower okay get that in there all right so now we have all of our flower in our magic butter machine as you can see this thing is packed full but that's going to be okay so that is this is four point three ounces of products so this is all biotics flower in here this is four point three ounces of Vioxx hemp flour whether it's trim flower it's just all plant material so now I'm going to be doing three cups of alcohol so we'll measure here now you see why I use three cups just happens to be a coincidence that it's the 750 milliliter Everclear is just about 3 cups so once you've measured that out go ahead and pour that in okay now we're all squared up everything is in we're going to put the top on our magic butter machine as we always do and we're going to plug it in okay so now we've plugged in our magic butter machine all as well so for an alcohol tincture you're gonna go to a hundred and thirty degrees Fahrenheit and I like to do eight hours now you can do four but I want the most out of it so I'm gonna do eight hours so we'll see it eight hours and we'll show you the finished product okay so the magic butter machine is all done and we just got a scoop off all the remaining plant material now remember this was like four point three ounces of plant material so there is quite a bit but you're gonna be really surprised what it looks like in there so it all gets blended down and I'll show you here so what was once a pile of flour is now gone so we're just going to dump it all out into the micron bag try to get everything out of here this is a quite a bit of plant material now at the bottom I'll scoop some out so you can see it just put that right into the white crumb bag but while the plant material in this recipe a lot different than the will recipes so now that that's done put your silicone glove on your dominant hand so you can squeeze it the best clean that up a little bit so the amount of plant material makes it definitely more challenging than the oil recipes because you're squeezing four ounces of plant material dried plant material now it's all wet can be quite the challenge and so what I like to do is put it right back in to the Everclear bottle so you know it's the alcohol tincture so that's what we're going to do here so that's our recipe that's what I have for you today folks I hope you enjoyed this recipe and use it to your advantage I will leave the recipe in the description below on the video go ahead and try it yourself if you have any comments questions leave them below you can also find us on Instagram and Facebook I'll leave those links in the description and I will see you in another video take care", "-790Tzzh794": "hi everyone welcome back to my channel today's video is going to be something i think pretty timely i know a lot of people are feeling stressed and anxious right now i wanted to do a video ranking all of the cbd oils i've tried over the last few years i'm gonna go through all four ranking them and leaving the very best for last so make sure you stay tuned to the end when i first tried it i was a little bit skeptical but over the years i've really found stuff that works for me and really helps manage my stress levels and also help me manage my tmj pain i suffer from jaw clenching and teeth grinding in my sleep my tmj pain is often triggered by stress and i need a little help in the stress management department i will also be doing a video all about cbd beauty so make sure you subscribe so you don't miss that i have a lot of skincare and body care products to share in that video all the cbd oils in this video are hemp derived so you can buy them online number four on the list is the first cbd oil i really tried on a consistent basis this is by the brand rosebud very cool female founded brand this is their old packaging so since they've launched a couple years back the packaging has been updated the logo has changed a little bit this is their 350 milligram bottle i found that in the beginning i would just add a couple drops to my coffee and gradually work my way up to half a dropper it was a great introductory cbd obviously a female founded brand which i love supporting so while i have the 350 here they do offer higher doses on their website so check them out that is rosebud next up we have reed's remedy calm and this is a really unique one because it's a spray and the nice thing about a spray is that the dose is consistent and this is the calm blend so this is a distilled hemp oil with terpenes infused this bottle contains 500 milligrams of cbd the spray design is genius because it's a controlled dose every single time unlike a dropper where you really have to look closely to make sure you have an accurate dosing especially if you're starting out and you're very sensitive for a one spray serving size you get 75 servings in one bottle really nice format and it has a little bit of a grassy flavor so it's very uplifting and awakening huge fan of this one i really think the packaging is quite innovative i've never seen another spray cbd oil so definitely want to try more from this brand raking in at number two is bloom farms cbd oil this is their relieve tincture this bottle has 600 milligrams of cbd really nice box really pretty frosted glass bottle just very elegant looks premium so this brand uses 100 organically grown hemp and also 100 usda certified organic mct oil bloom farms also has a really nice one for one initiative for every bottle sold they donate a meal to a family in need so when i was getting used to cbd i was just kind of putting it in my coffee a couple drops and gradually working my way up from there by the time i tested this out i was just using it in tincture form just taking a half dropper or so and putting it under my tongue and letting that kind of absorb in for 30 seconds to a minute so i would use this in the morning kind of to curb the jaw tension and headaches i'd sometimes have in the morning from my tmj and then i'd also take it after lunch and in the evening time to kind of just keep me leveled off and i feel like cbd truly has a compounding effect if you take it once you're not really going to notice a whole lot but if you take it daily i feel like it has a true compounding effect and it helps kind of curb those anxiety and stress levels at least that's been the experience for me so really enjoyed this one from bloom farms love that it's out of oakland love that it uses organic ingredients and had a pretty good taste but number one definitely wins for taste and coming in at number one the best cbd oil that i wanted to recommend is by pachamama and this is the natural a 750 milligram cbd it was founded by two brothers and they have a really inspiring story about overcoming addiction and i encourage you to go check out their website or their instagram to kind of get a feel for the brand the only thing they could really improve on this would be the packaging sometimes i had a hard time opening this so this has been my favorite cbd oil to date i love the story of the brand i love the taste it has a very unique taste that's different to the other cbd oils that i've mentioned in this video it has more of like a smoky rich taste to it versus like a hempy grassy taste to it i can't quite explain it this brand also has topicals and i've been trying their athletic rub it's a very very rich kind of body butter sal that you can put on sore muscles achy joints and stuff like that and it smells like girl scout thin mint cookies it smells incredible but anyways that's the other product i've been trying from pachamama that i love but in terms of their cbd oil it tastes the best and i really like the story behind the brand if you're curious my affiliate link will be down below i super appreciate your support if not just go check them out i think that they're doing really cool things all right friends those are all of the cbd oils for stress that i can recommend you now know my absolute favorite if you have a favorite cbd oil definitely leave it in a comment down below so we can all check it out so thank you again for watching i will see you very soon in the next one [Music] you", "4ixxyByF2zE": "hi hi hi today's video is a little different little different best CBD oils my favorite so far of 2020 if you're new to this channel what I do is I buy CD products for full price I send them to a lab to see if they're real well as of 2020 this year I send every product to two labs for blind testing why blind test products can you be so obtuse did you call me obtuse CBD products why can't we just trust blindly trust CBD companies and allow them to send whatever they went to a lab that they pay a lot of money to throw out any bad results and only post the good ones and then sell you crap I tested over 80 products over the course of a year without any sponsorship or affiliation but full disclosure this month for the first time I have added affiliate links to CBD examine calm to help pay for the products and lab tests product in lab tests are super super expensive and that's how we're gonna continue to pay for these lab tests well that's where I see things just a little differently contractor no I will not bow to any sponsor I did feel dirty adding the affiliate links to CBD examine calm though almost all review websites work with affiliate links or sponsorships of some sort but it felt dirty right it's like people only do things because they get paid and that's just really sad nothing will change on my website all new products will be purchased for retail price the CBD companies can't send me anything I need to buy them sent to two different labs for blind testing and the official reports of course will be available on each review the process all documented for your eyeballs and I will still be the same jerk that gives critical reviews but this following list was picked last week when I was still innocent pure and poor so after 80 product reviews here are eight of my favorite and these will probably change because I just sent fifty more products to a lab so hit that subscribe button to see more soon I'm gonna go over these super quick and you can just hit the link below to see all the full reviews the official lab tests or watch the YouTube videos on each one number eight oh Jesus look at that beautiful face okay this one needs an update someone lost their job back when Sun soil was called Green Mountain because they didn't know that full-spectrum products contain THC drug test look for THC when I did my review last year I thought that their their lab results could be a little more clear but they fix that issue since their lab results are now very clear I still think CBD companies should do a little more to warn people about THC and drug tests but that's a whole nother problem because if they put the appropriate warning on them certain government employees will flag them in mistake totally legal hemp for marijuana because the government the government in this tone is excellent and uses your tax dollars efficiently anyway back to us on soil here it's super cheap 30 bucks 600 milligrams of CBD our lab test found it was incredibly accurate on CBD trace levels of THC and lots of other cannabinoids the taste was not bad it's good for all the cannabinoids and the mint chocolate taste helps the natural flavor out a bit but it is a natural taste and it is a good full spectrum so that tastes a little like hemp EMP chocolate so if you don't like the taste of hemp move along just choose a different one if you want the cheapest full-spectrum USDA Organic CBD I think you found it five cents per milligram of CBD is incredibly cheap at only $30 numero seven cheap and trusted and that's not just a CBD company I tested Garden of life's 10 milligram in 20 milligram formulas that's two labs for lab tests dive in links below the $50 30 milligram formula that's 900 milligrams total came in at 5 cents flat cheap he's also taste excellent it's peppermint and orange zest it's really good both are labeled as broad-spectrum so it should have CBD other cannabinoids but no THC nope our labs found that they're basically just a CBD oil which is typical of broad spectrums nothing else most broad spectrum suck I like this as a pure CBD but really if you want other cannabinoids just go with a full spectrum instead of a broad spectrum this one has some essential oils added peppermint frankincense I guess you might be able to say entourage effect I give it to them because almost every broad-spectrum extract I've tasted is pure CBD and other cannabinoids are usually so low that they don't matter in these broad spectrums it's still a great deal for pure CBD and you're getting garden of life they've been around for 20 years and they're a great company I do like that their CBD is formulated by dr. Perlmutter you know grain brain I know it's probably BS he probably just tasted it and was like taste good and they were like okay good because we're gonna say you formulated it on the package and pay you a bunch of money you think that dude is in a lab formulating products probably on some yacht drinking herbal tea or something weird I would think brain maker that was a good book too okay on to number six most trusted brand bar liens our lab tests found this 1125 milligram bottle a full spectrum 70 bucks is a good full spectrum extract you've got CBD THC and good amounts of other cannabinoids like CBC and CBG by the way you guys I know uh people claim a certain CBD oil will be good for specific conditions we don't have enough research to suggest that these cannabinoids change everything I post the cannabinoid profile on every review you might like a lot of THC someone else may have negative effects from tea see you might find that cbc helps you someone else might just like pure CBD you really just got to try a few look at the cannabinoids when you find one you like they affect everyone differently under six cents per milligram great price I really like bar leans they've been around for thirty years and you really can't find anything bad about them well except I did find one thing bad the Center for Food Safety gave them a bad score for CBD testing which was complete [ __ ] that was my December 2019 update and my June 2020 update showed that the Center for Food Safety changed their score to an a stupid government I can say that now that I don't work for the government they were rating CBD companies on testing and transparency without testing anything I know I know and that's why you're here watching a completely insane person sense CBD to labs in California instead of putting your faith in the government yeah I was a government employee but don't don't hold that against me number five most loved CBD company this one is hard to argue with if I wasn't so cheap they would probably be my number one of everything they made the famous strange Charlotte's Web named after Charlotte Figi dr. Sanjay Gupta I don't think I said that right dr. Sanjay Gupta dr. Sanjay had a documentary that featured Charlotte and CBD and that really started the whole CBD movement you can trust dr. Sanjay because cannabis radar ranked him the number one CBD influencer of all time who's that clean-shaven baby face right there that's number two influencer in the world Charlotte's Web played a huge part and the legalization of hemp and I don't know if hemp would be legal today if it wasn't for this company probably not just don't say anything bad about them on the internet their followers really are passionate about them and will email you here's the here's the bad thing I said I really didn't like that the front of their bottle used to say hemp extract that's a [ __ ] term people confuse it with CBD it's not but I always gave him a little bit of slack because they were one of the first maybe the first to navigate the CBD world when you couldn't say CBD for legal reasons on the bottle they started this made CBD products before sea but he was legal then they helped make CBD illegal gangsters only halfway joking about the gangster part what they did was incredible and pretty pretty gangster now their labels are all updated and specific which I like because that's what I look for at CBD examine calm honest labeling our lab testing found that they make a good full spectrum extract even really need me to tell you that they're famous for that they have research on their company the only complaint I have is that they are on the expensive side their $30 bottle that's a new price is about 13 cents per milligram of CBD 15 cents is average but average to me is expensive I'm cheap you know that but if you're willing to buy their more potent formulas you can get a great deal they're 60 milligrams formula goes down to four point six cents per milligram of CBD if you're willing to shell out 275 bucks yeah so I would say go big or don't go at all but you really can't put a price on a specific strain grown by one company that's helped more people than any other CBD company and by more people I mean that they are the largest CBD company with by far the most reviews quantity a positive reviews number for re botanicals this is the first brand to receive a USDA Organic cert it's small but the founder was also the founder of Nu Teva the giant hemp super food brand that people seem to really like our lab tests found that re botanicals makes a well rounded full spectrum extract their new prices are between seven cents and nine cents per milligram of CBD average is 15 cents so good well great value for organic B first USDA Organic I use their role on peppermint CBD oil a lot this one smells so damn good I'm cheap but that smell gets me every time I like it put it on your temples relax a little bit number three best pure CBD med Tara matera is one of the first CBD companies to win a mainstream retail contract you can find them in CVS yeah there's a yeah there's a theme here I like well-respected companies that have pushed the CBD movement forward mainstream in this case by the way they reduce the price of thirty five bucks it seems like all CBD companies are getting cheaper right now I need to update those prices I bought before because they're dropping especially in the last few months in light of a certain shutdown of the economy not sure how that makes CBD cheaper but it has met Tara is nice for people that don't want th see our lab tests found that this is just clean CBD oil nothing else not even CBD V just CBD and they don't make any THC products so this is good for anyone who can't have THC in their system and doesn't want the chance of the product that the product might get mixed up with a THC product or somebody might look at them differently for having a CBD product with THC this doesn't have it this is the one that I recommend to my firefighter friends that can't have THC or shouldn't if I was still a government employee this is what I would pick up and if you have a soul-sucking job where you also get tested for THC met Tara's great I have a full video on CBD and drug testing there's a caveat a bad test is still in use today but for the most part pure CB means that you'll have no problem with drug test that tests for THC their new price brings this down to six cents per milligram of CBD excellent I've tested some that are over thirty cents six cents is great pure CBD has no taste so this has no flavor no weird hemp flavor I like med Terra but if you do want THC look out for Lazarus number two cheapest CBD on earth Lazarus Naturals now in the Bible I didn't read it but I do have Wikipedia Lazarus died and Jesus brought him back to life so when I was deathly ill from a hangover I thought maybe using Lazarus I could come back to life I'm not gonna make medical claims or suggestions for hangovers but miraculously I did come back to life this also happens to be one of the most potent extracts that we've tested for THC so it could have been that by the way always look at the THC levels of the CBD you're getting two milligrams is a lot you will feel that and I cannot confirm that it will bring you back from the dead like it did for me but you may feel it a bit there full-spectrum CBD is so damn cheap I can't believe it when I tested it it was at four cents per milligram of CBD for their $32 bottle and they just updated their prices this month and it's now three cents they're stronger formula is at two cents per milligram it's so cheap it was already the cheapest now it's it's that they beat their own record it's the cheapest cheapest cheapest but please let me know if you found anything cheaper than this because I'd like to test that one out to our testing found that they were extremely accurate and it was one of the most potent full spectrums that we've tested with a lot of CBC and CPG as well now the only downside is that the flavor is also potent it's super earthy but just looking at the candle levels I would expect that they use a natural ethanol extraction process some people don't like that because it does keep the natural flavors ethanol alcohol goes away completely during the evaporation stage but you're also left with one of the most potent extracts possible of kin monoids so if you don't like the natural flavor of hemp this won't be for you but it is such a good deal they make pure sativa tea products as well and I'm testing a bunch of their new products so stay tuned for that number one best CBD company Bluebird botanicals I've been a fan of Bluebird for a long time I wrote about them in my book hemp for migraine best book ever by the way and I'm a very modest person and I wrote about them on CBD examined for a long time where I test products for transparency and accuracy this company pioneered transparency today most companies provide lab tests online a lot of companies provide inaccurate lab reports but that's beside the point Bluebird was one of the first to may be the first to show real lab tests for everything I've tested for of their products now a couple of multiple times I've got more tests on the way also and their lab results have been excellent my only complaint is that they don't make any flavored products no gummies and instead of lowering prices in this time desperation the prices actually went up by a couple dollars still cheap still great still the best company but I might need to rethink this number one spot because everyone else is lowering their prices and I'm super cheap Lazarus load their prices last week Bluebird I'd like to tell everyone you did to in an update next week it's not like my opinion matters it's not like people pay attention to the top video review on Google right now out of 3810 Bluebird review results there are full-spectrum extracts are well rounded and potent I've always compared them to Charlotte's Web but cheaper still cheaper so I can't really complain about the price that prices have always been great and everything about the CBD company is positive too many good things to list and I really like that they give massive discounts to disabled low-income and vets Lazarus does that too if I didn't mention that before bluebirds founder is also the vice-president of the u.s. hemp roundtable which led the political fight for hemp legalization this is just a solid company that has built a reputation over years pioneered CBD transparency and pushed for legalization they really are in a league of their own so there you have it my favorite CBD companies and this list is bound to change because I've already sent 50 more products to the lab subscribe so you don't miss out and I will see you next time", "tFYJYBTCTmE": "this is Jes CBD specialist with ambery Gardens we're here today talking about our full spectrum daily 500 now this is one of the middle concentrations in our full spectrum a daily line of internally taken oil products and it's going to

concentration breakdown feel free to go to the description tab of this product on our website to find it there but we'll go ahead and go into that for you now so on our dosage scale we like to use two

that you want to start from a totally empty dropper so we just completely empty this out and press as hard as we can making sure we're really squishing every single bit at the top of that and press that down in and let go and you're given the exact dosage that we have on here on the side of the bottle once again in this particular bottle that is 17 milligrams now if we wanted to break that down further how we do that is in drops to get a drop to happen you need to give it a slow steady press allow those to form and fall and give maybe a second or so between each one gives it a good amount of time to form up and make sure that they're very consistent okay now in this particular bottle one drop is going to be point three seven eight milligrams of CBD not very much so we like to break that down in the following ways for you about three drops of this so three drops in that slow steady drop form that we said is getting you approximately one milligram of CBD six drops is going to get you roughly two milligrams of CBD and if you wanted to go a little further 14 drops will get you about five milligrams of CBD once again if you wanted to find a written form of this just feel free to go

meaning that taking more of it doesn't mean that you're going to experience a higher effect the best practice is to start with a lower dose and slowly increase until you find the dose that is perfect for you the first step is to find the total cbd potency of your tincture which weed is closed at the bottom of the front side of the tincture bottle we suggest that you take advantage of our graduated droppers which offer four different measurements a full dropper means that you're taking at least 16 33 or 83 milligrams of cbd in your toes for three quarters of a dropper you'd be taking at least 12 24 or 62 milligrams of cbd in your dose for half a dropper you'd be taking at least 8 16 or 41 milligrams of cbd in your toes and for one quarter of a dropper you'd be taking at least 4 8 or 20 milligrams of cbd in your toes if you're new to cbd this is probably a great starting point you can take one to two full droppers daily in the morning and before going to bed shake well before every use and remember as with any other supplements to consult your physician before using our products", "l9S46IkaOzw": "this is Jes CBD specialist with Avery Gardens and we're here today talking about our extra-strength daily 5000 which is the highest concentration of really any product that we actually make here at ambery Gardens but is also the highest concentration in our full spectrum daily line now these are internally taking products you would either put on a spoon to drink down or put under the tongue and this particular one has 5,000 milligrams of CBD in the bottle if you were to take it in the amounts written right here you would have 84 milligrams of CBD per press we'll get into a little further details of how these breakdowns work here in just a little bit this is an MCT coconut oil version of our product which means you're getting a long-lasting and natural breakdown of CBD over time this is perfect for individuals that have been told by their doctor to find a larger amount of CBD we find some people as well coming to us that are addressing more severe health challenges and are wanting to take a larger amount of CBD as well everybody is different and some people's bodies require just a simply larger amount of CBD per day so if you are looking for the breakdown of this product on our website go ahead and head to the description tab of this particular product and you'll be able to find a written version of this breakdown there but let's go ahead and go into that here for you now in our dosage scale we have two units of measurement we like to use and let's go ahead and establish those now the first one we have is a dropper which is the amount you're gonna see written right here on the side in this particular bottle that is getting you 84 milligrams of CBD to get that amount we're gonna go ahead and start from a completely empty dropper so we'll just kind of press all that out of there press down as hard as we can on the top of that dropper making sure everything gets pressed in push this down in and let it go and we'll get this exact measured amount of oil that we're looking for okay now in this particular version once again that is 84 milligrams of CBD that's in a pretty small amount of oil which is why it's so dark like that it's a very highly concentrated form in this guy now if we wanted to break that down further we like to do that in drops to get a drop you just need to give a slow small amount of pressure allowing for that to form and fall giving a little bit in between each one so we can really make sure that we're consistent okay now in this particular one here one drop is going to be worth about one point eight six milligrams of CVD so one drop is actually worth a pretty you know a consistent and solid dose in in a product like this three drops is going to be getting you about five milligrams of CBD so one two three that was five milligrams right there and if we were wanting to get ten milligrams we would do six drops and for this bottle about 20 milligrams of CBD you can get from 12 full drops of oil now this particular product once again we have a lot of people coming to us with more advanced health challenges their doctors have recommended them to get a larger amount of CBD this is the product that we turn to we also have some folks that are wanting to maintain a consistent daily dose but at a lower amount of oil so you could maintain something like that with this product it has a very long shelf life looking at two years on this guy so you'd really be able to keep it in a cold dark place for a very long time to keep a consistent daily dose of CBD in a smaller capacity like that once again the 5000 milligram of our full-spectrum daily oil 84 milligrams of CBD per press so if you have

what's the difference and what's better hi everyone my name is emily and today i'm going to be diving deep into the difference between these two types of cbd products the main difference between full and broad spectrum is the amount of thc that is in the product you know the cannabinoid that makes you feel high hungry sleepy and so on when the united states passed the 2018 farm bill they set a limit of 0.3 thc weight that can be found in hemp and that goes the same for cbd products full spectrum products tend to contain anywhere from point two to point three percent thc while broad spectrum is thc free or to be more specific it contains non-detectable levels of thc don't worry this isn't enough to get you high unless you take high doses of cbd like 100 milligrams of cbd at once and at a concentration of 0.3 percent thc this would be roughly 8 to 10 milligrams of thc that's not a lot but for the average person like me who doesn't consume marijuana products then there is a good chance you will feel a slight psychoactive high here is an example of a full spectrum lab report and as you can see this extract contains 0.15 thc or 1.41 milligrams of thc per 30 milligrams of cbd so if you take one serving of this which is 30 milligrams of cbd you would be taking 1.41 milligrams of thc as well broad spectrum on the other hand contains non-detectable levels of thc there are instances that you may see broad spectrum 100 thc free but from a scientific standpoint thc free means non-detectable levels of thc so there is a chance that very minor amounts are in the extract but it's not enough to show up on lab tests because it is so little and there is no chance of feeling any psychoactive high no matter how much cbd you consume this lab report you see is a broad spectrum extract and as you can see it says nd which stands for non-detectable also another crucial aspect of full spectrum or broad spectrum extracts is that they contain other cannabinoids other than just cbd such as cannabidrol which stands for cvg cannabinol which stands for cbn or cannabicharmine which stands for cbc these are only four of the 100 plus cannabinoids found in hemp also found in hemp and full spectrum and broad spectrum extracts are terpenes and flavonoids which also have their unique medicinal properties in another segment we'll be talking about why having multiple compounds rather than just cbd or just a few cannabinoids is a lot more effective so stay tuned just to recap full spectrum cbd products tend to contain 0.3 thc which is the legal limit and broad spectrum cbd products are thc free meaning they contain non-detectable levels of thc if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to reach out to us we are happy to answer any questions and guide you in choosing the right product thank you for watching and see you in the next video you", "E15C1PhSIP4": "[Music] hi welcome to hemp lucid University my name is Nick Van y and I'm gonna count strategist here at hemp

factory six today we're going to be talking about how to make a cbd tincture specifically the key components to an oil-based tincture now there's a lot of variety there's a lot of options that we're going to be going through it's really up to your personal preference your audience the demographic the people you're selling to as to what you pick and choose we're going to go through some of those options and really kind of help you out and guide you along the process so first thing is the ingredients and of course the most key ingredient is cbd and as you can see magically i've made some cbd appear because i am the wizard so again just to remind you all all of these here this crude oil this distillate this isolate all comes from this little special nugget here we've got another video we go into the different types of the full spectrum broad spectrum isolate what that all means so check that out but today we're really going to be focusing on how we're going to be using these as ingredients in a cbd and tincture so the first thing is this crude oil extract here as you can see is very rich it's got this nice super runny but it's a dark consistency as you can see because it's got all the plant fats it's got the chlorophyll still in there still under the 0.3 thc however it's the taste is going to be a little bit more earthy it's going to be have a little bit more of what we would call a bite to it on the profile of the flavor and then from there we're going to move up to distillate which is as you can see a beautiful honey color it really really plays nice inside of a cbd tincture and it's really delicious as you can see we've taken out the plant fats the chlorophyll that's what gives it this beautiful color and again this comes in either a full spectrum or a broad spectrum that you can put it in this is what we actually use for most of our tinctures because it's such a fantastic ingredient to work with it's easy to use the next thing we have is an isolate based again this is for more of your targeted type tincture for someone who's you know maybe worried about job loss or something like that maybe they're a first responder maybe they're you know um they work for the government or whatever your job may be this would be a fantastic option for that kind of demographic or audience if you're you know that's what you're selling to there's you know pros and cons to each again with the crude oil you're getting all those plant fats that's more of like an entourage effect with that crude when you move up to the distillate you can still get that entourage effect with the full spec or you can move up to a broad spec which again you're going to be losing out on some of the minor cannabinoids but you get a better flavor profile with a distillate as opposed to a crude and then of course the isolate it's odorless it's colorless so it's really really easy on the palette the next key component to our cbd tincture oil is going to be our carrier oil voila our carrier oils here so the reason we use a carrier oil is to help dilute the cbd make it a little bit more absorbable to the body one of our favorites that we like to use is mct oil it's odorless it's colorless it's tasteless so you can add flavors and other active ingredients and you can still kind of have those flavors come through without messing with it or you can also use something like hemp seed oil again you're going to have a little bit more of a flavor to play with with that ham see it's a little more earthy has a little bit more of a bite to it it's got some omegas but also a fantastic oil to use you can realistically use any ingestible oil like an olive oil even we've had some clients do that it really is up to the audience and the demographic that you're going to be selling to who you're really trying to target that you're you know which will guide your choice as to which carrier oil you really really want to use now the last thing that we're going to be talking about with our cbd tinctures going forward with our last key component is packaging we have our packaging here so one of the most important things we're going to be talking about is going to be the different components to the packaging itself we're going to start off with the glass the glass bottle itself the color now the color is important because it helps to protect from uv light that uv light will degrade your cbd tincture over time that's why you want a darker tint to your glass now it can be an amber color like this it can be a cobalt or a green or like this which is a painted almost black matte you could do all kinds of colors in this same thing though you could do a white you could do a blue a green lots of options lots of varieties again when it comes to that color of that glass now there's different options and styles as well as you can see these are very slight very small differences this is a european style round glass this is a boston style round glass very slight differences but again when you're looking at different types of packaging for your branding what have you that's important things to consider you also have different sizes you can see we have a two ounce here which is a 60 milliliter it's like more like a two month supply as opposed to a 30 milliliter one ounce which is like a one month supply so the other thing that we as you can see all of these are glass glass bottles we recommend glass we always recommend glass the main reason is oxygen barrier it really helps to prevent that degradation oxygenation will degrade your cbd tincture again so from the uv and the oxygen barrier that's why we always say go with glass now we're going to be talking about droppers the dropper is a really important component this is what you're going to be actually using to deliver this cbd into your mouth so there is a couple different types that we're going to be talking about this is a crc which is a child resistant cap as you can see there's a little contraption up here that helps prevent children from being able to take it off the top now it's plain and you didn't see any numbers on the side whereas this is a calibrated dropper that has numbers on the inside or the outside of the dropper that shows you how much you're actually taking so you're either taking a milliliter three quarters a half or two quarters up to you what you want to use with your own packaging you can even just get a simple non-crc non-calibrated dropper as well that's also available if that is the case this little safety shrink seal this is a requirement for all ingestible products you must have a safety seal and that's kind of where this crc prevents the children from getting in but this safety shrink seal is another component that you really want to be aware of the last component that we're going to be talking about with respect to our packaging is going to be our labeling it's really important that you get the labeling right for that reason i'm not going to go too much into it today we have a completely separate video all diving deep into those labels because there's qr codes there's compliance there's formatting there's all kinds of things you need to be aware of guys the last thing is let's chat i'm so excited to talk to you guys if you guys have questions comments below or if you got more specific questions on how to make a product go to

It's exploded in popularity with claims of treating everything\nfrom insomnia to diabetes. - That's the only thing that would help me with my migraine headaches. - [Narrator] It can be consumed as an oil, applied to skin, or inhaled it as a vapor. We know CBD is a component of marijuana, but it's derived from hemp,\nusually does not contain THC, and won't get you high. The game changer for the\nCBD industry came when President Trump signed a farm bill legalizing hemp cultivation. One prescription drug\ncontaining CBD has been approved for treating two rare forms\nof childhood epilepsy, but the vast majority of\nwhat we know about CBD has been limited to personal experiences and unproven animal studies. - More often than not, things\nthat look good in animals, when you go into humans,\nthose effects aren't there. - [Narrator] According to a\n2018 Harvard Health Blog post, scientists say they still don't know much about how CBD affects the brain or which doses and\ndelivery methods work best. For example, if you put a few drops of CBD under your tongue, you\nmight consume 10 milligrams. But some researchers say you\nwould need 30 times that amount to reach a threshold\nthat can relieve stress. And since CBD products\nare primarily marketed and sold as supplements, the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration doesn't evaluate whether these products\nare safe or effective. That means if you buy a CBD\nproduct, you don't really know how much CBD is actually in the container. There's no denying the\nCBD revolution is upon us and the marketplace is buying in.

are i'm going to break down the pros and cons of each and give you some insights into all of the lab testing that i do let's get to it my name is jeremy roscoe and i spent a decade as a professional firefighter with a baby face but my real dream was to grow beard and become the greatest cbd reviewer the world has ever seen now i have a beard and review more cbd products than anyone ever no more baby face i send every cbd product to two independent labs to see what's real disclaimer this is not medical advice visit seebiteexamen.com for official lab tests and more please like share and subscribe to support these free lab tests and cbd videos enjoy two things before we start there is no best for everyone there's pros and cons to each category everyone has different reactions to different cannabinoids so i might do well with low amounts of just cbd cd isolate and you might need a really large dose of full spectrum with lots of cannabinoids to fill anything at all the second thing is that many cbd companies lie about what's in their products i test at two independent labs look at my lab results from independent labs versus the lab results these companies provide or whatever is on their label don't blindly trust cbd companies that tell you what's full spectrum or cbd isolate so what are we looking at here we're talking about hemp products with cbd here cbd has a lot of research behind it it's found in cannabis it does not get you high all these categories here have cbd and we're talking about products from hemp hemp is any cannabis strain that has less than 0.3 percent thc thc is the cannabinoid in marijuana that is responsible for getting people high it has a lot of research behind it and can provide relief in low doses it's not supposed to get you high from hemp because hemp has so little thc but more on that later full spectrums have thc and those are for people who don't need to take a drug test more on that later too then we have other cannabinoids thc and cbd have a lot of research behind them but there's also over 100 cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant i test for about a dozen at my two labs for example we test for cvg cbg oils are becoming popular on the consumer market people think that it has anti-inflammatory benefits pain relief it makes me sleep like a rock but the research behind it is still in its infancy and then we have cannabinoids the labs don't test for yet like thcp which one study recently found is 30 times more potent than thc but we don't know if that lab rat research will transfer over to humans if so a full spectrum extract with thcp might have the potential to get you high with very low amounts very very low amounts of cannabinoids a cannabinoid that we don't even test for yet and the same goes for medicinal benefits all these broad spectrums or full spectrum products we don't know what's responsible for their increased benefits over just cbd and that brings us to the entourage effect the entourage effect is what researchers refer to as the synergy of multiple nutrients found within the hemp plant that increases medicinal benefits counter side effects and maintains benefits at high doses sounds like [ __ ] synergy [ __ ] but there's a lot of research behind this it's uh most apparent in caesar research they found that cannabis whole cannabis full spectrum extracts had greater success rates than just cbd isolate they also found that full spectrum extracts were more effective than the same dose and the same ratio of isolated cbd and isolated thc but they don't know what cannabinoids or what other nutrients are responsible it could be the terpenes the essential oils in cannabis could be healthy fats which increase the absorption of both cbd and thc could be some other cannabinoid they don't know this is so profound there's even cases where they give a kid uh one cannabis extract the seizures go away they give the kid a different strain with similar thc ratios and cbd ratios and the seizures come back in full force but they don't know why that is the entourage effect it's adding to or increasing the benefits of cbd without understanding why i say entourage effect i checked the yes for full spectrums but obviously uh we don't know that all of these will have all these products will have the entourage effect because we don't know what's causing it in the first place and there are a lot of different strains in these extracts more on that later broad spectrums don't have thc i say no entourage effect here many marketers uh would disagree with me and that's because they are all liars all right we're gonna go over the pros and cons take a look at my guide for dosing everyone's different and dosing is tricky there's a lot of ways to screw this up this is all on cbdxamen.com by the way we're on the article now and you can go to the what is cbd for a full guide on this under the uh about tab right there so let's start with full spectrum cbd thc other cannabinoids the full entourage effect maybe we talked about the research obviously this category has the most cannabinoids so it can be the most effective a lot of people say that full spectrums are the only thing that is effective and that pure cbd just doesn't work and that might be true for them it's certainly not true for everyone the good thing about full spectrums is that you typically need a fraction of the amount in milligrams that you would need from a broad spectrum or cbd oil from isolate the cons some people are very sensitive to thc research shows that those high effects like you would get from marijuana those can start as low as 2 milligrams of thc but i think the sedation mental slowness may start at much lower doses maybe one milligram of thc there are just too many people who complain about this from certain hemp products with more thc and a lot of hemp products have over one milligram or over two milligrams of thc per dose so some people don't like thc some people have other reasons including drug tests a big downside to full spectrums is that you need to try a few brands because they come with different strains from different strains and one might have the cannabinoid combination that's right for you i show common cannabinoids that my lab tests for on every review and people find it very helpful to find similar products but there's always that level of uncertainty where we don't know which cannabinoid combination is going to help you specifically oh and full spectrums they keep the terpenes now that's a good thing but that's where the flavor is and hemp taste naturally earthy and nasty so most hemp extracts taste accordingly nasty but there are exceptions okay moving on to broad spectrum this is my least favorite category cbd no thc and yes i put on other can modes but i should really say most of the time trace levels that are so low that they make no difference and many times no other cannabinoids at all okay here's an example here's a big brand found in big stores it's labeled broad spectrum you can see that there are no other cannabinoids just cbd maybe a little cbdv very very common so many companies lie about broad spectrums well i'm getting ahead of myself here the pros we'll start with that first it's for people who don't want thc but they want other cannabinoids they are a little cheaper than full spectrums and they usually taste better because they remove a lot of the terpenes that's the pros back to the bad no thc benefits okay we knew that even if you have a real broad spectrum they usually contain so few cannabinoids that it doesn't matter you could compare it to the full spectrums that i've tested but why bother most broad spectrums have trace levels that really won't make a difference you can also look at the price per milligram of other cannabinoids and you'll see that broad spectrums on any given broad spectrum product you're paying so much that it's not worth it for those extra cannabinoids over a cbdi slit again this is the most abused term in the cbd industry so good luck if it has any other cannabinoids at all and here is the worst part a big reason why people obviously take a product a broad spectrum product without thc is so they can pass a drug test that looks for thc but broad spectrums have other cannabinoids that could potentially trigger a false positive on a drug test a recent study found that cbn a common cannabinoid that we test for can trigger a failed drug test what other cannabinoids will also in addition to cbn who knows there's not enough research on any of these cannabinoids and then in addition to those other cannabinoids possibly making you trigger a drug test thc is more likely to slip by in broad spectrum extracts because it's difficult to remove the thc and keep all of those other cannabinoids and nutrients at the same time if you take drug test i wouldn't recommend broad spectrums okay cbd oil from cbd isolate just cbd no thc no other cannabinoids pros there's a lot of positive research on cbd lots of user testimonials you don't need to worry about thc and all of its problems and that might be why so many people love cbd just pure cbds if they don't feel well with thc if thc causes the sedation a pure cbd product can give you some relief while still feeling sharp and good cbd isolate is cheap it's 25 cheaper than full spectrums according to my 2020 cbd oils analysis cbd has no taste so products can taste great some taste horrible for some reason and that still baffles me that they can take something with no flavor at all and make it taste horrible but that's besides the point a lot of them taste good they should taste good okay and cbd isolate removes all of the toxins found in the natural hemp plant the hemp plant absorbs things like lead and pesticides just like any fruit or vegetable my labs have found that cbd oils that test accurately for cannabinoid levels almost never have this issue with the toxins because accurate cannabinoid testing requires a lot of work but there are many products that have inaccurate levels of cannabinoids and they also end up having toxins so cbd isolate is isolated from all of those problems the cons obviously you're not getting all the other cannabinoids and thc the benefits that come with those the entourage effect you typically need higher doses than a full spectrum as well there are still a few risks you should know about as far as drug testing goes there is a faulty drug test that can't tell the difference between thc and cbd hopefully they stopped using that after a big piece in the new york times came out and addressed that issue there's also drug field tests that can't tell the difference between cbd and thc products many people have been arrested and then the labs end up showing it's just cbd and not a marijuana product now that hemp is federally legal that shouldn't be a problem but keep that in mind when you're traveling where marijuana is illegal that cbd products can be mistaken for marijuana so what's the best type of cbd out of the three categories that we mentioned here it's the one whichever one makes you feel best if you can handle a full spectrum a potent full spectrum hemp extract that's great you might need to try a few to get there you might feel best with the pure cbd you might sleep better with a full spectrum and then enjoy a cbd isolate during the day while you work you really get just got to try a few out thanks for watching check out cbdxamen.com to see what's in your favorite cbd products i

Hi, I am Matt and welcome to another CuredByNature\nepisode - CBD Frequently Asked Questions. After such a long time of cannabis stigma,\nthe truth is finally out. Cannabis is very good for the human body. Most of the people know about THC - the cannabinoid\nIn the cannabis plant that gets you high, right? One other cannabis component has been massively\nresearched for the past 30+ years, because of its health benefits. And that\u2019s CBD or Cannabidiol. And since CBD does not get you high or in\nother words, it\u2019s not psychoactive the way THC is,.. and because US president Trump signed\nthe new Farm Bill in December 2018, you can buy CBD products almost anywhere these days. From local health shops to different online\nshops. And believe it or not, the majority of the\npeople prefer not to be stoned or high all the time. That makes CBD products ideal cannabis products. You get the benefits of cannabis but without\nthe high. Now back to the subject\u2026 Full Spectrum CBD vs CBD Isolate\nIf you\u2019ve done just a little bit of research you know there\u2019s basically 2 kinds of CBD\nproducts. Products made with Full Spectrum CBD\nand Products made with CBD isolate. First the Full Spectrum CBD\nIt\u2019s also called Full Spectrum CBD Extract,... or Whole-plant CBD extract or FECO that stands\nfor Full Extract Cannabis Oil. It includes all of the cannabinoids found\nin the cannabis plant and also includes all the other components that get extracted out\nof cannabis flowers in the process. These other components are terpenes, waxes,\nhealthy fatty acids and chlorophyll. And you know what,... there are other components\nin the cannabis plant that get extracted in the process that we are not even aware of. But that\u2019s a story for another time. So when we say \u201cfull-spectrum,\u201d we\u2019re\nreferring to a naturally extracted spectrum rather than a constructed spectrum. Now let\u2019s talk about the CBD isolate:\nCBD isolate is just CBD. It\u2019s just cannabidiol molecule isolated\nor separated from other cannabis compounds in the plant. Now to the big question:\nWhat to choose - Full Spectrum CBD or CBD Isolate There are studies that give scientific proof\nthat Full Spectrum CBD that also includes low amounts of THC plus other cannabinoids,\nterpenes, etc. produce what is known as an Entourage Effect. The synergistic relationship between all of\nthe cannabis components has been shown to increase the healing properties of each. But when it comes to CBD isolate,... even\nthough it\u2019s fairly unlikely that you would fail a drug test or experience a form of \u201chigh\u201d\nbecause of the low amounts of the THC in those Full Spectrum CBD products,... some people\nprefer to be on the safe side. So now you have the information you need to\ndecide... CBD Isolate vs Full Spectrum CBD My suggestion is always Full Spectrum CBD. Why? Well, when it comes to health I don\u2019t think\nwe should hold back. This is a natural medicine and it just doesn\u2019t make any sense not to get the full benefit out of it.

Gupta I can give you medical advice or supplemental health advice but the differences are is full spectrum and isolate based the next large difference is is where the gummies are infused or whether they are coated some people use these terms not properly because they think that if it's infused with CBD that it is just CBD is on there so there's two ways of getting CBD within the gummies you can either coat them or you can actually infuse them to where it's like I like to compare to donut so I mean who doesn't love donuts coated gummy is like a glazed doughnut sort of flavoring and stuff it's put on the top and that's how those gummies are made is that they're made and they are basically sprayed or soaked with the CBD solutions and they get absorbed into the gummy and they're on the outside to infuse gummies they're more like a jelly doughnut to where the solution is on the inside the oil is on the inside and they've been either injected or it's been formulated into the actual compound of manufacturing the gelatin or the building block of the gummies so that is another key difference and between that people say were some of pluses and minuses pluses and minuses are as generally the ones that are coded on the outside those are generally less expensive so they're more budget-friendly however the ones are injected are usually a little bit more consistent so if you're buying a jar of 1500 milligram coated gummies some gummies might be a little bit stronger than the other depending on how they record or if they're touching the edges of the jar and some of the CBD mighta came off and beyond the jar so you might have to take one two more of the coded gummies - whereas some of them might be a little bit stronger so they kind of average out but if you're looking for super consistency then you want the infused got me the jelly donut because that is basically an exact amount that they put into the gummy so now with these examples let's go into you know what different types of gummies there are so outside of the full spectrum and isolate gummies and the coated and infused gummies now you have gummies in the categories of even flavoring so here we have our CBD Gold Line let's take a look at this half of the product line right here so here is basically our offering of CBD Gold Line now these are actually all isolate based gummies so these will have absolutely no traces of THC they have they have basically a total amount of milligrams that you will get per jar and we recommend that you take two to three gummies per serving so we have different textures for gummies our first one here is going to be our sour gummy which is going to be like I said these ones are an isolate based so they're gonna be the zero TAC you're gonna go ahead and open it here so these are gonna be like sour flavored gummies and they are coated with our Goldline CBD solution very clean job of openness let's get close-ups here you get several different colors and these are gonna be more sour and taste you're also gonna have a little outside sugar coating for a little bit of a little bit of extra flavor let's go ahead and take one out and get a real nice close-up if you're into the sour taste not just kind of a plain fruity taste this will definitely be up your Avenue and also sometimes the sour taste can offset any taste within to come with the CBD oils so even when you're dealing with full spectrum gummies and things like that if you have a sour bass gummy it can offset any type of you say I don't like the taste of natural CBD oil there's CBD solutions then a sour gummy might be or a sugar-coated gummy might be a good alternative for you to offset some of that taste so you get a more pleasant experience of Wired having your CBD then you have your natural gummy which is basically plain fruity flavor a lot of companies just in making gummies that aren't CBD infused make very similar gummies that your the taste will be familiar from any of the Albanese gummies and things that you can get from the supermarket except they have the added CBD and these have been coated not infused and they use isolates they have zero THC every once a while different isolate gummies have different solutions every once in a while you might get some type of you might think it's sugar it's crystal but actually the CBD isolates come in the form of CBD crystals so every once awhile it might not be uncommon to see crystals on the gummies it might not have gotten fully absorbed into the gummy or that might be on the outside when the CBDs are a hundred percent pure that they're like isolates it's not uncommon to see some crystals I don't see any on this gummy so everything was good but these are generally big fruity flavored gummies so they're there Jim a little bit more fluffy they have the fruity taste these aren't gonna be the sour gummies so let's go ahead and put this back and move along so on Goldline CBD we generally sell the gummies in two sizes we have a 12 ounce and an 8 ounce and also some smaller assortments generally it's you know more value driven to buy more but we have all the way down to I think 10 or 20 pack that you can buy or even a 5 pack that you can purchase on the website just a sample the gummy to see if you like it and then once you're a go we do all kinds of bundles and you can go up to 12 ounce which contains I think about a hundred and twenty gummies so here we did a limited run for the holiday season these are of our holiday gummies on top of being the large fluffier gummies and being you know of holiday colors which is a red white and green over here these are actually uh flavored also so they're gonna have the different a little bit more added fruity flavor into them so it is a little bit more of a premium gummy than your standard base gummy bears that uh that are used so it's gonna be a little bit of an upgrade but you're not gonna get any of the sour taste so you know what a lot of people and a lot of companies even outside of ours will do is they'll use different types of flavored gummies as their base so you can kind of know what gummy bears from going to the supermarket that you like or what type of tools you like when you're selecting your ideal CBD gummy and I hope it's a gold line but in the event that it's not look for that too when you're on the hunt for buying your gummies let's go a little close-up of these guys so you can see we have the red green and white give me a thumbs up that you got a good focus and other gummies so there you see we have the nicest Ortman they're a little bit fluffier in texture and they also have the added flavor infusion so you're gonna have a very flavorful experience with these holiday gummies and they're still available on our website I think for the whole month of January we continued producing them and once that goes away we'll probably still offer these gummies but they're not going to be holiday oriented maybe some Valentine's Day gummies so now moving right along to our full spectrum gummies these use a high quality of full spectrum oil and on top of that they are actually infused so they are injected into the gummy so each time you get a gummy these that we have here available in four flavors you're gonna get a very consistent 10 milligrams of CBD in each gummy now we used to offer a 25 milligram full spectrum going but a lot of people especially when it comes to full spectrum you can actually taste the CBD oil so taste a little bit more like a medical gummy so there's different things that you have to do to the gummy to offset the taste some people are really into it like the Colorado and California style gummies and that's kind of what it tastes like and some people would rather just have you know a flavorful experience as well so what we did was we realized is that instead of offering a 25 milligram gummy let's kick it down to a 10 so some of the oil taste is not as prevalent and we also have poor flavor so we flavor and fuse the gummies on top of it so let's go ahead and get a close-up of what's available here so we have cherry flavor fruit punch and also strawberry and an orange citrus I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to lay each one of these out here on the table so you can see they're actually fruit shaped and the different flavor is actually indicated by the different color these are really nice gummy very high qualities of very high quality full spectrum oil and they are also quality infused so you have very consistent flavoring taste and CBD oil quantity in between each one of these gummies and again like I said you can get them available in the four different flavors yeah so like we said these will actually be below the point three legal limit for according to the the hemp farm bill passed in 2018 so these are in accordance with that however they might have little traces of THC within the legal hemp limits but they're there is that there is that so people who don't want to roll the dice to get you know drug tested and things like that then generally you want to stick with the isolate based product because there is zero THC in there whatsoever those could be within the legal limits see would be fine and it's still very very small almost non-traceable but we do have to put that out there for you guys then there's also gummies that we're developing that are almost like gushers to where there are very soft and heavily infused with flavor so it's kind of like they melt in your mouth and then they have the the the flavor follows up afterwards and rolls them so it's different from kind of a chewable gummy this is this is an extremely soft chew if we could even classify that but I would say it to a gusher and we have them infused I just want to go ahead and show these because some companies I've seen are doing it we're gonna start offering it but we have not yet so these are in the shape of bear but they're extremely soft very fluffy and almost melts I even feel bad putting them putting them out here but they are and they are actually they're full-spectrum and they're infused we have some of these samples are 25 milligrams all the way down to 10 but you can see that these are more than fusion style soft to customized gummies tour these these gummy bases are actually custom made to really melt so these ones are gonna be more like a gusher and generally you can tell from how fluffy and how soft they look and if you get a real good close-up there you can you can see the difference between that and even a fluffy standard gummy you know so again those would be full-spectrum and infused and then for those people who are looking for positive hemp benefits possibly a multivitamin I've also seen we don't currently offer them but hemp will extract gummy chews that you can see here these actually have hemp oil they're CBD content isn't really confirmed but it does have 20 milligrams of a hemp extract and it's also infused with like a multivitamin tour it has like your vaults a mitten or a vitamin b-complex and also your vitamin C's and different vitamin E so if you're just looking for like a nutritional supplement and don't necessarily want CBD we don't offer it but these are starting to get really popular within the hemp community and something you probably will come across most of these because they also have the multivitamin they're not going to be coated they're gonna be infused so they are gonna be very consistent to take on a daily basis you won't each one is gonna be very consistent to the other and again sometimes with the coated stuff some of them might be a little bit strong and others but generally averaged out pretty good so in summary I hope that today's

a special product that i want to share with you all we've been getting a lot of questions about this here at the shop and i figured a million of you out there will probably curious about it as well we're gonna talk about the hemp green leaf CBD product is Nick come on in guys all right everybody let's dive straight into these products here so we're doing two review today on the green leaf hemp oils here okay there's no difference between heavy oil or CBD oil it technically means the same thing I just think it's slinking purposes okay I mean this really we're gonna tackle three things today it's gonna be the difference between isolates and and full-spectrum hot into how to divide into your dosages how to actually dose your dosages properly okay in a different basis that they offer widows VG base or water base or even PG base okay how they're all used alright so the first thing we're the tackle is isolating and full-spectrum here you can see on these bottles it says isolates and in the red labels as a full spectrum what is the difference difference is full spectral I mean isolate means pure CBD it's been through an additional process to remove all the other cannabinoids okay all the other like THC and all that jazz and it's only just pure CBDs okay I generally always ask people before selling it here do you know does your job test and and if they do go with the isolates do any pop up tez or any drug test in that nature always use the isolates it's gonna be safest when it comes to you know just in case you get that even though in California or whatever state you're at the legal limit is 0.03 percent out here in California if you take the full spectrum and you take enough of it you might store you know your fat cells might hold enough THC where you get pop of the test so just on the safest side isolate means pure CBD there shouldn't be any THC at all okay now full spectrum means all cannabinoids from from the plant okay now like I said the legal limit in CBD here that's not sold and any collectives or dispensary is supposed to be 0.03 percent why did why don't you some people hear that it's better to take THC with a little bit of THC with your CBDs okay because they do work in conjunction somehow now CBD here doesn't have any THC in it I've taken this before I feel like it's about the same I mean such a low low dosage of THC may not make a massive difference or I mean very little difference at all because it's 0.03 percent member is not 0.3% its 0.03 percent okay how do we dose this the best way to dosage dose this CBD here is now generally always tell people 15 milligrams is kind of like the dosage where you can feel the CBD enough for you to feel the relaxation okay if you take CBD and a compound dosage you actually can feel the CBD working through your nervous system okay so it's much more relaxed as much more body of foreign but if you take it in a low dosage look for instance let's just say you take under 10 milligrams per dosage it's probably like a dietary supplement you may not feel it most likely you won't depending how sensitive your bothering body is depending which a tolerant level is okay everyone's body tone is a little bit different but generally under about ten milligrams you may not feel the CBD at all okay so that's how I generally tell people how much they take now how do you actually know how much to take let's just say you're trying to achieve a 15 milligram per sitting okay number one you get the bottle shake up really well obviously - you can look at how much milliliter this bottle is okay by volume this here is a 30 milliliters so you take 30 milliliters divided by the milligram by volume this is 750 milligram by the volume by the bottle okay so I think the math comes out to 25 mgs okay now in in the 30 milliliter bottle each squeeze of the dropper the entire dropper if you pump one full dropper into you know your cup or your directly under your mouth it's actually a 1 milliliter per vial per pump okay not per drop per pump okay that means I squeeze I'm squeezing and let go one full vial take it out squeeze it into the cup that is one milliliter verse and now now if you remember this bottle is thirty milliliter that means you have thirty pumps here okay that means each pump is a total of 25 milligrams I don't know if I made that clear but you take the number from the milliliter of the bottle divided by how many milligrams the volume of the bottle that will give you the milligrams per one squeeze which is one milliliter okay that's how you do the math for anything whether it's a thousand so I take a thousand divided by thirty which gives me thirty-three point three three mgs per pump okay that's one milliliter thirty three point three three mg milligram per vial per squeeze okay now if pretend this was 33 and you want to drop it down the half obviously you would squeeze half the vial that'll give you 15 point three three or fifteen point something all right so that's how we're able to dosage dosage how much milligram you're getting per content so somebody like me I have lower tolerance I take 15 milligrams I am all good alright I feel it any more than that you might get a little more nosh not nauseous sorry a little more tired a little more relaxed a lot more extra relaxed depending on your your your body weight to the fat ratio okay you like I said there's a talk there's a self learning curve between you and and the product I would start off with 10 to 15 milligrams see how you like it if you want more in the next usage you just you know throw in an extra full squeeze or one and a half squeeze okay however you come figure this out now the different basis of your CBDs here now we're talking specifically bottles dropper bottles here okay there's three types of bases here there's water base which is the one I'm holding right here okay there's PG which is propylene glycol base okay Andrews VG orders actually PG VG alright the water base and the water base and the VG base and the PG base you can actually directly do sublingual under your tongue or your foods or drink okay now the PG VG is all if you if you want to vape these oils in your vape pen okay they have to be a PG or VG base or both is okay PG VG or PG PG alone or VG alone you have to make sure you use a propylene or VG base not water base okay if I take this water base here and drop it into your CBD tanks or your slim tanks and you run that you're gonna get a lot of leakage because remember the solution is so much thinner just gonna seep right through the Cotton's out the breather hose it's gonna get all over your pants or your duffel bag or your backpack wherever you have it it's gonna leak right out okay so I don't recommend putting water base into your tanks only PG or VG base here okay I believe that's it if you guys have any questions comment below we'll get that we'll get back to you guys there if you guys have been using these products you have your suggestions for the audience for this community we're always learning about this stuff this is such a new industry we're still learning here we're trying to teach what we we come across here most of the time please share it with all the communities of CBD users and until next time if you guys like this video please give it a thumbs up and we'll talk to you guys next time have a great day [Music] [Music]", "WMNFyC15q-Q": "hey y'all it's Cody from sleep populace and in this video I'm going to introduce you to my favorite CBD products for sleep now a lot of CBD goodies in the market promise to help folks slumber but in my opinion these four are the absolute best now what are they well you'll just have to keep on watching to find out all right first things first let's chat a little bit about what CBD is now if you haven't checked it out yet I highly recommend that you take a peek am i what is CBD video which I'm gonna put right there I think yeah and it goes over what CVD is how it feels the research that's been done into its side effects dosage all things like that basically like it's a full rundown of CBD as a compound but in case you don't have time right now or simply don't want to watch it I will give you a little bit of a breakdown right now but what CBD is so CBD or cannabidiol is a compound found on the flower of the cannabis plant it's one of more than a hundred different compounds or phyto cannabinoids contained on the flower and they range and feel and type but the two most popular ones are probably CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol or THC however unlike THC CBD is not psychoactive and it doesn't trigger hallucinations or intoxication it's usually used in oils creams and pills to treat things like joint pain anxiety poor appetite and even poor sleep I should also mention that it's totally legal to buy and consume hemp derived CBD in all 50 states as long as the product doesn't contain more than 0.3 percent of THC alright now that we've gone over a little bit about what CBD is let's get into my picks for the best CBD products we're falling asleep and I want to start with my absolute favorite CBD product for spalling asleep fast which is the CBD PM tincture from CBD MD now this little baby contains both CBD and melatonin so it is literally designed to send you off to snooze town in a flash and when I tried it myself I found that it pretty much did that within five to ten minutes of taking it I felt totally relaxed and like I was drifting off to Dreamland with ease another thing I liked about this tincture was that I didn't really experience any next state grogginess which is pretty unusual for a melatonin based product so if you're looking to fall asleep super fast and need to get up and go the next day I think this could be a great product for you another good thing about it is that a 500 milligram bottle of the tincture only costs $45 which is pretty affordable when you compare it to other see many products on the market next up is what I find to be the most relaxing CBD oil and that's the American hemp oil from American hemp and I say most relaxing because I found that this oil had a really nice sort of like calming effect all across the body within 15 minutes of taking it I felt like tension in my shoulders was being alleviated my mind was quieted and so it helped me to fall asleep at night for sure but I also found that it was really just nice for lounging around the house reading a book watching TV and when compared to other products that I've tested I found that the effects lasted for a longer time around an hour and an hour and a half so if you're looking for a subtle CBD oil that'll sort of carry you through an afternoon or maybe carry you through your bedroom time routine I would highly recommend this one as I found to be very relaxing however it's like caveat is that a 2,500 milligram bottle of American hemp oil retails for $140 which makes it one of the more expensive ones I've tested next I want to share my favorite CBD oil for general use and that's the CBD premium oil from CBD MD now you'll recognize the brand from the first one I shared with you all for falling asleep fast but this one is different in that there is no melatonin here it is all CBD oil and I like it for general use because it helps me fall asleep at night but I also found that it had a really nice subtle relaxing effect during the day you know if it was like a weekend day and I was just hanging out I could take it go see friends go to the gym you know do errands and I found that it was just a really nice Zen tone I was highly recommended for general use and something else I really like about this oil is that you can choose your flavor so you go on the website and they have like four or five different options so you can choose the flavor that's best for you and something else I like about it is that a seven hundred milligram bottle of the CBD premium oil from CBD MD regionals for seventy dollars which puts it in a nice mid range between the least expensive ones the most expensive ones and finally my absolute favorite value buy has got to be the CBD oil from some soil now here as 600 milligram bottle retails for $30 and a 1200 milligram one retails for $60 so it's definitely more in a budget friendly zone for those of you who want to try CBD but maybe we don't want to fork over more than $100 to try it and even though it's less expensive than some of the option other options on this list I'd say that it's just as good it helps me to fall asleep fast and it made me feel really relaxed during the day so I think it's a great option the only thing I really don't like about the CBD oil from Sun soil are the flavor options and either comes in chocolate mint or cinnamon and personally those just aren't tastes that I like well folks that does it for my guide the best CBD products for sleep for more sleep related content and resources make sure to go to sleep obelisk calm and is subscribe to our YouTube channel until next time happy dreaming", "INVzvJHc2PA": "hello everybody and welcome back to the channel in today's video we are going to be making cbd oil with a crock pot but before we get into today's video folks if you wouldn't mind if you're new here to the channel please consider subscribing and for those of you that have already subscribed thank you so much i really do appreciate all the support and if you all wouldn't mind please give this video a big thumbs up okay folks so you may or may not know but our farm is solely dependent on our sale of hemp flour and that's what we're going to be using today our hemp flour now if you guys are interested in cbd hemp flour to make your own cbd oil go ahead and check out the link in the description below also go ahead and check out this link up top okay so first and foremost we're going to need cbd flour to make cbd oil you will find an array of options on our website if you're purchasing from us you'll see large flour or regular flour you'll see small flowers you'll see trim and some other odds and ends on there as well but today we're going to be using regular sized hemp flour the variety that we're going to be using is biox which is our most popular flower which is my personal favorite but there's also cherry wine on there i'll sweeten it a bunch of others that are all great as well it really depends on what you're looking for um but today we're going to be using biox and that's probably our most potent flower as well and that really depends on your potency level also and the same thing goes with trim versus small flowers there's a whole bunch of different potencies if you guys have questions go ahead and email me i'll be absolutely happy to answer any and all questions that you guys have about the hemp flour okay so we're going to need some stuff to make cbd oil with a crock pot unlike using an expensive machine like the magical butter machine you're going to need some other kitchen gadgets in order to make cbd oil correctly at home with a crock pot and so first and foremost we need a carrier oil now this is obviously you use this for a magical butter machine or any other machine we're going to use mct oil today other popular carrier oils are hemp oil and olive oil i really don't like olive oil that's just my personal preference i do love mctl it's the best carrier oil of all of them but if you're looking for a little added flavor hemp oil if you can find it is really good as well but today we're going to be using mct oil and the reason why coconut oil and other oils aren't in this is well coconut oil will be solid at room temperature so that's not good for cbd oil and other ones don't have the necessary fats to be a superior carrier oil and you really need that absorption rate to be high especially for a crock pot okay obviously next you will need a crock pot um these are relatively inexpensive you can get them for like 15 online you don't need a large one uh your batches are going to be anywhere between one to two cups of oil and one to two ounces of flour so really you don't need a large crock pot a three to six quart crock pot is plenty um another thing you will need is something to decarb with now we're going to use our magical butter d card box i love it there's no point in using a pyrex dish if i have this but you can use a pyrex dish with a cover that works as well and this will be one of the first steps we do here as we make our cbd oil the next thing you definitely need is going to be a filter of some sort some people use a cheese cloth um i don't i've never used that i've always used the magical butter filters you can get this pack on their website or you can get any type of micron filter i believe it has to be 150 or more um that's just what we use uh you can go more or less probably depending on the amount of plant material that's going to go through or how many times you actually want to sift through it this package also comes with a silicone glove i really like using that too especially when we're squeezing out the oil but that's going to be later on in the video now this part isn't necessary um to use i'm going to show you how to get around this but a lot of people will use this to cut up or grind up their flower a nutribullet or a magic bullet of anything like this to cut up the flower pre-decarb but i'm going to teach you a trick today on how you can avoid that it takes a little time but there's a trick now if you buy your hem flower from us it's going to come in a package exactly like this this is a pre-packaged um one ounce pre-packaged from us and what we'll do is we're gonna throw this in the freezer for four to six hours and what that does is it makes the hemp fiber very brittle and once it's brittle you can scrunch it all up in the bag and boom you don't have to use a grinder to cut up a flower we've already done that process and here we go here is our scrunched up flower and a ziploc now you don't have to use the bag if you if you're not purchasing from us use a ziploc same exact method in there for four to six hours scrunch it up and we're good to go so we've already done this step i'm not going to time lapse it or anything like that you will need to cut it up one way or another whether it's the bullet or it's through uh freezing it so let's dive into making cb duo with your crock pot here at home and get into the next step okay folks let's get into making cbd oil with our crock pot here we have already measured out a cup of mct oil so we're going to get that in the crock pot now to get it warmed up this process doesn't take very long but this is going to be the first thing you're going to want to do is measure out your oil and get it into the crock pot we're going to put it on low and we're just going to let it sit all right we're going to move this off to the side here for a minute next thing we're going to do is we are going to use our magic butter d card box again you can use a pyrex dish as long as it has a cover or any other baking dish as long as it has a cover now what you're going to be doing is you're going to be de-carving so get your oven preheated to 250 degrees 250 all right so we're going to preheat our oven right now again 250 uh preheat and then once we put this stuff in there it's going to be going in for 30 minutes now again you're either going to this step you're going to be blending your hemp flour which i just don't like making a mess so that's really just not what i want to do but this is an option you can do that get that you take your um your shredded up flour whether you use the magic bullet or you use the freezer method like we did and you're just going to pour it in to your d carb box whether that's the pyrex or this particular box you're gonna make sure that it's nice and even you're gonna cover it and we're gonna throw it into the oven for about a half an hour once it's preheated to 250 degrees so that's what we're going to flash forward to next and then we'll start getting into making the cbd oil okay folks so let me move this out of the way here real quick all right so we have done we are done with the d-carb process again 250 degrees for 30 minutes and there is your nice fresh ground uh cbd hem flower so now we're ready to go um but before we dive into putting it into crop i want to make sure that this isn't the end-all be-all recipe so we used one cup of mct oil for one ounce of hemp flour you can use two cups you can use less flour you can use more flour it really depends on what you want but i'm going to stand by one cup per one ounce if you want to go less you know you can use 14 grams of flour per cup i really don't recommend anything less than that because i don't think you'll get a good experience with cbd i just don't think the potency will be there for you the other thing about the crock pot too it's not nearly as efficient as the magic butter machine so this is going to be a process it is going to be in the crock pot for four to eight hours really depends on when you're ready the longer it has to be in there to cook into the oil the more chance of a higher absorption rate so just remember that as well and again guys you can find all this stuff on our website or feel free to leave a comment or email me and you can find us on facebook and instagram as well if you need to get in touch with me through there okay so let's go ahead and get this going into the crock pot now remember we put this on low already the oil is already nice and warm we have our ounce of ground flour here and we're going to go ahead and dump it right into the crock pot okay so now that that's done we're just gonna move around the flower and we're going to let it cook down [Music] and that's really all we're doing now we're going to let this cook down absorb all into the oil we're gonna cover it again you can use more oil or or i wouldn't use anything less than a cup of oil but you can use more oil like two cups we're just doing a very small batch for the video but as you can see it's already starting to go right into the oil so now we're going to check it about every hour on low so we'll see in another hour and then we're going to repeat that for probably six hours for this particular batch so that is how we get started making our cbd hemp oil in a crock pot okay folks we have let this go for about eight hours i lost kind of track of time and we've been stirring about every hour and this is what it looks like right now very liquidy you know all broken down and that's what you want to look like again you got to go for the longer cook with the crock pot i know with the magic butter machine it's four hours but you're really safe with an eight hour on low cook um of course the setting is low for the crock pot so now what we're going to do is we're going to get our strainer again this is something you're going to have to purchase in order to make cbd oil and then we're going to get some gloves and we're going to slowly pour this into the strainer all right so here we go again it's a balancing act with the strainer just got to take your time get this out of the way here you're just going to let it all go into the strainer there kind of write it up a little bit now again we only did a cup of oil very small batch and what you can do now is get all the plant material in there much as you want because what you're going to do now is once it's in the strainer you can squeeze every last bit of oil out of the flour because the flour does absorb some of the oil okay now one of the things that you get with the magical butter kit uh when it comes to buying these strainers is they give you the silicone glove it's pretty important because it helps you squeeze out all the [Applause] oil all right that's about all you can have with that and then you can put it in your container whatever you desire whether it's a droplet bottle a mason jar but this is the finished product this is your cbd oil and you made it with a crock pot so that's really it for today's video guys if you have any questions feel free to comment in the video uh or you can reach us um via facebook or instagram or email if you guys are interested in the hemp flower that we use today go ahead and check out our website link in the description below but that is all i have for you guys today i hope you enjoyed the video hope you all stay happy healthy and i'll see you in another video", "0FK_KCia8QU": "hello everyone welcome to

everybody Jim here I hope you guys are all having a good day wanted to make a video today and talk a little bit about the different terms that people use in the industry and in the CBD community to differentiate between the different types of active CBD that that's you that are used that's being used in all the products that were selling and consuming mainly the difference between isolate broad spectrum and full-spectrum CBD oil I've created a little video graphic a little video yakety I guess you call it a video graphic to explain and kind of help me explain the differences so you guys can understand it really easily before we get into that really quick I just want to let you know that in the research that I did to prepare for this video I talked with a few different companies that extract haven't been turned it into concentrates and basically what I've noticed is they're either very willing to share their information and talk openly about what they're doing they or on the on the other hand they are completely full of [ __ ] and you can tell they're bullshitting mean trying to make themselves seem larger than they are and then you have the the third group of people that I talked to and again kind of biessing a little bit but more so to protect their their proprietary technique or they're a little bit more suspicious of why I'm asking so they the information they gave was rather vague so we're gonna keep this this video very high-level we're not going to deep dive into the the exact nuances that go into extracting CBD from hemp but we are going to talk about just kind of the basics and and break it down in a way that's very easy to understand and hopefully by the end of this video everybody will have a clear understanding of what isolate is what broad-spectrum CBD oil is and what full-spectrum CBD oil is so let's jump into my computer and check it out okay so we are now in my computer we're calling this the over-the-shoulder cam from time to time we're gonna jump into my computer like this it just makes it a little bit easier for me to explain things when you can see exactly what I'm seeing when it comes to making CBD extracts for the most part all of the companies out there are using hemp you have a small handful of companies that are using low THC marijuana but that's not what we're talking here we're talking about hemp based CBD extracts and how they're made so what what happens is the extraction companies they start with hemp whether it's PCR hemp which is vital cannabinoid rich hemp or industrial hemp the difference between those two is a topic that we will cover in a future video for the sake of this video we're just going to call it hemp and they take their hemp and they run it through an extraction process so that means they're taking all of the plant material all of the hemp material after it's been harvested they're putting it into an extraction machine they're running a solvent through all of that material whether it's co2 ether something like that some sort of non-volatile solvent and what comes out on the other end of that machine is crude crude a CBD crude oil is very similar in texture and in looks to motor oil it's literally very very dark it the smell is very strong the flavor is very bitter and while it is very high in all of the compounds and cannabinoids that everybody craves and is in is seeking it's not very consumer friendly just because it's so bitter it's so strong and it's so ugly so what people do or what companies do is they take that that crude and they refine it even further than they put it through the distillation process and in doing so there's going to be some minor changes chemical on a chemical level and on a molecular level I guess you could say you're gonna have on the the CBD a convert to CBD and what happens is you end up with a product that is much more consumer friendly it tastes better it looks better and overall just works better and that's what we know as full-spectrum CBD distillate now when I'm talking about a full spectrum product or full spectrum CBD oil or distillate I'm referring to a product that contains everything including th see all of the cannabinoids all of the compounds the flavonoids and the oils vitamins everything including THC that's what i'm talking about when i when I'm using the term full-spectrum CBD distillate and the full-spectrum distillate it's used a few different ways the most common way that people are using the full-spectrum product is to create new and other products they're using it as the active ingredient in the gummies they're tinctures dog treats anything that you see on the market that is being labeled or being marketed as a full-spectrum product more than likely or most likely or what should be happening is the the CBD being used to create that product is coming from a full spectrum CBD distillate now another way that full-spectrum CBD distillate is being used is to create broad-spectrum distillate broad spectrum CBD distillate is full-spectrum CBD distillate with the THC removed there is an entire segment of the consumer market out there that's very interested in trying and using CBD products but for whatever reason whether it's they're an athlete maybe it's a job issue whatever they are not interested or had they have no interest at all in consuming THC so what's happening what's being done is the full-spectrum distillate is being refined even one step further they're pulling out the THC they're creating the broad spectrum CBD distillate and then that broad spectrum product is used to create other gummies tinctures dog treats etc and the third way that full-spectrum CBD distillate is used is to create CBD isolate the CBD I slit is exactly what it sounds like it's the CBD molecule that's been isolated and extracted on its own it's it comes in the form of a white powder there's very little flavor very little smell and it's a very useful product in that it can be easily incorporated into just about any type of product or recipe that you could think of the downside is many people think that because isolate doesn't contain any of the other cannabinoids or pretty much anything else found in the hemp plant that it's not going to be as beneficial it's not going to work as effectively as maybe a broad spectrum or a full spectrum product but for the most part you know people are taking that CBD isolate they're using it to to create all of the same exact same type of product that people are creating using the broad spectrum and the full-spectrum distillates but what the main difference being there's there's nothing else in those products except CBD there's no other beneficial cannabinoids or calm at all so I hope this this little graphic this video has been helpful I hope this has been an easy way for you guys to understand the difference between isolate full spectrum and broad spectrum we're gonna go ahead and jump back out of my computer get back into the office and wrap things up okay I hope that little video graphic helped you guys understand the difference is a little bit better between isolate broad spectrum and full spectrum I know that there is more to it there's more nuance to the extraction process than I described I get it I just wasn't trying to make this some big drawn-out 45-minute video we'll cover that in detail a little bit better in a future video if you're an extract or out there you don't need to message me and tell me that I should have done a better job covering decarboxylation and the conversion from cbda to CBD I get it and we will definitely cover it like I said I was just trying to keep this kind of high level provide enough information so that you guys can make better decisions when it comes to the products that you're buying and asked you know they're just the right questions you know when you ask a manufacturer of a product what kind of CBD is in this and they tell you it's broad spectrum or it's full spectrum or it's isolated you should know what that means so if you guys have any questions any comments or any complaints use the comment section below and I will see you guys in the next video peace", "KIW4kQtqwtg": "hi jim higdon again out here in the hemp field answering your hemp questions one big question we get a lot is what does full spectrum mean what is full spectrum cbd oil how is it different from broad spectrum i'm standing here in front of one of our certified organic hemp plants growing here in central kentucky and we're going to use this plant to make our full spectrum cbd oils and that means we're going to use all the cannabinoids in their natural ratio in this plant including the thc so we make full spectrum products here at cornbread hemp and that comes from this plant with all the cannabinoids from this plant in their natural ratios that's what full spectrum means and i'm jim higdon been nice talking to you you", "Qofq6bjOlh4": "[Music] hey guys Justin Ross here with green valley Nation I'm gonna give you a quick review of CB distilleries 1000 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil CV distillery uses American grown hemp that is non GMO not certified organic but it is third-party tested in each one milliliter dose of CBD oil you get 33 milligrams of CBD which is printed clearly here on the box see if you're still earning one thousand milligrams CBD oil uses a co2 extraction method they don't add any flavors to the oil itself they do use coconut oil as a carrier so that the product tastes like coconut oil and hemp plant so if the smell or the taste of hemp is not something you enjoy that might be something that you want to consider when purchasing this product see distillery 1,000 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil comes in this individually packaged in this nice bright orange box with CBD really easy to read across the top the other thing about this package is the milligrams of CBD per dose or easy to read right here on the front as well and each box comes with a informative pamphlet kind of gives you a little information about CP distillery itself and the product and how they extract the oil and all that the other thing I like about this is the label on the bottle matches the label on the box so if you lose the box no big deal so I'm taking CV distilleries 1000 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil for about six months now I usually take between 20 and 35 milligrams at one time I started taking it to see how it would help in my chronic back and knee pain and I noticed after about 20 minutes that I had significant reduction in pain and inflammation in my lower back and my knee I also take it in the evenings before bed to help me calm down from the day so that I sleep well all through the night and I don't wake up with any pain that's an added bonus so the things I like about CP distilleries 1000 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil is that it takes away the pain after only 1/2 I can also take it before bed and it'll help me sleep all night soundly and I'll wake up without any pain in the morning the other thing is that it's easy to fit this into my monthly budget the cons are the plant light flavor and the fact that I don't feel like it's quite as strong as some of the others that are in a similar concentration so overall if you're looking for a more economical high concentrated full-spectrum CBD oil and you don't mind a little bit of a plant flavor you can't go wrong with CBS tillery's 1000 milligram full-spectrum or CBD oil my name is Judson Ross and if

is a short video on what is full spectrum Syria you have to excuse me I'm wearing some kind of Mexican blanket cvd isn't just for summers it's now cold in our basement that's why we're filming so what it's full spectrum CVD you probably heard it a lot and it's sort of rigged about as the the CBD to go for full spectrum CBD means it's got the entire range of the terpenes and plant matter when you extract from the cannabis plant now there's a number of different ways you get your sous vide one of them is a isolate which is a four pounder format which is produced from a process called to cock-block slice your bobbin got it is that properly from co2 extraction it comes into a super concentrated powder so 99% but in the process of the sort of refining it means you literally have just CBD don't really have any terpenes now CBD as a product is is tapped to be something that's very beneficial so it's not going to hurt you by not having all the other bits and bobs involved but when you look at full spectrum see mini which can be a bit more expensive its producing it's like different matters distilled oil and in the process it doesn't lose all the other additional terpenes and plant matter so when you have a full spectrum CBD it means it's got a tiny amount of THC and that's why when you hear people say I need to have a bit of THC inside of which is the stuff that gets you high but fraction also doesn't really get your high about 0.2 percent is the legal level in the UK if it has that in there as well it means it hasn't been super filtered it means it has tons of other chemicals that can be of and information benefit anticonvulsant benefit matatini you going to depression auntie auntie so I asked many people what C meaning is so there you go that's full-spectrum CBD that means it's not being isolated down so when you get a bucket you're a distillate seat mini distillate but it might be about eighty percent which is generally where the full-spectrum stuff comes from it has a load of other additional potentially therapeutic benefits compounds inside it whereas ice alert is just CBD because that means it's better than CBD ice and that we don't really know CBD is touted to be the thing that we're all looking for so CBD in a high purity format CBD I so that it's probably perfectly adequate but if you do want the entourage effect that means the potential benefit of a extra compound that can have and see fatigue effects you're going to get that with the full spectrum CBD broad spectrum being the CBD that doesn't have THC in it whatsoever it's called non-detect and how they make broad spectrum CBD compared to full spectrum is they just built it out very aggressively really angry they just filter out that takes the THC out of it but it can take out a few other elements as well so it might have a few less compounds than full spectrum there you go full spectrum broad spectrum my Mexican blanket showing them more space tada you", "Rh5O74AtSAw": "all right yeah we got to soil last year in January at at the farm show and let me tell you it's made a tremendous difference in our dog we have a large dog he's a Bernese Mountain Dog lab mix we gave him the oil and his hips are just tremendous he doesn't ache when he jumps up he jumps on the couch again because of the stairs like lightning and it's amazing the difference he's a 7 year old dog 7 year old dog so he's not old dog he's not a young dog he's just a big dog it's tough submitted it made a difference this is a real testimonial do", "ArovQOERHRA": "hey guys so I'm here to review a newer product to my schedule that I've been doing every single day for a few weeks now and it is the CBD FX CBD oil so I already have it out of the bottle here and we're out of the box I have really have been enjoying this I've been thinking about trying CBD oil for a while now just because of all the amazing benefits that it has for me specifically I wanted to try CBD because I have anxiety so I wanted to try it for the anti anxiety anxiety benefits as well as the pain relief benefits I do have a little bit of lower back pain so I've noticed that I will take this instead of if I feel the need to take like an ibuprofen or something like that I've been taking CBD instead and it has relieved my pain just as much as the over-the-counter stuff would have so I'm really enjoying it for that and other than that I don't suffer from too much chronic pain but I am just a very like tense person my shoulders and my back is always super tense for some reason I don't know it's just my nature and I've honestly noticed the difference when I take this I just feel just more relaxed it doesn't have its antipsychotic so there's no like hallucinations or psychotic effects at all with CBD it is just a compound of cannabis and it's actually one of sixty compounds in cannabis that belonged to the cannabinoid family so it is a cannabinoid and this one specifically I got is the 500 series this is the 500 milligrams and it's a 30 milliliter bottle so every dropper I use a full dropper and every dropper I think has like 16 a little over 6 ten milligrams of CBD in it and for me just starting off I've noticed that that is a good amount I don't know that I would need any more and any less I'm not sure but the 500 was kind of in the middle so that's the one that I got and it's been working for me so I'm really enjoying it other things that CBD is commonly used for is to help with sleep I know some people have a hard time either getting to sleep or staying asleep and I have a couple friends that actually use this for sleep they use it before bedtime to to kind of relax and get to sleep I've just been taking it kind of as needed each day in the middle of the day in the morning whenever I feel like my back or my shoulders really need it or if I have anxiety that's when I take it and I notice the difference for myself other uses or benefits I guess you could say for CBD is to help relieve nausea so it could may help give a little bit of relief with that and then again it has no psychotic effects so it doesn't make you feel high or like I guess I don't know paranoid if you could say because it is a hemp product and that was like one of my I guess you could say hesitations like I new CBD was good I know that it has amazing benefits but since I've never taken it before I just didn't know what to expect and I honestly I don't feel any of that so CBD has been good for me in the past few weeks I've really liked this brand CBD FX I did my research before choosing a brand and this is the one that I decided to get I love their website they have tons of information for new CBD users and other great products as well I've actually used a couple of their other products as well the lotion the CBD lotion is really really great I like using it on my shoulders and then they actually make CBD capsules so you don't have to use the tincture so mine that I have I'll just show you like it's Dropper this is my second model here so it's a dropper and you would just put it under your tongue how it's recommended to take is just dropping it under your tongue and letting it sit there for at least a minute before either swallowing or just going about like normal but they also make capsules so you can take it in a capsule if you prefer it's a little easier I would think so I'm gonna get those next and yeah I've just been really liking it so I wanted to share with you guys I am a new CBD user and it's given me relief at least for my attention my anxiety and my minor pain so if you guys have any questions just let me know I'll link this product and the company below so you guys can find out all the information you need and then again if you have any questions just let me know but here it is again I wanted to share and let me know if you have any questions see you guys", "UFrC-ZLvCh4": "hey everyone welcome back to my channel if you're new here my name is Brittany I'm a type 1 diabetic and I also deal with depression and anxiety so today video I'm gonna respond to everyone's question about what CBD I use the last video I received so many responses everybody wants to know what's the VD I used how much do I use how long the supply lasts me and does it really help is there any negative side effects today I want to go through all of that with you so before I get started please hit that subscribe button give me a thumbs up I really do appreciate it so before I actually get into everything I just want to state that this video is not sponsored I am NOT getting paid by this company to tell you that I use this because I actually do and I just want to be very open and honest with everybody so the company I use is lazarre's naturals they're based in Colorado they're third-party tested which is very important you want to make sure that the CBD you use is tested on and it comes from the actual hemp plant what's great about this company and its product it's pesticide free it's vegan and it's gluten free it's natural their shipping is great I get the product in sometimes two to three days which is astonishing I use the full spectrum CBD because it offers the wide range of cannabinoids from the plant so you get the full benefit first is the isolate or broad spectrum they're cheaper but they don't offer all of the different elements of the plan with the CBD however on that and it does not have THC in it however the full spectrum has very maybe 0.3 percentage that's zero the point 3 so very small this bottle is 3,000 milligrams I was doing 750 milligrams and that bottle is a little smaller so this is the 750 milligrams bottle this is a 3,000 now I was using this and this only last me a week and a half to maybe two weeks and who wants to order it that often it's kind of obnoxious so I upgraded to this and hopefully this can last me about a month I hope so the serving size is one milliliter and that is 50 milligrams of the CVD so right up to the line I will have about 1.25 so milliliters so that's up to the line and then about a quarter extra morning afternoon and night and depending on how I feel I might need a little more or sometimes not much at all just it depends on the day now the cost the cost of the 750 milligram is about $30 this 3000 milligram is it's a hundred and ten 110 I think because of the research I've done this brands this company is actually cheaper than other companies like Charlotte's Web Charlotte's Web it's known for helping with seizures and it's great for mental health and all that but because of the cost of the Charlotte's Web I never never went that route I went and I I was recommended this company I tried a few in the past and they didn't really help I tried this I you know it works it works for me and some other flavors I do the classic because I don't mind the taste or smell of CBD some people do you can mix it in your drinks or you know put it obviously put on your tongue hold it for like 30 seconds and then you swallow and I usually just take a drink and chase it down it's not bad and it really helps calm me down and it helps me focus so I feel a little more level down it take away the need for antidepressants I am NOT against aunt Ida presents I think they do work they do work but for me because I was putting on a ton of weight on them and I couldn't figure out the right medication or the right dosage that it was causing more problems than I would have liked this has actually been a year since I've been using CBD and haven't had to go back on the antidepressants I will say that it doesn't help with my PMDD if you don't know what PMDD is it's severe PMS it is irritability mood swings crying spells PMS basically on steroids and the CBD it helps a little bit it'll like calm me down and I can focus clean the house and stuff but I still have that I'll get me out of my skin feeling I hate it but CBD does help that is the only drawback is that it can't tackle those hormones just like the hormones take over my diabetes my chronic illness it also nothing really stands in his way so CBD doesn't have a chance it helps a little bit but it's not the cure-all and I just want you to know that CBD will not fix your problems it won't make your stresses and fears go away it won't change your mood it'll just relax you a little bit you're not panicking so you're not freaking out and everything but it is not the cure-all I love the stuff it helps me helped me stay off antidepressants I'm right there with you if you are contemplating like going a hand-tied presence or you don't want to be on anti you know it's hard nobody wants to be stuck on a medication especially if it's not working talk to your doctor so I can give medical advice I can't say do this or that but if you're able to manage your depression and anxiety with like exercise eating right and you just need a little bit of a boost CBD will help you have to figure out what works for you and how you're able to cope this is just a way to cope basically that's the end of this video I hope it was helpful maybe this company can help you there's a bunch of different CBD companies to choose from this one just happens to be a really good one and I don't want anybody to have to go and search and go through a bunch of duds you know I'll go on their website give them a try who knows it might work

so thank you so much", "pRQQqKUyIro": "[Music] hello my name is Jennifer Dixon with the green valley nation and today I want to give you a really quick review on the Charlotte's Web maximum strength CBD this is a highly concentrated product that claims to be great for sports recovery folks suffering from anxiety issues and insomnia and sleep related issues Charlotte's Web grows and processes all of their hemp in Colorado they use organic non-gmo and vegan friendly products to make a full spectrum CBD using co2 extraction methods the Charlotte's Web maximum strength CBD comes in chocolate mint flavor it has 60 milligrams of CBD per each suggested serving size of one milliliter there are two current sizes which are 30 milliliter and 100 milliliter which gives you at least in this bottle eighteen hundred milligrams and then in the 100 milliliter bottle it gives you 6,000 milligrams of CBD because this is a full-spectrum product there is a little bit of THC in it but it's less than 0.3 percent and so it won't get you high let's talk about the packaging on the outside of both the box and the bottle is a picture of the Rocky Mountains a kind of tribute to where they are located and on the outside of the box is a QR code it's on the bottom right hand side that you can scan and get the analysis and the information about the particular product you'll find that each bottle inside of the box is individually wrapped with cellophane so that you know that it's new and that it has the ingredients and it has the suggested serving size of one milliliter because this is a full spectrum oil you'll notice that it is a little bit darker and greener in color than an ISIL it might be that also means that the flavor is going to be a little stronger now Charlotte's Web does use a chocolate mint flavor in this product but that doesn't necessarily mean it covers up all of the flavors let's try it you're gonna put it underneath your tongue and you want to hold it for at least 30 to 60 seconds the first thing that you're gonna notice after taking this product is that even though it is supposed to be chocolate mint flavored it doesn't taste super chocolaty just a little bit minty you're gonna still taste the plant it's a it's a full spectrum product so it definitely has that plant flavor to it however within 15 minutes you're gonna notice that you're calmer that you can focus a little better and that if you have any residual pain because it's so concentrated this stuff knocks it out pretty well now for me I'm very sensitive and I react very very quickly and strongly to CBD so I don't need very much I use like a few drops maybe a quarter of a dropper full and that will last me all day for you if you are a little less sensitive to it or you are dealing with a higher amount of anxiety or pain you might have to use the full suggested serving size of one milliliter and it may not last you all day you might have to take this every four to six hours it really just depends on how your body reacts and responds to it and then how quickly it metabolizes the CBD you can also find that when you take this before bed it'll help you to relax and go to sleep I find that when I take it before sleeping it puts me to bed like that and then I can sleep the whole night which is glorious let's talk value here this is considered a premium product so it is definitely on the higher end of the price spectrum if this is not something that you're generally as concerned about then it's a perfect product for you however if you live on a pretty tight budget this could be a difficult addition to your daily routine if flavor is also a big thing for you this might not be the best option because it definitely does still have a strong earthy plant flavor there is a hint of but if you're very sensitive to taste in flavors then I would definitely not recommend this product for you overall I really do like the the Charlotte's Web maximum strength CBD oil it does what it says it's supposed to do help you to relax it definitely helps me to sleep and it definitely does help to manage my aches and pains I can't recommend it if you are looking for something that is on a budget because this is a little bit more on the higher end of the spectrum but it is a great product high quality every single time I take it it's the exact same and if you're not as sensitive to flavors it's going to get the job done pretty quickly because it's so concentrated so you might not need as much thank you so much for taking the time to watch this review once again my name is Jennifer Dixon with greenvalley nation and if you liked it make sure you subscribe to this channel for the most comprehensive library of hemp products thanks again see you soon bye bye [Music]", "G6SEKfH2H7M": "okay so I'm with my boyfriend Paul and we both just started taking CBD oil so Paul is starting a channel with the channel gonna be called smarter than your doctor well originally I started taking CBD oil a little over a year ago and mmm when I started taking it I really didn't know anything about it and the dosage I was taking was what was on the bottle I was getting like three point three milligrams of CBD per dose and it literally was doing nothing well I've had numerous years of like long-term chronic illness things several different things and one of those things was hyperparathyroidism and that's a huge issue all in itself so I don't want to go into the details of that but basically the things that I'm dealing with currently our body aches and pains headaches really bad headaches long-term headaches and massive fatigue and somehow about a month or so ago I stumbled across I was I was looking at YouTube videos and I stumbled across a YouTube video that was talking about headaches and CBD oil so I started you know diving into that real hard and I go okay headaches how do I know how much CBD oil I should be taking for a headache well I found one particular site that gave a listing of several different illnesses conditions whatever you want to call them and headaches was in the list and they say for headaches you really need at least two point five milligrams to twenty milligrams I'm sorry micrograms of CBD oil I got a look again in milligrams yeah okay its milligrams anyhow so I said oh no I'm yeah we have to make sure we have all our information straight so I I said okay up to 20 milligrams I said okay and I had already looked at some other videos about how much people were taking for certain other types of things and they were taking like 50 milligrams or 100 milligrams I'm going man that seems like a lot compared to about 3.3 whoa I remembered something I learned a long time ago about people who deal in supplements and so on and they they just cut their dosages down so dramatically to keep from ever having a legal issue well so then you go out have to go out on your own to find out what you really need to be taking it may be the products good enough but you're just not taking enough of the product so the first time I had a reasonably good effect from CBD oil I had to take six doses of the oil that I had and that was something my dad bought for me over a year ago and I took 20 milligrams and I'm telling you in about five minutes I became so much more relaxed and my headaches started going away and I was literally amazed at how I was feeling and that made we dive into a whole lot more study about CBD oil and that's why I started taking it I mean I'm taking it for several other reasons you know for the fatigue for the body aches and pains but it's been a good couple of weeks now that I've been on a regimen of approximately 50 milligrams in the morning and fifty milligrams in the evening and I'm starting to you know show very significant the signs of feeling them tons better not just kind of better like way better I'm not expecting it to be a miracle because I realized my endocannabinoid system has been very neglected for many many years and so that that's another thing that if you're seriously interested in CBD oil is you really need to learn about what the endocannabinoid system is in your body so endo stands for endogenous which means it's inside of you already this is a system that God gave you and cannabinoid is the chemical which operates between different areas of your body and this is it's as pretty new medicine like they didn't really start learning about this until the 1990s they knew about it before but not really how it worked because we have so much more medical technology now you know okay I'm probably going further than you wanted me to go but like what Brandon okay what I'm taking is Lazarus Naturals you can go there Lazarus Naturals calm I'm not doing a commercial for them I don't get paid by them at all the reason I'm telling you as the millions of people looking on YouTube is I did the research on exactly what you should be getting from a from a CBD oil and Lazarus Naturals happens to be one of the companies that makes the CBD oil actually they grow their own plants too which is a big deal so they see the process from beginning to end and there are other far more expensive quality I mean they are top quality of CBD oils but they're cost prohibitive I mean you'll start to learn that very quickly if you're you know needing this saying you know you really want to use this well mmm it's not like going and buying a high high priced medication but it is like you need to shop and I can tell ya I mean if somebody else has another place to go that has quality CBD oil for a really reasonable price another thing actually Lazarus Naturals has a discount program for people who are veterans what are the other two things veterans low income and yeah there was one more thing anyhow that's that was another reason that I mean literally I was paying less than half of what some other companies were charging for the same thing and if you start doing your research the thing you have to be careful of is everybody who sells something tends to get into the hype of their own product and the things that really matter in this case are the CBD oil itself and I can't say that you shouldn't try others because maybe there's certain things that work will work better with your system I'm just telling you this is the one that I I came to that I said okay this is the one I'm gonna start with I can afford it and I probably will try some others down the road I just think you know for most people medicine should be affordable and we're not even really at this point for most people even in the medical community they're not calling it a medicine they're really thinking of it as a supplement and there are groups who consider it food which if you think about it it is a food but it happens to be a food with a great supplement to it you're taking the high potency 50 milligrams one milliliter you've got the biggest bottle right how many the bottle that I got is a hundred and twenty milliliters six thousand milligrams in the entire bottle so that turns out when you divide out you know per milliliter that puts fifty milligrams per milliliter so a milliliters a thousand milligrams so you want 50 million yep 50 50 mil milligrams of CBD oil is in 1,000 milligrams of the oil that's in you know 1000 milligram is a milliliter I hope I'm not confusing you you know so 50 milligrams for an adult is a very reasonable dose but people should really start slow because of what happened to me I did it too high I wasn't expecting if I had been at work and taking such a huge dose you know right yeah it's a much smarter to start with a low wind dose maybe you know 0.25 milliliters which would get you 12 and 1/2 milligrams of CBD oil I think that's a really good way to start you might not notice anything on a dose that's small and the bottom line is your body needs this like really bad because we're not getting food that has the CBD oil that chemical manat getting the food that has that for our endocannabinoid system to be working functioning it at top you know top level so oh go ahead oh okay I wouldn't have to say as far as taste goes I mean because I actually smoked pot before it tastes the way pot smells at least that person at that particular product yeah this product that I'm using right now and you know it's it's not a bothersome flavor at all you know you get used to it your full spectrum I'm definitely on the full spectrum which basically means that you're getting like the per that there there are laws for how how CBD oil is made and CBD oil it has to have less than okay so CBD oil is is made under legal restrictions so the the allowed amount of THC in the CBD oil has to be less than 3 or 0.3 percent so if you basically 0.3% is three milligrams was that what we ended up with three milligrams per yeah three milligrams per thousand I think I'm know I'm getting confused I gotta go look up my you might have to redo this part because I got it I gotta get that the math straight in my head so people have to be careful of they're taking the full spectrum because some because some places they'll say oh you won't fill a drug test but there's plenty of videos where people say they were shocked because they fail to work drug test you know random drug test for work base because they were taking the full spectrum right right yeah to two issues here one is drug testing you may and you may not pass a drug tests taking this they the people that I trust the most say that if you've got to take a drug test then you need to be off it for like 10 days and then you won't have a trace I mean that's that really tells you a story right there is it's really low THC content if it only takes ten days for it to be out of your system the other issue is how THC affects you personally and that that's a really big deal to pay attention to and then one of the reasons I suggest people start low because my girlfriend Joanne sweetest lady on the planet is sensitive to the THC and got baked on a couple of normal doses they were 250 those those are normal dose like but it was really so it kind of was the equivalent of a hundred milligrams right typical right so so hundred milligrams for Joanne really gave her enough CBD oil which really relaxes you and THC which has the psychotropic effect mmm so she was feeling pretty darn good and there's a reason the reason it happened is cuz she didn't she didn't feel like she was getting anything from the first dose well we actually learned later that it takes about an hour to two hours to really feel the full effects of the CBD oil and that's something you really need to pay attention to just don't just dive into this you know take it you know be mindful of what you're doing and maybe even take notes of how much you took what you're what you felt and so on and so forth because most people nowadays most of the companies that I look at are saying forty to fifty milligrams for an adult is a good normal sized dose and then there are you know serious step ups for for people that really need more they say okay if you weighed 200 pounds then you cut your weight in half and you want so that would be a hundred then a dose for somebody who's really needing a lot more should be a hundred milligrams so in my case with what I'm taking it would be 2 milliliters to get a hundred milligrams I haven't no I did I went to that level one time but basically it was like oh the other thing is like if you know if you only wait like 20 minutes and think oh it's not doing anything that's that was the little issue that we had Joanne if she didn't feel anything because you know if you ever smoked marijuana before you get hit with that pretty quick like within just a couple of minutes you start feeling a pretty good buzz smoking marijuana well this is not the same you know system okay because when you when you inhale and stuff gets into your lungs it's getting into your bloodstream very very quickly if you're taking stuff sublingual wooly and then swallowing it you know some of that's going through your stomach so no that's going through your mouth and it takes that much longer for it takes that much longer for the chemicals to get into your your system so in in conclusion to this video I want YouTube viewers to know where they can find your channel what is your channel gonna be called you we're gonna create it for you today so what do you think we're probably gonna name okay so we're gonna name the channel smarter than your doctor and I know that sounds terribly arrogant but here's here's what it's really about okay your doctor is a doctor right and probably trying to help you with certain issues that you're dealing with well your doctor might not be the specialist in that area so the people that we are and the research that we're going after is just so far beyond what it's even possible for your doctor to do as a regular doctor he just you know he she whomever it is just doesn't have the time to dive that deeply into all these issues so smarter than your doctor really is just getting to the information that is available to help people with a multitude of different and we're talking barely major medical issues that they haven't been able to get a better understanding of from their doctor a better direction better medication and and we will tell you this here the majority of what we are helping people with is using things that are on the natural end if somebody has to have a regular prescribed medication then yeah they have to have that we're not seeing that and we're also not seeing that there is a cure we're saying what their what this is is what other people have had success with what these what this major yeah what these major research groups have done and found and you know I've actually done a lot of this on my own and shared stuff with my doctor who happened to be very open to hearing because her her specialty is anti-aging and what I've told her certain things about what I was doing you know one of them being natto which is a Japanese food and I told her how it was helping me dramatically for my blood pressure she had actually already studied that a little bit and said wow I have actually thought about prescribing natto for my clients well anti-aging that would be huge because Japanese women have the best skin in the world and this is the you know this is the this is the natural food that they eat every day for breakfast so any of them okay I think I think I hammered that right there no I'm just I'm really excited to get some feedback from people and you know let's let's keep this all on the on the high level here you know and help each other out if

a really difficult one because it's the doctors saying basically well you've got all these symptoms we don't know what they are we don't know what's causing it one of the things we're starting to realize though is the endocannabinoid system probably has a lot to do with how people are not getting like what they need in excuse me in order to take care of their fibromyalgia symptoms so anyhow thank you so check it out Paul's channel and thanks for watching", "5hbylT2q8Ls": "[Music] hey guys all right today i want to talk to you about a company called joy organics enjoy organics is a cbd company now before i get into my thoughts about the company and what they offer and everything um let me tell you a little bit about myself and where i stand regarding cbd because i think that's kind of important okay so um you may or may not know but i stopped drinking alcohol last year um after a very long struggle with um with it and after i had stopped drinking alcohol i was not on any type of antidepressant or anything like that um i am naturally an anxious person that does i suffer from bounce of anxiety as well um which is actually kind of ridiculous that i used alcohol for so long as a coping mechanism because it does the exact opposite but anyways um so when i stopped drinking i was not on any sort of antidepressant or anti-anxiety medicine now i'm not i'm not against those whatsoever i think they're wonderful i just wanted to see where i stood um regarding my anxiety um because i never really dealt with it um for all those years because i was using alcohol you know and what i concluded is that i'm still just naturally naturally an anxious person um and that's okay however i've been hearing for years that cbd is something that a lot of people use um to manage their anxiety and and depression um but i was i don't want to say i was against it i was just super naive about it because um i didn't know if it kind of like got you high and when i was younger i i smoked out i'm talking about like really young um smoke all right you know i smoked pot once in a while and i did not like how it made me feel whatsoever at all i didn't like it at all so i didn't know and i didn't want also in conjunction with that i didn't want to go from alcohol to you know something else that i might um become addicted to or whatever because that's how i am i just have more of like an addictive personality so i was just very naive about it um and i didn't really think about it um the first few months that i was i was sober however earlier this year i kind of became more um open-minded when it when it came to you know came to it so i started researching companies um and what i realized that there was a lot of companies out there that aren't they're kind of like brainwashing i guess in a way um they make their they they when i would reach out to them asking about their products and everything they couldn't tell me where they were sourced um if they were like locally grown if they used any pesticides if they did any sort of testing um if it was just like straight cbd or if they were using like binders and fillers and stuff like that so um just like how i spent a lot of time researching like supplements and vitamins i did the same thing when it came to cbd um and i did find two companies that i really that i really like joy organics is one of them um i've been using them for the past several months i didn't want to just start using it and then jump on here and give my opinion i really wanted to like wait things out and see what i thought um so that's where i'm at today now i should say that i am affiliated with them and i'm very grateful for this opportunity um but i was before uh i was using them before you know before i had this opportunity um so anyways that's where i stand um i don't want to tell you guys exactly like what i use because i think that's a pretty personal thing and what works for me is not going to work for someone else but i will show you some of the products that i have um anyways so what stood out to me about joy organics is that they were very prompt with their customer service when i asked them my million questions that was probably super annoying so that was that was a mark right there is that you know they were very responsive and they were very courteous about all my annoying questions um they're also a family-owned company and they were established in 2018 so they're pretty they're pretty new um and then they just offered everything that i was looking for um they are made in um in the united states um their products have no binders fillers dyes or unknown substances and that right there is a huge plus because i don't want to put anything in my body that i'm not fully aware of um and then one of the most important things is that they do third party tests they don't just test they test each ingredient and then they test it um they test the final product and i'm all about third party testing you guys probably know that by now now joy organics offers i'm not a scientist i should just let you guys know that probably know that um but uh they offer broad spectrum cd cbd and when i started on this whole you know journey learning about this i did not know anything about this and i i still don't but they offer broad spectrum and i know some people use um full spectrum however they're launching some products that that are full spectrum for those of you guys that are interested but i'm not going to get behind the science of it or everything anyways broad spectrum does not have any any traces of of thc in it whatsoever and that's that's what i wanted um so all the um the hemp is locally grown um in uh in the united states which i really appreciate um let's see what else they're grown and manufactured in the united states they third party tests they have zero thc and then i'll show you some of the products that they do offer so first we'll go with the soft gels and these are them right there um soft gels are just good if like if you would you know take one in the morning um to kind of like get a jump start to your day um and then they also offer the cbd oil that you would just apply directly underneath your tongue and then that's how it's going to absorb and this is obviously going to be a quicker you're going to you're going to feel the effects faster obviously because your body's going to absorb it faster being directly applied underneath your tongue um so those are the two options right there and they do offer different sizes um i should say that i love the bath bombs the bath bombs are great these are excellent obviously for relaxation um these are these are something that i use um i use fairly often and then i also have the gummies and these actually they actually taste pretty good um and you just need one of them and i should also say let's see the sugars are two grams of sugar 15 calories for one and then four grams of carbs um four grams of carbs for one but there's no fillers or anything in these um like a lot of gummies like a lot of gummies have so i don't know i i don't take that i don't take cbd every every day and i should say i like i said i'm a naturally anxious person but i feel like i don't need to and some people might think that's i don't know that's not good or whatever but um i just don't i notice that there's just some days that i'm just more anxious than others and i don't want to take it every day because i don't really need to and i also should point out that i've been really tracking my cycles lately the past few months i mean i've always tracked them but i'm talking about like my moods and my um energy levels and things like that and i've noticed that i'm a lot um more anxious at certain points in my cycles than others so uh but that's that's a topic for another day um but yeah i like i said i'm an affiliate with the company and everything like that so that does mean that you guys will get a percentage off if you use my link in my code i will have that um link directly below if you're watching this on instagram then you can just go to my bio and click on shopjoy organics and um i'll have the code and everything provided there i think i think it's kims15 i should have probably looked that up before i before i recorded this but anyways it'll be linked below but you will get 15 off your order um if you use that that code and um uh it doesn't cost anything extra for you obviously you just get a percentage off and then i get a small commission for it so um they do ship to all 50 states um however they don't ship uh they don't ship internationally and um some people have asked me before when i talked about supplements um if they're vegan now i should say that the oils and the gummies are vegan so these two are gonna be vegan but the um the soft gels which are obviously the little like pill form or whatever and then the balms that you're gonna rub into your hands those are not vegan in case anyone's interested in that and they all have a um shelf life of 18 months so anyways um if anyone has any questions let me know i just wanted to share this company with you because it took me quite a while to find one that i was comfortable with using and um that offered really good customer service so yeah if that if anyone has any questions let me know um otherwise hope you have a great day", "3o5Au3HyWMQ": "on my way old smoke and falling and falling then turned into rain the rain dried out but the Sun shone against the flowers blossomed in the grass girl the mercury rose

"NtFSeWNJCHg": "so our full spectrum that CBD and hemp tincture is the baseline for everything I use I use this in the morning and in the evening I personally do the thousand milligrams so one dropper full is about 33 like what does that even mean half in the morning is somewhere around 16 milligrams and in the evening why because I like to start my day and ease into it knowing that I'm giving my body what it needs to be stress-free and in the evening of course that's part of my relaxing and going to bed regimen but this hemp in here started on our farm again with our family of farmers and it's full spectrum it's the whole thing in here so this is just what I do like a little half drop like that under the tongue hold it there over there for like 15 20 seconds and then swallow what's left over and baseline yeah I use it as a baseline every single day I wouldn't travel without it and I just add lots of other things to it", "oACmVBbLN7M": "[Music] hi my name is Jennifer Dixon with green valley nation and today i want to talk to you a little bit about the Seabee distillery 2500 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil at this level of concentration it's probably best for folks with more severe symptoms that are looking for natural approaches to helping them manage those symptoms in each one milliliter dose you get 83 milligrams of CBD the Seabee distillery 2500 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil is a co2 extracted non-gmo non certified organic u.s. grown hemp product because it's a full-spectrum product you get to experience all the benefits of the many compounds found within the hip plant sometimes this is known as the entourage effect let's talk a little bit about the packaging and what you get when you order the Seabee distillery 2500 milligram CBD oil they recently revamped everything and the new color scheme is pretty neat coral but what's really cool about the new packaging is that you see the dose right here in front which contrasts pretty well with the coral color so you know exactly what you're going to get each time you take one milliliter which is their suggested serving size another cool thing about that this particular new product is that on the side it actually tells you how to take it because sometimes there is a little bit of confusion on how you administer the supplement when you open up the box you're gonna find your little bottle it's 30 milliliters of the full-spectrum CBD oil and then you'll also find a cute little pamphlet that helps to educate you a little bit on CBD what's in the product how much you get for a couple of drops and things like that you're going to notice that it's a it's a dark amber color and that's because it's a full-spectrum full-spectrum products are usually a little more dark and a little more plant like let's go ahead and try it since this is so concentrated I usually don't take a full dropper that's just too much for me so I'm gonna take a few drops I'm going to put it underneath my tongue and then wait about 30 seconds right off the bat you're going to learn two things one this does not taste awesome unless you really love the earthy plant like taste 2 this is really strong a little bit goes a long way you're gonna find within about 15 to 30 minutes that you're calmer you're able to focus a little bit and any residual pain that you have this stuff will knock it right out I don't take the full dose because it is so strong but my husband does and he loves it one dose will that last him basically all day 8 to 10 hours another really cool thing about this product is it'll help you to go to sleep and stay asleep because it is so strong let's talk about value here this is a very concentrated product that comes in far below other competitive prices for similar concentrations it still is a little bit on the higher end if you're on a tight budget but if you do have severe symptoms this is a really great way to manage those symptoms and not break the bank what I really love about the Seabee distillery 2500 milligrams is that a little bit goes a long way if I had this bottle all to myself it would last me forever because I never take a full dropper however my husband is constantly taking mine so it doesn't last quite as long there are 30 doses if you do one milliliter at a time so that's still a pretty good amount and it lasts you all day and it helps you to go to sleep the thing that is not so awesome about the Seabee distillery 2500 milligram is that it does not taste very good if you are very sensitive to strong earthy flavors this may not be the product for you because it is both strong and very earthy flavored the other problem with the Seabee distillery that even though it is a very good value still is expensive if you are on a tight budget if you can afford this this is awesome it's the most concentrated you can get for the money but it still is rather expensive so the CB distillery 2500 milligrams it's really easy to read it's very clear you know exactly what you're getting and it is a good value for the money you get a non certified organic product non-gmo American grown hemp product at a really good value thank you so much for watching again my name is Jennifer Dixon with green valley nation if you liked this review please be sure to subscribe to our channel for the most comprehensive library on hip products you can find thanks and see you soon bye-bye [Music]", "DbIvkKuEBl0": "full spectrum cbd oil when and why should you take it and what is it let me explain you and answer all of your burning questions today in this video and hopefully by the end of watching it you will really have a clear idea what full spectrum cbt oil is and why you should be choosing it and when so my name is nadia and i'm the founder of vicario cbd and i'm a holistic nutritionist specializing in cbd oils first and foremost what is the difference between full spectrum and cbd isolate it's quite self-descriptive but cannabis has over 130 different cannabinoids and by the way hemp is cannabis um it's just a type of cannabis and there's over 130 different cannabinoids cbd and thc being the two most popular and prevalent ones but there's a you know over a hundred different ones so when we talk about cbd cbd is one cannabinoid it's an extra they extract that cbd and it usually looks like powder so cbd is isolate is usually just powder versus cbd full spectrum it's exactly what it means it means it's a bunch of different cannabinoids um so cbd still being the main one 95 percent off full spectrum cbd would be cbt but there's also cannabinoids like cbdn cbg and a little bit of thc so cbd isolate would have 0.00 dhc however cbd full spectrum will have a little bit of thc it is usually a very small amount um less than 0.3 by dry weight um that is kind of like the legal um requirements but sometimes it's even less than like significantly less than that it will depend on your full spectrum cbd so uh if you're really worried about thc uh whether you are just taking cbd for the first time um like myself when i started with cbd i really didn't want to have any thc in it because i'm so afraid to get high so because i take it monday morning and i don't want to have teachers in it then go for cbd i sell it however if you don't mind a little bit of thc if you're like smoked weed a lot of times and you're like i really don't mind i'm not scared of it i'm not afraid of it um then that amount of thc isn't really significant enough to you know to get you high that being said um we still most of our oils at aquarium are cbd isolates um thea with cbd isolate being our most popular one um you can get it by following the link in the bio and using the code youtube um it has no flavor it's made with mct coconut oil and cbt isolate and that's it it has 0.0 thc so there will be nothing to worry about and most of our products still contain just cbt isolate however there are benefits to full spectrum obviously there is a whole concept of full spectrum cbd oil having an entourage effect that cvt isolate doesn't have so what is entourage effect entourage effect is when cannabinoids are working together um and so thc will help will it will make sometimes cbd stronger if it's in a right proportion so in full spectrum it is the case so um when it when we're talking about cbd qualities like anti-inflammatory or analgesic or um that it will help you sleep thc and other cannabinoids can really boost the function of the effectiveness of cbd itself so that is what a rush effect is so is full spectrum cbd oil better than cbd isolate well it really depends everybody is very different so you have to make your own decision there is no better or worse cbd isolate doesn't have thc in it so if you are worried about thc whether it's a drug test or just your own personal reasons then it's just stick to cbd isolate however if you're not worried about the liberty of thc full spectrum might be for you full spectrum because of in entourage effect can be better for pain management because um it will be stronger anti-inflammatory and stronger analgesic so whether it's arthritis whether it's headaches back ache or whatever that is cbd full spectrum can be better might be better and another one is sleeping noise insomnia cbd full spectrum cbdo can be more effective in um in case of insomnia and actually falling asleep and relaxing that being said i have had um some customers um report to me that they feel sleepier from full spectrum cbd than cbd or isolate and in that case you don't want to be taking it monday morning right um so let's say you're taking cbd oil monday morning you're taking it for stress you're taking it making sure that your energy levels are stable throughout the day um you don't have pain or sleep problems um then we i recommend sticking with cbd isolate just because thc can make you a little bit more relaxed um to compare it to just pure cbd as i'm saying all of this i just want you to keep in mind that we're all very different and we will all have a very different effect personally speaking if you ask me i will tell you that i don't feel the difference between full spectrum and isolate but that's just me some people feel huge difference and some people love full spectrum and some people love isolate so i don't think there's a right or wrong reason full spectrum is definitely gaining popularity um and we do have our full spectrum that you can also get in by following the link in the bio we ship in u.s and canada you can use the code youtube to get 10 off however i i will insist on saying that there is no better or worse just because it will depend on your lifestyle if um you feel like you're burnt out and you're really tired and you need you know three coffees to stay awake in the day um cb the full spectrum cbd oil might really like make you even more make might make you more relaxed and in that sense um it's a good thing like cbd will help you get over the adrenal fatigue and like will force you to rest so it's not a bad thing however you probably don't want that effect on monday morning and that being said if you are struggling with pain then i would go for cpg full spectrum another question i could commonly ask is whether they taste differently full spectrum versus isolate and yes they do full spectrum does have a little bit of a more like weed taste versus isolate um in a regular concentration doesn't taste like anything and if it's a high concentration it might taste a little bit better but full spectrum almost always has that tiny bit of a weed taste and smell no matter the concentration is so just keep that in mind so i hope you see how both full spectrum and isolate have a time and a place in our day i do highly recommend you trying both and seeing what which one works for you um comment below with which one worked for you better and if you see the difference and if you don't also let us know make sure to subscribe to our channel and i hope to see you in the next video", "fERdBttO0Zw": "okay today we've got a review of R&R medicinals I bought their 1000 milligram bottle and Amazon sent it to a lab to see if it's real this is independent no affiliation I paid for the lab I bought the CBD for 45 bucks if you see my other reviews some of the companies charged that for 250 milligrams of CBD a quarter of the CBD for the same price but is this deal too good to be true that's why we sent it to a lab first I've got a quick review and then I'll show you the lab tests so this is CBD oil you put it on your tongue for a minute for the best absorption swallow after or just eat or drink the drops but you lose some of the CBD during digestion ingredients are simple MCT and sunflower oil mint flavor hemp extract corn are is out of Aurora Colorado it's a super small company in 2018 they replied to a customer saying it's operated by its three owners it's probably bigger now yet they are a top-selling CBD product on Amazon now if you're skeptical of Amazon CBD you should be amazon doesn't allow for the sale of CVD at least they claim they don't but then they have a whole section for CBD and I've tested a bunch of CBDs on Amazon and many are real some are not and it would be hard to claim that Amazon doesn't know that they're selling millions of dollars worth of CBD they're a tech company I think they can put one and one together two and two together so RNR and other companies get around this policy in this no CBD policy but just saying hemp oil and keywords like entourage effect or full spectrum this suggests not only CBD but other cannabinoids like THC and that's part of my argument against the sale of CBD on Amazon is hey if you're sensitive to THC and you buy hemp oil from Amazon where they claim they don't have CBD or THC and you drive off the road in the middle of the night sleepy there's there's issues you should know what you're getting and spoiler alert we found a lot of THC in this product enough to get super super high okay about the good first on our medicinals has over 1,600 positive reviews I think it's over 2000 now and a bunch of positive reviews on Google imagine that yeah people trying CBD with a lot of THC for the first time and they're feeling effects yeah they might like that now they market this to relieve chronic pain stress anxiety and inflammation which the FDA strictly prohibits for CBD products but they say aren't our medicinals don't say they're CBD they're not lying with words at least they're merely suggesting their CBD some people say they should follow the rules not give people false hopes without an FDA approved research others believe CBD helps with these conditions and don't really care let's just see what's in the product let's see the independent lab results in just a disclaimer this is me reporting on a lab test of one of their products at one time I can't guarantee all products will test this way companies change manufacturing processes all the time disclaimer blah blah blah they claim one thousand milligrams of unspecified they don't say whether it's cannabinoids or CBD because on Amazon they can't and our lab found not a thousand but twelve hundred and fifteen milligrams of cannabinoids including one thousand 70 milligrams of CBD now if you go buy CBD they're 1000 milligram label they are extremely extremely accurate sixty three milligrams of THC holy [ __ ] hey mom can i buy some hemp oil on amazon where they don't sell CFD or THC oh sure a couple droppers later of this bad boy and you're off to lala land a marijuana brownie can be like 5 or 10 milligrams for a higher dose intended to get you high some people super super high this this is a problem the liability of selling something like this on amazon whoo as far as pain relief yeah that's that's gonna do something these other cannabinoids rare cannabinoids over 55 milligrams of CBC and about 24 milligrams is CBG that's amazing these are some of the highest levels of CBC and CBG out of all the products I've tested it's surprising look at my list it's almost at the top most CBC here almost at the top and most CPG as well look I expected this prod to be fake on Amazon because Amazon doesn't sell CBD but nope and here's the official lab test link for this whole review is below again this is all independent I paid for everything price four cents per milligram some of the CBD oils I've tested are over 30 cents this is four point two cents lazarus naturals is the only one cheaper out of over sixty products that i've tested this is incredibly cheap and then if you're a Prime member it's too easy but I do not condone buying this on Amazon or any see videos on Amazon anyway but if you do here's the milliliter breakdown 35 milligrams per milliliter of CBD 35 milligrams CBD per milliliter breakdown is a strong dose some product start you off at five others eight fifteen twenty five some go over fifty so this is thirty fives pretty good THC 2.1 milligrams that's a lot that that's a lot for a hemp product I don't even know if you can call it hemp at that point research shows side-effects that's referring to the effects of THC basically be high start as low as two milligrams and now that's that's research with measurable high effects some people will feel it with a lot less maybe not document in research some people won't be able to drive after a couple of these doses you've got to take that THC into account here with ya thirty five milligrams of CBD is a good sized dose but then when you add the THC within it makes it very potent again a lot of CBC and CB g this is a strong potent well-rounded full spectrum extract look up the entourage effect and this is gonna have a lot of that which suggests these other cannabinoids increase the medicinal benefits of CBD that's it that's my review we have a super potent well-rounded full-spectrum extract that's accurate for CBD and has a lot of other cannabinoids and it's heavy on THC yes enough to make you fail a drug test and possibly have side effects like being high and they sell it on Amazon they are not transparent about what it is but it's

really points back to that one right there miss Wendy's she approached Tiffany in the library of all places in had said I've been waiting to talk to you we can all buy cvd like and for us being in the wellness practice we had to admit we didn't know very much and a little bit embarrassed to admit that patients have been asking about it but we just didn't know too much about it and so when Wendy asked would you be willing to meet with my cousin who's someone you may know Lisa honored respect for Wendy because we love her so much we said okay and so we met with Lisa for about an hour and she came and I presented and hopefully we weren't too standoffish because we knew it was probably gonna lead to like it there exhales kind of thing that really wasn't for us but Lisa says that we were very gracious and listened to her and as soon as we heard the presentation Tiffany's a scientist dr. LeBlanc Tiffany so she dug into the research what is this what have I been missing for the past couple years patients have been asking me about and started learning about CBD and the endocannabinoid system and everything that goes with it and then also why this product might be the best one out there at the time we didn't know but we were just listening to Lisa and you know trying not to be sold on anything but enough research was done to say okay you know will bite but we're still not going to take you for your word we want to see it wanna see doesn't do what you say you do so we signed up and bottom knocked right off the bat to give 50 patients a 30-day try and pretty much what we saw some some of them pretty quickly like like within 15 minutes sorry sighs some of them it took days some of them a couple weeks and generally I'd say we could break up that that study which is now probably close to eight people right there's more than 80 subjects just not necessarily going out there right it's okay I think we can roughly say we can divide it up into thirds we're about a third or the people who have tried it with us entities might see some difference but probably not enough to justify staying on it every month buying it consistently about another third saw an appreciable difference where they want to be a part of it they want they want to buy the product and continue using it and about another third life-changing results they're paying that they've had for 30 years is gone can't sleep now you can sleep anxiety depression on medication being able to come back off of those blood pressure right it's another point and so some of these things aside what it so that just prompted us to say it's working let's get further into it into the science and figure out what why why can it help all of these different things whatever he's going to talk more about science for you she's she's her goal tonight it's to be able to being a doctor being able to talk about the science bring it to a level that we can all understand because it's hard for me to I'm still trying to figure it out before we do that though I just want to talk a little bit about the founder of the company and the industry as a whole Stephen Thompson and his wife are the founders and part of what we enjoy so much about it is the way this company got started the lease a name actually means nutrition multiplied and so this started when mr. Thompson went on a mission trip to Haiti which we had a soft spot for you know us that he does a lot of mission work they were doing time money there are some youngsters too and he saw just the state of human poverty there malnutrition starvation diseases them that we you know things that we take for granted in the medical world just they don't have that luxury and and a touch them and he had been in the direct sales business in the health and wellness industry for almost twenty years and came back after having seen that and wanted to do something to help and the business that we he was in at the time the people at the top they they they didn't want to change their system to do anything so he actually knew that I think he knows the guy know was the guy from Tom's the shoe company right and so we got with him and said how do you make that work how can you do that and came up with his version of direct sales so he's taking everything that he knows and likes about the direct sales industry in the health and wellness field and has applied it here to his own business that just started in 2015 so this company's only barely four years old right and then about a year ago doctor de silver there figured out how to make this product at the top of the industry I'm talking about I'm talking about the hand that CVD industry right so he figured out how to make it water soluble and that's the game changer so we're talking about the industry you know these publications you'll see numbers like that 700 percent projected growth by 2020 I've heard our rolling stone actually sent 22 billion dollar industry by 2022 I've heard trillion dollar industry in five years so all these numbers are going around the lease itself for debt projects itself to be a billion dollar company in five years and the last figure I heard was just either a hundred million as of October is where they are now something like that so from a hundred million to a billion in five years I think it's safe to say we're in the early parts and so you always hear that when we talk about direct sales and again I am talking about direct sales so for those of you that might be put off by that right from the start I'm calling it out now but I don't want this to be to feel like pressure right you vote we've all been to those meetings pampered chef Tupperware right whatever it is where you feel like you go in and they want you to buy something and you're looking for the cheapest thing in the catalog just so you don't feel guilty we believe they want you to sign up that's not this that's not this we're here we swear in a wellness business and we have been waiting for this to help people we just happen to believe because we saw it with our 30-day trial that this product can help people and because of what Stephen Thompson's done not only will it help people with their health but it can help you build a business and help you breath as well it's kind of kind of cheesy I think that they ride but health and wealth we kind of go together so I'm gonna turn it over now to the love of my life the person who without I probably wouldn't be able to do half of the really cool things that I do and she's gonna try to fulfill her goal of bringing the science down to the real world for us very pretty dramatically in their background we have people that are you know physical therapists we have people that are stay-at-home moms you know I want to make sure that I can make this understandable and applicable to everybody in the room so last time I was doing this I got a lot of head nodding and I got this I got this and then I got to this one point and all the head nodding stopped it doesn't move I think I lost them so I'm gonna try very hard to make this understandable for everybody so the first thing I'm going to tell you is your point of being in this room can vary dramatically you can be here because you just want to learn and that's fantastic I am a big big advocate I love teaching so if that's why you're here that's cool if you're here because you're taking the product you want to understand why it's doing what it's doing great if you're here because you want to make a business out of it great it can be anywhere any one of those three things it doesn't matter to me but what I want you to get from me is why and how does it work so the first thing oh I have like two slides and I want to go through but I don't even look at them so you're welcome to read that if you want to but it's completely irrelevant to what I'm going to say really but the first thing I want to do is I want to clarify some terms and I want to help explain the definition of them so first of all I want to talk about the endocannabinoid system so endo means made inside the human body okay so cannabinoid is when you're talking about CBD oil CBD cannabidiol is a cannabinoid so CVD is one type there are many types of them and I won't go into all the details of what they are just know that that is one type so when I talk about this product you know that when you say the word CBD well that's really not fair it's a full spectrum chemical and we'll get to let that mean so back to endocannabinoid so endo means maybe in your body cannabinoid the cannabinoid system so we have a system that already exists within our bodies where we make produce use these substances and I want you to think of them mostly like a hormone but it's a little bit misleading to say that but just think of it sort of like a hormone and so if you have a deficiency in any substance in the human body it could be a vitamin a mineral a type of beauty protein there are symptoms that are associated with those deficits so either so if you if your endocannabinoid system is not functioning or producing what it needs to you will have the symptoms of that so there is actually a recently document in 2004 was the first documented endocannabinoid deficiency syndrome that same study was republished about four years later in 2008 so we actually now known that there are people who have deficiency syndrome but you know as a scientist in life you're high why why that's the bigger question I think you know the answer to that but why do we have deficiencies syndrome but here's the good news if you don't make enough in your body what do we look to in any sort of deficiency we look to what's called phyto system so what plant-based systems of food based systems so a final cannabinoid is a plant based cannabinoid so we're very lucky because hemp is like the perfect plant to help produce phyto cannabinoids that can fill the gap and stimulate the endocannabinoid system does that make sense to all of you I need to see some head nods to make sure that makes sense get some eyes and say yes it's like so if so to take this like the next step further so if you have a deficiency it usually as a result the this the symptoms that result from that is because of a system well ironically and interestingly enough the cannabinoid system the endocannabinoid system is involved in almost every organ system in the human body so when you hear about CBD oil and hemp oil it sounds like a pennis tea it's like it's kind of nice everything in your life that's gonna go in and fix everything and it's you know it sounds crazy but there's something to that because so many organ systems are associated with that and so I have to be clear about something upfront we cannot talk about a supplement as it diagnoses trees or what the knower cures any disease process but what we can talk about is the endocannabinoid system and what that controls in the human body and by supporting that by a supplementation how that results and changes in disease state or symptoms does that make sense to all of you okay because we have to reserve the commentary on treating and curing to medications or drugs that's just the way this is and they're this way and it works so when you're when you're talking about this particular type of product CBD oil the next thing i really want to cover with you is why would you pick one over the other what differentiates one kind from another what makes a good product what makes a bad product and then some of the things that you might run into as far as obstacles and some concerning things that might come up so first of all let's talk about a number of things that there let me be clear there are a lot of companies that do these first few things well and I would never want to discount you know other companies that works but there is one thing that distinguishes this company all the others so first of all if you're looking for any type of CVD product or hemp product you want it to be organic and the reason why and this is more important than people realize is because hemp is extremely efficient and pulling things out of the soil so if you had a toxic waste dump and you want to clean up that soil have been a great way to do that you plant the hemp and it would help clean it up hundreds of years ago farmers had to plant him in order to rejuvenate the soil for crop rotation so it's that's part of its like the wonderful part of it is that is so efficient at that so if it's not organic it's also very efficient at pulling out negative substances such as heavy metals pesticides so that kind of leads into the next thing you want to look for you want to make sure that whatever product you're using is tested for those so if you look in your packet I think it's page three or so this company tests all their products for heavy metals for the pesticides for toxin toxins and they also test 20.0 THC and we'll come back it sleeps PNM okay the next thing that you want to look for things that you want to make sure that it's sio2 extracted the reason why that's important is because methane butane butane etc is used as typical extraction process is extremely cheap and it's a very toxic so it's best if it's co2 extracted which takes more time and more expensive but that's a much safer you know - baby I'm not really looking to drink up some hexane you with me on this movie okay the next part that you really want to look for is you want it to be a full spectrum hemp oil and this so I don't even look at it I just keep talking but yes so a full spectrum hemp oil has in it all of the other the synergy of the entire cell so I'm gonna use some simple analogies for this it's the difference between an apple and pear juice okay so the apple has the fiber and the vitamins and the minerals and has all of the elements of the whole fruit if you take out the apple juice you get some of those elements but not all of them so I'm going to take this a little step further so when it comes to science you know science is always looking for how can I break it down to the isolate so do you rember years ago when they were saying red wine it's really good for heart disease you know if you drink a glass of red wine is supposed to be go to the heart well the industry said well let's figure out what is it in red wine that helps you with your heart disease and we're going to extract that out and we're going to put it in the pill and we're going to make it work and so they said it's reserved at all so we're gonna extract out reserve it salt if you're put it in the pill and everybody's gonna see these benefits to their heart disease well it turns out that didn't work out and it's because oftentimes when you remove things out of the natural environment you lose the synergy of the element so the reservatrol didn't work and the same thing is true with CBD CBD is one cannabinoid it's considered an isolate so when you isolate something down to its individual that's an isolate and the challenge when you ever you make a total product down to an isolate is you generally have to increase the dose and you increase the side-effects does that make sense so on top of that all there's about 17 different cannabinoids that one one of those is THC and I'll segue into that in a second and there's a couple different kinds of THC as well but you also have all of these other elements the terpenes were played in like the minerals the vitamins that you would lose if you isolate it down to just CBD okay so that's the next thing that's very important and then the last thing and this is where you know I actually went to Massachusetts I went to a manufacturer who does all of those things that I just said very very well I had them produced me four bottles of CBD oil specifically for me to my specifications no THC this whole thing and I had them make me four bottles and the thing that you can't compete with is the water solubility so let me talk about that for a second so switching hats I'm becoming a nutritionist now okay so in the world of nutrition it's very difficult for the human body to extract out of fats its nutrients the reason why is because you don't start digesting it until it gets into the small intestines you'll require a vial to start breaking down fat so that comes from your bile duct which is associated to the system file duck gallbladder liver etc okay so if you takes you until your small intestines to start breaking it down it's very difficult for you to remove all of the components so let me um they'll give you an example of that have you guys ever noticed that it's very very difficult to assimilate vitamin D from a supplement so people vitamin D deficiency is just rampant in this country and so people take these humongous mega doses of vitamin D vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin it's very difficult for your body to pull that out of a tablet and make it into something useful so people end up taking these giant doses of vitamin D and then they end up pooping out a tablet and they have very expensive poop so actually we've got this felony on the day we had to have a septic tank pump and he said you wouldn't believe how many tablets just fill septic tanks he said I just pump out buckets and buckets of tablets because you can't use them can't break them down so American that very expensive boot okay so back to the CB Damon so if you have an oil that is not water-soluble here's the challenge so the big conversation right now in the CVD world is dosed they're like what's the dose what's the dose what's the dose is a dose how high enough and that's true but only to the extent that it's absorbable so there's something in that it's called bio availability so bioavailability is the amount that you can take out of a substance and use and assimilate in your body so most CBD oils are about three to ten percent bioavailable and I'm going to call some bluffs on this because all of them have you put it on your tongue which is called the sublingual patien so if it's an oil and it's not water-soluble and you put it on your tongue but there's no bile in your mouth you're not absorbing that until it gets to your small intestine so you can take it just swallow it there's no reason to keep it under your tongue this is no bottle you're in your mouth right so that three to ten percent is that is the typical range that a typical oil-based CBD oil has a bioavailability for it so if we did some math you know because you know all these different companies like we have the highest dose CBD oil that's super but if you only get five percent of it you have to do the math and figure it out so actually one of them and I won't say anything so there's a there's a very good company that has a good product that has a very high dose product and it is very expensive it's like 340 bucks for their highest dose bottle and they talk about their dosage but I did the math and when you have even it all out the the absorbable amount even if I want on the high end of the typical bioavailability still less so let's talk about water solubility for a second so with this particular product and this why I think I've seen so many of my patients where they've taken two or three other kinds of CBD went and they're like it just doesn't work for me that's okay you don't have to do this but consider a try just try for 30 days if it's not helping you you don't have to continue and more often than not they come back and they say for some reason this one works more and the only real argument that I can make is it has to be the water solubility because that's what makes it bioavailable so this study right here and this is something that I I think this company can be really proud of it's very expensive it's very difficult to do studies and now let me be clear there's different hierarchy of kinds of studies this would be considered a case series they've taken you know I think it's 25 subjects with it I can't I think it's 25 subjects and what they did is they they took an a blood draw from these subjects every hour for 12 hours and what they were looking at is we're going to give them a standard dose how long does it take before they absorb it what percentage of it is absorbed into the bloodstream and how long does it last okay so if you look here pretty much everybody within an hour have absorbed nearly the full dose and this is the coolest thing ninety-two percent absorption that that's crazy from anything that's ever from a fat soluble product that's that is I can't think of anything else that would be quite like that honestly we really need to take this technology and apply it to a lot of other stuff lots of other vitamins lots of other minerals this would be so the lease are you listening get on that but the other thing that was very cool about it so they kept taking it and I'm gonna talk about this little blip here for a second because I have a theory but at least we'll probably get mad at me for sharing my theories but it stays it stays elevated they just stopped measuring at 12 hours I don't know why they stopped measuring your 12 hours they should've kept going maybe the subjects were tired and wanted to go to bed no idea but there's no real indication that it's going down after 12 hours but there's a little blip here around 10 hours and I would tell you clinically there seems to be a group of people that they need a third dose they need something in the middle of the day and I cannot tell you exactly any you know data on is it said I don't know the sex the weight that you know the diagnosis that the problems I can't tell you anything consistent consistent about that but I can tell you I have a number of patients I end up breaking the dose up it's in 2/3 because for some reason they may seem like they have this little dip and I see it around 9 to 10 hours but that's just a clinical observation now after having so many so many subjects that have tried it so that is that is the thing that distinguishes this one particular product in my opinion and I did I've actually used the two products the one that I had manufactured I've used it on same subject no go it was no belt like it just didn't work as well and I can't say anything about I actually felt kind of bad that company contacted me today and said you know how's it going and I said I'm just going to become candid with you you know this is what happened and they were really grateful for the feedback actually and I was thinking well it's a patent-pending process so good luck with that you might get in trouble if you try so that's that's the the bioavailability part now what about the process that makes it so bioavailable it's called a micellar process now the women in the room might know what I'm talking about did you ever heard micellar water you clean your face with it kind of a new thing no it it's it's like a toad you know what it is she knows what it is I've never used it I don't know how a you know I I don't know if it's works well oh that's your business oh that's right she's you seeing up here and talk about it but my seller processing it takes and I'm gonna explain this in YouTube ranking if I say anything wrong I use a couple terms so do you guys understand the word hydrophilic and lipophilic no no okay hydrophilic means it likes water lipophilic means it likes oil or fat so what they've done is they've found a process that takes the CBD oil and puts around it a hydrophilic outer and a lipophilic inner so that it's attracted to water on the outside which helps transport Vince your body that pretty good with a decent okay I'm getting approval from like the science at the other scientists in the room she don't even like myself in my seat yeah and I see lol okay so does that sort of explain how they made it water-soluble now I'm sure I can guarantee you they're not going to tell me all the details of the how that works because it's a patented process I might be able to dig it out in a few years I don't know anywhere the prep when the patent runs out really can get the details of it okay so does that make sense to you guys so let me talk about one more subject and then I'm going to turn it back over to Nathan one of the questions that I often get is how does how does this work on you know so many different systems like how does it you know work on helped people with depression and anxiety and you know people with highly high blood glucose and stuff like that like how does that all work so there's two types of memories factors in the human body and I'm going to just simplify this and we're going to call them type 1 and type 2 they have other names like we're going to come one and two one of them is primarily found in the brain and spinal cord and the other one is primarily found in your immune system so there's it's pretty difficult to think of something in your body that is not influenced by your brain spinal cord immune system and there's actually more than that it's involved in one map but I'm simplifying as much as I can so if you can stimulate that system you can therefore stimulate the symptom that's associated with that system so I'm gonna just take a second to talk about some of the cases that I have in the clinic and then we'll move on okay and I'll try and give you a good variety because some of this stuff is just crazy I don't even I don't even know how to explain how bad I feel that I didn't look into this sooner because there's a number of my patients that have been with me for years and they do well I'm gonna give to mine was born again for a second I'm really good for some therapists and they do well but then there's a few of them that they have these underlying pathologies that you know have sort of a big question mark on and think of your fibromyalgia patients you are patients with lupus your patients with these unknown autoimmune disease like you know they have an autoimmune disease but they do the blood we're going to come up with one marker and like now you don't really have it you're like you have something we just don't know what it is those patients I'm amazing so let's talk about five miles per second so fibromyalgia has a whole slew of symptoms and you know there's always this controversy is it real is it not real whatever it's chronic pain a chronic pain of unknown origin an unknown solution for this pain so there's some commonalities about around fibromyalgia I can't sleep they have pain all over their body they have have digestive issues and all of these things when I put on my nutrition is has there's a lot of combinations you know that they work into each other but that's another conversation so with these patients two of the things that really really go well three of those actually but if you can help someone sleep it can help their pain if you can help their pain you can help them sleep I don't know which one is working I have no idea I don't really care honestly all I care about is that they feel better but it's a very fascinating process like what's happening there and that's where I was like delved into the research so I challenge you guys because another thing I hear all the time like if I speak to a physician like well there's not enough research I'm like well you're a [ __ ] because I saved him today just today just to see how many articles would come up on pubmed.gov if I just wrote cannabinoid I want to guess just can he guess how many articles 25,000 plus and I did that search right before I came here so I was curious I was like typing it they wasn't cannabinoid then we put it in and no cannabinoid then we put in Fido cannabinoid and then we put in cannabinoid and Parkinson's cannabinoid and sleep and the least we found on any search was a hundred and fifty four articles now for those of you who are not in the science field I don't think you really get what that means we'd be lucky if we have three articles that support something and we're like yeah there's so much evidence to support that don't fit a question here I'm started in um did you want early research on things like it's a friend bipolar disorder so I I didn't look up those specifically and I ought to be fully transparent I am nowhere near getting through 25,000 articles I am working my way through a lot of articles but I'm I'm like a couple dozen in okay not 25,000 so my answer is and I would never you guys anything that I don't know the answer to I don't know I'm not sure but I encourage you to look it up go take a look let me know I want to know but there there's definitely a plethora of research that you can take a look at and also this is a really early science like if you take a look at the number of years we've known about testosterone or you know any other hormone system hundreds of years we've known about this the vast majority of the research that's been done on this has been done in the last you know 22 years it's really a young science and we have a lot of distance to go so I want to talk about a little bit about why maybe it's such a young science and why in America doesn't have this stigma like you know people always say is it medical marijuana am I gonna get high okay well let's clarify that so first of all in 1937 prior to that cannabinoids or cannabis was the third most prescribed medication in America Eli Lilly Pfizer they all had their own strings that they prescribed in 1937 the bill was passed it's called the marijuana activist actually called a narrow somethin'-somethin app and it look what happened is cannabis and hemp got lumped together was then called marijuana there's a whole conspiracy about why that happened and they were both considered a class 1 drug so all of those pharmaceutical companies had to drop it and it was no longer available to the mass public well 85 years later finally have a bill that separated out those two things cannabis and in him so hemp is actually used in all sorts of things like it's a it's a wonderful thing it's moving in paper and materials and we know someone that's investing in a company that's using it as a lubricant in the military I mean it's using tons and tons of things so it's making a huge agricultural comeback because of this separation and thank goodness because it's you know it's easy to produce and it's it's such a wonderful benign in so many ways product so when the next question is let's talk about the THC for a minute so that's the big question right it's like gonna get me high am I going to get a positive blood test for you know at work etc so THC is the psychotropic properties and there's actually a couple different types of THC in one of them in particular is what everybody thinks of is it's a longer name than THC but so THC is what you think of as the psychotropic properties of marijuana or medical marijuana or recreational marijuana and there's even two strains of that so one of those strains has more CBD and less THC and one of those has more THC than the other so from a therapeutic perspective invisibility is called innocence don't quote me on that I might've said that wrong but it starts a night in this indica indica yeah good job in a guy that's it so indica mat one is the one that has less THC and more of the medicinal properties now if you and I want to clarify for a second THC by itself has its own medical benefits that you know nausea related to chemotherapy or cancer treatments super helpful for that certain types of seizures there's like a list of symptoms that I would I would recommend someone seek out medical marijuana now there's certain other things that don't maybe don't go as well with THC like certain types of anxiety and depression they it can exacerbate those symptoms also if you're not looking to get high but you want the medicinal benefits you you would likely want it's out no let me be clear I have patients are like well why would I bother with that I want to be high and like okay well you're let's send you over here because that's not what I do but it you know as far as the blood tests are concerned I get that question a lot and now this is what I can tell you the company tests the product at zero point zero THD the legal limit is anything below 0.3 th 0.3 on 1% does that make sense so to me it's really important that it's zero point zero because there are some drug tests that are sensitive to that level and I I wouldn't want someone to test positive I can't guarantee you one test positive anyway I don't know if the test goes to the point zero zero zero one I don't know but I tell people it tests to 0.0 0.3 I don't know maybe that would show up on a drug test I don't know it's not gonna get you I'm not gonna get you very high unless you drink a huge quantity of it but the zero point zero even you're not going to have the psychotropic properties and if that's important to you than that's that's it was important to me as a provider and the other one that I had manufactured I had to actually ask for that state you option you want the point three or the zero I'm like I'm with the zero give me the zeros that's wrong with this mmm okay so I'm going to transition out of this did I miss anything important so how did a person who's in direct sales create a product when he doesn't have a scientific background that's what I'm that's what doctor disobeys he is that he's the formulator if I understand correctly doctor the silver is actually the one item on the mission trip to Haiti Mars I understand where'd you go even New Jersey yeah that's right I've been in New Jersey and sang Thompson's out of Texas they grow their own em comes from Colorado in color and the distribution plant is in Indianapolis but it's growing and harvesting Colorado look at know they actually building appears to see if it's Russell you could actually get some snails so really I can't answer that other than I know that it was present in the blood drop but it are intracellular I don't I don't see myself a little throat blood will but it won't rule I don't I don't believe that they've done that study but I won't speak for them as far as I know if it has been done I'm not aware of it it's that ferrets or everybody who knows okay any other questions how do i do did you guys get it they make it pretty understandable I would also in the question she had yeah did we test the cells one of the things that we're seeing is that there is a result okay so we don't look in the cells but the end result of the product the anecdotal would suggest it would just highly suggest especially with a new topical that we're seeing that we put on and people feel relieved ten minutes oh well Union Master right faster for some and so Mike my scientific mind would say or at least my anecdotal mind would say yes okay you first you tell us hold on one second let me into her question and then she has a question then we'll go to you okay so some patient cases um I have more talk about yours yeah I got a 15 year old son that basically is very shy how would you say to start socializing social anxiety and basically he would seem little to other people was kind of big for us we're even talking would tip me he'll go back in he's dictating the conversation instead of the person dictating the conversation we were at a friend went over that friend's house and he was sitting came in in normally we would be sitting up there and the parent was like hey Aaron Zak - I had gone out for in the house he would have never walked in that house on his own he would set out there with us I mean that's just the way it is this past Saturday you know this we're at the lacrosse tournament and Tucker basically went ballistic on his teammates tell him they weren't doing their job and the coach loved it and said he called him all out when he needed to and that's not him not I've known Tucker since he was a little and there's you guys had some really serious concerns about that social isolation and I actually did an interview with him a month after he started he also has ADHD words were in it and he's he's doing extremely well and that's that's one case so that's kind of on the brain health side of things and then I have a patient who is a god 80 patients to talk about going to pick this one so he is a fireman and he has an injury when he young where he hurt his back and he also had a very rare infection in a lung that ever since that and the antibiotics and when I ma know that he has had terrible terrible gastrointestinal problems and he has kind of this systemic weird pain stuff going on and he he was the most rapid responder I've had so within 15 minutes he goes this stuff is weird and he goes I don't hurt and he has one of his symptoms he has epicondylitis so in our world and this test you put your finger out and push on it out of that freaking hurts and then 15 minutes later it was not there and I hadn't treated him yeah I'm done anything and then he ended up being so sensitive to it that he only takes eight drops twice a day and that's all he needs and he was actually just in today and he thought he got another bottle and he's actually going to human resources to make sure that he can continue taking this because of his line of work he's worried about drug testing and he's following through because he wants to share it with all of his other co-workers cuz they all have these problems you know because they're caring they're having ins and the ladders and all that crap so keeps that's a great segue into you okay I'm gonna stop but I will answer your other questions later those of you who had other questions okay alright so that is a really great thing because we can we do have maybe we're in a unique position to have the patient population to try this with so we do have those stories and then I want to get to more of that later because there's some great ones but it's a great segue into what Solis is looking for us to do business challenge right challenge you to try it see if it works because they say up to 80% of people are gonna feel some kind of result than that pretty closely matches that if you remember earlier I said a third a third a third right so you take my two-thirds sixty-six sixty-seven percent that's not far off right so so that's a challenge to try it and I'm just going to talk a little bit about the business now and again before getting into that speaking about Steven Towson again this whole thing that started he's continued that through and so every dollar of volume that gets spent in other words every time you buy a product it's getting matched to go towards prenatal vitamins for a pregnant women or blends of multivitamins for kids and that's just not that's the Sun in Haiti where where all this started and that's not just done a country after but I have a real big problem that's all around the world and in all 50 states so they've actually done the math on their impact so far and have reduced infant mortality by 29% syrup so he's I have not met I've only heard great things about him but it seems like he's doing a really great thing was trying to pass and I was trying to pay for you because of the pay it forward companies and so not just with saving kids around the world but paying it forward to the employers people that have working under him us and and wants us to do well so if you've not taken the challenge challenge you to try it they say seven days really in our experience seven days yeah for some things like Tiffany said you might you might you might get results pretty quickly for some things it might take a few days and we've seen people not see results until the second or third week so I really encourage you to try a 30 day if you can't you know financially if you if you can buy the big box try it if you do want to get involved in Kenya as a consumer you can buy it at retail retail for bottles $50.00 a lot of places sell it 440 can't sell it for less than hundred 20 also starts to degrade the integrity the product you can also sign up as a preferred customer but really quite candidly I don't know why anybody would do that you know they advertise it here as as you can be a preferred customer you can have it shipped to you directly you can save about $30 a bottle when you do that or you can sign up wholesale and you can get an even cheaper just for yourself if you want you don't have to do the direct sales business as a matter of fact think about it logically if they're exhales push you off then treat it like any other retail vendor you might have if you have to if you have an opportunity to sell retail just buy it at the wholesale and sell that retail and forget about their drug sales I have to do all right but if you buy a wholesale or there's just for you or or to sell at retail and at least you have the opportunity you should it arise and trust me it will to share it with somebody else or somebody else again involved in the program Tiffany was at the shoe store last week this winged shoes this is the shoe she boy and didn't have her size and so they were gonna order before and they wanted the email right so they could contact her when they came in and she put her email Tiffany at Lamont wellness leave behind a counter said Oh what kind of wellness do you do said well usually that answer is on a wellness clinic that does physical therapy personal training and nutrition counseling for some reason this time she said that plus and see me anyway and a lady said well I want to learn more about that so she started talking about it and the lady outside ever said I want to learn more about that just happens right and so it'll especially happen when you have a story when you've taken the challenge and it helps you or when somebody you know has taken the challenge and then and that's on the Wellness side or if you've gotten into it you've made a little bit of money and that's on the wealth side you have a story when you have a testimonial when you start telling people and it just comes up because really how many times have you ever talked to somebody that didn't tell you something about their health right back it's killing every every for every conversation it's almost always something about what's going on their help so the opportunity now that was on the consumer side of you if you're thinking about the business side they say there's seven ways to make money I'm gonna I'm gonna bunch this into three so it's easy to remember just retail that we really talked about and if you take two through five that's really commissions commissions and bonuses right based on what kind of volume you and your downline and people under you doing for business okay and then there's benefits program and the benefits program is really and I don't have a lot of experience in direct sales but to me that's that's kind of a big difference is that Stephen Thompson understands that in order to be money at this you have to work you always hear about direct sales and now is the perfect time and get in now markets about to blow up and then you get in and nothing happens right well that made me because the mat market saturated Tupperware pamper chef or maybe because you got sold on this potential and didn't realize that it still takes work you know I heard the other day there's no just statutes for lottery winners right people that get rich by being lucky there's no statutes for those people the people that do well financially doesn't work hard right even athletes you might think about that making twenty million dollars a game we'd only see him on Sunday we don't see the hard work at do the rest of the year and we can talk that's paramount later but the point is they work hard you still have to work hard so again coming back around the benefits if you're going to make this a full-time job and you know maybe leave another job or or you're a single parent you want to make this your job but you know health care how you have that stuff well he addresses that well then I'll get to that in a minute so retail practice again just just one more detail I want to talk about when I talk about retail profits this is not like a vendor in most other situations where at best I've ever seen you make twice what you're buying it for right if you buy a wholesale in bulk you can get this product first cheapest with shipping about fifty five dollars a bottle if you sell it at suggested retail that's 150 so you're making nine to five dollars a bottle yourself ten balls in a week that's almost a grand that's that's that's a big deal that's that's not any other kind of retail opportunity you're gonna find anywhere else if you do let me know the second way you make morning like I said is the combination of commissions and bonuses so really if you sign up and there's there's three levels you could sign up with so you can earn up to 20% of all the volume that you make or is made under you and you do that by enrolling a team okay so the first thing you want to do is enroll somebody on the left and somebody on the right and that makes you even a ship and associate and you can earn up to 20% on that volume up to $250 okay I'll tell you later how you can accelerate that as well and then you keep growing in level as you keep a roll of people they keep enrolling people you this is the direct sales thing right you keep building your tree and you keep going up to the point where there are black diamonds in this company they actually have to create that category people went past the last one to $30,000 a week there are people whose company that make that so this is the part we like yeah you're telling me all about this opportunity it never happens this products only been out for a little more than just over a year yeah so and we can we talk about where the industry is now and where it's projected to be President Obama cleared up the farm bill in 2014 on a provisional period it's up for repo and Mitch McConnell is going to go through it so in the next few months this bill is gonna is gonna pass and it's gonna separate or Tiffany was talking about earlier to marijuana in the head and that's gonna open up this industry there's no reason why Morgan so it's already going state-by-state our donors know there's no real reason to believe anyway that's why magazines forms Bloomberg they're all projecting this giant girl right so again it is early stages right the person that signed us up 13 months she's been in the now as our meeting was three weeks ago and she was a year na at that point so she's been in this for 13 months she's that presidential in October her Commission check was $26,000 so you can do it which means four weeks and we're probably getting a car next month I'm getting it so it can work but I'll tell you what Lisa works at tail up she works at Elle yeah she does record so part of the benefits the first benefit that you that you'll get blessing - and this is so cool once you get four people directly under you you can qualify for a blessing bonus it starts at a hundred dollars right I have a little story about this we were out to dinner Saturday night and I don't even think we were thinking about this no definitely not our server was just a real kind of talkative guy and we were we were in Murphy North Carolina it's a real small town like you can you can see every restaurant in the town from one Street apartment and so we're having a good time talking to him question came around how to end up here and you know he kind of told us his story kind of got a little teary because the family drama that happened and he was a little bit emotional and he went back and did some things and when we were asking for the check and we're talking some more I noticed he had a I am second bracelet on Alpha gadget familiar with that is you can look it up I am second calm but I knew what it was and so I asked him about it and he starts telling the rest of his story now it was a pretty personal story and he's he's been through some hard times and it's got a great attitude and he's looking good we just felt compelled to leave him a good tip right so on a $35 check I'm paying a check and Tiffany pulls out a 50 and she says he he means this right and then it dawns on I bet we're close to this suppose that another 50 so we left the hundred dollar tip and I'm not saying this because we're generous I think we're pretty generous with time and money I'm saying this because the lease allowed us to leave a hundred dollar tip on a $35 check and we left so we paid in cash we'd have to wait for him to take it and come back we just left Nasser crushed I don't know if you did this Basma crossing the street I looked over my shoulder and he's at the table like this right and I'd love to take credit for it but I can't have to give the credit to the lease because we didn't know we got it but when we went home that that that following day and looked in our account we had earned a blessing bonus like a few days ago okay days prior to that so they actually paid for us to do that and and that's when as you get up through the ranks you can get blessing bonuses up to $500 a month and the only stipulation is you have to give it away you have to get away and that's a tremendous feeling to be able to do that or simply so remember that tree we were talking about you qualify for that when you start with 4 under you and they say 4 by 4 because the next level is trying to get two of those people have 200 them so the humanity of 4 and the near 4 right so fittingly the next benefit is a 4 by 4 so they will pay if you're at that rank for you to have a cheat if you don't want the cheap you can get half the benefit in cash at least it would tell you but then you're gonna hang out forget you got to put their stickers on it right they're paying for it and they'll give you at the first level of getting four dollars a month as you climb that can become $1200 a month this are pretty cool she's driving around I don't even know what a $1200 a month she looks like Robyn climb every that probably pretty cool and then here's where it gets to be really cool if you really wanted to make a business out of this and call this your full-time thing it is they're gonna start paying health care you know how great is that if you're a single parent or or quit your job to try and make this work and you're figuring out healthcare anybody it's never pretty cool but that's like anybody's tried to get health care on that one knows how expensive that is they'll start paying health care for you and as you climb up to $1500 beyond that again four by four by four so we'll keep building the key building and you're gonna qualify for two percent share the entire revenue or that kind of thing so and that's divided by your I don't say your profit its prorated based on your contribution to that global revenue center right and then beyond that motorcoach again we're talking about these things that get all these things there are people in this company that are driving those are they for thirty forty feet long 30 34 feet long wants to be 34 feet or more and they'll give you I think it starts at $12,000 a month once you get to that level and then if you get all the way up into the diamond lomi 3000 doesn't they'll give you to have the motorcoach to enjoy there's no stipulation other than you have to have their branding on it they are thinking you're going to travel around the country and talk about the lease right I tell you what if I'm making that kind of money every month right Lisa presidential 26,000 a month right at motorcoach level you're talking about 30,000 a week I don't need to worry about going to work the next day I'll take their coach not drive around the country so you can see I'm starting to get excited because the opportunity it is there is there and again it's direct sales don't you know I don't want you to feel that pressure but I hope you can see the opportunity and when we talk about starting your own business we started we actually have four businesses now if you count this one and every time you start your own business you start thinking well what is retirement and click do I have to work forever well Stephen Thompson's built in this residual program so as you build you can earn generational bonuses all the way down to six gender patience so if you see remember the 4x4 right as you start multiplying if you add up all the numbers in that right column yeah you have a team of over 5,000 people once you get to that level you're looking at 2 percent residual bonus I don't know what that math is but that sounds like a lot it sounds like a lot to me right so again there's tremendous opportunities so how do we do it I'm not a sales guy I'm up here talking and you can't see it but I'm a little jittery in less now than it was when I started this is this is not my thing a lot of sales guy but I saw what the product can do and I've seen because we've gotten a blog blessings bonus and we'll probably qualify for a Jeep within the next 30 days or make it money too it works so I'm sharing that with you that's that point share it share the product share the story the health story the wealth story whatever it is if you share we don't even have to initiate it sometimes it's people are just gonna tell you on my back is killing me today like I said or sometimes it's just a simple question have you heard about CBD oil and then they start Thai and then you're armed about this information you can get a man getting involved you suck you are right now if you don't know the answers to the question this is being filmed right now so if we didn't blow it too badly we'll put that out there there's other ones Stephen Thompson has his video dr. andrew has a video right now for the time being this on YouTube and you know work will always be there to help our upline Lisa's been great she's she's been there to help Wendy's been a great teammate there to help whenever she can so we're all a team this is not like you know I've heard of horror stories from other direct sales where you know they stole my customer and you know now their competition it's not like that you know you brought somebody with you to they're yours I'm not going to try and sign them up for you they're yours and that's that's how this works and and of course share in the product they have their own story and they're going to be just as excited as we are together and and this is this is the slide that shows that that kind of positioning I don't know where as Lisa's on this line what I do know is that that seems pretty true when you take the other example as we talked about when you take the pampered chefs and the Tupperware's Mary Kay's that have been around for 50 years it's really hard to make money because you go anywhere in the country and people know what that is they've been to those parties they they look for the super sting on the catalog they've done it you go down to go down south for Reta one town down ask him if they've ever heard his Elise that's going to remember her ultra so it's brand new we're the first right in in the Atlanta market when it first Indiana's where to start because that's where a distribution that's started for the ultra cell here we're it right now so really here we're gonna start so if any of this interest you again no pressure we're just sharing because we care about you the person met and that invited you care about you or it feel like you can benefit from it either for your health or your welcome both this is where you can get started these are the three packages and this is how I was talking about you can accelerate yourself so if you sign up at gold which of course is the most expensive right 1299 you will get 20% of your binary bonus that we talked about over there so you're down like we care in 20 percent based on their body and potentials 2500 right off the bat instead of that 250 and and it comes with the product that you can share you know you got four big bottles we got 24 little bottles we got a bottle a topical there's other three that you see there was either three bottles you see those have boosters so this ultra training of ultra ice and ultra edge they use the same micelle the processing technology and the dream you know if you have trouble sleeping and the ultra cell bad cells networking the dream boost at so it's things like melatonin and things like that right the electric edge is for cognitive function I know Lisa said she uses it when I'm she has a long drive to help keep her focus and the ultra ice is really for anything chronic in terms of like getting your body back that homeostasis makes very information and things like that so that all comes in that package and all of these packages if you just got it and then turned around and sold it you'd come pretty down close to just get any money back so the risk is pretty low if you're if you are a salesperson you'd like to try and sell stuff bronze might be the one for you can you come in it 199 and you don't have anything to share you got one bottle one big ball in one minute you can only have one topical in one can if you wanted to but you can't share that doesn't give you anything to share right so you better be good at selling stuff and in the middle one is sober you get one big bottle one topical and you get a dozen minis bigger than what you get and what it costs I think in my in my opinion is the commission basis here's the good news if you can only come in in 199 and that's what you come in you get even upgrade alright so once you do start making somebody all you going to do later to upgrade let's just pay the difference and you'll get the difference in product back and then you're up to your 15% binary commission bonus and your weekly potential over that and then you can upgrade again so you just pick what's right for you if any of it just do the retail sales if that's right for you just just just try a challenge so I think that's all I have I would love to hear", "XKn9DIBRA8Y": "there are a lot of us out there that are looking for

video I covered the basics of CBD you guys a little background info about my story coming off of some super invasive antidepressants and talked about how CBD has helped me throughout that process and did a demo dab of the CBD isolates lab from Sammy distillery and a little review on that so you haven't already be sure to check that video out this last week and a half since that first video went up husband incredibly unproductive for me so I'm sorry that it's taken so long to get another video up but to catch you up I went down to zero milligrams so I am completely off the antidepressants that I was on I assumed that going down from five milligrams to zero would be somewhat similar to the ten milligram to five milligram drop which wasn't quite as bad as some of the other ones along the way going down 30 40 50 milligrams at a time but I definitely assumed wrong on that one when you're on such a high dose of a drug as invasive as pristiq is for as long as I was which was almost seven years I think that coming down to zero is just a total shock to the system no matter how fast or slow your weaning off of it I don't know if you guys could just tell I just had like a big chill go through my body yeah I could tell my body was pissed off and looking for higher doses still when I was on the five milligram but now that I'm totally off and there's no SSRIs or SNRIs in my body whatsoever that's like my system is just revolting and every way possible to get my attention so these past four or five days have been especially brutal to say the least my body's not really regulating temperature the right way the nausea has been pretty unbearable that's the worst part for me the zaps I think I mentioned in the last video at this point I've become pretty much non-stop I guess the best way I can describe them is it's what I imagined it would feel like if you were to stick your finger in an electric socket a dull electric socket but for the entire day or something it's a really bizarre feeling yeah not sleeping a lot not eating a lot my back and my neck are locking up a lot more than they were when I was still weaning down so some rough days but all that being said I got a couple more grams of the CBD isolate and some serendipity terpenes from the Seabee distillery a few days ago and I was planning on doing that as a review for my second video but I've been having a lot of trouble actually getting on camera to smoke anything with the level of nausea I've been having and when I do smoke it's feeling pretty tough on my body right now like the actual act of smoking so I was really really excited today to see that this package arrived with a bottle of 500 milligrams CBD t-shirt from this distillery so I'm going to review this instead could not have come at a better time I'm really excited to see how it goes um I've never tried any tinctures so this review is for you guys but I'm also pretty pumped to see what I can do myself so why don't you guys to be able to experience the whole process with me so yeah this is one of the CV distilleries new full-spectrum 15 milliliter teachers they carry at 250 milligram and a 500 milligram this one is 500 I've been getting a lot of questions about tinctures whether or not they actually work do I like them are they better or worse than dabbing and the truth is I've never tried them so I'm gonna go ahead and drop a couple probably a good number under my tongue so we can get it kind of into my system let it sit for a minute or two and then I'll come back and talk about the product so even here and just go right under my tongue okay so it's been about a minute and a half um first impressions first of all I like the taste a lot it's subtle but it has a pretty distinct hemp flavor to it if you've never tried him it's just pretty earthy and like I said though not too strong um the ingredients on the back just CBD extract hemp seed oil and MCT which is with coconut oil so we've got a high quality product here no [ __ ] you know I love that about the Seabee distillery I feel like a lot of the products that I see out there they're fun you know I mean like they seem like fun products which is cool but for me I want something that really is gonna do the job and CV distillery has not disappointed yet so far it's actually I'm kind of surprised at how fast it's working it's been about two minutes yeah and I already my nation is starting to go away which is always what amazes me about CBD and see the color of it is kind of a green Brown comes in this little glass bottle with a dropper top the size is perfect I like that it's something I could just have in my pocket or my purse in my car in a backpack super convenient that's a huge plus you know I love the isolate and it's my go-to but especially having this issue that I've been running into with not being able to smoke lately and also just not always being at home or somewhere where you can smoke I think this is a really really wonderful alternative so I like that it's super discreet it's quick it's easy to use you guys saw you can just put a couple of drops under your tongue yeah and now I'd say it's been four or five minute it's um I was shaking a lot before and that's gone down a lot I was sweating before I don't feel like I'm really as hot my body is kind of regulating a little better the knowledge is not totally gone you know don't get me wrong it's not like you use two drops and you're not gonna be sick anymore but I am interested to see if over the next half hour or hour the not completely subsides that would be cool to check out and I'll definitely let you guys know how it goes in the next video I'll probably start off with a wrap-up I guess of this team sure but um so far I can tell you that I already recommend this product coming from these past few days of not being able to actually smoke CBD and knowing how much it helps me getting this product today has been really really exciting and yeah I hope that this review helps you guys out if you guys are looking to buy some tincture or check out the CB distillery please check out the link in the description of this video and as always if you have any questions feel free to hit me up in the comments have a great one", "hO37ah9h_nc": "it's part of my morning routine i go to the gym come home take my vitamins drink my tea take my 25 milligrams of cbd and go about my day a lot of the stuff that i had been taking a lot of the cbd was very himpy this goes down so easy you don't have to chug anything afterwards i can just take it like on the go wherever i am did you take cbd today of course how do you think i'm gonna survive this podcast i think it's definitely gonna get us through", "t1IDW45TEgk": "all right what's going on guys set here back at it again with another video and today in this video I wanted to do a review on this CBD oil right here in this cannabidiol or broad spectrum hemp extract that I've been using here for the last few weeks and so this is from a company called Manitoba harvest all right so this is broad spectrum and I've been using it like I said for the last few weeks and tracking my deep sleep with my word ring also suggests objectively speaking and yeah taking a few droppers of this before bed my sleep the last few weeks especially my deep sleep has been very very good I've been getting over about two hours and 30 minutes of deep sleep which is almost every night for the last few weeks and my sleep has been really tremendous so yeah I really haven't tried to be honest too many CBD products I know that for the most part just hearing all about the benefits and how a lot of professional athletes especially like in the PGA Tour and the MLB they use CBD to be able to get better sleep at night to be able to wake up with more energy lower inflammation really just help you tap into that parasympathetic state the rest and digest and so forth so I figured I'd give it it give it a shot and so yeah taking the CBD it just I felt really relaxed I like to take it well I have been taking it in the evenings so when I get back from the gym I'll just take it after dinner that's generally the the timing that I use and then yeah it just it puts you in a really good mood I've noticed and this so this looks like it's co2 extracted and this this company I had a lot of really great reviews I got it from thrive market and you can actually get an additional 25% off your first purchase and they're a really cool membership website actually have on their site it's like Amazon meets Whole Foods where they ship you all your groceries straight to your door free of charge and it just shows up and you just yeah you don't have to go to the grocery store or anything so that's make sure you go ahead and check that out and anything they sell everything is organic you know has ton of different tremendous values and so forth so I love thrive market but that's where I pick this up so yeah overall taking the CBD you know it's pretty pricey but I think that it's you know maybe just taking it on the days that you really need to make sure that you're recovering from your workouts if you're really getting after it with the weights maybe you're playing a sport or something like that I definitely say give it a shot so yeah if you have if you have tried CBD I'll

back to my channel if you're new welcome I'm having an upcoming webinar called what you need to know about CBD for dogs and cats you can click the link in the box below for more information the CBD II it stands for cannabidiol it is the largest component of the hemp plant and it's the non psychoactive component before you start giving this to your pooch or your kitty cat there's a number of things you should be aware of first you know what's the source do you really know where those plants have come from you know is it a company that had actually growing their own plants are they just you know outsourcing it getting it from the cheapest available seller they may say it's organic but how do you really know so what you want to look for is verified third-party testing and that they're using a thing called green extraction methods you want to make sure that the using co2 to break down you know there's green plant leafy material to then extract that essential oil companies are they're cutting corners will you'd solvent such as acetone and residues of those solvents can then still be in the CBD oil and they themselves can be carcinogenic summer even neurotoxins the point one his third-party testing [Music] a second if you're going to be giving CBD oil to your dog your cat you want to make sure that's a whole plant extract think about it like taking vitamin C and is it more nutritious take a vitamin C tablet or eat an orange clearly is eating the orange of which I will proceed to do now maybe kill the orange summer break there are no native crazy combos this is based on a principle called the entourage effect you've got over a hundred and different separate ingredients within the canvas plant and those can all interact with each other in a very positive way going so much further in terms of promoting health and wellness that in your dog or cat versus the Dyke just singly isolating a single part a single compound and expecting that to do the same thing so if you're not clear just think orange better versus tablet not so good accurate dosing and this is one of my pet peeves I've actually treated a number of animals with cannabidiol also with THC but anytime I'm using one of these liquid tinctures it has been so difficult to get an accurate dose so you want to look for companies which are using like a medical grade tincture bottle where one drop can be carefully measured and is accurate so as you can see here with this think to your bottle my actually CBD tincture bottle one drop is one drop and you can clearly give the exact amount [Music] for what is the carrier oil so what that means is CBD comes are very concentrated from the hemp plant and a thing called the carrier oil is then added in to help with dilution also help to preserve it and make it easier for you to dose it adequately to your dog or cat most people are using this mzt oil there's a couple problems with that first of all many animals as with many people can get stomach upset from MCT oil last thing you want to have is be dosing your dog or can they're having vomiting vomiting and/or diarrhea secondly you're also asking the body to them metabolize it completely different oil from a completely different plant so if you're gonna have the you know the best benefit from using CBD cannabidiol you want it to also come from the hemp plant so in my opinion the ideal carrier oil this is hemp seed oil v can there be any drug interactions it's a great question most the sites you're gonna read on the internet safe on there's zero interaction but that being said cannabidiol is metabolized in the liver by an enzyme called cytochrome p450 and many of the veterinary drugs that your dog or cat may be on are also metabolized by that same enzyme but fortunately most dogs and cats that are on CBD they're on a low enough dose that there should not be any significant interactions so if you're dosing your dog or cat this suggests the dose of about one milligram per 10 pounds of body weight in all likelihood there won't be any significant interactions but there can be so always talk to your veterinarian before you're gonna start on CBD so if your dog or cat is in on any other veterinary medications two most common veterinary drugs that use the same enzyme the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs metagame REM Adele etc along at the corticosteroids you know such as prednisone so if your pet is on either one of those meds and there's other ones just like heart medications etc you can discuss this with your veterinarian what's the best way to be giving CBD cannabidiol to your dogs or cats it edibles you know you just squirt it into the mouth we're on a bitter there food just encourage them to eat it a CBD in an oil form is best absorbed just on your pets comes or just underneath the tongue because ideally what we want to do is bypass the stomach get higher blood levels also make it easy to give to your dog or cat you guys how easy it is to give tutuila her dose is actually one drop twice a day so she's on it support one drop is two point four milligrams I'm gonna put it on my finger and I'm just gonna rub it on your gums good girl cuz then you're gonna absorb more of that and it's gonna get into your bloodstream quicker making you feel a little bit better there okay - laughs you love the hemp seed oil you over the CBD oil you feel like their little Rastafarians nelson dog don't you good girl yes [Music] point number seven does it allow for topical absorption Murray here's a great example many cats are really difficult to get anything into their mouths or orally especially in an ongoing basis there's some research showing that CBD to be beneficial for animals with diabetes Marv he's been getting a drop a day so not only can I just put it orally put a drop of my finger and I can put this Murray you stick around and get a cap and a drop in here either I'll show him how easy it is just to put it in transdermally okay and because this CBD is decarboxylated there Murray I didn't have to put anything into your mouth well thank you guys so much for watching this edition of venery secrets I really encourage you to

talk about the age-old question full-spectrum versus isolate we've all either bought both products and one works better than the other whatever it may be but I'm here to talked about full spectrum and why it is proven to be better for most of all of our customers typically whenever you're dealing with a full spectrum product you have a variety of cannabinoids within the implant that you're giving within our oil with an isolate CBD product all you are getting is straight isolate so all the entourage effect does not come into play whenever you're doing with the CBD isolate product so as I'm pulling this poker chip you see every single other cannabinoid that's coming with it that is a full-spectrum product but if you are looking at a isolate product this is what its gonna look like so as you can see only one cannibal is coming coming with it and it is just CBD so that is the easiest way to really describe the differences between CBD full-spectrum and CBD pure isolate products so if you guys ever do have any questions we're always here here at access labs to not for you to give a quick call to and we're always here to help thanks", "iaxR6ES7hdM": "hi everyone I'm Shana king with

benefits like overall calmness it'll help relieve stress it's great after you work out and you go to the gym all the time it really helps reduce inflammation I love it taking it right before bed

a dropper and that's how you consume it into your body or your bloodstream and today I'm going to show you how simple it is to use the Green compass CBD tinctures [Music] if we were meeting for the first time my name is Kristy Nash and I am an attorney turned entrepreneur I practiced commercial litigation for about 15 years and today and no longer practice law I run two businesses from home thanks to technology and social media I love what I do now because I get to help other people like you also build online businesses because you deserve something for you so CVD tinctures you've probably heard the term and maybe got a little confused is it a tincture isn't an oil what's the difference they're pretty much the same thing I think the tincture is just a fancy way of saying CBD oil and a green compost level we have variety of tinctures depending on different strengths we have 500 milligrams all the way up to 2,500 milligrams we also have different flavors with our teachers we have a natural that has no extra flavoring in it whatsoever it's just a natural CBD extract along with the carrier oil and the MCT oil and then we also have a citrus flavor that is flavored with a citrus essential oil we also have a mint flavor and a cinnamon flavor which is by far my favorite all of our flavorings are created with essential oils and people often ask me when do I take my CBD tincture and the answer to that is it's going to vary depending on the person and depending on why we were using CDD so for example if you are taking a CBD teacher because of some anxiety during the day stress during the day to boost your overall mood or energy level during the day then I would recommend you take it in the morning I keep this on my bathroom counter and I take it after I brush my teeth if you are using it maybe for sleep insomnia maybe you have anxiety when you put your head lay your head on the pillow and and it keeps you up at night then I would recommend you take it more in the evening however not right before you go to bed maybe a couple of hours before you go to bed for those issues if you're using it for pain for sore muscles you know that's gonna vary during the day when you might need it most but I do always recommend that you take your CVD teacher on a regular basis it should be a part of your everyday wellness routine because there are so many health and wellness benefits to CVD some of which you probably didn't even know you needed I've heard so many stories of people taking the CVD for maybe some pain in their knee and then they realized that they were suffering from anxiety and major stress during the day and taking the CBD for their knee actually helped them in that area of their life as well so always recommend you take their tincture on a consistent basis so there is simply our tinctures come in a bottle with a dropper and the dropper has measurements so our dropper at its full capacity is 1.0 MLS and then you can drop them down until you get your desired measurement amount right now we're at 0.75 drop a little more out we're about at point five and then here we are at just about 0.25 MLS and you simply just use the dropper find your desired amount and the way you consume the tincture is you drop it under your tongue that is the best and fastest way to get it into your bloodstream you do want to let it sit under your tongue for about 60 seconds and absorb before you swallow but that is how simple it is to use the Green compass local CBD tinctures I love of the dropper have some measurements on there for you and also all of our bottles come with a very clear label on the backside know exactly what is in your bottle you know how many milligrams of the CBD hemp flower extract exactly is in this bottle and then you also can scan the QR code at the bottom of everything kompis global product to show you immediately a lab analysis aport that comes from a third-party lab all of our products are tested by a third-party low so that's it that's how simple it is let me know in the comments if you've tried a CBD tincture yet and if so what for and make sure you check out my other videos about grand combis global CBD in particular and make sure you check out my show notes because I have a freebie there for you that gives you a lot of information on what you should know before you choose your CBD if you found this information helpful don't forget to give me a thumbs up and let me know and I always appreciate when you share my content or subscribe to my channel because that helps me help you with future videos", "DCbCrqtqvyc": "[Music] hi guys it's Brandi from green wellness life thought I would chat with you a little bit today about capsules they do come in different sizes strengths and variations and I get a lot of questions about those and what the differences are because there can be some different price points as well I do also have a lot of people ask me that if taking CBD in a capsule is just as good as taking it in a tincture or a raw extract form you know my answer is generally the best CBD is the one that you'll actually take every day so if you know yourself and you know that that grassy earthy hemp flavor that comes from a tincture a raw extract is not for you know you're just not comfortable taking it in a liquid and you'd rather take a capsule then by all means do it the capsules can take a little longer to get to work for you just because your body has to digest them before the CBD can start to do its thing but the end result should be the same for you whether you're taking it from a tincture or a capsule so I might say that I've got three basic variations of capsules soft gels traditional powder capsules and then what I call a hybrid which is kind of somewhere in between the two so soft gels I have right here is from Entourage oops almost ripped it this is just encapsulated hemp oil you can see it's kind of a light and amber color it's squishy and if I were to stick a knife in the end of this guy then that oil would squeeze right out so I actually have some customers that say that they like to buy these capsules just because they know their serving size because those milligrams are sat per capsule so they actually buy these I'm just a competitor a knife in the end squeeze it out under their tongue and go on about their day so I have soft gels from Entourage from Tuesday hemp oil and also from Plus CBD so these are just the traditional hemp oil extract that's been encapsulated next one is or the other end of the spectrum I guess we should say is the traditional powdered capsule and that is just what it sounds so this has been through more processing to take that CBD oil and get it down to a powder to stay and then fill up these little Koen capsule guys so this is been a little bit more processed these are from plus CBD great product super popular and a little bit lower price point but it is it is surprising to some people to see that it really is a powdered capsule so really traditional then we've got what I call the hybrid in dhoka falls into this category as does CBD FX so that's another one that I would call a hybrid so looks more like that first softgel a little bit squishy but you wouldn't be able to just stick a knife in the end and squeeze the oil out there's more of a paste and this it's a little bit thicker consistency paste like but not full powder and capsule so kind of somewhere in between the two those I have in all different variations I've got 10 25 and 50 milligrams strengths so I think it's an easier way likely for the manufacturer to take that humble extract not worry about thinning it out or adding any oil carriers to make it a soft gel but kind of leave it as sort of that waxy middle ground definitely thinner and not powdered but not a full-on soft gel so those are kind of the three variations personally I prefer a soft gel or in that middle hybrid which I'm sure is not actually what they call it but that's because I'm kind of a baby and I don't like to take regular capsules it's just not my preference as a human so I like the soft gels but everybody has their own their own preference and in their own best way which is why we do carry multiple variations because they want to make sure that there's something for everybody so I hope that this helped a little bit and I hope that you have an awesome day always email or give me a coffee you've got any questions that email is support at green wellness live.com support at green wellness live.com or you can always give me a buzz at eight eight eight seven seven two seven eight seven five thanks so much make it a great day [Music]", "EUXkqNkw2Nw": "Green compass CBD is the new standard of well-being and tinctures are our

would have been the CBD gummy review from C with the FX um I reached out to this company see buddy new new leaf Naturals has a large variety of see woody products the product that I'm going to be reviewing today is the 240 milligram kind of cannibal oil it is point 17 and fluid ounces also 5 milliliters as you can see it comes in small L bottle has a dropper like mostly buddy bottles do and has the serving size on the back with the recommended serving which if you can see it says that it's about ten drops and there's ten servings I don't know if that's going to focus in there you go so besides ten drops servings per bottle approximately ten when I did test a full a full squeezed drop dropper has about jobs in it one nice thing about the dropper in this is unlike most shoppers it has the nice little glass almost like a Prince Rupert's drop on it now from first opening it one thing I will say is it definitely smells more fragrant than a lot of the CVD oils I've had smells similar to marijuana but there's you oh the absolute bare minimum oh it's all natural with no additives or preservatives made from non-gmo hemp plants going on slight funds within Colorado where the company is based out of it's a hundred percent organic no herbicides pesticides or chemical fertilizers were used and this this one is legal with in all 50 states of the US and over 40 countries worldwide a the cotton the product is concentrated to approximately 50 milligram cannabinoids per milliliter of oil so one drop of this is about two point four milligrams of CBD and there's roughly a hundred drops within the bottle what a lot of people tend to do with this oil is drop it under the tongue and usually hold it there for anywhere between 30 to 90 seconds I'm going to give it a shot to put a lot of people say that it can happen within 10 minutes other people say they feel the effects within the hour um you could also mix this within lotion and it's you could also use it as an acne treatment it's been known to help with that again if you didn't watch my last video I have a lot of twitches in my shoulder and legs so I've been using see woody products to combat combat that and the CBD gummies worked well I started they lose the they started losing their effects kind of quicker than I was hoping so I decided to reach out to new leaf to see if they want to collaborate with me and they sent me this tester bottle which is one of the ones they sell on the website so I told them I'd give it a try give a review of it and let my viewers know what I think of it so go ahead and give it a try I've not tried this yet so I'm not sure what to expect flavor-wise I know some CD can be very bitter five six seven I saw ya I said a full dropper usually holds anywhere between 25 to 30 drops I took I'm gonna do 15 drops worth so roughly 15 drops so probably about half a dropper I'm gonna say is a anywhere between 10 to 15 drops and I'll see how it goes so it's gonna be quiet for the next 30 seconds so enjoy the background you you all right I kept it there for about 30 seconds again it doesn't have much of a taste to it I want to say it's an earthy flavor but it it tastes like it smells not as potent but there's a little bit of a taste to it has a has an oily texture to it like I can feel it on my lips it's similar to olive oil I would put it at oh yeah the taste is in bed the price for the product isn't terrible either this one retails on the website for this exact bottle retails for thirty eight thousand fifty cents there's over six thousand reviews of it and instead of Fawna half stove four and a half out of 5 star rating so a lot of positive comments on it and yeah I'm hoping that this works a lot better than the gummies did when I weigh I am the dingo ate my vape

Moringa tree is edible and good for you good for your immune system good for your stomach good for your skin helps with edema and then on top of that it's got the CBD why am I talking specifically about this brand because I'm having a really rough day with my nerves and my my neck it pinched something about half an hour ago and my I couldn't stop the shaking in my head which was minor and you wouldn't be able to see I have two bottles of CBD and more one is 1000 milligrams now there's lots of companies out there that make 1000 milligrams - guess what sometimes a thousand milligrams isn't enough to stop your pain or the nerve damage or the shaking that's going on even in my hands kind of currently right now so but that is the life I have to deal with and what I have to deal with now so when a thousand milligrams isn't enough five thousand milligrams is what I have to turn to is once again this is CBD so I'm not getting stoned I'm not getting high I can still function like a normal human being and go about my day but if it wasn't for the 5,000 milligrams my CBD and more I wouldn't even meet in my truck right now riding along with my sister to go run errands I'd be stuck in the house in a ton and ton and ton of pain so I I love backing lots of different CD CBD products and telling you all about them and whatnot but as far as I'm concerned this is one of the better ones out there the top of the line if you have a CBD product and you think it's better than this well prove me wrong send it to me let's talk because right now CBD and more 5,000 milligrams that's that's it that's that's the stuff that's the ticket and so when when I'm having my worst days and the things are just beyond my control and no other CBD product on the market can touch what's going on with me or my pain nerve damage this is where I turn to CBD and more so go check them out and tell them down the road show since you thanks for stopping in", "QH1GEuMw8Dc": "hey this is jeremy orozco and today we are going to go on a magical journey to see if varritus farms is real faritas means truth in latin as all of us remember from latin classes during boarding school or if you didn't go to public school in the united states like me maybe you know some latin well veritas we are gonna see the truth about your cbd farm i sent veritas farms to two independent labs to see if it's real how about the product paid for the lab test you're welcome i do use affiliate links on my website disclosure but if you look at my reviews i give some of the most critical honest cbd reviews on the internet and that's because i'm really bad at business and i would rather give you the truth veritas also known as the roman goddess of truth okay let's see the lab test the price breakdown taste test strength and the good the bad and the ugly on veritas farms subscribe because uh i have more coming and you don't want to miss out on this first problem is they claim 500 milligrams but they only say full spectrum hemp and we don't know if it's milligrams of cannabinoids or cbd who are you for a truth goddess we're off to a rough start what did the labs find both labs found that they are real b scores they give a little bit more cannabinoids than suggested links below to this page to see the official lab test dive into this now they are extremely accurate if you go by cbd 500 milligrams of cbd and they are right on the money within three percent accuracy very accurate and it's full spectrum with a good amount of other cannabinoids i used to berate cbd companies for not claiming cbd amounts specific amounts but now every market place is forcing these companies to be vague and not mention the actual words cbd or cannabinoids so i guess they're okay 10 cents per milligram it's good for a fancy little farm in colorado i should note that there is no discount as you go for the bigger bottles the price per milligram stays the same so there's not much point in that there are a lot of cbd companies charging over 15 cents per milligram so 10 cents is okay you can get cbd for as low as 2 cents per milligram but just pretend i didn't say that if you like this brand the taste was excellent one of the best i've tried and i tried the watermelon it kind of tastes like between a watermelon jolly rancher or maybe a watermelon bubble gum sweet but not too sweet and no harsh taste of hemp it's amazing how far cbd companies have come they also make a peppermint which would appeal to more people and non-flavored i think i'd go for the peppermint because i'm not the candy watermelon guy but it does taste great if you're into that sort of thing i don't judge the strength 17 milligrams is a good starting point 0.6 milligrams of thc won't have side effects for most people i would say but may provide some additional benefits to the cbd see the entourage effect for that i would go as far as to say that you can take this and still jump over a moving vehicle if that's your hobby without delayed reactions from thc but always check with your your doctor first before jumping over moving vehicles while using cbd with thc just remember i said that when you end up in the hospital specifically so you don't sue me i have a disclaimer this is a full spectrum and has good amounts of cbc and cbg it actually has more cbg than the majority of full spectrums that i test that's pretty good i know a lot of people want to know how i feel from cbd from this cbd personally but you should never pay attention too much attention to the experience of just one person and a cbd product the effect of cbd and other cannabinoids is very very individualized on your endocannabinoid system and it can be very misleading to listen to one person so i focus on the actual data the lab test so you can find one you like and actually know what's in it veritas farms is a real farm small farm in colorado they have 140 acres they focus on sustainable farming and avoid pesticides surprisingly this little farm made it into major retailers like kroger and cvs nationwide from what i've seen this adds a lot of credibility to a cbd company and it's much more likely that they'll test well and that's what my lab tests have confirmed i didn't find anything concerning about veritas a plus better business bureau score with no negative reports in my in-depth internet search overall i think this is great for new cbd users occasional users gifs this would be a fantastic gift and i promise you that this is going to taste better than 90 percent of cbd companies out there this looks like something you would get at a spa it has a professional luxury look that still says hey i'm a natural little farm here but i keep my barn clean clean packaging and logo small farms are great because they have full control over their products the consistency the same strain and cannabinoids they're not just buying cheap cbd from thousands of different farms growing with questionable methods and pesticides and whatnot if you met some cannabis farmers you know what i'm talking about they are not however going to compete with the giant companies they can offer super super cheap cbd if you didn't know hemp is becoming very cheap right now so a lot of small farms like this one are struggling so if you want to support a small business and get a luxury cbd product for you or a great gift i think this is great they also make gummies capsules topicals skin care and cbd for pets that is it check the links below for more info i will see you next time", "rQlKO3jt7kQ": "welcome to smoking legal well

reviewed next that's not what we're here for today what we're here for today is when i saw this they had made a post about this on instagram saying that it was coming i had to have it i had to have it this is their full spectrum tincture oh now i've had that tincture before but i have not had this one this is the what if i'm not mistaken this is the one fluid ounce 30 milligram this is 5 000. [Music] [Music] z 5 000 milligrams that was my own slow motion effects let me know how i did this is my uh 5 000 milligrams of the cotton candy oh my god oh my god i've been waiting on this i've been waiting on this one black tie has some of the best tissue that i've had period i am a fan i am an absolute fan of their lemon ginger they have a lemon ginger tincture that is amazing uh also they have a they have an espresso tincture that i really like i put the espresso tincture in my coffee it's time for the murder knife again to get this little plastic thing off this little whatever that is get that off it was really giving me problems it was really giving me problems okay so i was saying that they have an espresso tincture that i really like i put the espresso tincture in my coffee um the lemon ginger tea tincture one it tastes really good on the tongue under the tongue it has a nice flavor to it the espresso does too it really tastes like coffee that's why i just drop it in the coffee but trip off this i like the lemon ginger tincture and i put drops of that i put that in my whisky it's amazing i put that lemon ginger tincture in my jack daniel's whiskey and voila you now have cbd infused whiskey thank me later okay but we are here for the full spectrum 5000 milligram cotton candy tincture now a lot of people ask me what do i do about how do i handle my anxiety during the day and being that i can't smoke during the day well i could now because i'm off work right uh but when i was working you know you can't smoke during the day or at least i couldn't i guess you could if you had a crate but something about smoking during the day makes me a little bit lazy but i can take the tinctures and i am focused the anxiety comes down i am ready to go into the meeting i was in uh an account executive for the company that i worked for in nashville constantly in meetings constantly speaking to people and in front of people drove my anxiety crazy uh but as long as i had me some tincture on hand like if i get ready to go into a building uh to speak to one of the facilities managers or something like that i could take a couple drops of tincture voila good to go great if i'm getting ready to have a meeting i could use the tincture i know within about five or ten minutes it's gonna kick in calm me completely down and have me ready for the meeting so one i know the tincture works i love that i'm more here for the taste i'm going to tell you about the fix as well but i want to know how good this tastes because the effects i know tincture is great for anxiety absolutely one hundred percent i love tincture for anxiety we're going to read the dosage it says start with a half a dropper half of one of these wait for the effects to begin increase as desired for optimum results for best application drop in mouth hold for 20 seconds before swallowing that is the best device i've i've seen people who have used the tincture they'll take the tincture swallowed done done and they're wondering why the effects haven't kicked in or why it's taking so long for the best effects with this tincture like i said start with the half a dropper i'm gonna start with i could do a whole drop but i'm gonna follow the directions i'm gonna start with the half a dropper wait 15 to 20 seconds it says 20. wait 15 to 20 seconds before you swallow then give it a minute so let's do that i'm excited i'm excited black tie has really done a great job with the flavors like i said that uh the espresso really tastes like coffee the lemon ginger you can really taste the lemon and the ginger in it and this is the 5 000 milligram cotton candy now it says start with a half since i've used tincture before i'm gonna use a whole dropper okay let's go up under the tongue i don't put mine on top of the tongue go up under the tongue [Music] [Music] okay okay okay now i'm going to talk about the taste water fix again needless to say needless to say if you don't like cotton candy this is 100 a no for you you're not gonna like it you can definitely definitely taste the cotton candy taste which is kind of you know cotton candy-ish to say the least like how do you explain cotton candy to someone who's never can't have cotton candy no more who's never had cotton candy um it's like trying to describe pizza to someone who's never had it cotton candy is sweet it is i wish pink was a flavor because it when you think cotton candy you think about the pink one yeah comes in different colors but you know when you think cotton candy you automatically like pink cotton candy it's sweet um it's a candy taste uh it's sweet it's candy doesn't taste like cotton at all like my shirt is 100 cotton and it does not taste like my shirt tastes way better so it's sweet and candy-ish um it does it does have a bit of an aftertaste it the aftertaste is more hmm the aftertaste has like like a like a tart taste to it like you know the cotton candy comes in strong boom in your face the aftertaste i would have to say that aftertaste tastes more like cotton like just a just like a a funny little aftertaste not a not a nasty taste per se or no or a bad taste or anything like that but it does have an aftertaste um but the cotton candy part of it the sweetness of it it makes me want to take another dropper full it does it really does it makes me want to take another dropper because yeah i like that that taste i'm gonna tell you what else it says on here let me put this back on there good before i spill my [ __ ] tincture it says black tie tinctures are made with full spectrum hemp oil made from pesticide free industrial hemp and mct oil medium chain triglycerides we use mct oil so the cannabinoids absorb as effectively as possible into your system this full spectrum tincture contains a full range of cannabinoids such as cbd cbn cbg cbda as well as citrus terpenes that's the aftertaste it's kind of tart like it was tart it's it it i guess i would consider that kind of citrusy because it it it's like it wants to be citrus but you know how have you had an orange that wasn't completely like super sweet yet it doesn't taste bad it's just not sweet you can taste the orange and tartness of the orange but it just doesn't have that sweetness that's the aftertaste that must be those citrus terpenes because it's kind of tart not really sweet citrus terpenes just the tart citrus terpenes but i love the fact that it has cbd cbn cbg and cbda as well and now that i've been talking for a second it's kicking in it's kicking in it's a it's it's calming it is like i said it this is this is what i'm used to i'm used to being able to like i would be in my i'll be in my work vehicle before i get ready to go into a building to go have a meeting or to go talk with someone i do a dab of tincture fix my face make sure i don't got anything in my nose or anything you know that's embarrassing when you got a a booger or some snot in your nose or something uh so i was sitting in the car i would do that take my tincture check myself out in the mirror make sure i'm good to go swag then i would go in and have my meeting and by the time i would go in and get ready to have the meeting the tincture has kicked in and i'm calm i'm good to go i'm ready to interact with other human beings and talk sophisticatedly and i feel good i feel a little uh here's the thing about tinctures tinctures don't make me lazy like making sure that i have a sativa or an indica you know you want that sativa that's going to give you that upbeat feeling indicators will give you more of a chill relaxed lazy feel with with uh tinctures you don't have to worry about that it keeps you in a good mood uh it's gonna calm you down it's gonna calm that anxiety tremendously and you're just gonna be good to go i definitely definitely uh if you're into tinctures now i know some people who just do not fool with tinctures at all at all and that's all right they just prefer to have this the flower to smoke hey cheers to you my dear friend but to those of you who are looking for something to use during the day or those of you who can't smoke or have a friend or someone that would love to get into cbd uh for the uh medical uh benefits of it but they just don't want to be smoking the tincture is the way to go it will definitely do the job it's going to calm that anxiety and you're going to be feeling great like don't do the tiger you did salute as we say on smoking legal keep it positive or keep it pushing keep it positive or keep it pushing a more", "eNxZDSGqdHI": "[Music] guys I'm not even sponsored by muscle Mac I literally post about eating this stuff so much cuz it's one of my favorite snacks and they hit me up on histogram dee Hanson sent me this whole box of three and each one of these boxes there's 40 grams of protein 2 servings each if you guys like crafts mac and cheese this muscle Mac stuff tastes exactly like crafts in my opinion and it has high protein that's much a healthier option so if you do like mac and cheese give this stuff a try guys his bomb and like I said this is not a promotional deal no strings attached I really just freaking love this stuff whoa guys I almost forgot something what is going on aliens so I'm actually about to talk about something it's gonna be very controversial that a lot of you may not even agree with me with but I hope you can at least respect my opinions because always respect yours guys I am a supporter of medical marijuana I think there are a lot of scientific medical benefits and overall health benefits behind medical marijuana you sink and help with chronic pain it can help with diseases it can help with inflammation anxiety a ton of problems that you may be experiencing with your life I know a lot of people who use medical marijuana and it significantly helps improve and enhance their whole quality of life so I hope you guys connect leave open your minds to do some research if you're very against weed I think we got a terrible rep because smoking obviously smoking is not good for you and then also people when they smoke and get high they are completely demotivated they can't do anything with their lives so they basically just become bombs and come back couch potato and that's when it becomes a problem but I'm not trying to get into the pros and cons of medical marijuana use right now what I am going to talk about is my process using CBD and hemp oil because I am huge fans of these products and what you have to understand is CBD hemp oil it does not get you high that is such a big common misconception THC in weed is what gets you high there is no THC or very minor traces in CBD oil and in hemp there's actually no THC so you're not getting high what you do get from CD and hemp oil is a body relaxation but it is not gonna make you dysfunctional or unable to do other aspects of your life so say you're trying to do work cv oil is not gonna screw up your mentality so you're not able to get your work done now if you're wondering the difference between CBD and hemp oil CBD oil is extracted from the whole cannabis plant which can have more minor traces of THC in it where hemp oil is derived from the seeds of the cannabis plant which is not likely to have any THC in the product and another point you should know about CBD and hemp oil is it will not show up on your standard drug test it does not change your mentality THC of weed is what changes your mentality makes you feel all space-bound and lamping out but CBD and hemp oil it is made for medical benefits and has a ton of recovery aids and a lot of other benefits I'm gonna get into right now before I give it to my favorite products I want you guys to understand that I am sponsored by Arab strong and I want that point to be known because I'm not trying to [ __ ] lie to you guys this is actually what I believe in and it's a company I really do support so let me talk about why I support it and how I actually feel difference with it the oil guys I just drop five drops under my tongue okay huh no you let's sit on your tongue for a minute this is full spectrum hemp oil recovery drops I'll take five drops in the morning and five drops before I go to bed and the reason I like taking in the morning is because it really helps with my anxiety during the day guys I do a ton of [ __ ] during the day and this literally helps me just relax and go through the motions of my day much smoother that's my experience with in the morning and the reason I love taking is before bed is it helped me fall asleep sometimes I have a really hard time going to bed you know I'm one of those people who fix a thousand stories and thinks about my day and thinks about all the things happening tomorrow before I go to bed so I've all these thoughts wrapping around my head and they want to try to go to sleep I'm thinking about trying to go to sleep so now I can't think go to sleep because I'm thinking about go to sleep so it's just like ah [ __ ] so that's why this has really helped me just relax and it helped me fall asleep faster and then when I wake up the next day I feel better now here's the full spectrum hemp oil recovery cream this is stuff you saw me get in the mail now when I first heard of hemp oil or CBD oil as cream I was like that's ridiculous that's never gonna work as [ __ ] this stuff has been the biggest life for me as you guys know my quads were absolutely killing me before my pal ting me I was putting this stuff on three times a day before my meet and come me time I hit a new swap yard my meet now every time after I work out I rub this cream salt to show you an example of rubbing it on take a look I'll rub it on with my form right here you literally just rub it into your skin it's that simple there's no smell or anything like that guys we wrap it in but I really love this stuff because it significantly has helped me at least with my joint pain my overall muscle pain it's really just helped my muscles recover faster and get rid of any inflammation I may have so I highly recommend this product especially for everyone who lifts because it really has helped me make a difference and helps me just feel significantly better after I use it I didn't use this for a while because I was a little nervous about a drug test with C because I wasn't too sure but I did a lot of research on it and I actually bought my a standard drug tested like check for myself because I really do love using the CBD oil and hemp oils but what I did notice guys is when I stopped using this product I was more sore so I can honestly say that this has made a difference for me and I would recommend it if you're someone who has inflammation or hoho I almost forgot a huge point guys I know a bunch of grandmas I got my mom on this stuff they use this for arthritis this has been a huge help to my mom I noticed that obviously is my mom so I can say like personally I know for a fact this is gonna significantly help a lot of her long-term problems because it's been progressing worse for her and now she's been using it it's really made a huge difference for her arthritis she just feels less pain from arthritis it's actually really crazy how that works so I really do recommend this product and I'll put a link in the first minute comments what's the description to herbs wrong because like I said guys it is something I support I know I'm sponsored by the company but listen to what I'm saying cuz I [ __ ] mean this and another reason I wanted to have this honest talk with you guys is not to promote a product but to talk about CBD and hemp oil in general because a lot of people think oh [ __ ] that's drugs guys to me it's another supplement it's like taking pre-workout it's like taking protein powder it's a supplement that's helping me enhance my daily aspect of life and it's also helping me with my lifting goals so it's supplements to what I'm already doing with life and I do recommend it because it's benefiting me I also do want to personally say thank you to herbs strong they really make me feel welcome to their team check out this little letter they gave me thank you for your order we are thrilled to have you on the team please let us know if there's anything we can help with little things leave the big things guys it's something small like that just adding a little personal note really goes a long way with me because it shows they really value who they're working with but also that they really care about their brand and actually believe in their product that is something a lot of companies they don't I don't really get that sense from this is why I'm really proud to stand behind our F strong and support their cause because it's something I believe in as well and having a whole team behind me that makes everything so much better and so much more powerful now let's switch gears guys and talk about something I thought I'd never do I hired my first powerlifting coach Brad cool yard I always thought I'd be doing things myself but I really want to take things to a whole new level I told you pounding nationals a couple weeks ago really push me to the next level it changed my entire mentality it really humbled me and I want to give it my all to become one of the strongest people this entire country than the world and now you're probably thinking why the hell would you need a coach are you eating you don't know what you're doing no guys I freaking love coaching other people I love making workout programs I love doing dieting plans I actually considered making programming one of my specialties that being said when you get to a certain level it is really hard to self-analyze and figure out what exactly you need to do for yourself specifically to get to the next level it's great to have a second perspective an outside perspective from your own and I'll give you an example Michael Jordan guys one of if not the best basketball players of all time he had like six coaches a basketball driven coach of course a nutritionist a workout specialist even a mentality expert a bunch of different things to help him get to the next level even though yours are good at that top level guys you have to step outside yourself sometimes it's really hard to do that too it's really hard to get out of your own ego think you know what you're doing all the time thinking you're the best and just kind of humble yourself to be able to reach out to someone who can actually help you get to the next level I'm a huge advocate for programming you guys know that if you're not following a program I think it's really hard to actually progress so that's why I always advocate following the program and why you need someone else to make that program and I've really just taken a step back for myself and realize to get to the next level in power thing I want someone to make me a program I don't want to think about it I want someone to analyze my form for me so I don't have to go along in my own head try to figure out what's going on because then I just kind of Drive myself crazy guys I've been struggling with my deadlift for him for a long time it's driven me absolutely nuts I switch back and forth assuming the conventional and now I'm sticking to Sumer because I know anatomically it puts me in a stronger mechanical advantage but just I need someone to look at my form and break things down for me it helped me get better and I'm really excited to do this whole program from an outside perspective because I've never done it before it's something completely new to me and I'm expecting some serious strength games I'm ready to give it my all as I always do and see what I'm made of and it's gonna be really helpful being able to send someone else my videos of me lifting since have someone else analyzing my form and tell me what I'm doing wrong and how to fix it instead of trying to do it all myself I do this whole business and of all killings by myself I can't keep doing that with lifting - I need someone to help me out and just kind of ease the stress of the whole things and get me to that next level because I'm gonna come back with nationals next year and [ __ ] kill it and you can count on that guys so my new coach Brad and I are really gonna be putting a lot of focus on correcting my mechanics my breathing patterns overall movement pathways and also just focusing on tempo tempo is something I've never really dedicated time to I've never truly dedicated programming to working on my form just because I freaking love lifting heavy but that's the ego guy so you gotta toss that aside sometimes if we're really trying to get to the next level and I've really just up and humbled by this whole National Park experience before this national power to me I win all my power that means guys regional means I know one of the strongest people in my area and that's not I'm not trying to sound cocky it's just it's just kind of how it is but when I got to a national level with some of the best lifters in the world I didn't win and that was the best experience that could have gone through it made me understand what I needed to do to take things to a whole new level and get better and better myself and that's me guys I believe No Limits and now I'm really gonna get after it and just to avoid any possible confusion I'm obviously going to be continuing my coaching services I know it can help a ton of you guys make your games no matter what your time availability or equipment accessibility is I already have multiple clients that are making incredible results and I'm so happy for you guys it really just motivates the hell out of me being able to help someone else and make them make gains but I'm now reaching to an external source they give me an outside perspective to help me make more gains on my own and now I'm gonna go film some videos for you aliens as you guys know now Scott Hartman studio Adam plasti of New Hampshire where I used to film all of my YouTube videos that is no longer there anymore me and him had to take it apart since he moved to Florida and I moved to Boston so that's no longer an option of film I'm gonna be filming all my videos at Jimin and Watertown in that private personal training area the only thing is though right now I need to buy a new microphone I needed buy some specialized lighting in order to make that quality content otherwise it'd be completely dark and you wouldn't even hear me so it wouldn't be worth filming there right now but I'm gonna order that stuff and do some research on some of the top products I could find online but for the time being I'm gonna have to run home to my house in Lexington guys and just film some of the at home workouts dumbbell workouts and things I can do here for the time being another little situation I'm dealing with right now is my normal filmer doctor eyes and eyes you see him in a couple of my videos he's my buddy Aaron he's in optometry school so he's becoming an eye doctor and he's in midterms right now so he's crazy busy song have anyone to fill me right now so I got to do all this stuff on my own so during this little figure out period I'm gonna be filming some videos in the upstairs living room it's the most amount of open space in the house the least amount of echo and the best lighting I've actually dumped some videos in this room in the past if you recognize the room I took the middle ad workout here and a few others but I'm also gonna try to film some videos in gym it it's just I'd like to do my videos real time for these specific intense workouts as well as a few others so I do need a talk which is why I'm gonna need the mic when I do feel more videos in that personal training area over there and like I said I'm filming myself right now so I've got the tripod set up and you guys are gonna love how I've been capturing my thumbnails you ready for this but other tripod attached to the ceiling fan got to do what you got to do video releases have been a little slower for me lately which is why I wanted to explain the process I'm going through right now just trying to create these videos for you guys I'm doing my absolute best and it's gonna be so much better when I get this new equipment it's literally gonna be next-level guys the content is gonna be so dope so from Boston to Lexington and now off to Watertown to go to gym it which is the gym I lift that now I've got to do some squat work [Music] to the top wait I'm gonna go at today is 475 pounds I'm doing three sets of just two repetitions I'm really gonna be focusing on homework and embracing my course much as possible and on another know that just down with Apple music it's [ __ ] dope guys check this out anabolic annihilation play this baby no [ __ ] limits so the first may thank my coach and I feel fencing off my squad is poor engagement and breathing what we've been finding is that has I have been taking my big deep breath and before you said on the squad it's actually been results gave me losing the core engagement that's gonna cause my chest and upper back to keep or because I lose my tightness when that happens now what we're doing to fix this is I'm taking actually exhale before I get into my spot so I exhale to get my core fully engaged and then I slightly elevated my chest squeeze my upper back and this is gonna allow me to stay tight and now into the positioning to do my squad and then as I'm into this positioning I under act the barbell I'll take my big deep breath in while keeping this tightness in this core engagement and then on the sense of the squad and secondly as we work on this core engagement it's gonna allow me to get a lot more air into my lungs and we're also focusing on pushing my elbows back when I grab onto the barbell to really emphasize that tightness of my upper back we're really focusing on avoiding my chest came forward so we're focusing on coming down in the most straight bar path as possible and coming right back up in the exact same bar back [Music] so squats [ __ ] alright today guys it's gonna take a little bit of an adjustment period to get used to focusing on this core engagement of breathing well I'm actually doing the squats because when you lift in heavy you don't always think about the form so that's why it's really important to understand what strain training you don't always train as heavy as you possibly can like I can did more weight than four into 75 pounds I can't do more reps with 475 pounds of two reps but I'm just focusing on the mechanics right now so I've dropped the weight down and I'm really just trying to establish new patterns to transmit over to when I am doing those heavier weights for those heavier set scraps so after squats guys I just did some really light accessory leg work going through the motions this week the focus is on the compounds and mechanic tips that my coach and I talked about on improving so I'm really working on applying back that on Monday I start my new intense strict Palestine plan and I'm gonna be vlogging all of that guys so you know exactly my process and how things are going and it's really gonna be intense as book getting mad gains you guys like that flow I just got a haircut guys I wish that cool there I just frickin don't but I hope you're excited for this new power lifting vlog series that I'm gonna be doing I'm gonna be showing everything my training my diet I'll be showing macros calories I'm even gonna be doing body fat analysis weight management and then I'm also gonna be showing you guys body measurements of each muscle group so it's gonna be so intense and really excited to take you guys through this whole process with me I'm gonna work on actually I'm gonna probably cut down guys to an 83 kg weight class I've been competing 93 kg weight class so I'm gonna be losing weight in this process too so I'm really hoping that's gonna help me aesthetically as well as it gets stronger oh yeah bested both where else and another announcement guys over a hundred new exercises are gonna be added to exer prize his exercise library XAR prizes my workout at make sure you download it but it's gonna be added to the excess price library so you can be able to do a ton more variety with your workouts because we're gonna be

well I'll still be doing my intense workouts my tip videos all that because I know you guys freaking love that content and I love helping to my best ability so let's get them games together aliens we in the salvation oops [Music]", "hotM0FCS7kQ": "shellie welcome back to clean green being so in today's video I just kind of wanted to hop on and do a little chit chat and follow up to my most recent Instagram post to which I announced I would be embarking on a little 30 day journey to test out the broad spectrum hemp oil tincture for sleep by the brand calm by wellness so I have suffered from intermittent symptoms of anxiety and insomnia throughout my entire life and with that I have tried a variety of treatments and medications to help me with that and I just really haven't found the right option for me I have tried other CBD products in the past that just really haven't kind of worked so when I came across home by wellness after doing a lot of research on the brand itself I really thought it would be a good match because they are super clean transparent in terms of how their plants are grown where they are sourced how the product is produced and even tested so that really made me want to embark on this journey to really see if this CBD helps me with my symptoms of anxiety and insomnia so in today's video I just wanted to sit down and first talk a little bit about what CBD is and how it affects and works with our body to help with a variety of physical ailments I think DVD along with medical marijuana of course it's having a huge moment in the medical and even beauty industry I think we hear CBD all over the place CBDs than this CBDs in that but you might not necessarily know exactly what the heck CBD is and what it does not I would sit down and explain what CBD is and then of course I want to talk about calm by wellness as a brand a little bit more about who they are what they believe in in terms of their products and you a little bit more information about what they offer in terms of broad spectrum CBD products and then lastly I want to talk about how I'm going to be using this product to test whether or not it helps me with my symptoms of anxiety and insomnia over the next month so before I jump into the video I first want to kind of put a little disclaimer out there all of the information that I am providing in today's video I don't want that to serve as a replacement for medical advice from your trusted physician or natural Pathak provider always if you are starting a new supplement you know just like a new exercise routine you always want to just kind of run it by your physician first so make sure you do that again if you are looking into trying CBD products so with that little disclaimer out of the way let's just go ahead and jump right into it I first want to talk a little bit about CBB what it is what it's used for and kind of how it works in our bodies so the CBD actually stands for cannabidiol so it's an acronym for one of the chemical compounds found in the marijuana plant so of course we have THC which I think most people traditionally think of when they hear the marijuana plant right however there's also another chemical compound in the marijuana plant which is cannabidiol or CBD so together THC and CBD together they are called cannabinoids CBD cannabidiol has no psychoactive effects so you're not gonna get high from it THC does carry those psychoactive effects and you will get that high or the traditional high that you think of when smoking marijuana the Hanabi dial is used for a variety of physical ailments and it is known and it has been studied to show that it can help improve symptoms of pain of course anxiety it can help to improve your sleep it helps with inflammation and nausea there are many more symptoms and kind of ailments that CBD can help with but those are kind of the main ones that I wanted to mention the other thing that I wanted to talk about is if you're looking for a CBD product you're going to see broad-spectrum and I'm going to say that a lot too because all of home buy wellness their products are broad-spectrum you're going to see broad-spectrum and isolate CBD product I say full-spectrum CBD products what I mean by that is these products contain all of the cannabinoids outside of THC in that product so there are different cannabinoids which I will kind of list here as a scrolling list because they're mouthfuls but in addition to cannabidiol broad spectrum CBD products contain these other cannabinoids that help to really work with the body's endocannabinoids system so without getting too technical we have naturally-occurring cannabinoids in our brain and when we introduce external cannabinoids such as CBD it helps to enhance the efficiency of our internal cannabinoids to help maintain homeostasis it is a really great compound that works along with our brain it doesn't really bind to receptors it just kind of helps enhance again those internal endocannabinoids that we already have so that it can help improve certain symptoms that we may be experiencing if you really want the best effects from a CBD product you do want to lean towards broad-spectrum products versus I they're kind of only getting one cannabinoid versus all of the cannabinoid proper so in terms of calm by wellness they produce full spectrum CBD products they are based out of our vine California they have a variety of CVD products such as gummies they of course have tinctures for sleep and just general calm they have topicals and they also have CBD products for your pets which i think is really amazing they are super transparent they have locally sourced farmers to which they produce the actual plant out of Oregon Northern California and Colorado their actual production plant is I think within 10 miles from the calm by wellness headquarters so they are super hands-on in terms of the production of their product they are involved in all steps of the process some other CBD brands they outsource their farmers they don't have access to the products being produced and a lot of them don't have any sort of safety testing calmed by wellness has third party safety testing so you can actually review this report on their website it shows you and it just breaks down exactly what they're testing when they are trying to see how safe this product is they look for things like pesticides this does not contain and a lot of other CBD companies they don't test for safety so another thing that I want to mention if you're looking into getting into CBD definitely do your research because not all CBD products are created equal they just aren't call my wellness is organic it is gluten-free it is sweetened with stevia I have the blueberry lavender flavor and it is it is so delicious a lot of CVD products taste like it's very bitter and it tastes like you are essentially eating the marijuana plant it a lot of them the taste just is not palatable however they have I think like a strawberry lemonade flavor and again this is the blueberry lavender and when I did taste this last night it was actually very lovely so I know a lot of people think CBD tastes gross and a lot of it does but this tastes really nice so again call my wellness is super pure they're really dedicated to producing the highest quality and purest form of broad-spectrum CBD products on the market again I do want to mention that this is THC free because it does not contain that specific cannabinoid so you're not going to get any psychoactive effects from these CBD product with that just based on how transparent clean and safe these products are I really thought that this was the right brand to partner with and try out their products for my anxiety and insomnia if I'm going to be ingesting it and trying it over the course of the month I want to be very sure that what i am trying is going to be safe for my body I'm not just going to try anything because I don't want to try something that could be potentially harmful that I definitely thought called by wellness was a really great fit for me personally so with that I decided to try out there as mentioned there broad-spectrum hemp extract oil for sleep it is in there blueberry lavender flavor as I have mentioned and how you're supposed to take this as you take one dropper one hour before bed each night and it is supposed to help improve anxiety and also the quality of your sleep so me personally I experience a lot of my anxiety right before bed or kind of in the evening I am go go go go go all day long so when I get home and I have time to kind of sit and kind of reflect on my day or just you know things calm down a little bit that's usually when my anxiety kind of flares up so that's why I picked the sleep version because I wanted something that would help me with my sleep and my anxiety in the evenings so when I took my first initial dose is to when I'm out under my tongue for faster absorption I really felt a sensation of calm probably 30 minutes after of taking it I didn't feel sedated I didn't feel loopy or anything like that I just felt calm and it definitely helped curb my anxiety so that is a really great sign so far so over the next month I'm going to be tracking my sleep via the sleep watch app I believe it is which is available on my Apple watch and I'll be tracking it on my iPhone as well I really want to see how my sleep quality is affected when using this product I also will be checking in intermittently to let you know how I'm feeling in terms of my symptoms of anxiety I know that's kind of a subjective thing so it's hard to give you you know objective data on that so I will just kind of touch it and let you know how I am feeling so with that definitely be sure to check back over the next month or updates I'll be posting them to my Instagram stories and then at the end of the month I'll sit down and do a full review video of this product which I have very high hopes for and especially after just an initial dose I'm really really optimistic that this can be a really great product for my anxiety and insomnia so a lot of information I just threw at you if you have any questions definitely leave them in the comments down below questions regarding CVD I'd be happy to answer them definitely check out in the meantime be calmed by Wellness website which I am listed at the bottom of my screen if you're interested in learning more about CVD and more about the brand itself so with that being said I just want

"this CBD oil is very different from all the other CBD arts so different that it's actually not even in oil and I tested the Ohio energetics full-spectrum hemp alexia for two months and here's what happened hi my name is Max and I recently interviewed work leading the founder of Ohio energetics and I also tested his full-spectrum hemp products here for the last two months the reason why I tested it first it was super hot in the summer and I didn't sleep well at night and second I just wanted to see if I take it regularly if I feel any overall health benefits so my first impressions of the products were that yeah has a nice packaging the CBD oil which is not an oil but it's very thick compared to normal CBD ODS it's yeah really like honey worse yeah CBD odds are more like oil what's interesting also the ingredients so besides hemp oil and CBD it contains also Moringa and acerola cherry the very special thing about this is that it's water-soluble it's a full spectrum and has a twenty times higher bioavailability compared to your standard CBD oil there are other water-soluble CBD products out there but this one from my knowledge so far the only full-spectrum one that is also a 100% natural one so other water-soluble products of gnu's synthetic or semi synthetic encapsulation but this one's yeah they use their own patented process and Ohio energetics to make it a fully in natural it with normal CBD oil you get the experience that just the more you take kind of the more effect you get but actually turns out that CBD works on a bell curve which means you take a little bit more you hit a peak a sweet spot and you had have a greater effect and you take more and actually you feel less effect until you take even more and get too second peak to a second sweet spot with the oh hi it's pretty interesting pretty crazy actually because you get a feedback in your mouth if you hit the sweet spot so the way you take it you put it under your tongue and you get a taste and beginning the taste is sour you take a little bit more and it starts getting sweeter and at one point it's just sweet so if you have the point where it's just sweet you either pick a sweet spot on the back row event I think it's just so cool that it's kind of a feedback mechanism inside this hemp alexia the way I take it personally and my own personal dosage is the following I took it in the morning was just a quarter of a dropper under the tongue and for me that really increases awareness and wake up feeling so what's totally new for me actually to take it in the morning cuz I always thought you know you just take it an evening to sleep but turns out you can also take it in the morning or during the day to just feel certain overall benefits from it so for me a quarter of droppers enough so I feel the first sweet spot quite fast and we'll set that that's a sign for a healthy endocannabinoid system and someone if you don't have to take that much to get to the first sweet spot in the evening and for sleep I also just take a quarter of a dropper to it the first sweet spot and it takes an evening it takes maybe 20 to 30 minutes to feel the effect in the morning it's actually different in the morning I feel it quite immediately but in the evening for sleep it takes yeah it takes longer for me to feel it I also took more to hit the second and third bell curve once in a while as an experiment at the second bell curve I often have to cough I don't know why that is it's quite weird and then the third I can't really tell what's the factors so I just stick to going to the first bugger off I don't have to take I don't have to use a lot of it just a quarter of a dropper for me and that's how I use it we'll also mentioned in our interview that you can actually take some of this hand Ballack's here under your tongue and then you sync it up with smelling at an essential oil so because you have terpenes in essential oils and every essential oil has its own terpenes or different terpenes and the cool thing is that if you sink those up in your brain through taking the CBD or under your time and then smelling at the essential oil you get different kinds of effect which is quite interesting so you can either get like a more sharpened alertness effect or more relaxed effect depending on which essential oil you smell with the CBD you will find more emphasis on that in the for interview with the world my girlfriend also trial tried it out a couple of times the fact that I could notice was that it really relaxed my muscles after a short while they stood her menstruation of cramps which I get regularly or once a month and I used it for that too usually I took a painkiller I just once once per month and this time I used CBD oil and step because I was curious what it could do yes it did I didn't take opinion the price for this at the moment is 75 dollars in the official energetics shop which might seem yeah it costs more than your standard CBD oil but I think you have to to really think about the effect cuz this has 250 milligrams of CBD inside and with the 20 times bioavailability you would have to buy 10 of your average 5% CBD hemp oils to get the same effect as you have with one bottle of these so I think the price is quite fair and you can actually save 60% on it if you use my coupon code Mac sack you can use it in the official low energetics shop which is linked down below so yeah you save some money on it and get some comma points for helping me because I'm affiliated with oh I and they pay me a small commission when you use the coupon code Mac sack and you also say 16 percent on it if you want to see the full interview with the founder of our energetics will Clayton check it out here on my YouTube and you can also find other bio hacking experiments and reviews on my youtube if you watch that for give it a thumbs up and thank you for watching", "1dNvaCjGR18": "I bought this product to see if it would help me with my arthritis it's by sunflora it's got 0% THC and I'm not sure if anybody else is having this problem but the dropper up here and I'll show you as you're tightening down the lid literally comes up and I've had it actually almost off the bottle and this stuff is $90 for this one fluid ounce it was $90 so you sure don't want to have any issues with that so at the place that I bought it at the guy said oh we've never heard of that I took it in and showed them you know don't know anything about that you know this is the first he's heard of it said he put something up on the company's there there their website to check and I hadn't gotten any feedback so I actually have ended up calling the company a little hard to get ahold of when I actually got a hold of him spoke to a lady who said no they weren't aware of this or at least she wasn't and said she would look into it so I thought I would do this video and give them the link to this so they can actually see it's easier to show than it is to describe what it is and if anybody else is having this issue okay so I don't have this lid snug down but this is what happens when right now it's just loose so when you turn this and snug it down you see what happens and the other day I literally had this corner out of the cap had this thing tipped over in my medicine cabinet and I went to pull it out or if I would have dropped it could a lost content of some of the contents or all of it this stuff is $90 a bottle so the other day when I took it out of the medicine cabinet it literally was out something like this when I put it back together that evening and stuck it back up there I apparently just had noticed that it had done this but it was up just like that so I just pulled out the tube and pulled this out and then just brought it back through the stopper like this you pull it there and it seats it's got that groove that it seats in to that undercut and then there is an undercut in the rubber plunger that this sets in and then you just simply push it in just like that and it's that simple all right and to be fair about this I did call the lady said that they would send me a couple of new of those droppers the plunger so when I get those I will check those out and see if they are the same way but in the meantime I will send this link to sunflora so they can have a better view of what I'm talking about and perhaps this was just an anomaly but I would find it hard to believe that I was the only one that had this issue throughout the country and hopefully it's something that they don't have an issue with", "uBdHOJoj6Bo":

with the clean urine sample which is what we did so this is what you take see believe ten days the video hi I'm David I love fitness wellness and all things CBD this is my office this is my temple and this it's all green TV is it a banger what's happening this David it's all green TV now other people worry if taken see buddy is gonna make them grow fail a drug test well we talked about it in other videos I thought proofs in the pudding so what have I done over the last 10 days I've been taking see 20 50 milligrams every single day and here's what happens now I want to show you that I've completely clear system beforehand so I've taken a test in advance we're gonna check back in the overlay so you can see that you can see I'm being completely honest I'm clean as a whistle so we've got on the under cameras on the best angle so this is the multi screen drug test can test for many different things I'm gonna dunk in here for just 15 seconds so I'm just gonna so there you go that's my piss on a jar so two lines means negative so let's find out over the next 10 days if taking CBD we're gonna use sample vial for no fail so it's not branded yet you'll see if broad-spectrum CBD can cause you to have all failed drug tests that's it so that's it this was the benchmark this was me introducing myself as an absolute weirdo let's find out what happens when we take CBD oil we use 500 milligram what do you think 10 days well we found a drug test so I doubt right so day one go ahead I'm branded bottle for a no-fail CBD we're gonna take one full pipette to 10 more bottle 500 milligram in that means 50 mg per day which is generally in good allowance to take per day part of this testing option we're taking these drops to see whether or not will we favor drugs tests of CBD so just so you know we could do 10 days Nora okay Google what's the date today it is Wednesday the 14th of August 2019 there you go so this is day 1 I think I want [Music] [Music] 25 20:19 what [Music] so got this little bad boy here this is a drum turf the actually test for loads more things than just CBD doesn't necessarily test for THC and this is the thing people worry about is see video oil will bring up the THC metabolites that's what shows up on a drugs test and if you work in an engineering industry nursing medical science police force whatever the last thing you wanted to be pulled up for a CDT compulsive drug test to get them in the forces and sharp like that the THC if you haven't ever had a split or haven't been smoking weed that's the last and once you can use basic CBI so we wanted to show that RC videos see videos that we work with as flexi we need our remedy it's even a dispensary use the same source it's broad spectrum CVD that means it's been filtered for today from from the source and i want to do a little turn they test to show you whether or not it comes up on a drug test and i'm going to show that it doesn't what it's hoping if you see this video didn't come up on the drug test i want to go for a piss I'm going to take a wife otherwise technically a sexual-harassment to get anyone else to fill me I can correspond to to just shake your home health drug test kit mean tampered with right one step so that's before don't give the piss for 10 to 15 seconds and then we read it in five minutes there's the tester as you can see we're looking for this one here at THC [Music] and we'll leave that for five minutes so I've already seen it was all come for anyway it doesn't wait five minutes generally but if the second line comes forever that means is negative which is an absolute relief I'm gonna show you here I'm gonna check on the camera can actually see it it is the second from the left see th see to try and bring it down this is really hard to try and do it while focusing on the camera you can see bring along TC warmly cocaine is quite faint but yeah there you go so you can take your CBD for last ten days taking 50 milligram every single day 500 milligram ball that was the broad spectrum CBD oil from Fleck CBD so if you do sports and your industry then you worried about drug tests or it's showing up for THC test cannabis tests what CAC is there you go 10 days that's what happened didn't shove the drug test I wouldn't fail a drug test so now you know you're not going to find a drugs test provider you take Bruce paradise of the CBD now you're gonna jump over on the next video and we're going to talk about what are the five most common CBD mistakes hit the link I'll see you there", "o8RtMQtluxE": "it's just not bitter you know like the the thing that most cbd oil is this has replaced it with a nice sort of turp in it welcome back to the ismoke channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host tyler green today i'm going to be taking a look at this cbd oil offered by encasa botanics it has a twist and i'm excited to share it with you right here on the icemoke channel let's get into it big thanks to encasa botanix they sent me over these products after getting in touch to tell me about their range they work with growers out in switzerland who produce some awesome cbd flowers for the swiss market and for the european market these particular oils have been extracted from the white widow cbd hemp plant which is a plant grown by this swiss company and kept in its natural balances for the oil so very different to how a lot of the oil ends up in the bottle before you when you buy cbd oil from a lot of suppliers it will be using various grades of hemp sometimes industrial hemp sometimes specific hemp strains and sometimes other strains that have been grown for their high cbd content and low thc content also defined as hemp but not listed in the eu's official definition of it this is an oil which has been extracted from one strain a name strain that this company are happy with so rather than it being a cannabis oil just extracted from any old hemp it has come from a specific source and i believe you can taste it we're going to try that out and demonstrate a little bit later in the video lab tests are available on the ancasa botanics website for the cbd oil which is good always willing to be seeing lab tests in 2020 when it comes to cbd products inside the box we have this 15 ml bottle here the regular size is probably the 10 mil bottle but they have a 15 ml bottle available on site and looking at the product in a bit more detail the bottle's got a really cool look to it first of all they have opted for see-through transparent glass bottles which enables you to see the color of the oil more clearly it isn't as photo protective of some of the photo synthetic balances so store it in a cool dark place but it is good to be able to see the oil inside the dropper itself i really like this sort of wood effect that they've gone for i really like like wood as a material and the dropper that they've gone for they've got a white sort of rubberized lid and a wooden part to the lid as well and then in here you've got the glass dropper which you can see on the back of the bottle it says full spectrum organic hemp extract infused with mct oil cbd 5 500 milligrams thc 0.2 natural flavor from terpenes shake well before use food grade ethanol extraction that's cool store in a cool dry place away from sunlight can be refrigerated used within one year of opening distributed by encasa botanics a produce of switzerland i believe that this has been infused with mct oil to bring it down to the legal classifications that you can have in cbd oil in the uk the swiss market actually has a thc limit of one percent thc so potentially the white widow cbd plant in its natural form is a little bit stronger than the 0.2 percent thc probably virgin up to the one percent thc mark as a result the resulting oil has been made the correct potency using mct oil this is actually common practice when it comes to cbd extractions because you are playing around with some strict legal sort of definitions and percentages so what often happens is it gets to a certain stage in the extraction process they look at the end result and then they make that the correct potency for the market that it's being sold in we're going to go straight in and taste it because taste test is part of the review right so first of all oh if you give it a smell it has got a weedy smell to it that doesn't smell like other cbd oil it has got like a real unique aroma profile from the terpene balance that it has which you can really smell it's not got like a bitterness instead it's got a sweetness which comes through in the aroma we're going to see how it translates into the taste of the cbd oil so i'm going to put some under my tongue and then swirl it round in my mouth a bit to get the flavour do you know what that has almost got hints of chocolate to the flavor to it it is really terpy you can taste the turps when you put it my guinea pig just tried to jump on top of his home which he's never done before fell off again it's really distracted me you can really taste the terps they are perceivable from when you put the oil in your mouth under your tongue it sort of sort of seeps along your tongue and you sort of start to get that sort of terpy aroma flavor even coming through the flavor itself is sweet rather than bitter it certainly is cbd and i get a kind of cbd taste that sort of comes through after with almost anything that i eat that's a cbd product the cbd gummies that i tried last week on the channel are a good example of that you sort of swallow them eat them everything tastes sugary and sweet and then you get a bit of a cbd taste so i can taste cbd but i can also taste the white widow cbd terpenes and it is completely different to what you'd expect as i mentioned ever so slight sort of chocolatey hint to a turpy weedy kind of flavor right it's more weedy in the in the smell than the flavour but the flavor is also weedy as well so that's a cool thing when it comes to cbd oil so five percent that means there's 500 milligrams of cannabidiol in this bottle this being the 15 mil bottle it means that there are 750 milligrams of cannabidiol in this bottle so if you just take that and work out your dosage from that you'll probably end up using half a syringe or quarter of a syringe under your tongue once or twice a day depending on requirements so i like the cbd oil especially for the flavour which is nice and different to what i was expecting terpe they also sent me over some cbd isolate now this is not something that i've used for a number of years but i just wanted to show you it on the channel in this video because encasabotanic's cbd isolate has got this lovely sort of crystalline look to it it looks like sugar it's very fluffy it's very crystalline pure cannabidiol i've never actually tasted what that tastes like it's pretty much got no flavor pure cannabidiol there's no smell to it when it's this pure it has lost all of its terpenes it's lost all of the other minor cannabinoids any hints of thc that were in there and all that remains is the cannabidiol really cool stuff so that is their cbd isolate available on their website in terms of price points this is coming in at 29 pounds 99 for a bottle of 10 mil or 43 pounds 99 for a bottle of 15 mil and the isolate is coming in at eight pounds for half a gram or 15 pounds for the four gram of the cbd isolate this is good for adding into your own edibles or products or anything that you want to infuse with cbd that makes it a good product for those who are looking to make their own cbd products constructive criticism i think that the box maybe could have a little bit more information on it perhaps what is inside the bottle but it does have a handy tag that says see the inside bottle for ingredients i really like the branding of the bottle itself but as mentioned is not as protected so keep it in a dark place out of direct sunlight otherwise you will notice it's sort of changing in consistency or color or appearance i don't know exactly what it's going to do but you you'll notice something over a period of it being left in sunlight and casa botanics are definitely a small boutique cbd brand on the uk market they are working directly with a swiss producer which is really cool stuff so it's different to what you'll see out there on the market for the most part uh due to it being extracted from the white widow cbd i think that is super interesting i'm gonna have some more yeah it's got a nice kind of um it's a very complex dirt profile that's just not bitter you know like the the thing that most cbd oil is this has replaced it with a nice sort of turp in it so i like that and overall i like being casabotanics products big up to those guys for sending it over remember you can get them on the encasa botanics website there will be a link in the comments and remember to use the code i smoke for 15 percent off if you want a nice little discount on the cbd sold by encasa botanics just got my laptop here to talk about the lab tests for this oil cannabinoid content 5.153 cbd 0.158 thc 0.196 cbc and 0.033 cbdv 0.081 cbg and 0.102 cbda so awesome to see the lab tests on the batch of white widow cbd that went into this oil so that's going to be it from the encasa botanics cbd oil video review do leave your comments below

you asked so many questions last time thanks for staying tuned let's get to it the term entourage effect was first used to describe potential interactions between our body's own endocannabinoids at the cannabinoid receptor the term was later used to describe interactions between different plant cannabinoids when combined at the same time in a person so for example cbd because it doesn't really fit into the lock very well might block some of the effects of thc so this is a potential example of an entourage effect from having a full plant extract rich in multiple different cannabinoids so to this point when we're talking about plus cbd oil and i have a little vial over here you can see it's qualitatively dark in color it's a little bit goopy it's a little bit stinky indicating the presence of hundreds of different molecules that may support an entourage effect a full spectrum hemp extract means taking all of the aerial parts of the hemp plant everything that grows above ground seeds stock leaves flowers and when you do that your oil has at least 400 different molecules it's not just about cbd the thc in plus cbd oil products is not just there for fun it's a naturally occurring component of hemp the united states government defines hemp as the plant cannabis sativa that contains less than 0.3 percent thc in it by dry weight our hemp is in accordance with federal law and we also feel that having trace amounts of thc based on the current scientific literature show that it would have a beneficial effect from the perspective of the entourage effect hey guys time skip all that stuff is still true but i filmed that months ago and i've been very busy working on a bunch of different projects including material to support the release of a new product known as happy lane happy lane is a high quality cbd isolate that contains less than 0.00 percent thc it contains less than 50 parts per million thc so if you're worried about the thc content in full spectrum hemp extracts such as what you would find in plus cvd then we think you're gonna love what happy lane has to offer some of us are gonna be wondering about whether or not they can take happy lane if they're likely to be regularly drug tested by their employer and with this we must express some caution the reason being that even though it contains less than 0.00 thc it still does have cbd in there it can still pop a false positive on some of these drug tests so we just can't say either way that being said we know that you've been asking for this and it's going to help some of you feel a lot more comfortable not all cbd isolates take you down the happy lane in fact depending on how you isolate your cbd certain types of solvents or things like this that molecule might bind to the receptors in a different way than naturally occurring cbd does leaving you feeling sick and tired the fact is that happy lane is extracted using supercritical co2 free of any harsh chemical solvents that might cause you to not feel so great the same scientific rigor that cv sciences applies to plus cbd when it comes to published peer-reviewed articles quality assurance and quality standards we have applied to happy lane so yes i know this sounds like a commercial i'm just excited to offer you the market has spoken that you have been asking for a good quality cbd isolate and we have been able to deliver we just took a little bit of time to perfect it so end of this faq video for now i hope that you appreciate this new information give this stuff a try and if you do try happy lane let me know how it feels thank you take care be well until next time", "xBEOJGdQ8-k": "hi welcome to my full spectrum CBD review full spectrum CBD is an all-natural supplement that is centered around CBD as its chief

what's the best amount of CBD to take it depends on what you want to achieve each person is unique and will experience different effects CBD takes time to build in the body much like some vitamins you can take a small amount every day well you might not notice an immediate effect over time you should begin to detect more balanced calm and peace of mind in your life some people may notice a more extreme difference than others imagine someone who is deficient in vitamin C taking a vitamin C supplement will create a radical change in their health CBD is similar to a vitamin and that it helps to maintain and support overall health if your endocannabinoid system is depleted or imbalanced taking CBD could produce tremendous changes more quickly than someone who has a healthy endocannabinoid tone if you're already healthy CBD may not be noticeable right away what your friends may take a high amount of CBD and notice immediate changes you may not need the same amount the following is a general guideline a good way to start is with the mild range take the amount recommended for your weight not feeling anything within the mild range if mild doesn't work for you it could be good to reach for a higher dosage and try out the medium range go for the high dosage if you haven't noticed any changes in the medium range some people take more than 100 milligrams of CBD each day it all depends on your health and your body experiment to find out what works best for you how often should I take CBD there are three main schedules that people use to take CBD once or twice per day every two to three hours so that they feel the effects throughout the day and hourly micro dosing for CBD oil we recommend starting with one quarter drop daily during the first week moving up to one half a dropper during the second week three quarters of a dropper during the third week and a full dropper on the fourth week for CBD balm it's suggested to apply a healthy amount to the area where you are experiencing pain dryness or stiffness every six hours for vaping CBD you should start with three normal inhales and wait 30 minutes to fully feel the effects until inhaling more for edibles and soft gels start with one shoe or one capsule every 12 hours so what is the right amount of CBD to take there's a few key points to remember when you're determining the right amount of CBD to take remember to start slow and work your way up there is no right amount of CVD to take each person is different you can use our chart as a starting guide until you figure out what works best for you enjoy the process and the wonderful calm and peace that CBD can bring into your life [Music]", "pxzkvlKfh04": "Tom and I are partnering up to do a giveaway in which we will pick two winners the giveaway is going to be hosted on Instagram so if you're not already following make sure you head over there right after this video go ahead and follow me so you know the moment it goes live [Music] hey guys and welcome back to my channel thanks so much for joining me again if you are new here then my name is Mariah and on this channel I share my fertility churning product reviews as well as lifestyle vlogs so in today's video I'm gonna be sharing with you guys about how I incorporate CBD into my fertility protocol this video is actually sponsored by calm by wellness I have done a sponsor review with them before as you guys know when I review things I only give you my honest opinion in my personal opinion and this is just an assessment of how well a product does or does not work for me as always with wellness products I also have to put out the disclaimer that I am NOT a medical professional so you should consult with a medical professional before trying anything especially if you are taking other medications in other words you are research so what I really like about using calm is that they are an all-natural product they're organically grown right here in the United States right in Colorado and they're also processed there as well you guys know one of the biggest things for me is that they are THC free so they do not have that psychoactive component of the cannabinoid plant contained in any of their products which is awesome in my opinion it's nice to be able to get the benefits of CBD without having that other component in there especially as it pertains to fertility so CBD can actually reduce stress reduce inflammation it can reduce any of your pain it can also increase your mood by blocking your stress hormones and as it pertains to fertility it can boost your anandamaya levels so what CBD basically does is it gives your endocannabinoid system a small push or a small nudge of sorts it kind of wakes it up and says hey this is what you need to be doing once the endocannabinoid system is more active it actually increases the Anand amide levels which stimulates the ovaries to produce more estrogen as we know during the follicular phase of our cycle estrogen plays a key role in a production of follicles as well as during up for ovulation and hyerim on denied levels occur at ovulation and are very widely associated with successful pregnancy so by taking CBD during the follicular phase of your cycle you can actually help to boost and Krystal's Amanda Knight levels hopefully therefore increasing your estrogen levels now this in turn may give you a healthier and stronger ovulation but if you are already having issues with your ovulation it doesn't guarantee that this one thing is going to make you ovulate if you have things that are already inhibiting your ability to ovulate CBD may not necessarily help you fix that so similar to how you use supplements to help with your fertility your ovulation your egg quality all those things CBD is just like another form of a supplement it is not a medication and it is not a quick fix either now if you're gonna be using CBD specifically while trying to conceive you only want to take it during your follicular phase so you only want to take it from about cycle day one routes you about two days before you ovulate the reason I'm telling you this is because after ovulation you're anandamaya levels begin to decrease so that your progesterone levels can begin to increase so remember higher Ananda might level zequals higher estrogen levels and after ovulation you obviously want those to start coming down so that it doesn't inhibit your progesterone from increasing if you continue to take it during your luteal phase that is post ovulation it can and very well may interfere with implantation of an embryo it may not affect fertilization rates but it can and does have the potential to interfere with implantation because it once again it is increasing your estrogen levels instead of your progesterone levels so my personal recommendation and how I use CBD while trying to conceive and to help aid in trying to conceive is I take it the day before or the day of my cycle starting so if I am 99% sure that I am NOT pregnant in a particular cycle on the very last day of that current cycle for me that's day 28 on day 28 I will start taking the CBD because I already know that a I'm not pregnant and B my menstrual cycles about to start and then I will continue taking it every single day until up to 2 days before my ovulation the reason I start taking it the day before my cycle starts is because it can actually help juice cramping I've noticed that over the last few cycles I've used it if I take it the day before my cycle my cramps on like cycle day 1 or cycle day 2 are significantly less than they are without taking it for me personally I don't like taking medicines like leave advil ibuprofen Tylenol I don't like taking any of those and I much rather try a holistic or more natural method to reduce those things this CBD really definitely does help with that it doesn't get rid of everything for me but my period pains are usually at their most intense on the first day or so I'm usually in my bed hugging a heating pad for majority of the day and just trying to make it through the day however since I've started taking this a bit proactively that pain has been significantly reduced it also helps my mood because when I'm cramping and everything like that and feeling overall icky I'm obviously not gonna be in a good mood because I physically don't feel well I feel like crap oftentimes so when I'm able to take this and it's able to alleviate a lot of those symptoms yeah I'm not gonna be as cranky as I normally am and it also helps me function a little bit better throughout my day because I'm not then focusing on trying to get rid of the pain so I do truly believe that CBD can be a great help in that first half of your cycle in the follicular phase I can help reduce your pain boost your estrogen levels and it also reduces your inflammation so similar to taking things like baby aspirin CBD has the same kind of effect and reducing that inflammation as well as reducing the pain now as a disclaimer if you are taking any medications even if they are fertility medications I urge you to consult with your doctor before taking this product and the only reason I'm telling you that is because similar to how grapefruit juice affects the absorption of certain medications CBD can have a similar effect not necessarily on all medications but there are some medications that it can interact with so you definitely want to make sure that you're not inhibiting any of your medications from properly working or having any negative side effects I personally have had no negative side effects with taking the column CBD the only complaint I have about it really is the stopper on it and I'll show you guys you pinch the stopper it doesn't always go up to there there's a little number on there and I'm not sure if you guys can see that but there's a little number on there and when you pinch the stopper doesn't go all the way up to the full milliliter that you take with we were one dose so if I had a complaint it would be that their dropper is a little bit not the greatest so what I tend to do is I will measure up to about the 0.5 milliliter mark and I'll take that underneath my tongue sublingually and then I will do that again a second time so it's not that I'm taking it twice or taking two doses I'm just splitting my dose up just so that I can make sure that I'm getting a single full dose as far as the taste is concerned this flavor is peppermint and it tastes just like that peppermint it's not really even a taste to be honest with you guys because your nose is connected to your taste buds you feel like it's a taste but it's really more of a smell this doesn't really have a overall like flavor to it per say it's more so that you're smelling it when it's in your mouth and you are tasting it it's not pungent it's not thick and I typically hold it underneath my tongue for about two minutes and then it takes about another 8 to 10 minutes for me to start to feel the effects of it CBD also helps with decreasing your anxiety and it was a cortisol blocker so it also can decrease your stress which we all know is very helpful when you're trying to conceive or really just in general life no one needs to be stressed out it's really not good for our health at all so it does that as well as improves your sleep as I've said before I've tried their sleep one out first and this one has lavender in it and I did a totally separate review on that but the general gist of it is that I love this when it comes to my sleep but I just wanted another different tension that I can use during the day so whether it was nighttime or daytime I wanted something that I could take without it making me feel almost too relaxed so just as an overall recap CBD can boost the anandam eye therefore increasing estrogen levels there for supporting ovulation it can also reduce menstrual cramping reduce other forms of pain and reduce inflammation also is very well known to help with anxiety depression insomnia any form of sleep issues so CVD all-around has an array of benefits and kind of has something for everybody like I said if you are specifically trying to conceive you want to take it only during your follicular phase only pretty much from cycle day one through two days before ovulation if you're not trying to conceive then you can take it every single day of the month in fact some people have used CBD as a more mild form of birth control it is not an official form of birth control but they've used it all throughout their entire cycle if they're trying to prevent getting pregnant because it does keep those estrogen levels at a much higher level so that's all I have to share with you guys about how I'm

foods that heal you and foods that feeling a CBD and in this video I'm going to answer the question does CBD oil have THC in it the short answer is CBD by itself does not have THC in it the reason for that is because CBD and THC are separate cannabinoids in the plant so if you look at my infamous infamous cannabinoid wielding holed up in all these videos you see CBD here and you see th see over here they're separate from each other so CBD doesn't have THC in it but if you have a full spectrum CBD hemp oil product is probably going to have trace amounts of THC in it now it's going to be below 0.3% which is legal if it is hemp derived now if it's a full spectrum from the marijuana plant it's a whole different ballgame I'm talking about hemp derived CBD oil so a full spectrum is going to have all of these cannabinoids all the vitamins minerals plant terpenes naturally-occurring plant parts whatever it's gonna have all of it in there and an Israeli study in 2015 showed that full spectrum is actually going as a bit superior to an isolate I'm not going to explain why and I'm going to explain what you can do to help make up for that alright so full spectrum and I have a couple examples of full spectrums that we carry we have our this is our gold in our green label we have a blue label also that looks just like this but these are full-spectrum they have all the plant parts all the vitamins minerals nutrients in them are at including trace amount of THC now the THC is not even enough for you to feel it but there are people who are looking for something with no THC and then our tasty drops again they are full-spectrum let me see forget that right there full spectrum this is the 300 we have a 1000 they're going to have all the plant parts all of the cannabinoids in fact the tasty drops are raw so they're also going to have CBD a which may have a no benefit so I'm not gonna go too far into that because I have a separate blog post on that but those are examples of full Specter right then you've been half isolate now a CVD isolate it looks like a powder it's basically if you look at this wheel again you take just the CBD out so there's not going to be any THC so if you're looking for something with no THC then an isolate is going to be a good choice but what you have to keep in mind about isolates is that they aren't going to be as effective unless you add back in plant terpenes with it and and or omega-3 fatty acids cuz those will help increase the effectiveness of that isolate alright so like for example in our vague products our alternate vape and our vape shot all of our vape liquids there it's the CBD isolate so it has no THC but it has the plant terpenes in it which helped create that entourage or full-spectrum effect so that's why they work so well for people because they do have the plant terpenes add it back in gummy bears edibles brownies stuff like that they usually use isolates and without the plant terpenes and without the omega-3 fats the the isolates are they're not gonna be as effective they're just not and we sell actually the isolate powder for those of you who might be allergic to certain plant parts but that definitely these others are definitely going to be superior that's kind of a last resort for those of you who can't have any of the other products alright then the third option which would be I call other because you're there's broad spectrum and broad spectrum is pretty expensive and it's not really out there much yet but broad specter was where they pick and choose they want THC CBD CBN CBT they pick and choose maybe 10 cannabinoids it's really expensive to do and it's highly processed okay but what we have is a product that is full spectrum with only the THC filtered out and that's our head boil pair and you'll see these I have and you'll know when you look at the label to like this says zero th see our vape says no THC so that's one thing that you want to look look for is make sure that it says no THC and like we even have the lab test results on each product page so you can look at the lab test and see that it doesn't have any THC in it so if you're looking for THC free you definitely want to make sure that you are getting what you're you know what you're buying what you think you're buying but the nice thing about the hemp oil care spray is that it still has all the plant parts all the perturbing all of the cannabinoids all of the vitamins minerals the only thing not in there is the THC okay so that's going to be the difference there and there are no other products on the market like that so if you're looking for full spectrum without the THC the CBD spray the hemp oil Kerr spray is a really good option now what I'm gonna do is post below I'll probably create a blog post you can give me more than a day to get that written but below this video so that you have this written out if you're on YouTube or if you're on Vimeo you can see that you can also check us out at foods that heal you CBD calm I'll have a THC free section I've already got that on there so it's all categorized for you and then if you have questions please join us on our Facebook community page

everyone today is interested in CBD and its health benefits but as someone who has been researching CBD since well before it exploded into popularity I want to warn you that not all CBD oils and

the cheapest one either there are two main things to look at when attempting to select a CBD product first is whether the CBD product is broad-spectrum CBD or CBD isolate here's the difference broad-spectrum CBD includes not just CBD but also all the other cannabinoids that are found in a marijuana plant this CBD provides the maximum amount of health benefits CBD isolate on the other hand only contains purified CBD that's been extracted and isolated from the other cannabinoids so you get less potential health benefits so what kind of benefits can you expect from taking a CBD oil or supplement researchers say all of the following is possible pain relief reduction of anxiety and depression alleviation of sub cancer related symptoms and possible reduction of acne also noted were some neuroprotective properties that means it might help with some neurologic disorders there are also potential heart benefits antipsychotic effects it can help with substance abuse treatment and and as possible anti-tumor effects and for those of you who are diabetics it's been shown to have some preventative measures in a recent pain relief study researchers determined that CBD may help reduce chronic pain by impacting endocannabinoid receptor activity reducing inflammation and interacting with neurotransmitters in a study on depression and anxiety researchers determined that a group of social anxiety sufferers who receive CBD had significantly less anxiety cognitive impairment and discomfort before a speech performance than those receiving a placebo now what benefits you actually receive will depend on the second thing that you need to be sure to look for when studying CBD products and that's the quality of the product you should look for a product that contains 100% natural ingredients and that is made using only ingredients that are tested for purity and quality the product should also have no artificial fillers flavoring or colorings just premium ingredients that you can trust one more thing it should also be made in the USA and an FDA approved lab like life renews CBD products life renew has quickly built a reputation for providing the highest quality purest supplements the company supplements can be counted on to contain exactly what they say they contain and to produce the exact benefits they say they produce look I'm very excited about the potential of CBD and the quality of CBD products being produced by life renew personally I feel there's a lot more benefits that are going to be associated by taking CBD do you know that we actually have an endocannabinoid system inside of us well we all do this system has receptors throughout our bodies and it's involved in most of our brain and bodily functions that's incredible news and it means that supplementing with CBD could just be what you need to achieve optimal health we already know that the ECS or the endocannabinoid system plays a big role in how we handle pain as well as stress and anxiety it's also involved in our motility and our muscle health our endocannabinoid system basically keeps us in balance and CBD is the all-natural fuel that helps keep the system operating optimally

500 milligrams of cbd oil and 500 milligrams of cbg oil and with each serving you get 17 milligrams of cbd oil and 17 milligrams of cbg oil so before this we found this product we both didn't know much i didn't really know a whole lot about cbg but this definitely turned us on to it yeah we found this product and let's read a little bit about cbg oil so on this box it says cbg binds with cannabinoid receptors in our neutral system which helps to regulate your pain mood inflammation motor control nausea memory appetite pleasure and immune function so this bottle has a lot of good effects in it with cbd oil and i definitely feel like they are true yeah we definitely feel like they're true this is full spectrum cbd and cbg oil um yeah we really seem to love this product let's just try it yeah let's see a little bit how it works so first the directions you shake before use and then to open it you press this dropper in and turn so it's not super easy to open but that's that's okay and then you to fill up the dropper you press the squeezer and it fills it up and then you squeeze it under yeah when you fill it up it's a full dose and then you would squeeze it under the tongue let it sit for what 20 to 30 seconds no let it sit for 15 to 20 seconds and then you swallow so let me give you a little bit you can tell us about the flavor let's sit for a second i found the flavor to just be like just hemp flavor it's just like neutral oil oh it's salty i definitely agree it's very mild and just kind of earthy and it definitely it says on the bottle it says natural hemp flavor and i definitely agree it's very just earthy and just heavy though yeah it tastes pretty good um let's see what else it's definitely not the best taste in the world but it's really not too bad and with all the benefits that i think that it helps me with i definitely yeah it would definitely be worth it let me try a little bit of the oil too on the camera what is it pretty swallow oh it's really not bad at all you don't really taste it too much it's like a natural flavor yeah and i definitely agree the benefits are worth it for the flavor and for you know and not tasting the best

we're going to talk about the Charlotte's Web hip extract liquid capsules that come with 25 milligrams of CVD so these Charlotte sweat liquid extract filled capsules contain 25 milligrams of a full-spectrum CBD in each capsule this is a really great option for those of you looking to supplement with CBD but perhaps you don't really love that earthy flavor commonly found in most tinctures the recommended dose is one capsule and that is a pretty strong dose if you are kind of new to supplementing with CBD show-ups webb suggests that these are great options to help improve your overall wellness and to help improve muscle recovery from like sports and stuff now before we go too much further about Charlotte's Web and these awesome liquid caps don't forget to Like and subscribe to the Green Valley nation channel and also check us out online at Green Valley nation.com where you are going to find the industry's best non-biased reviews on all of the CBD products and even more importantly you get the education you need to be able to make the most informed purchasing decision so again Green Valley Nation comm go check it out and read the rest of this review Charlotte's Web claims to be the number one hemp manufacturer in the United States by market share that's a pretty big claim to fame however they have been in this game since 2011 they have tinctures capsules like these gummies and even pet products they contain full spectrum products and they also create they've also created some isolate products as well the majority of their products are co2 extracted however they do have one line their original formula that is alcohol extracted however at this time you can only get that with a prescription like from your laughter so each of these capsules contain 25 milligrams of a full-spectrum CBD something that's really cool about Charlotte's Web is that they are US hemp Authority certified and they are C GMP certified as well they made a 98 on their most recent audit which basically tells you and me that these things are created and manufactured in a really nice facility cGMP good manufacturing processing that's kind of like a grading score that they even give pharmaceutical compounding facility so the place that is making your prescription drugs that they are held to the same standards as these Charlotte's Web manufacturing so basically you know every single time you take one of these capsules whether it's from this bottle or your next you're going to get the exact same result because you're going to have a very very very almost identical basically product it's a really good indication of Charlotte's Web dedication to quality and making sure we get the absolute best CBD supplement now you're probably looking at this thing and saying okay what's in it that's the really cool thing inside this box you'll have a bottle that has 30 capsules inside each capsule is just the hemp extract and olive oil it is a vegetarian capsule so it's a these are vegetarian vegan friendly actually these are also non-gmo and they are currently evaded available in US Canada Brazil and in certain places inside the UK depending on availability I kind of get the impression that our friends across the pond may have a bit of a problem maintaining inventory levels so you guys definitely make sure to call the retailers to make sure it is in stock okay now we're going to talk about the test results I'm so excited to be up here and tell you about these new test results that Charlotte's Web is giving out this is actually a brand new product it is replacing these extra-strength capsules this was last year's version of their capsules and this is this year's and I'm super excited to tell you that unlike last year's version of the COAS which basically just told you how much CBD and how much see isn't it and nothing else these new test results actually disclose so much more in fact you find out that there's 0.11% THC which is definitely an illegal mountain grounds and you can see that there's C B G and C B C as well as the CBD that's kind of giving you a big idea of the full spectrum effect that you can expect to get when you take this product because you're getting more than just the CBD another really cool thing about the test results is that they show that it passes for both microbials and pesticides now what does that mean that means that in this test in the test for this batch in particular there were no signs for pesticides and microbials which makes me feel pretty good because I'm not putting you know yucky stuff in my system the one thing I will tell you about the Charlotte's Web Co is is it's kind of like a treasure hunt to get to it I do appreciate the fact that Charlotte's Web is now putting the lot number on the bottom of the box in addition to putting it on the bottom of the bottle and it's in your packing slip the way that you access the COA is you click on you use this QR code however if you don't want to use a QR code totally okay make sure you check out the written portion down below or on our website at Green Valley nation.com and you can get the direct link to the batch results and we will even have a copy of these COAS in our review so now you're probably wondering what is it like to take these so if you're anything like me I was a little bit worried because I really liked the capsules that came before the extra strength capsules these are like a dry form and you might actually still see a few of these in stores near you is a powder in the old one these are liquid filled so it's using an olive oil as its carrying base and so I was very worried that it would leak or that it would cause me to have some indigestion and then there we go I have that natural flavor of the CBD but luckily as you can see that's why I wanted to keep it inside the box there's not been any leaking which is awesome other liquid-filled capsule had and the studio have leaped a bit and I haven't gotten any of that nasty actor flavor so that's pretty awesome as well another really great thing about the liquid craps is that there's 25 milligrams of CBD in last year's model there was only 18 milligrams of CBD so it's actually increasing the total amount of the cannabinoids CBD in these capsules I have been taking the Charlotte's Web capsules I started out with the extra strength a little over a year ago and I just got these into the studio within the last within the last month and so I can tell you that I still absolutely love taking these pills they help me to stay focused they reduce my chronic pain I have pain in my low back and like in my feet and they really do help me to sleep they don't make me sleepy but if I take it before bed I can go to sleep and they will help me to stay asleep all night which as a busy mother of two and entrepreneur is very important so now you probably want to witness me take it keep in mind these are vegetarian like vegetable pulao most they're not plastic but they sort of do feel like plastic so if you have trouble swallowing capsules definitely make sure to have some water I usually don't need a capsule to take one of these you just kind of pop it in and go but it does take about thirty minutes as much as much as an hour to start feeling the effects which is a little bit different than a tincture so here you go bottoms up are you ready to hear my top three reasons why you should try this Charlotte's Web 25 milligram liquid fill capsules number one is that these capsules work the 25 milligrams of full-spectrum CBD it totally helps to reduce all of my pain in my back and in my feet and it helps me to stay focused oftentimes CBD supplements can make me get really sleepy and so I don't love to take them during the day these Charlotte's Web capsules I can take one capsule in the morning it takes away all my pain and even better I get just the point where I can focus you know like the days before social media focus like I could go 90 minutes and I haven't even looked at my phone it's really great to help me reduce pain and it also helps me to get and stay focused I also really really loved the fact that well frankly that it's a capsule I don't love the flavors of a lot of the tinctures they're very very earthy I love that term by the way because I don't know what that means it they don't necessarily taste that great and so the capsules give me the ability to get my CBD supplement and without any of the shall we say more natural flavors commonly associated with CBD supplementation now you're probably wanting to know the but part here's the buck part Charlotte's Web is a premium product that means you're going to have to pay a little bit more for it these actually come in at about three dollars a capsule US which is a little bit over market price however Charlotte's Web is an industry leader they do have the number one market share and they are manufactured in a professional pharmaceutical grade facility so you know exactly what you're going to get that's basically my biggest complaint is that it is a little bit more expensive the packaging it's come a long way from the where it was last last year when it was just black and white it was really kind of hard to see things now that we have this nice gold color it's really really easy to tell exactly how much CBD is on it but it's still not super easy for you to figure out where the co-pays are thankfully they're now adding the lot numbers on both the bottoms of the box and the bottle but if you don't have the website to look in that number and if you don't know how to use the QR code you're kind of like alright how do I get there so keep those two things in mind when you are considering purchasing the Charlotte's Web 25 milligram hip extracted liquid capsules well that's it for me you guys I hope you enjoyed this review of the Charlotte's Web liquid-filled hip extract capsules I really do like taking them and I'm curious to know if you guys have seen any of these in your local CBD retailers yet I just got them and so I'm curious to see if you've tried them and if you like them better or if you liked the extra strength capsules from last year better I have still seen I'm still seeing more of the extra strength capsules in in my local retailers but I am really excited to hear what you guys think if you like the liquid feel better than the powdered filled or have you ever had anything spill so I'm let me know by leaving me some comments down below I'm really curious to see what your thoughts are again my name is Jennifer Dixon with green valley nation and I can't wait to see you again soon take care bye bye [Music]", "w1p3atKuCyg": "hi Annie rouse here co-founder of a navi market and today we're talking about Palmetto harmony palmettos products all come in a very nicely packaged box and they are they use they used to use Kentucky grown hemp now they're using South Carolina grown hemp but the tincture is mixed with MCT coconut oil and has this specific bottle is a six hundred milligram and the whole bottle which means that it's twenty milligrams per milliliter it's very easy to take simply fill her up I'm drop it under your tongue it's got a really nice we're fine flavor very earthy but all natural they use a botanical extraction process so it's solvent free and there you have it Palmetto harmony available at a Navi market calm you can find out more in the links below thanks", "153jwvFdrow": "hey everybody this is ricochet with Willie's works in the CBD Willie comm first I just want to thank you guys for the good responses to the videos and it's definitely encouraged me to keep them going one question I get asked a lot about CBD products is the difference between full spectrum and broad spectrum not a lot of people understand the difference even the people that are retailing it and selling it in stores a lot of them know that CBD is good but don't know the difference between broad spectrum and full spectrum basically there's over 90 different compounds in a hemp or cannabis plant and if you get the oil out of there the first oil that's got all 90 compounds mixed in it it's gonna be called full spectrum oil so you're gonna have all the different compounds that are in a plant including a trace amount of the THC that is known to get people stoned and high for recreational use now in Indiana you have to have less than 0.3 percent THC which is not enough to give you any of the psychoactive effects so it doesn't cause you the high or the stoned feeling but it can do wonders for your body and all those different 90 compounds are going to interact with different nerves and transmitters in your body's different ways now the CBD content in a full spectrum oil is going to be much lower than the milligrams on the bottle so if you have a 550 milligram full spectrum oil there's 90 different compounds and their CBD is one of them so the actual CBD content is just going to be a fraction of what's in the bottom so this is great for a lot of supplementing and helping your body's overall health however if you're in a lot of pain chronic pain and inflammation or having a lot of stress and anxiety issues and broad spectrum oil is when they take all the CBD out of the full spectrum oil and they condense it into just CBD okay so the broad spectrum oil is going to give you the compound that is doing so much good for people's inflammation and pain and anxiety and things like that so you're going to get a quicker more noticeable result from the broad spectrum oil but the full-spectrum oil is going to have other compounds that are going to help your body in other ways so it does take a little experimenting to figure out what's gonna work best for each individual client but we do care a full spectrum broad spectrum I've even got edibles gummies vapes we got coffees teas are all matters and how you ingest the CBD as to how it's gonna work for you and everybody's body is different so come on down we'll talk about what kind of issues you've got and we'll figure out what's best for you we're at 1508 North Main Street Crown Point Indiana where these works fire works and CBD products CBD Willie calm and you can call me at two one nine three zero eight nine nine nine eight and we will see if we can't find something that I work for the issues you have going on thank you for your time", "cy0r4zIdDMs": "[Music] hi friends trent the wizard here with factory six we're diving deep into some factory six factoids going into the forge about the difference between full spectrum broad spectrum and isolate products now the first thing we need to under really understand is where does that come from what is hemp extract well that comes from this delicious little flower here which is produced by the hemp plant now this little guy is where we're really going to pull most of our product from some of the leaves but mostly this is where the concentrated product exists now it's about a three to four month growing period for this to come to full fruition then a couple months for you know harvesting and drying and then at that point we're going to put it through an extraction process most commonly that extraction process is going to be a co2 or an ethanol depending upon you know purity and speed and whatever you're looking for but there's also new processes that are coming out we're working with a company right now that is actually working on a high pressure water extraction right now that is really exciting because it's solventless it's all natural we'll see how that comes out and more as it comes down the line however right now we're going to talk about the full spectrum crude oil that is the first thing that comes off the plant through that extraction process so this dark tar-like substance is exactly what has what we call a full spectrum of the cannabinoids or when we say that we mean all of the cannabinoids that that specific strain or that variety of hemp produced so it doesn't contain all 113 known cannabinoids but it will produce a variety of specific ones depending on the strain that you're growing and from there when you put it through the extraction process those are what's going to be present here along with some plant fats some chlorophyll some other things like that this is a pretty raw material so taste wise it's not super delicious it's kind of rough to the palate however there's things that we can do with this even as it is right now one of those things being we can use it in for example topicals like a cbd balm or a cream that way we're also utilizing as much of the plant as possible because it's as close as to it as we can get it's the first extraction that's something that you can really just use and just rub onto the skin and it's really nice you're gonna get most of the benefit that you can get from the plant in and of itself from this product alone all right friends so the next step in that process that we're going to be talking about today is going to be distillation with distillation we're going to get a distillate from crude oil that distillate is going to look very much like a honey as you can see here it is a very beautiful product in the sense that it's got the fats the chlorophyll everything else is taken out of it it can come in two different forms it can either come in a full spectrum or a broad spectrum the full spectrum is going to have again like i said all of those cannabinoids that plant produced and 0.3 or less thc as per federal regulation whereas a broad spectrum you're taking all of that thc out down to four decimal points so it's a non-detectable amount in that extract for you so the main thing that we're going to use something like this for is we're going to put this into something that's more of like an adjustable product like a tincture but this is really one of the main or most popular products that we use with a distillate among the many various products that we can put distillate into all right friends and as we move along this process we're going to be taking our distillate down to an isolate so in isolate as we go down that refinement process is going to be a powder that is literally a crystallized oil which is actually quite fascinating but one of the benefits of that that gives us is the fact that we can do really targeted things now an isolate is a 99.9 or 99.5 pure concentrate extract so we're talking about really really pure no plant anything but just that singular compound in and of itself so you know this is kind of like a sniper rifle in the sense you can get really targeted you can get really specific on what you're trying to do with it and that's really really nice it's workability it's it blends well it does a lot of things that these other products is a little bit more difficult takes a little bit more time to do so for example like a great product that an isolate would be used for is like a quick tab it's a nice little sublingual tablet that dissolves directly into the mouth but again it's very easy to work with and that's why we like to use an isolate with it all right guys so the last thing we're going to be talking about today in our process is going to be a powdered water soluble extract now this is unique in the sense that we're taking a oil product we're encapsulating it down on a nano size to actually make it dissolvable in water which is really really unique considering the oil and water don't generally mix so from this we can make really really cool products there's a lot of applications you can do especially since this can be a broad spectrum product still retaining all that cannabinoid profile all that entourage beautiful effect that we've talked about earlier but while at the same time getting a very very targeted application it's really unique and really really cool to work with guys thanks for watching this is all we have for you today for more information check out

back to my laboratory today we're going to be talking about short path distillation the functions the components and the process of it and then we're going to finish up distinguishing between full-spectrum oil broad-spectrum oil and tea free so let's jump right in alright so we're gonna talk a little bit about short path distillation today and what what the purpose of it is so we use short path distillation to extract cannabinoids from the crude oil so basically we're really doing refining operations using the short path distillation system it's very similar to the chemistry that was used in the white film molecular distillation that I talked about in a previous video just on a much smaller scale but you can also be a lot more precise with this equipment so several different components of the equipment of this whole entire system and so we'll start off from the beginning first piece that we have here is a low temperature coolant circulation pump and this is used to keep the condenser which is right here cool and what this does is it takes the vapors that are created by heating up crude oil in this boiling flask and it turns him back into liquids so as mentioned we have a boiling flask here inside of a digital heating and stirring mantle and what's going on in here is do I put crude oil in here we stir it at specific settings as you can see here below we have it at 330 rpm and 237 degrees Celsius what that does is that heats up the cannabinoids to the point of vaporization they turn into vapors they go up the distillation head they hit the cooler temperatures at the condenser right here cooled off by the chiller and once they turn back into a wick they come down into this thing called a cowbell and I can only hear the comments and jokes from here so so get them all out of your system now yes we all need more cowbell so what the cowbell has is you have your head and then you have your three main collection flasks and in each collection flask and you'll be collecting something differently in the first collection flask that you see in the background kind of a like a dark nastier color you're collecting heads and what's in those heads is any ethanol that wasn't recovered during the rotary evaporation process there's a little bit of terpenes some fats and waxes and lipids a little bit of CBD comes through here but really this is junk the second collection flask that we have is our mains this is the good stuff this is where we're collecting a majority of our CBD and as you can see it's pouring in there nice and smooth right now and a nice golden color that's that's what you want to see and the third flask which we haven't started using yet we'll use that at the end we're gonna collect our tails these also contain some cannabinoids but you're starting to get a really dark color which you really don't want in there and you're starting to collect a little bit more of some of the undesirables that are left behind in the crude oil after your cowbell yes we all need more of it you'll see a cold trap and this cold trap is designed to protect our rotary vane vacuum pump that we have down below here in this cold trap is on top has a mixture of ethanol and dry ice as you see is sort of bubbling right now right like it's not boiling that's just really really cold and that's what ethanol does when it gets it's probably below 30 minus 30 Celsius right now and so that cold trap is making sure that any vapors that didn't turn into liquid the cowbell are turning into vapors before they make it to the rotary vane vacuum top if they didn't then it would end up potentially damaging the rotary vane back and thumb so this vacuum what it's doing is it's lowering the atmospheric pressure of the entire system so that the cannabinoids don't have to reach as high of a temperature in order to convert from liquid to vapor and the reason why I want them to convert to a vapor at a lower temperature is because we get to have degradation of those can monoids at a higher temperature and we want to avoid that so that we can have higher quality and we're wrapping up this session by talking about the difference between full-spectrum broad-spectrum and tea free or isolate oils so full spectrum has terpenes CB d minor camera cannabinoids and a small amount of THC what I'm making right now is full-spectrum stuff broad

in come back again later on have a great day", "Pb-zI1ZThU8": "hey guys how you doing here we are at the greenlight City Cafe your beautiful Alabama as I told you I tried to do two of these today so just got off of the blackberry bubblegum I see Beauty hint flower review as you know it was great flower but now we're on two different things it's not a flower review at this point it is a full spectrum CBD extract oil or tincture the reason I want to review this one is because it's one of two companies one of two companies that we that I know of that specifically use high CBD hemp rosin to Palouse a product now you people are gonna ask that well yeah why does only two companies doing it if it's that great you know why is everybody doing it and I'll tell you why it's more expensive not that the product is more expensive but it's more expensive to do this it's less efficient I'll tell you why that is rosin is when you take the semi flower after think you're I mean you can't do it - fresh - but for the for our purposes we're gonna talk about dried and cured flower what they do is they take this flower and they take and they they put it in a filter bag and they take that filter bag and put it in a press and that press can can exert as much as you know a thousand pounds - toes whatever it whatever it may press down on this on this filter bag that has the flower in it and what happens is is that flowers compressed and when it's compressed for the east of these plates the place were heated up to around 230 degrees for this for this particular company they heat the place up to 30 degrees and they press and they hold it for a specific amount of time that allows the pressure and the heat to liquefy the trichomes of the the hemp flour and allow it to run out and as it rose out it goes through this filter bag which which keeps the organic part still you know still the flower that you want to keep out of your all it comes out then they take this rosin as it's called at that point and they they take it and they add it to em sitio web CTO is multi chain triglyceride and say fractionated coconut all very good for you very healthy you probably heard that as far as people who use it to mate with also you a lot of people uh will uh cut you know CBD oil or THC oil for cartridges with this don't get it don't get it twisted with by the acetate MCT all is considered safe and and I would say not healthy for you let me you trying to tell you something to you buddy healthy but it's safe by Bini acetate is what you don't want to have in that big long lips eto or the or the you know THC OTA distillate or the CBD distillate so anyway we'll get away from that we're talking about teachers as you can see I've blasted through this is only this much left this is a three thousand milligram that I use for my personal and I'll go between 3,000 and 5,000 milligrams but anyway getting back to it that Roz is taking its put in MCT oh it's it's heated slightly for it to intermingle and mix bind together at that point it's then introduced you know into very degrees into other MCT all to give you your you know your one thousand through five thousand milligrams you know based on my thirty milliliter bottle that I have here so did I say this was a three thousand milligrams so it's probably I wouldn't know exactly how many how many milligrams of uh our how many grams of Roz is actually in here but I do know that the CBD content is over the entire bottle is a total of three thousand milligrams at the minimum it could be more than the minimum so the reason I say that I only use rosin there's only two companies see this is a very inefficient way because everybody else out there beside these two companies this one to the other company here the United States Roz is very inefficient you don't get a whole lot of rods now maybe out of just just say if we do seven grams 10 grams press and that press gives us back 15% return so 10 10 grams of flour would give you a little over one gram of rosin back so you can see how it's very inefficient compared to other extraction methods and once the other distraction methods I mean like take it ethanol do there's ethanol extraction there's co2 extraction and all those are very efficient although there's drawbacks none and when I say drawbacks here's what we call residual contaminants from solvents still within the the extract so by doing it this way this is a solvent list extract rosin is a solvent let's extract because on fire time pressure and heat nothing else now the carrier is in sitio let's not MCT always not a solvent for this per se so there's no extra residual solvent solvents or anything there's a residual it's not all or you know anything else you can butane whatever that people use to do extractions now by doing it this way you preserve a lot of the natural terpenes and stuff then ethanol and co2 strips away because terpenes if you add a lot of times her paintings are reintroduced in other products having you strengthen all extraction or other extraction methods only so you get basically what got into what I'll say God what nature intended that's for safflower you get the most natural comment you can get you know it'd be an AM CT or frankly I cooking at all so anyway here we are hit a very pure product how low did I use three times a day simply get up I use it midday and I use about a hour of our gonna bid and man between that of course I do I smoke I hit if you hit a pre-roll here and there you know they throughout the day so likes a very clean very very good product very the purity that it's you know it's there I can't say enough about it it you say well what does it taste like well tastes like tastes like the flower which your flower you press say this was super haze or or Hawaiian haze or lift or electro you know whatever it may be a lot of times they'll actually tell us what this from I think this took a run was from super haze so so most of this that we have in right now is actually actually the rosin was produced from super haze super haze is one of those that are high trippin level and you get a good return on the rosin pressing so that that's today is one of them that they used quite a bit so super haze is one of them well one the ones of course we get the coa and we see what what the levels are we know what what's going on but anyway i like using this because say i smoke sam having a panic attack or i'm feeling feeling you know feelings i building up you know i smoke a quick pre-roll maybe you know four or five person just kind of hit it because it's you know pre-roll is by vaping or smoking it hits you quicker because it bypasses the good you know you so you get a quicker you know fifty four or five pools and you'll start feeling a little a little bit through your sinuses in behind you guys all you started o with this it's a little more long game so I'll tell you spin under my tongue I'll hold it for 90 seconds sometimes more maybe switch friendly [ __ ] and I like to get that absorption house while the rest and I noticed in about 40 minutes to an hour at try and Jess said I can start to fill the text but now whereas the effects from the flower lasts me a couple hours this right here I tend to feel that thanks ever about a four-hour period sometimes a little longer so that's why I use it about every 4 or 5 hours so I use it three times a day excuse me and I find it to be very effective on the long game if I need said the quick acting I'm gonna bait or I'm all pretty role but this right here this is in my arsenal my war chest this is my war chest every day I wager war against to wage war against PTSD fibromyalgia a bad hip that's going to be replaced to two budging slip this nerve problem you know getting old guys getting beat up using and in a couple couple different Wars you know well one conflict and one war and you know get pretty beat up so this is what I do Medicaid drops three rolls or flour they um you know sort sore joint three things freights cuts I use a I use a CVD bone guys CVD is part of my life in now that's why I'm here homeless everyday trying to let you know what kind of products we have that we've got the best prices and that we're here not not to minor pockets with gold but we're here to help you just like we're helping ourselves you know I use CBD every day I needed my partner very green he uses CBD every day no he won't smoke he won't he just doesn't smoke but he uses the bomb he uses the drops he does the gummies so we believe in it we stand behind it and we're here for you in every shape form or fashion to help you be as healthy as you can be and as stress-free as you can be because guess what guys you've got enough regular stress out there without anything added anything they can take it away and I'll tell you what I stand behind CVD taking the work taking that stress away or at least knocking it down level or two so you can watch and as always always useful respectful if at all possible to worry about the drug test broad spectrum is always always out there in Iceland neither one are going to be as effective as full-spectrum because you need all the content always together the arts hard to think and that's like say the the the the wasn't some all is great yeah the sum of all is greater than the one so you'll find more effect more relaxation more health benefits and then I'm not the only one who says that almost every customer and say we use a full spectrum product or we'll use a full spectrum product you know if you don't worry about shine with gypsy that a little bit of THC 0.3 percent or below Delta not tasty you're not gonna get high but you will feel better you know if you're like me I mean I'm found rather sensitive kid having a wit so again I know I'm rambling I said I would do to two reviews raw this is we call it raw because it's made out of resin or rosin rosin sorry not resin rosin and again it's the only teacher we carry that's how that's how much we believe in it and like say there's only two companies who do that as far as we know and we don't tell you that's pretty much it guys is getting late here my friend it started raining here and here in my part of that of Alabama so I'm let's go and as always be safe have a great weekend and as always keep using your CBD a wetter form you use it in keep medicating be safe now", "gCHJdLXLi6Y": "[Music] what's the difference between full-spectrum hemp oil versus isolate as the term suggests full-spectrum CBD comes with all the cannabinoids present in the plant in hemp oil this includes a long list of cannabis compounds such as CBD CBN CBG CBC and THC it is critical to point out that small amounts of THC can also be found in hemp the government regulates concentration levels at 0.3% dry weight for industrial hemp products resulting in very limited cerebral or psychoactive stimulation when CBD is in the isolate form it is separated from other cannabis compounds in the source plants it was previously believed that CBD isolates were more potent and concentrated than full-spectrum CBD this certain assertion was eventually debunked by a study from the Lautenberg Center for general tumor immunology in Jerusalem in the 2015 study researchers were able to prove that the full-spectrum CBD is capable of offering greater levels of relief as higher doses were administered to mice by comparison the group that was given CBD isolates did not experience the same level of relief at higher doses to better understand how the to CBD formulas differ imagine being presented with two types of spaghetti sauce in the first bowl you have you'll find a simple spaghetti sauce made out of pureed tomatoes CBD isolate and in the second bowl you can now find a more complex spaghetti sauce containing roasted garlic and fragrant Italian herbs the full spectrum CBD it's clear that both balls are holding spaghetti sauce but the second recipe is more flavorful and interacts with one's taste buds differently also known as the entourage effect which one is right for you or for me based on the comparison above full spectrum hemp oil is more effective than CBD isolate making it highly recommended for people interested in the holistic approaches hemp oil is an extremely potent source of CBD responsible for a large bulk of the oils cannabinoid to fully reap CBD oil benefits one should explore the different mediums of the compound available in the market today capsules tinctures topical creams and vape oils we will also be launching our pet line as well as skin care and cosmetics line as well here soon we thank you for popping by", "3pffJYTL__M": "[Music] I am super pumped to introduce cooldown to you all hey gasps Clark here at Victory bicycle studio this is our own CBD product CBD tincture that we had made everything about it really came from you all we've been selling CBD here at the store for just over a year now and with that we really took a lot of feedback and we got to hear what you liked what you didn't like whether it was flavor or potency and that's how we came up with cool down it's a 900 milligram tincture 900 has really been what folks keep requesting on this one where we really nailed it was there's no yellowish or rancid flavor so many times I talked about that early that almost bomb water like flavor this is incredibly incredibly clean it's a 900 milligram isolate and then there's also a little bit of MCT oil in there that's really a carrier helping hold everything together but before the tincture is probably one of the easiest to take there's no mess there's no odor and it combats everything and it will not get you stoned this is the non psychoactive part of the hemp plant why do we have CBD why does a bike shop have CBD oil it's quite simple and nation and that is one of the biggest biggest things that we try to combat as athletes so post-workout also anxiety and stress it essentially just

much about anything and it's not that we're trying to keep anything a secret but just really haven't said much and I wanted to use this video to kind of come out and let you know about are you this last year cuz I might think you might think it's interesting so 2019 we became farmers Fiona told me a year ago that I was gonna be a farmer so I thought you were crazy but here's the story I my day job is in digital marketing and one of my digital marketing clients is a CVD extraction facility and so I told Rachel early on you know it'd be a lot of fun if we could firm him this year so we reached out to our friends Albert Kelly who have planned pitch the idea to him they said let's do it so we jumped in and we farmed nine acres of industrial hemp this last year and again you might be thinking this is incredibly crazy Dustin farming and Dustin farming hemp I'm gonna just tell you right now this isn't marijuana the genetics that we use are bred for high CBD they're below the legal limit for THC which is the psychoactive property in marijuana the genetics are below 0.3% THC so yeah that's more used for things like aches and pains and people use it for sleep people use it for anxiety there's lots of different people use CBD I'm not going to really get into that because the FDA doesn't a hasn't approved CBD for treating hearing or preventing any diseases so I'm not gonna say anything about that no makin any claims but that's the reason that some people take it chances are you or somebody you know uses CBD so anyway let me tell you a little bit about the farming thing it was really a fun time for our family to be honest kids are teenagers now so it was a good time to be able to teach them about hard work at their hands dirty and there was some real invaluable experiences in the last year we got 12,500 seeds and we propagate those seeds in a greenhouse and when they were ready about a month later we transplanted those seedlings and about three or four inches tall into the field about a hundred yards behind me and about four months later we harvested the plants and at that time the plants were five or six feet tall that's tall as me they it was amazing to watch them grow be honest it was just a great experience and so yeah in the barn I don't know if you can see the barn I think see the barn behind me we hung dry about 9,000 plants and those in the barn and when we were done we combined the plants into a biomass form kind of a chipped kind of form and filled up about 45 super sacks that can hold about 350 400 pounds of this biomass we ended up getting 16,000 pounds of hemp biomass took it down to the processing plant that I worked for just down the street and processed that into CBD distillate and then we ended up making these tincture bottles out of it so we've kind of gone the distance with this whole CBD thing and so I kind of just wanted to tell you about that it's kind of a fun story but we've been up to this last year like I said chances are either you or somebody you know is using CBD right now and so here's my ask if you don't use CBD right now I'm not trying to convert you if you do use CBD I want you to buy it from our farm and here's why I'm gonna give you two reasons first of all we farmed processed formulated bottled and labeled these bottles right here ourselves so we did the whole thing I can tell you exactly what's in this bottle if you're using CBD right now CBD tincture CBD oil whatever chances are you don't know what's inside your bottle is it made from crude oil it's made from distillate made from isolated is it is it THC free or is there any CBD in it at all you can buy a bottle just like this says hemp oil on it and it's actually made from hemp seed oil there's no CBD in it whatsoever you can use it for cooking so you're paying a high premium for something that doesn't even have the medicinal qualities if you want to call it that not making any claims again of CBD so I can tell you exactly what's in this bottle because it hasn't left a 20-mile radius of right where I'm standing right now we've done everything ourselves second reason is because we've done it all ourselves it's just Albert and I doing all this we can offer it for about half the price of what other premium CBD brands sell these bottles for and so you can save some money so we offer it in two different doses there's a 1,000 milligram bottle and a 2,000 milligrams bottle both are under the legal limit of 0.3 percent THC that's less than one third of 1% THC so it's a legal product in all 50 states and you can go to green method Farms calm and purchase is there we'll send it to your doorstep free shipping maybe you don't want to buy CBD but you want to learn more about the farming maybe this is kind of interesting to you and you want to learn more about it at green method farms calm you can go check it out I made kind of a documentary video of the whole process from field preparation all the way to harvest so if you want to hear our story and kind of see some of the images of what we did this last year go ahead and and check that out if you have any questions by the way go ahead and message me

contains CBD where hemp oil does not but to be totally sure about whether or not a product contains CBD just be sure to read the description of the product it's also important to note that the science

potency sublingual tinctures and that means it's going to be a tincture of liquid that you're going to be putting under your tongue in small amounts over long periods of time these are full-spectrum extract tinctures so it has CBD and other components from the hemp plant and the idea of a full-spectrum tincture is you're going to get all of the benefits that a CBD product can provide the anti-inflammatory the analgesic and pain relief the anti-anxiety and the antioxidant benefits of CBD extracts these products though the lock and key is not just making a tincture that has full spectrum extract they also put a whole lot other things in it some essential oils and plant terpenes I'm going to go over that right now now these extracts contain not just hem but also aid essential oil blend that includes sweet orange turmeric black pepper whole wood and wintergreen and a whole lot of terpenes as well and terpenes are flavorings from plants and in this case from the hemp plant the two bottles are both 30 milliliter bottles and they have graduated droppers for accurate accurate dosing so you know how much you're taking and certainly with tinctures of this elevated level of concentration you do want to use small amounts over long periods of time these are not meant for instant immediate you know effects you you want to slowly use tinctures of this type of high level of potency the the 1500 milligram so that's 1500 milligrams of CBD each one milliliter a dropper so a one dropper in a bottle of this size and a thirty milliliter bottle is roughly one milliliter each dropper has 50 milligrams of CBD the four thousand milligrams CBD or the extreme level what they call it is each drop or each one milliliter is one hundred and thirty-four milligrams of CBD so that's a lot so you do want to use it like I said in small amounts I can't stress that enough the effects of the terpenes are pretty interesting this these products have limonene and terrifi lean meer seen and these are highly fragrant compounds with citrusy and spicy and musky hints so you'll definitely taste them when you're using the tincture the effects of the terpenes may range from some pain relief to send some inflammation reduction but you know terpenes are definitely we're at the fringes of the science of terpenes and knowing how they really affect us but certainly in extracts like this when you compare you combined the terpenes with the hemp and the CBD you can get an overall very very good product that gives you a lot of wellness benefits the products also have an essential oil blend that makes them very unique the essential oils you know like central oils like terpenes are found in many plants and the ones they have in these are the sweet orange the turmeric black pepper oregano eucalyptus whole wood and wintergreen oils and they add a lot of sweet woodsy floral and minty sense to the tincture and they give the tincture or some very very very strong therapeutic benefits we get really really good feedback on these tinctures when people start using them they really report that it works great for them for a lot of the things that we're using it for and one of the things that we like about lock-and-key remedies and it really matches our business goals here at have headquarters is to really be concerned with quality making sure that you're making a good professional clean product and and we only stock products that are like that and lock and key remedies is one of the best that we found you know I've talked to the owner of many times and he is very very very concerned with making extremely good high quality products and only bringing to market stuff that they nose is going to be really really good and clean and really benefit people so if you're

equivalent to 5,000 milligrams of CBD and other tinctures now on the negatives yes there are negatives but they are minor in my opinion the main thing is and I'm gonna be honest it don't taste great bro it's got sort of a honey earthy flavor to it now no longer bothers me a guy to taste real quick I just wanted to point that out here and you know me I'm a big supporter of eating stuff that doesn't taste great for health now the second thing is more of a mitt pic compared to other tinctures that I have tried Ohio energetics full-spectrum hemp elixir is very thick and sticky it's a little harder to manipulate on and inside the dropper other tinctures like this one here is more clear and oily now recommendations do I recommend this thing yes I do man alright cuz I've been using this for a few months and I feel great not too seriously though it is a great product you got pain you got inflammation problem sleeping maybe you want to be superhuman like my oldest brother Clint geez look at that dude man he's 46 and shredded doing ninja warrior stuff and he takes Ojai every day and he says it's really worked for him and it's incredible in my own experience though I started noticing that my sleep was much better and I'm talking deep deep sleep I'm usually a light sleeper but not with this stuff I'm just out and I wake up feeling refreshed not groggy or anything like that if you can get past the taste this is probably one of the best CBD tinctures on the market give it a shot", "z_1O_h6zOYI": "there we go hey what's going on everybody we are reviewing koi naturals CBD oil now if you are not 18 years old please exit the video but if you are 18 years old then welcome to my bedroom now I know in a lot of videos I'm like making them in different areas we'll just bear with me because I'm very spontaneous when I record so I like to record in a lot of different areas as you can see I was just playing my xbox one if anybody has an Xbox one and they want a game out put your comment below now let's move on so we are reviewing koi naturals CBD oil now I know what you're thinking oh this is the stuff that goes on your tongue and you can put it in a vape no stop right there people you cannot put this in a vape this is for your digestive system only okay let's reiterate this digestive system mouth orally only not Lumley orally alright now that we clarified that I would test some but this is pretty much empty I used this for years and of course that just goes to show this is a definitely childproof cap child definitely proof cap which is another thing I like about this company not a lot of stores sell these so if they do then you're in luck I actually had to order this bad boy online okay so this is 250 milligrams they go all the way up to like a thousand milligrams if not more I don't know I don't need to be overdosing on this kind of stuff but you know so child proof proof lock cap definitely a plus but other than that let's talk about the product so positives of this childproof cap I'm sorry I keep stressing that but I'm not about to stress it enough childproof caps are the way to go people I do not know a lot of things that have childproof caps nowadays and your kids can get into them like what's going on with that this stuff can be digestible but not to kids so we need to make a petition to start having more childproof caps and they're like oh you got to be responsible parent you know what kids can get into anything so shout out to the moms and dads with kids that are watching this video moving on koi naturals has great tasting stuff there's a lot of CBD oil out there that you taste it you kind of get this like a waxy slimy feel and it almost tastes like your how do I put it like you're eating like some sort of like starburst now I know starbursts are juicy and they're delicious and wonderful and hey what am I talking about what I'm talking about is that kind of feeling that you get I'm not sure how to describe it I don't know I've always felt starbursts to be chalky so anyway moving on it does not give you a really bad taste in your mouth this flavor is lemon-lime clay natural I have to say hands down not only tastes good but I wish I could compare we'll do that in another video it's so it's so like liquidy and this costed like $40 you walk into a shop and I guarantee a bottle this side is gonna easily cost you like a hundred to one hundred and fifty dollars excuse me it's very amazing it's cheap it's childproof cap it's honestly I couldn't have asked for about our CBD oil so the the directions of it and let's just let's just put it down here when you look on the back of CBD oil and look on the back of all these seedy BD products there's so many different chemicals that go into it and the reason why I say chemicals is yes I believe that they're natural and you know they can help you better than like vicodin or something like that abso-freakin'-lutely Viking it this stuff is not gonna make a make you addicted to it and be make you like hallucinate or drugged so I absolutely say go with CBD if you're in pain or anything along those lines over taking a vicodin or something this stuff helps you with pain headaches anything that you wanted to that involves your body now as I was saying the ingredients on this bottle full-spectrum candid can I bid all the hi spell it I spent it is that how you sound it canada Badal blend natural lemon line extract in coconut oil that is it people that is all they put in this full spectrum can above Badal be dial the dial but little blend natural lemon lime extract in coconut oil that's it I literally have done this is my third review and this has the littlest amount of ingredient in it in everything that I have been reviewing and you ingest this so it's great childproof lock the consistency goes down very smoothly I don't know if anybody else has tried CBD but usually the consistency is thick it's it's thick it doesn't taste good it take it leaves like a really gross feeling in your mouth but this does not only do the job and it makes the pain go away the headaches the muscle aches and it definitely comes your head calms your mind just remember to take it in the appropriate amount of doses okay now the negatives I rate this 5 out of 5 stars there is no negatives to this coy Naturals is exactly koi Naturals it is amazing it tastes great it does great and they have so many different milligrams to choose from please if you're thinking about or if you are in pain if you have headaches if you're having Sayyidi anything please pick up a bottle of this because I guarantee you with my life that this is gonna do the job but make sure that you get the appropriate amount of milligrams okay alright well thank you so much for tuning in like I said if you have any questions drop them in the comments below and on top of that you know subscribe if you liked the video you liked the content you liked me subscribe if you didn't like it give it a thumbs down but I can honestly say that I'd be I'd be pretty sad okay but anyway thank you so much for tuning in on my third video and everybody have a nice amazing weekend gay yay", "KDjg-NuSvac": "on the market today there's two different kinds of CBD you're seeing out there there's the full spectrum and there's isolate the eye slit is just pure CBD it works great for people who have to take drug tests for work maybe not be allowed to have any other cannabinoids in their system perfect for them the unfortunate part is though it only works so well with a full spectrum of CBD oil or hemp oil you actually have all the other terpenes and cannabinoids in the oil still which actually gives the entourage effect and activate in your receptors and actually allowing your body to uptake and utilize more of the hemp oil that you're taking it my personal experience I prefer the full spectrum hemp oil I noticed a vast improvement with my ailments using the full spectrum hemp oil mainly from the entourage effect of the other cannabinoids along with the high amount of CBD when I tried the CBD isolate I noticed that I plateaued at a certain point and then as soon as I started taking the full spectrum hemp oil I could just notice the difference right away", "4fSyQ8imidY": "so I wanted to do a review for CBD I've been trying some of their products the two products I've tried are the peppermint full-spectrum oil and the neon gummy bears first off a little bit less important but both products taste really good the gummies I almost just ate a whole pack one time because they tasted really good and they actually work great compared to like a lot of the other companies that I've tried CBD gummies and then this stuff to CBD peppermint oil it's super strong I'll take it if I'm having trouble going to sleep I'll take a dropper in it with about 20-30 minutes I'm feeling super chill super calm and I'm usually sleep in like 20-30 minutes how they recommend this stuff I also found out that on the pack there's a QR code that you can scan and it'll tell you the lab results so you can actually see what you're putting in your body which is really cool and there's only like a few ingredients in here which are make let you know that there's not any garbage that you're that you're taking both the products super solid and highly recommend both of them I'll continue to buy

product is because they're coming to you now but what it is and what it can do for you is amazing we have two strengths of this product 500 milligram in 1500 milligram and here's what's so exciting about it by adding just one milliliter of 10x peer to a 30 milliliter container the drops model that all the drops come in if you add just one milliliter of tanks pure to the CBD oils that we sell it's been shown to increase the effectiveness the the potency the result producing potential of that CBD oil by up to seven times but here's the face we're not just adding one milliliter we're adding two milliliters of obtaining spirit to every one of our 500 milligram and 1500 milligram 10x pure 30 milliliter products now we still have the regular product as well as the isolate and the full-spectrum without the connector but with the ten extra product there's two milliliters of this additional ingredients being at it so when we say it's up to 10 times more potent and more effective we're actually being conservative than that and the reason for the increase potency and effectiveness of these products is what we're here to talk about tonight and it all has to do with water solubility and spinal availability but before I bring on our amazing scientific expert guest speaker who I'm really looking forward to just letting her kind of let her loose watching so to speak I want to first introduce the man that made it possible for c2fo to get the exclusive rights to attend occur in the entire network marketing industry world wide is the co-founder and CEO of t4 manufacturing which was founded in 2017 but then in November of last year they brought on highly experienced scientists with extensive expertise in organic and targeted biological processes and what happened was they developed a patented process that's what we're gonna be talking about tonight we can't go into details because it's patented but it's what makes this ingredient and this part of our products so amazing so please welcome with our heartfelt thanks and appreciation for the exclusive rights you've given us the awesome Jeremy ducharme and Jeremy I just want to say thank you so much for joining this time so I'm gonna introduce someone to you folks that you want to listen closer to she has come to us by way of Yale University New Haven department of molecular biology University of California San Francisco and in many other locales where she has honed and developed her expertise she's a molecular biologist extraordinaire it's definitely one of the smartest people I've ever met please welcome the amazing Francis or we called her friend DiNozzo friends thank you so much for being on the call tonight thank you for having me thank you for being there even though Jeremy somehow dropped off because I know he was off he was on it's okay with you I'm gonna sort of just as Pompey I'd like to ask you some questions that we've received from members in our company and then just let you share with us your extensive knowledge of what we have our hands on here with ten insecure I said okay trying okay so number one first can you please explain to our listeners what is and extra ingredient is how it affects our CBD oil when it's combined what's what what you can share with them about it I guess this patented process and anything that you are allowed to explain to us about it sure so 10x pure is a mixture of a unique supercharged oxygenated oil and a full spectrum and educator the oil itself is hydrophilic which means that it is has an affinity with water this allows the oil and water to form an emulsion since most of the human body systems are water-based this property will allow the oil along with any associated molecules to travel effectively through the body so Willem patented process produces an exposed oil with the thin layer film removed it is super light and can rapidly penetrate membrane another advantage to the k\u00f6ppen molecule is the ability to adapt other closed molecule with a state-of-the-art coupling reaction to establish and covalent let clear structure the covalent bonding creates a synergistic CSEC meaning that they may work as a team resulting in increased opens easy and faster reactions so actually the first questions that you said to me are a little bit overlapping and that's why I combine the answers okay okay so that was the how the combination of the CBC of the CBD oil in 10x pure expected increase the overall effective I gotcha right okay okay so I guess one of the things we hear about in the industry a lot is the nanotechnology stuff and whether those of you there were at the gala event in Las Vegas heard pranced and share this and with an analogy to can you kind of go into how you feel this is a definitely an edge up on what annal technology does to usual full-spectrum racemic um yeah actually I've borrowed some of this terminology directly from a blog from an expert in nanotechnology and so I'm just reading verbatim from his blog this morning most of the other products available are CBD by swiftly so there is some confusion in the terminology in the field view so sense extract is actually a hoie form of cannabis that consists of between eighty and a hundred individual to Navigon and provides the most optimal healing benefits and calming effect however there is no water soluble CBD whether have the organic level or the nano level so the nanos products in collaborating nanotechnology which is the great technology cannot supply you with the full spectrum hemp extract it does have subedi in it but it has holy CBD and one way to think about this is the difference between honey and sugar for example both will make you see sweetly but honey his raw unprocessed natural product that in addition to the sweetness has nutritional and added health innocence so taking as dr. Seaton explained at the gala taking only the seed out of the hem extra really stressed it away from what she referred to as the entourage of Festus of the complete sheet full spectrum extracts and I'm just gonna sort of open it wide open I don't know what you have to share on this one but I just like to invite you if there's anything on any levels that you'd like to share about connect pure about CBD about CFO about anything any things that from your perspective and what I will very I believe accurately call your expertise teeth perspective share with our listeners tonight at all this is sort of my final question for you anything at all that you want to add to what to settle so yeah again summarize what I said earlier penetration and absorption are the most important property to success successfully deliver a product to its target this exposed oil is considered five times at least five times better than other oil in terms of its penetration ability and permeability it is also has a lower flashpoint and in itself is antibacterial antifungal and prebiotic tenets pure is absorbed easily and travel through the body quickly and brings along a full spectrum temp extract not only a CVD

general idea and also I have an article about it if you'd like to read it on my site just go to WWI told you I was sick calm and you can read the full article there okay so without further ado let's check out my clips which are a little bit awkward I apologize and I'll see you in the next video okay this is Jamie from I told you I was sick calm and this is my very first time trying syan medicinals full spectrum hemp oil I'm gonna be recording my process and I will let you know how I like it and how it goes so it's about two and a half hours later since I tried the hemp oil for the first time and I just woke up from a really lovely calming beautiful blissful nap so so far I am really liking this stuff well I'm awake I'm much calmer and even my sinuses are cleared up so I'm thinking this stuff is kind of magical so I have been reviewing this full-spectrum hemp oil from Zion medicinals so far I have tried it before I take a nap because my anxiety can get really bad today I'm just going to try it I have a little bit of back pain but other than that I'm actually doing really well so I'm gonna give it a little bit of a try and I want to see how it affects me just during daily life and not just napping so here goes it's got a little dropper in it and I usually take very very little because it's very strong like very little that's probably see what I mean little little okay it's really strong so I'm in the car getting ready to drive I work with Dan on Tuesdays and Thursdays so so far so good with the the oil obviously it's not helping my memory um the hemp oil the full-spectrum hemp oil is doing pretty good I may have felt a little bit I don't want to say hi but I may have felt a little bit like calm and peaceful and comfortable and maybe that's hi um but I don't feel like I can't drive I feel totally sober and everything feels fine and I actually feel more calm and relaxed so I just wanted to give you that update and if anything changes I will update you again so the last time I tried this I think I took a little bit too much so I'm going to reduce the dosage just a little bit and I'm gonna try to relax and take a nap because it is really hot and I am exhausted for some reason I feel like I didn't sleep right last night so here we go trying this again well I think I feel a lot better after this nap versus the last one I tried to take with the CBD oil I think that honestly the problem that I'm having is that I'm drinking too much caffeine and my sleep issues are having nothing to do with the CBD oil which I didn't think it was but I just wanted to see if maybe I had taken too much or what was going on but I think it's the caffeine so I'm gonna have to cut back but the hemp oil is definitely helping okay so to give you an idea what I mean about the dosage of this I think that I'm safe doing about this much and that's it I don't think I need any more than that I think just right here seems to work for me just wanted to make sure that I clarified that because there's no technically there's no actual dosing instructions on here so I have had unfortunately neck pain all day long and nothing is seeming to touch it so I'm going to give this a shot I actually have not tried this for physical pain yet so this is gonna be interesting I hope it does work I don't know if it will but I will let you know so let me see here there's a little dosing can't take that much of it you're supposed to keep it under your tongue for 60 seconds and then swallow and the ingredients in this is it's a full spectrum hemp fractionated coconut oil and okay it says I'm sorry seven can avoids cannabinoids I can't even say that that's pretty sad seven cannabinoids including CBC and THC the THC is less than 0.3% I'm going to mention that in the actual article that I write about this but I wanted to make sure that that was really clear that this does contain THC not every CBD product does so I will let you know if it helps with my neck pain because so far ibuprofen and I used like a pain unit on here it's not a TENS unit it's called a Ben APOD and I also use some muscle rub and nothing is working so let's hope this does okay Alan so unfortunately my neck pain is being incredibly stubborn today which means the CBD oil really didn't help I felt like I got some relief for a little while but the spasms are starting again so I am going to start using my tens unit [Music] you", "m1V_ACMW358": "hey guys I wanted to talk to y'all for a few minutes and I'm hoping it's just a few minutes about the announcement that we might be partnering with Charlotte's Web a maker of CVD oils so I've written up a bunch of things I'm just gonna give you some research that I have looked at for a little bit now and then want to give you a personal opinion on it as well so I know I've had some of y'all contact me about it already and just thought you know what that video is the best way to go about this and I want to train you guys this week on what this looks like coming down the pike what is CBD oil what does it do tons of questions not sure I'm gonna have all the answers but hopefully this week it'll be a little bit clearer okay disclosure I'm not making any speculations about what is gonna happen with plexus and CBD oil from Charlotte's Web as of today today's may 4th for me 2019 we have no information from plexus corporate other than the fact that one of the founders of a company called Charlotte's Web is going to be speaking at convention the speaker's name is joel stanley and he's one of seven brothers who founded the CBD oil and company the men that founded the company our brothers char very own Jane Hopkins she's one of our appliance if you guys have not heard of her name or you don't really know how she's related test I think I'm maybe her level six or something secondly I'm hoping this video is going to provide an information that I've researched already said that I'm not gonna try to answer every single question you have but I'm hopefully over this next week lots of answers to some of the questions and hopefully this video is going to better educate you on what exactly CBD oil is what it can do for you and the company behind it all right so let's talk fact versus fiction for a second because I don't have the wrong impression of CBD oil and I'll talk about that a little later towards the end of the video fact there are two active ingredients in marijuana and him those active ingredients are called THC and CBD you guys can look at what those stand for I'm just trying to make this a quicker video by the abbreviated version of it THC is the component in the plant that is psychoactive and gets you high okay CBD is the component in the plant that modulates chemical and electrical activity to help quiet the excessive activity in the brain causing a myriad of issues one of them being seizures all right fiction this is a big one for me because I thought this was true CBD oil is only made of marijuana not true CBD oil is not medical marijuana at the beginning when Charlotte's Web oh I'm sorry at the beginning Charlotte's Web and their product was classified as that so if you're looking at stuff I think the CNN documentary even calls it medical marijuana once it was classified is that it is no longer classified as that okay it's been reclassified as hemp which you go into a whole food store I'm assuming Trader Joe's as well and you can find him okay CBD oil contains 21 percent of the CBD component and less than 1% of the THC it's actually like 0.3% of the THC all right it took years of crossbreeding to break down that THC because the brothers wanted the medical component of it and not the psychoactive aspect of it why do we need CBD oil okay so we've discussed the fact that it's not going to make you kind of go out of your mind it's not psychoactive you're not gonna get high off of this why is everybody talking about it I went into my holistic doctor and with my newborn just the other day is a whole row set up of CBD oils he's a believer I walk in he's got Christian stuff everywhere and the TV station had on Christian speakers and preachers and so he had CBD CBD oil everywhere I went into my car vouchers office two weeks ago when the baby was born got him adjusted and she has CBD oil stuff everywhere so it's kind of um it's kind of a new thing that help was kind of the new thing and now we're kind of talking about CBD oil and why do we need this every single person okay not just people who smoked me to the best every single person has something called an endocannabinoid system in your body all right now this system was discovered in the 90s I've seen different dates given on that 92 94 so I'm just gonna say the early nineties so if you didn't hear about this biological system growing up in school it's because it's more relatively new so let's talk about what this system actually does in our bodies and this was kind of a fascinating study for me I really enjoyed and learning more about it so um first let's just mention homeostasis some of these words are coming back from your biology class right homeostasis is your body's effort to keep everything operating correctly I'm going to put the links for where I found all of this information in the comments of this video so if you're like where'd she get all this I'm going to share it with you okay it works to keep your internal environment inside stable and optimal no matter what's happening in the environment outside of you guys okay so I'm going to give you an illustration of kind of what that looks like you guys are just all from a website but I love the way to explain it it just makes a lot of sense so let's think of this system as the electrical panel in your car okay so the endocannabinoid system think of it like the electrical panel in your car the gauges tell you something is not operating correctly okay you're gonna have a light flash on when something isn't operating in the right range like your temperatures too high your heart's beating too fast maybe your hormone levels are off your body is going to activate the endocannabinoid system to regulate it if you're really hot and you begin to sweat it's your endocannabinoid system working to cool you down right your endo cannabinoid system does this using two receptors okay and from my research we only know about two receptors there's possibility that there's more but i'mma tell you let me know now CB CB one controls your central nervous system CB 2 controls the nerves in your extremities digestive system and specialized cells in your immune system we've had a fun science day already haven't we okay your endocannabinoid system can help regulate your appetite your digestion your immune function inflammation including it gyro inflammation your mood your sleep your reproduction and fertility motor control temperature regulation memory pain it's a lot of stuff right so hearing all of that how does I guess your next question is well how does the endocannabinoid system like how does it why does it need the oil to help it well just like poor gut health can wreck your the rest of your body your endocannabinoid system can also be wrecked just by things that are happening to you things that you eat that are not good for you etc so because we have something like pro bio that can help the gut and we're all aware of how great that is we have we turn to something for from the plants as well to help the endocannabinoid system just continue to function correctly or to start functioning correctly again we take phyto cannabinoids to help the endocannabinoid system okay if you remember science Fido is from a plant so we take plants to help our endocannabinoid system CBD is one of the phyto cannabinoids CBD can go directly into your endo system and like a key it can unlock that system that is not working properly so CBD is kind of a supplement like vitamin C it's it's very benign but it can be very important for a system that for years we didn't even know we had I'm hoping that makes sense it made a lot of sense to me I really enjoy the study of that I know you still have got questions I'm hoping this week on our team page helps with that I'm going to continue to give you more information as I hear about it from corporate or from other people with plexus who are much more skilled and well versed at this stuff than I am I want to close with the fact that most of you know I'm a conservative Christian and and I want to give you a personal opinion about what I think about the CVD oil that might have been why you are watching this video in the first place just to hear my opinion on it when I heard this was coming out with plexus I was really skeptical my husband and I talked about it now we still do not know what's coming out it just when I saw that we were having a speaker from this company come speak obviously we start thinking something's coming down the pipeline and I was really skeptical and so is my husband and he even said you know Courtney you've had a great five years of plexus and maybe this is just the time that God had for us and we need to be done now and I was like well let me just educate myself on it and see what it is which is what I'm hoping this video has done for you and it's maybe even been a jumping point for you to do your own research and come up with some more answers to questions that you may have but the more that I once uncovered about CBD oil especially with Charlotte's Web I feel comfortable with whatever plexus decides to do in the future with a product as long as the THC levels remain below that 1% and here's how my husband I came to that conclusion about ten times in the Bible we are told to be sober minded that sober mindedness is one reason why we choose not to drink I know there's a lot of Christians out there now who choose to drink that's kind of between you and God and I we just for ourselves have chosen not to because we choose to stay sober minded anything that can mess with my mind and cause me to act or speak in a way that I don't have completely complete control over is something that I choose personally not to use there is no psychoactive materials in the CBD oil produced by Charlotte's Web it is illegal in all 50 states to use ship or sell CBD oil okay so I'm not breaking any laws by using it selling it it's also able to be used by anyone if you watch that amazing CNN documentary where they kind of named the whole company after this one little girl who was having about 300 seizures a week and after using this product she no longer is having seizures I think she's seven years seizure freedom but if you've seen that obviously even children can use it and she's not the only child that has used it that they have worked with so ultimately what I'm saying is this is a decision you guys have to pray through um is it something that you feel comfortable with you and your family using is it something you feel comfortable selling I will say if it's not something you feel comfortable using or selling that doesn't mean you have to quit Lexus and it just means maybe that's not something you actively promote and that's not a testimony that you share on your page if it is something you feel comfortable with more power to you I do not want to be the I guess deciding factor for you and your family on what y'all are comfortable with and so I'm leaving that up to you as the individual as families that's just my take on why we are going to continue with plexus why we left Lexus and why we feel comfortable with whatever is coming down the pike as long as it stays about 1% or less of the THC so I'm hoping that helps guys I look forward to a great week sharing more information as the week goes on have a great day", "mY20TICyT8g": "what's going on everyone my name is chris here at CBD review lab and today i'm reviewing the savage CBDs 1000 milligram full spectrum CBD oil specifically their peach and pear flavor so savage CBD is based in California and they've been in the CBD game since 2015 and they carry a massive selection of products all of which are a third-party tested by SC labs so you know you're getting products that you can trust when I was looking at the certificate of analysis for this specific product the lab results showed that there's actually over 42 milligrams of CBD per milliliter in this product so while they market it had 1000 milligrams it's actually close four to twelve hundred and sixty milligrams of CBD which I'm totally cool with so the oil itself has a clear appearance to it and it has a nice fruity smell and taste with absolutely no bitterness where cannabis taste at all it is hands-down the best tasting CBD oil I've tried so far and I've tried quite a few CBD oils so my dosage for this product has been two milliliters which according to the certificate of analysis is over 80 milligrams of CBD and I've been very pleased with the results I find that it doesn't relax my body as much as other CBD oils but it does seem to relax my mind and it makes me very sleepy I don't know if the CBD strain that they use to make their products is a sativa but I seem to feel it more in my head than in my body which I'm actually a big fan of I love getting that body high from CBD but this is been quite enjoyable as well so as far as price goes this Teamster runs $85 if you use the discount code CBD review lab and if we go off the lab results which say there's 1260 milligrams of CBD in this product the price comes out to under seven cents per milligram of CBD and I consider 10 cents to be average so it's below average so to summarize I think savage CBD offers a solid CBD oil it works well and it's under ten cents per milligram so I've got a link to their website in the description below and don't forget to use the discount code to save some money if you end up trying them out so thank you so much for watching I hope this video was helpful if you have any questions please leave them down below I hope everyone has a great day peace", "h8Y-NZOWQAo": "welcome to the Zija lab where we are here to demonstrate to you how a male and tun CBD squares outperform other ways of getting CBD into your body and therefore give you greater benefits to the right of me we have our oral way so if you ingest your CBD we have our CBD here and we have a simulated digestive tract in the middle with a simulated liver on the bottom as we take CBD the bulk of it is going to hit that liver and go through extensive first pass metabolism meaning that hardly any of it is actually going to enter this outer area that simulates the body or the bloodstream it's going to only come in maybe 6% is what a study says and so a lot of its just gonna be metabolized and it's out of the body that's what happens there now in the center we have our simulated skin here this is what happens when we apply an anton square we'll see that we get a slower but more sustained delivery of the CBD into the body and so we get constant dripping the body is giving us the the CBD regularly and so some of it builds up in the tissues as well in your fat cells because cannabinoids build up in our fat cells and are stored there now the last method is when we use an IV so this is directly going into the body into the bloodstream [Music] and so you get rapidly elevated levels of CBD in the bloodstream but the problem is that that also rapidly is excreted from the body so you don't have a long lasting effect from the IV now coming back to our Entune squares here's one of the great benefits of having a transdermal delivery because those seat those cannabinoids are stored in our fat cells when you fast or you have an activity you're exercising and those fat cells will be broken down for energy sources and as they are it also releases the cannabinoids and so what happens is we get a secondary delivery a big secondary delivery of the cannabinoids that are coming back into the body and so you get two deliveries this way which allows you to be having a CBD in your body for longer and giving you greater benefits [Music]", "Ru1pvQTaOdM": "hey guys Justin and Jennifer here with Rob yoga him store hey guys she's gonna bring you a quick review of a new product we just got it's called our I believe is how I pronounce it I like a pirate like a party anyway it's a European product and I'm gonna bring you I'm gonna show you the six hundred milligram bottle today so the good thing I like about art is it comes well packaged it's very easy to see what's in here and they take quite good care of how they package each product isn't that pretty like that's a really cool packaging yeah that's good so in that way because it chips from Europe you have to worry about a bottle getting messed up or anything like that so I'm gonna be reviewing number six today we've already reviewed number three well I reviewed it so make sure you subscribe to our channel to see it so the great thing about this product is it comes in a nice I call it a new color with black accents nude marking and it's really easy to read the other great thing about this is you can look on the side of the label and you can see everything that's in it and how they process it so it's co2 extracted it's non-gmo it's organic it's 100% vegan which really makes a difference on how the quality of the product another really great thing about this particular company is they grow everything in Europe they have headquarters in both the US and in Europe but everything is grown in Southeast Europe they don't tell you exactly where but as a result of that the amount of THC in each of their products that they only carry full-spectrum at this point is 0.2 percent or below so if the amount of THC in your product is something that you're concerned about European standards require a lower amount in the US we can have 0.3% but in Europe you can only have point two so in all of the ire health products its 0.2 percent or lower the other awesome thing about IR in general European standards can be mmm a little bit more stringent yeah different than the u.s. there are a little more stringent and so our health action they on their website they're really proud once you click on the information about each product you're gonna be able to see once it pops up here it is on the iPad that they are European Food Safety Authority certified which is awesome and so you know what you're getting is exactly going to be the same thing every single time because they're also GMP certified as well that's interesting it's good to know because you know that with so many new products coming onto the market and people say they're being tested and all that sort of stuff you know that this company is is legit because they're following such strict manufacturing protocols so the great thing too is when you open the box it has a nice solid black bottle so you know that oils were protected in there the other thing about this is the oil is a nice dark green color and I'm about to drip it yeah I can it's yes that's right precious commodity here yeah so this has a to me it has a strong plant flavor I don't really taste the medium-chain oil that they use or coconut oil so it but it doesn't taste bad it's a if plant flavor if you don't mind it then you're gonna love this product if flavor is a issue for you then you know what get it anyway because it works great and it's a great value and you're not taking it because it's desert you're taking it because it can help relieve anxiety it can help you to sleep it can help reduce inflammation and because it's a full-spectrum product you know you're gonna get the benefits of the entourage effect and that's where all those chemicals are working together in your in your favor so to speak chemicals meaning cannabinoids inside this cannabis product that's right so they recommend a full dose or a full dropper one to two full droppers a day based on you as as you need I take two because I need about twenty milligrams and hour 20 milligrams or more depending on the day because I have back issues and knee pain we're working on him practicing more yoga yes so that's a good thing about it is I can do one dropper in the morning and probably by mid-afternoon three or four o'clock and probably do another one so that I feel better the fact that is sativa brandt sativa blend it doesn't really keep me awake as long as I don't take it I'm like Jennifer I can't take it right before bed because it will keep me awake a little bit or just doesn't really keep me awake it just slows me from falling asleep as quickly as I normally do when I take the indica Brent the indica blends or whatever I really like this product it's a great value for this 30ml bottle it's less than 50 bucks and the other great thing about our is they're very transparent they show you everything there third-party tested and everything that shows up on the third-party test they offer on their website which I'm going to show you they break it down in a nice graph if you'd like to read graphs or they break it down by each individual line item product which is really nice because not everybody in the industry does that now and that's really really annoying it's mostly the newer folks to the market that are being so transparent our health was created it was um formed in 2018 so it's a newer company so I believe that the newer companies are just being more open and honest and transparent about what's in them and let me show you what this so you're gonna see the potency test so you know exactly how much the Delta 9 THC and the THC a is in there and the CBD in this product there's six hundred and ten milligrams of CBD in it which is actually a little bit more right than higher than what they sell what they say on the outside would you light most people will go lower so you're getting a benefit of a higher quality product in this one oh yeah slightly more potent concentrated product but the other here here it is you're gonna list out every single cannabinoid that's in the product which i think is awesome I know that research is still in its infancy in terms of what the different cannabinoids can do for your system but the early research suggests that each of them contribute in a different way slightly to your overall health and so it's really awesome so for example the CBD just plain CBD in the CBD a total to be about a little over 600 milligrams so CBD a is 450 milligrams a unit CBD is 215 so it's just showing you that you're getting a lot of that CBD that you want which is that what we need to have a what more healthy life that's right since we're not daughters and we want to thrive good placement yeah alright guys so that's it for today there again check out our Cercado youtube channel if you like this and we'll always have more reviews and

product here at CBD Biocare we only offer full-spectrum CBD what that means is all of the cannabinoids are present all the terpenes all the other mint molecules are also present in the oil versus a CBD isolate which means the CBD is isolated from the oil and it's usually turned into a powder form and that's all you get is CBD so when you're reading and you see on a website for example and it says CBD 99% well that sounds fantastic but in truth that is not going to give you the medicinal benefits that you are seeking so with the full-spectrum CBD oil what we have when you take a tincture and you take a full dropper and in that full dropper let's say you take the 750 milligram in that full dropper there are 30 milligrams of full-spectrum CBD oil what that means is that we have all of the cannabinoids plus CBD packed in that dropper 25% of that dropper is the CBD but again the true magic of the oil and the true medicinal benefits occur when all of those cannabinoids are together if you're doing your research it's often called the synergistic effect of the cannabinoids it's also called the entourage effect because that is where the the medicinal benefits exist and that is what you are seeking and that is what we offer we have been we've looked at offering a CBD isolate product but when we dug and we did our research and we talked to the doctors and we really did our research in terms of what is better for you no question the full-spectrum CBD is the way to go so again there's full-spectrum CBD which is what we offer because it offers the medicinal value and then some of the other products on the market are CBD isolate so before you purchase before you compare us or when you're comparing us make sure you're comparing apples to apples", "JNsc1dmpdkM": "hi my

"wAF_M0k6u1w": "in this video i'm going to explain how i've made my own brand of cbd oil and i'll also demonstrate how to use it so i decided to make a full spectrum product and that's because in my personal opinion also the opinion of thousands of my customers and a full spectrum does is the most effective it does work the best a full spectrum means that when the hemp plant is growing it has over 100 cannabinoids in there the two main ones are cbd and thc cbd is non-psychoactive thc is the part that gets people stormed when taken in large amounts so legally here in the uk we are legally allowed to have 0.2 thc in a product because it's such a miniscule amount that it's not going to cause any psychoactive effect but what happens is when we take cbd with a little bit of thc all the other phytocannabinoids from the hemp plant the terpenes the essential oils when we consume them as a whole plant full spectrum and what happens is once they get into the body the working synergy together and so that and the create an entourage effect in the body which means it has a greater impact on the cannabinoid system so a full spectrum is the most effective oil that you can get so with a full spectrum product though i do need to make you aware that if you were drugs tested it could possibly show as a false positive on a drugs test so very similar to if you were to eat poppy seeds they would also show as a false positive now if you are if you have a driving job or if you get drugs tested at work and we do have lab tests for our products and so if it did show us a false positive on a drugs test you could show them the lab test to prove that you are just taking a food supplement and you're not consuming drugs so my oil is a full spectrum oil it's got all of the cannabinoids in there the terpenes the flavonoids the essential oils and it's also been mixed with organic hemp seed oil and it's got a little bit of peppermint flavour in there just to mask the hempy taste because it is a full spectrum it is it is a quite a strong taste in oil and i have had it have it had it developed so that once you do put it into your mouth it does disperse and absorb into mucous membranes very very quickly so within a minute or so it's it's dispersed and got into the bloodstream i've had my oil made here in the uk it's been manufactured in a gmp facility so the hygiene there is is absolutely excellent um we've also had it it was extracted with a co2 extraction now co2 extraction means that it's the cleanest purest form of extraction another type of extraction would be an ethanol extraction and the reason why i didn't choose that is because an ethanol extraction it can leave residual solvents in the oil so i wanted this to be as clean and pure as possible i have had all my products tested at a laboratory so what the lab test proves it's a third party laboratory test as well and what it proves is is that it has got less than 0.2 thc in there so it's 100 legal and safe to use it also proves that if it says it's got 500 milligrams of cbd in the bottle then it's actually got 500 milligrams of cbd in the bottle because when you're buying a product like this that's what you're paying for you're paying for the milligrams so a lab test proves that it has got that amount in it it also shows that it's pesticide and chemical free it's non-gmo it is vegan friendly and it hasn't got any heavy metals or residual solvents left in there as well i chose to put my oil into a 30 ml bottle usually a cbd oil will come in a 10 ml bottle but i chose a 30 ml bottle and because it's mixed with organic hemp seed oil i wanted to get as much essential fatty acids per dose as possible so with it being in a larger bottle it just means that you're going to get more omega-3s six and nines every time you take a serving and it also is in a brown bottle and the reason why i chose that is because this brown bottle it the glass it actually protects protects it from oxidation and it also protects it from uv rays so i do recommend storing it in a cool place you don't have to keep it in the fridge but just don't put it on the radiator or in the sunshine and just keep it somewhere cool this bottle can also be recycled as well so once you've finished with it and just pop it in your recycling bin and you're doing your bit for the environment when i do send out um products through the post i do use biodegradable wrap bubble wrap and the bags that i use are also 100 recycled and they're also bio biodegradable as well so the way that you would use my cbd oil it comes in two strands i've got 500 milligram and a thousand milligram if you're new to cbd it's always best to start on the lowest strength of 500 milligram and i always suggest to start on 10 milligrams a day and that can be taken in two servings so five milligrams in the morning five milligrams in the afternoon after several days if you feel that you're noticing a bit of a difference but you want a bit of a better effect you can increase it to 10 milligrams in the morning 10 milligrams in the afternoon which would give you double the amount 20 milligrams a day but i say to start on 10 milligrams because i'd say a good 50 of my customers find that 10 milligrams a day is sufficient for them so with this bottle it's got 500 milligrams in the bottle it has a one mil per pet and that one mil per pet holds 16 milligrams in total so all you would do is you would just have a third of a pet in the morning and a third of a pet in the afternoon and a third of a paper holds five milligrams so that's five milligrams in the morning five milligrams in the afternoon the one thousand milligram bottle that because it's got double the amount in a third of a pet is 10 milligrams and so if you wanted to have a higher amount per day you could just have you could buy the 1 000 milligram bottle have a third of a pet 10 milligram in the morning and a third of a pet 10 milligram in the afternoon that would give you 20 milligrams a day so if you are new to cbd and this is the first product that you're looking to buy and this product if you were to just take 10 milligrams per day this

"wlsHmRvRZ0A": "[Music] what's up everybody my name is Christopher a little bit about myself I've been involved in the cannabis industry in every facet from horticulture to agribusiness and advocacy for like I said just under under 20 years so I've been approached by the good people at popular scene brands calm you can find them on Instagram populist leading brands and pop the CV so what they do is they bring here as much information on cannabis business everywhere from water cannabinoids terpene profiles the difference in ham industrial ham and all the new things as far as products and information and legislation that are coming around on a daily basis so they really are leaders in the industry of providing free information and discount coupons and codes you some of the most familiar if you will CVD products that are on the market currently so I've been approached by them to start a project where we're going to be reviewing some of the most popular brands that you see in the retail shelves across America from different tinctures edibles health and beauty products pet products and stuff like that so today our first product that we are doing a review on together its pinnacle house six hundred milligram tincture so let's touch on everything from the marketing this bottle is probably one of the coolest bottles that I've ever seen it's kind of like winning winning an Oscar for your help with this with a gold bottle the other thing I like to take a look at some to this considered supplement and you are taking it to hopefully improve your overall quality or health there's the dropper and you could see here that this one is labeled in quarter milliliter doses all the way up to a full yellow in there that is cool very responsible of these guys everybody should be doing it should be your requirement it's also in the child safe bottle topper which it which is great because you don't want anybody that's not in need of this to take more than what they what they would do fortunately it's not a pharmaceutical so it won't kill them and then just ride make them poop their brains out but you know that's not bungee so I will tell you that I've been taking this product for a little under two weeks about 10 or 11 days I've been taking it suggested use by the company and I will say that it's helped with my inflammation my knees my joints on stuff that's taking a beating from being in the you know forming industry for as long as I have it definitely has helped with a lot of like that my mental clarity issues it's helped me fall asleep a lot accident typically I lay in bed for sometimes in excess of 3 or 4 hours before I fall asleep and you know I wake up not feeling as rested probably should and I keep in very close watch up my blood pressure my heart rate things of that nature while I'm asleep and it's been showing that my blood pressure has gone down which in turn are testing the lecture-room of lecture just lower when I wake up and the amount of deep sleep I'm kidding and almost twice as long as what I was getting before I started taking your breath product so I'm definitely a believer I definitely think that 600 milligrams is a great place to start for the average adult and then you can either work up and work down eventually the value will be over build a tolerance it'll bioaccumulate in your system if you're not sweating it out or stuff like that but I will say that that's being a diabetic having the vegetable glycerin flavor kind of cut some my my little sugar cravings that I have throughout the day and I think it's a lot safer to take a little dropper of a vegetable glycerin CBD tincture and I did so many reasons people to cook me or something like that so you do taste the plant in the back because it is a cool spectrum product they're not just an isolate there's a little bit different method of how they put these together so you will get a kick back up like a biomass or plant flavor instead of just like a pure isolate which they just put my coconut err and boil so overall I think the marketing wins I think the products great I'll continue to use it I'm definitely gonna get a higher dose and see how what that does to me and how that makes me feel but as a lifelong cannabis easier that's one that really watches my guy watches everything that I pretty much system on a daily basis I will say that the effects from this one I definitely feel that if I were to get a third-party independent test that it would be what it says it is and I will be purchasing this purchasing this product regularly and including it in my any supplement regimen and I hope you need to so go check out popular CBD brands top the CBD on Instagram so you can get some discount code so you can try this stuff

"hello fellow Doug lovers so if you've watched my top 5 CVD oils video for humans you all know that I've been experimenting with CBD for the last couple months because I was looking for a solution to deal with my stress and it's worked out so well for me and I'm so happy that I found a natural solution to my problem and I thought you know why not try it for my dog I have a 12 year old chihuahua chichi and she's been struggling to get around more and more so I wanted something that could alleviate her pain and just you know kind of give her energy boost so I've tried a few different oils from different brands just putting a few drops in her meals twice a day and that's worked really well for her but you should definitely figure out what dosage works best for your dog but first let's explore oil options so here we go my top 5 CBD oils for dogs starting at number five just CBD ok this is number five but honestly it was really hard to order them because they just all worked really well so with just CBD you have quite a few flavor options that can appeal to your pooch they've got bacon chicken salmon and beef I personally went for bacon and I was a little tempted to try it for myself but I didn't so jess CBD offers 3 CBD strengths for their oils and at a pretty good price as well the hundred milligram bottle is at $17.99 the 250 milligrams is at $29.99 and the 500 milligrams is 49.99 Gigi's pretty small so I just went with the hundred milligram bottle and that was enough but if you're looking for the best deals on CBD oils just click on the link in the video description and honestly you'll find the best prices there next in 4th place I put Charlotte's Web there CBD oil is offered as chicken or unflavored this time I went for the unflavored because I figured it would be easier to mix with bigger variety of food again this one worked like a charm just make sure that you test and adjust the dosage when you switch from another CBD provider their oil is also from USA grown hemp and they make it really easy because they only offer two sizes they have the 30 milliliter bottle at $64.99 and at a 100 milliliter bottle for one 59.99 both sizes contains 17 milligrams of CBD and they offer a 30 day satisfaction guaranteed so if you're on the fence you know you can just try it and see if it works with your pooch with little risk in third place we have CBD FX so you might have heard of these guys they've been mentioned by vogue NBC News BuzzFeed etc they provide real high quality products and they also have a huge variety of products they're also 100% natural and organic they use the co2 extraction method and they keep their lab reports available on their websites if you have any concerns and want to have a look so in their pet range they offer three CBD oils and they basically depend on your pet size so for small dog breeds or even just animals weighing less than 20 pounds you have the 150 series at $29.99 for medium breeds there's the 300 series at $44.99 and then for the large breeds there's the 600 series for $69.99 now next on the list and second place med Tara okay first thing to mention about these guys is the price point they're the most affordable and they start at $19.99 for the 150 milligrams bottle you can also get the 300 milligram bottle for $29.99 and the 700 milligram bottle for 39.99 I think 750 is the highest I've seen which you know could be good if you have a mastiff or a Great Dane or something like that like all products in this video matera CBD oil is made in the u.s. non-gmo all natural and doesn't contain any THC which is the psychoactive element of cannabis meaning your dog will not get high and neat little thing that these guys provide also is their pet dosage calculator so you can just scroll here just input the weight of your dog and then you'll get dosage recommendations and if you're out of the u.s. matera ships internationally so you can get your hands on the CBD oil except if you're from Canada or Australia all right now for first place I put honest paws so why did I put these guys in first place well several reasons the first one is these guys only provide CBD oils for pets so that's their main focus second their products are also 100% natural non-gmo from premium grade hemp farmed in Colorado and their soy free so if your dog has soy allergies this is a really good option they also offer the 30-day money-back guarantee their website offers a ton of information on CBD for pets so it's definitely worth a read if you've got any questions or concerns okay now for the main reason why I put on his paws as my first choice is because I had to take a five-hour flight with chichi she is usually a super nervous traveler which in turn makes me super nervous but oh my god what a difference I mean I gave her some CBD before the flight and she was so calm but yet she was you know looking around kind of taking it all in but without like I could tell she was so much more at ease so that's why I put it at number one alright that is it for my top 5 CBD oils for dogs list don't forget to check out the link in the video description for the best deals for CBD oils plus it gets updated regularly with the latest deals so time to go shopping", "FpqLj3UqLGo": "a lot of people want CBD they hear the word hemp and they think oh I'm just gonna go out and buy the product a lot of the products that are out there are actually hemp seed oil that contains zero CBD now they have some Omega oils in them that are good for your health but they don't have any of the CBD so people are out there in the marketplace using this confusion selling hip seed oil at an extremely high price and people think they're getting CBD and they're getting no CBD hemp seed oil is not the same as what you'll find in a can IV product [Music] CBD is very different it's taken from the flower where the crystals are pulled from the plant matter through an alcohol extraction process and hemp seed oils where they through a cold pressing process they pulled the oil from the sea very different products very different uses [Music]", "zqRNCSX_uJQ": "hey what's going on everybody hope you have a healthy day and if you see what's going on out there you know CBD is extremely popular there's so many companies so many different options it could make your head spin well it was a couple years ago I actually tried a CBD brand didn't really do anything for me I tried a liquid I tried a cream just it just didn't work and I do see this where people say some it will work some don't and it was just a few weeks ago I connected with a company called calm by wellness and had the opportunity to have a conversation what I really impress or what really impressed me was that the company wanted to spend time to introduce themselves what they do what they stand for and then talk about one of their products which they sent to me to try and review it's called sleep and again I've had the opportunity now for a good couple weeks to try it I really wanted to make sure and see how it worked for me before I shared with you now I'm gonna put a link in the description where you could learn more about the company and if you really dive in and learn about the company I think you're gonna be impressed as was I so they thought we'd try sleep before we try some of the other products this is a 17 milligrams per serving blueberry lavender and as far as the ingredients well a couple other things its THC free which was really important to know and when you go onto their website you'll see they've got lab information lab reporting so you'll be able to get that there as well it's a broad spectrum hemp extract sleep turban blend and it's made in the USA so it's all-natural non-gmo organically grown gluten free and again it's processed and made here in the USA as far as the the different blend that it has in there it's got lavender flower chamomile it's got hops lemongrass hoe wood which is leaf orange and pine and jasmine so it's got a really nice combination it's kind of got a fruity combination and as far as taking it you take it about an hour or where there abouts an hour before going to sleep and the recommended is just to take a drop put it under your tongue and then let it dissolve in under your tongue I let it dissolve there about for a met a minute and then I swallow so as far as the product and how it worked for me I tried it both actually with one full dropper and two full droppers just to see the difference so initially the one dropper I felt like it worked okay for me then it went to two droppers and I felt I was getting a bit groggy when I was getting up so then I went back to one but as I started using it over the several days and over a couple weeks what I found is that it does kick in for me where I start getting more relaxed and I then really start getting very tired when I'm laying on my bed and I used before I go to sleep I use I use an acupressure mat and I and I found that when I started using this I really started getting tired now during the night I'm still waking up I'm going to the bathroom so that's not changing a lot but I do find that it is helping me get a bit more relaxed and definitely feeling more tired to fall asleep quicker so that's the results for me so I will say that I do feel like it is working for me when you are looking at the CBD companies it's so important to really know what's behind the company and when you go to the website and they really have a nice website there's a ton of testimonials as well you'll find that they you know they just talk about that they have an in-house farmers in how scientists they also do third-party testing and also as as far as what they do versus other company so other companies outsource their farmers they outsource their science labs and they're not quality tested and this company does do their testing again you can also scroll down and then here is the certificate of analysis and when I actually was talking to some my friends and sharing on Facebook about it they were asking me do you have that and they do have that there and to me that is impressive so you definitely wanted to check out the website so there you go that's my experience they have a number of other products that you can try as well but if you are in need of sleep you know again it's worked for me it's worked for me some and will definitely continue taking it and look forward to trying other products so I'll try and answer any questions you have but please click on the link where you can get more information greatly appreciated if you find this video helped I definitely appreciate also a thumbs up and hope this will work for you as well if you are taking this

body's endocannabinoid system also called ECS it was only discovered in 1992 it impacts everything from mood to memory from energy to better sleep from faster recovery for less pain in fact it's called the master regulator of the body and what feeds the ECS makes it work cannabinoids the compounds found in him and while hundreds of manufacturers and marketers are trying to cash in on this new market only one company has taken it to the next level that company is evolved by combining the natural power of one plant hemp with a proprietary extract of another place alum they've created a patent-pending product that's truly in a league of its own completely unique and completely different here's the scoop there have been four stages of progress the first stage was isolated where companies took the raw hemp material and boil it down to just one cannabinoid CBD but here's the thing scientists soon figured out that by using all of the hemp plants good stuff not just CBD you achieved better results was staged to the unter aaj effect a huge step forward but those full spectrum products still had traces of THC you know the ingredient that gets your high and can make you fail a drug test so along comes stage 3 broad spectrum keep all the good stuff in hemp and take out a hundred percent of the THC and now stage for the latest and greatest you see we nano sized all the good stuff from him throughout the THC and added a proprietary blend of more terpenes and then supercharged it with nature's most powerful aloe molecule ace man and as they say more is better even

CBD a community like go and reddit you would think that this is the most popular brand why well I bought this bottle of 750 milligrams of CBD for only $32 that's extremely cheap but is it too good to be true let's see the lab results they claim 750 milligrams of CBD and we found 794 milligrams of CBD or 5.8 percent no it's an accuracy it's excellent look at all those other cannabinoids 905 milligrams of total cannabinoids Wow we'll break that down THC 30 milligrams of CBC and 37 milligrams of CBG you guys know I'm a fan of Bluebird botanicals this blows them out the water with the CBG it's more than anything I've tested that's so much CBC - right I was really surprised by this one the CBC and CBG those are the cannabinoids and Charlotte's Web they might be the secret sauce to that very popular brand and I think it might have something to do with all the positive research and positive reviews for that strain and the various conditions possibly people like it the official lab test is here it's just one test and I don't claim the law test this way but it's completely independent and I promise you that I have nothing to do with this company or currently any CBD company the price for sense flat per milligram of CBD if you look at all my tests 15 cents is about average 4 cents is the cheapest out of all of them I tested not only that it goes down to 3 point 5 cents per milligram of total cannabinoids not only that you buy the larger bottles of CBD that they offer and the price per milligram of CBD drops to 3 Sen do you know what this mean not only that I sound like a damn commercial right now but you guys can see my industry report I've got the reports for everything I review they offer veterans disabled and low-income individuals up to 60% off who qualifies of course I don't I don't think they give every single person that discount Wow a little hard never but I really do appreciate they do this for people in need and they've got to be losing money doing this but the the regular price is insane - it's just it's it's cheap ingredients just hemp hemp seed oil and coconut oil beautiful I would be a little disappointed if they added sugar whatever other weird ingredients CBD companies tend to put in their oils this is the milliliter breakdown for dose I would caution this is this is potent you don't want a full dose of this your first go around look at the THC two milligrams of THC that's a lot research shows that high effects can start at two milligrams and sensitive individuals is you high and obviously it's enough to risk a failed drug test some people start off at five milligrams of CBD this is a 50 milligram dose just be aware of what you get into Wow welcome to the 700 club kid Lazarus is a company out of Seattle they've been around since 2014 and remember CBD just became legal at the end of 2018 so they're kind of like vets in this industry let me get the bat out of the way I did find one negative investigation by NBC that found Lazarus natural product had a high levels of lead however just looking at the product in this news piece I was like does that look like Lazarus Naturals label not really it looked like the label was printed on a home computer and deteriorating it didn't look like what I bought they bought it off of Groupon never do that Lazarus came out later and said that the product they tested was counterfeit which is actually a big one group on now I report everything that I find to be transparent but I think NBC's report was just negligent why would you buy something on Groupon and then publish those results but it should caution you that there are lots of fake CBD products out there and you need to buy from legitimate retailers I also don't like that they sell on Amazon because you need to be sneaky and say that you're just hemp oil basically to hide the fact that your product has CBD but the biggest companies are now doing this so what are you gonna do the good nbc6 investigators tested Lazarus and found that they were one of the only companies they tested to have accurate amounts of CBD Wow now you have my tests my independent tests and theirs to confirm its accurate which is good it's good to have multiple sources that's it that's the review this is the cheapest it has the most CBD cbc CBG they're good to vets and low-income people hit that subscribe button and i'll see you next time", "yjV0jy8ibXQ": "hello I'm Steve Walker if you're thinking of trying CBD oil but have more questions than answers then I hope you'll find this video helpful today we're going to talk about our 500 milligram full-spectrum CBD oil tincture which comes in a thirty millimeter or one ounce bottle in this video I'll be explaining what full-spectrum means for you how to read a lab tests for CBD potency and legal TAC amounts and how to take the CBD oil how to get the most out of the CBD tincture and then explain how to calculate dosages full-spectrum CBD or cannabinoids is a hemp extract that contains a hundred and thirteen known cannabinoids found naturally occurring in the hemp plant including terpenes essential oils and other cannabinoids these work together to magnify the therapeutic benefits of each individual cannabinoid this is commonly referred to as the entourage effect full-spectrum CBD also contains 0.3 percent THC or less or at least it should in order to determine if a product is under legal THC limit reputable CBD companies like ours test their products with a certified third-party lab test a lab test is what we call in the business a co a certificate of analysis there's two questions you should always ask yourself one does my product have the amount of CBD as advertised on the label and two does my product meet the required federal limit of no more than 0.3% THC so let's take a look at our coa to see if the amount of CBD matches with what's advertised on our label look at the CBD on the left and then all the way over to the right you'll see 17 point to 9 milligrams per milliliters 17 point to 9 milligrams times 30 milliliters equals 519 milligrams of CBD in our hey we went over the amount good for us our bottle indicates that it has 500 milligrams so you know you're getting the potency you pay for okay and - does my product meet the required federal limit of no more than 0.3% THC so let's look at the very top line where it says d9 - THC and then go to weight percentage so anything below zero point three zero weight percentage is legal according to the 2018 farm bill okay let's talk about dosage so I can't tell you what dosage is right for you you know that's something that you're gonna have to figure out on your own I'll give you some tips but the only thing I would recommend is starting out with a low dose first and then working up from there if needed I mean that's what I did the truth is dosage varies drastically between individuals due to inconsistent potency and then of course the instructions from the manufacturers as well as the desired strength of the individual some CBD research has reported doses ranging from 5 milligrams to over a thousand milligrams generally a product with less than 15 milligrams per milliliter is considered low potency a product with 15 to 50 milligrams per milliliter is regarded as standard potency and then a product with more than 50 milligrams per milliliter or more is considered high potency for more information on dosages go to the education stabbed and then dosages a word of caution here though it is still possible that you could test positive for THC even though the THC level is very low but even if you're taking what is considered high potency then naturally you're more at risk so your job or profession requires a drug test let's say you're a driver or something don't risk it you could always take our THC free isolate CBD gummies okay so I suffer from lower back pain I've had lower chronic back pain for some time now and I'm an insomniac so I take two droppers in the morning when I wake up and to droppers before i go to bed now when i say a dropper full it's more like two-thirds of a dropper let me just show you alright as you can see here the dropper is not full but it's hard to get a full dropper full if you could it would be one milliliter I get a consistent dropper full by first squeezing the dropper bulb fully like this and then I submerge the dropper and then I let go quickly when I pull that up you can see that I have about the same amount every time I do that which is about 2/3 of a dropper I calculated that I could get 49 droppers out of a 30 in a liter bottle so I divided my 500 milligrams that's in the bottle divided by 49 droppers and this equals 10.2 milligrams per dropper let's just say this is rounded off to 10 you could use the same math of course if you have a lower or higher content I started off slower I started off doing just 1 mil 1 drop or fall or 10 milligrams and I really wasn't feeling the benefit but once I upped it to twice that amount to 20 milligrams and yes I felt the difference and during the day not only does my back feel better but I'm also less anxious and at night before I go to bed I noticed that I feel much more relaxed and it calms my racing mind I constantly thinking way too much before I go to bed again not everyone is the same so figure out what dosage works for you we have great educational section a great educational section on our website under the education tab for more information on dosages most experts agree that taken CBD tincture sublingually has the most vile availability bioavailability refers to the degree and rate at which an administered drug or other substance is introduced into the body in order to have an active effect you can lose the effectiveness of CBD if it has to pass through the digestive system sublingual glands absorb the CBD oil into your bloodstream quicker and more effectively so what I do is I'll take my my dropper I go under the tongue and then I'll hold it for like 60 seconds before swallowing I actually don't time myself but I walk around with it under my tongue for at least two minutes before I swallow it this

him so I was willing to try anything [Music] hey we're at ro Nels house and Rennell has a dog named Marley and Marley has a couple conditions I get treated with CBD oil which is something a lot of people didn't know you could do with dogs so how did you come to get Marley somebody was had him up for adoption and they said that they had little kids and they couldn't handle him which I thought was crazy until I got him home and I found out why cuz he just wanted to be held and he's under your feet he couldn't be by himself I was like having a baby so it was like it was terrible if he got really upset he would he'd go to the bathroom in the house and it got to the point where was like you can't have that so yeah we were gonna have to find him another home we take him to a groomer and I just happened to ask one of the ladies that takes care of him there if he behaves as badly there as he does at home and she said that we should consider using the cannabis treats because it would help with his anxiety and that the Prozac probably was not helping any longer because he'd been taking it so long oh so he was on frozen crows I Fedora hmm they do what was the difference between the Prozac behavior in the CBD with the Prozac he was calmer but he still was a little more anxious with having people come and go in here so often he had to calm down because he was just barking like crazy and just going on and on so now he just sits and hangs out with everybody but like I said didn't change his personality at all which was nice because I was afraid it was gonna make him just you know with our Jick and lay around and do nothing so he still runs around with the kids and plays with them and does all that so changes to mean and oh yeah exactly that's exactly right CBD saved the day they did I did well I'd heard about studies on the effects of CBD in dogs this is my first time seeing it in practice so we're outside of it Lydon right now it's one of our nails favorite places to come get everything Marley needs so we're gonna go inside learn a little bit more about CBD and pets and see what kind of goods they have to offer hi Trey hi I'm Leah nice all right so you guys have quite a number of products which ones are for dogs all right so we do have a product that is CBD base or hemp based and it is a pet CBD whole plant tincture CBD is known to be non psychoactive or what we say is non euphoric so you're not gonna get that high it can help with ailments such as stress anxiety pets dogs namely also have what's known as an endocannabinoid system humans and pets have this so CBD can help pets as well for my dog I use it once a day in the evening to kind of chill him out not that it takes away his personality or anything it just is a nice he's not so anxious it's really great and your dog likes it oh yeah absolutely while both THC and CBD compounds are found in cannabis plants they behave very differently CBD doesn't have psychoactive properties so it won't make you feel high it's important to remember that CBD products for dogs aren't regulated so you should try to talk to a vet about what brands and quantity to try for your pet CBD also hasn't been thoroughly tested in humans or animals but some early studies have shown that CBD has a lot of potential medical benefits including a calming effect which is a natural alternative to prozac that can help marleah so let's see a shape before using take four drops per 10 pound animal wait twice daily how big is my early about 8 pounds about 8 pounds yeah that's about like three four jobs all right let's see what you think about this mm-hmm what do you think not sure if I you somewhere you eat so I find I'll eat it [Music] but if I put it on something you'll take it with me think let's try it there we go so today we learned about CBD and dogs CBD might be a good alternative for your dog or your cat or other pets as opposed to going through pharmaceuticals so yeah maybe your dog or your cat

products it all has a chlorophyll it's got every part of the plant in it I'll try and show you the color now so you can actually see this is what we're dealing with look look it it's so like thick and gooey is everything of that natural hemp source so I'm going to try a little bit of and now the solution as you can see it's really really fixed so this is how much I was normally taking about this level and yeah the effectiveness of this product was really good and like the results how I felt throughout the day yeah I was like yeah this is really working I feel good I feel bit more relaxed so yeah I'm gonna try this now and I'm gonna chill outside in the Sun and yeah it's a winter's day and I'm in Manchester and I'm sitting on the Sun it get a bit bit windy [Music] so yeah that's a minute and so it says up to three minutes you can have the CBD oil under your tongue I've heard a lot of different points from different brands like one minute 30 seconds 60 seconds it's just really about you know persevering with your mouth longer you have it more capillaries more like veins and more access to get into your bloodstream through your mouth the longer you keep it there I've also heard about swelling it in your mouth can really help like doing that you can get back to your molars and your molars have a lot of veins and pillories and the cell walls easy to absorb and the CBD a bit better so yeah I think just try out different methods see what works for you and some people can't stand the taste all they really like the taste it really depends on you but if longer you hold in your mouth the best absorption rate so yeah three minutes they advised to describe the taste there's a lot more earthy enriched and other products a lot thicker and more viscous under the tongue but it was nice tasting I've taken me a while to adjust to the taste compared to the other ones which have a sweet terpene profile but yeah it's full spectrum of the products and it's just going to help a Bennett for that entourage effect got the bio purest product here and then we leave a description under below where you can buy it yeah so a reasonable price of $34.99 and what's great about it you are getting a full spectrum products not filtered ours got the chlorophyll they've got you got the THC you got the CBD it is full spectrum I've seen a lot of products advertised online saying hey I've got a full spectrum CBD product here however the chlorophyll is filtered out and really that is not the full spectrum you kind of getting some broad spectrum CBD here but this one yet full spectrum it it says what it does on the tin and yeah I really really enjoy it with it being a full spectrum products do was a little bit I do feel it I feel it a lot quicker and I think eyes orbit a bit better and it lasts a bit longer throughout my day at 3499 yeah like the bottle it's not all flashy or ever however the content inside this bottle is good so overall what am I going to give this product I think yeah $34.99 really reasonable it's not going to break your bank being it full spectrum it's going to last longer and you'll be able to yeah apply less for out the day so if you last you longer yeah I'm gonna have to give this a five star product really really happy with it so thanks guys for sending it yeah I've enjoyed taking it and yeah $34.99 I think it's reasonable for other people in their price points it's not the most flashy bottle but does it need to be it's about the contents inside and yeah so it's a CBD radar and have a good day enjoy", "fkVtLqsBoG0": "hi everybody its dr. Sarah and guess what we are almost at the finish line with my CBD oil pipe harm or Hachiya article series now this video is based on my article on my home page an overview of the full spectrum of research and CBD oil and the entourage of clinical studies and the various cannabinoids in the cannabis plant longest title ever but it does describe what we're going to be discussing today now there will be links to the previous videos with all the resources and references and the original articles at this black site so make sure that you click on those if you missed them because there are very important safety and very important considerations for you to think about before you implement CBD oil or any healthcare modality and I went through all of these subtopics about CBD oil for a reason I really wanted you guys to realize that there's the individual characteristics of the actual modality right so for CBD oil we went over its precautions its regulations its medical usages the mechanism of action the importance of the endocannabinoid system how CBD interacts with it and other cannabinoids interact with that and then the entourage effect which is describing the difference of a full spectrum CBD sorry it's a full spectrum hemp oil right which contained all the cannabinoids versus the CBD oil which is one isolate of the hundreds of compounds found in cannabis and the hemp species is part of the cannabis family okay so not only do you have all those characteristics and consideration standards and quality all of those different factors to consider on the product you're using alone but you also have your own biochemical individuality right everybody's different how they process it metabolize it you know the different environmental exposures all of these will interact to how something affects you so marketing which leads us into think that one thing will cure everything is effective but it's not the truth that I've seen in my clinical experience over the past 15 or so years working with women with their digestive health their hormonal harmony and their mood support it just it just doesn't play out that there's one thing for everybody okay so I'm going to hammer that home as we go through this research because I'm going to be talking about some of its effects but I also want you to keep in mind that these are based on general studies okay so first what I wanted to do is I wanted to go over the full-spectrum product right so people are going to be deciding what they might want to choose to use whether it be a CBD oil isolate and remember the legalities of that is very important so make sure you click on the link if you missed that video because you want to make sure that if you're being legal when you use something maybe not but most people do the CBD I sweat oil extract or the full-spectrum hemp oil extract okay so remember when I'm saying oil it's not necessarily the essential oil which I also covered in a previous video so you want to check that out as well I'm not going to take the time to go through that again here so the full synergy means the full spectrum that there is a synergy there so all of the compounds in the hemp are kept intact and they all will kind of balance each other out kind like the synergy that we founded the different constituents found in the essential oil they all balance and modulate different aspects of our biochemistry so if one component is high and it causes an effect in your body there's another component that might help lower that effect to bring your beddy body back Betty that's interesting to bring your body back into harmony isolettes can't do that right I thought let's have usually one a fact down a biochemical pathway because of that they can be more powerful right because they're exerting a stronger effect at a higher concentration but then they can have those side effects because they don't have the balancing constituents so I posted on my article in our interview with Cal Germano and actually dr. Mercola it's on the benefits of full spectrum hemp now this guy actually wrote a book on it and he's been doing research so it's a very cool thing to listen to if you want to get some of the research because remember guys when we talked about the endocannabinoid system I talked about how it's the regulator of a lot of our body systems if not all of them and one isolate is not going to feed that system alone there's different cannabinoids and our own endogenous what we make ourself cannabinoids that affect this system which is important for the regulation of our body and also was that as I stayed on the last video there's nutrients and medications that also interact with how our body produces these our own cannabinoids and also how maybe some external cannabinoids will affect this endocannabinoid system so that's why it's important to understand that because when we look at CBD CBD is one isolate but it has multiple effects just like many compounds do right it's actually supposed to hit one or two pathways but when they've done the research as you'll see in my article get hit a bunch of different receptors right so just to name a few which are again in the article if you want to reference it I took the some studies that were trying to determine the effect of CBD and disorders of motivation movement disorders right like Parkinson's or tic disorders or neurological symptoms and they looked at the way that CBD could effectively act to modulate these effects tons of different receptors right that's not the actual cannabinoid receptors as influences that might actually antagonize it and make our body produce more of our own endogenous cannabinoids by affecting the breakdown of them as well as hitting these different receptor sites including a serotonin receptor including some pretty funky names like the trpv1 receptor different PPAR receptors right so well that's a lot and if you're a geek and a doctor you'll kind of know what those different receptors do so add that one one isolate at all those different receptors in the body right and then you're going to add the different biochemical individuality of each individual so that's going to be a lot of different effects that you can have now if you have a full-spectrum product that's kind of balancing this all out and feeding the whole in endocannabinoid system there is an argument that there would be less side effects you need a smaller dose and you know there could be balancing out effects just like how they've done the studies with the psychoactive component found in cannabis THC and CBD they've also done studies which has led to the approval of CBD alone acting to help with seizure disorders so there might be some times where it's medically indicated where you want that isolate it might be some times where if you're doing it for general health you know you might want to look at other options now I do not know what you need I am NOT your doctor this is just general information of me going over the research with you guys it's complicated right so when something like CVD comes out it's it's different for me than like an herb which you know even though CBD and cannabis have a very good safety profile overall they are registered as drugs right so we're not like sniffing an essential oil right we're actually we're actually manipulating our biochemistry so we a lot of people are seeing these quote miracle effects but a lot of people aren't right so you're not going to see that on CNN you're not going to see the negative well you might see the negative but people aren't going to brag about the negatives they might try and go you know or they might try it and not get the press but it's doubtful that it actually does cause a harmful effect I don't want to scare you guys but just you're playing with your biochemistry so you need to know all this stuff if you're not going to go to a health care provider or somebody that specializes in determining what's right for you one of the big things we need to keep in mind remember everybody's different there's a ton of actions on CBD on different receptor sites in the body it's an isolate a tax and has been isolated as a drug and as a pharmaceutical and where it is regulated it might or may not be legal in your state there's all these different things to consider now CBD or CBD is in hemp hemp is now legal because of the farm bill so there's a lot of caveats here guys and these are just considerations now all of the resources and references for this will be on my website and I you know this is kind of just an overview of the difference between an isolated compounds effects remember last time we talked about how CBD is mostly being used for pain and and neurological and I'm going to go over those in the next video but I wanted you to see first what happens when all of the cannabis is together how it nourishes the endow cannabinoids from a full spectrum Hunt product and what CBD potential is we got that okay cool thank you for following me I know that's a lot of kind of information for you guys but um that's again is on the website if you want to go through the nitty gritty details but I think I even provide like an example with caffeine that molecule how that affects our body in different receptor sites and make a comparison with the caffeine molecule versus green tea used to CBD versus cannabis so sometimes those comparisons might help I'm going to sign off now because probably your brain is full my brain is full and I'm reading this you know I just read another article today that I'm going to put up for next week so don't worry it's complicated but you know you're you'll get there and I will speak to you soon in the next video for the conclusion and they'll still be loaded biochemistry there but I'll try to keep it understandable for you guys alright take care and if you're in the Northeast a worm by", "P919-tyYuLM": "[Music]", "Z9m-y6-r6ws": "[Music] love health

more information visit us on our website at eco life supplements com", "0WAerMFgy-E": "[Music] hello everyone thank you for joining me today this educational video is going to dig a little deeper into what a full spectrum hemp oil extract is i promised a companion video to talk about what uh the full spectrum product is and what it does and why you should buy it why i recommend it to all of my customers so here goes full spectrum hemp oil extract what that means is it's a hemp extract that has all of the cannabinoids in it the hemp plant has about 113 give or take cannabinoids thc happens to be a cannabinoid it is the psychoactive component in the cannabis plant it stands for tetrahydrocannabinol it is found in recreational and medical marijuana it's also found in the hemp plant and the reason being is because the hemp plant is a cannabis plant it is actually cannabis sativa whereas medical marijuana is cannabis sativa or cannabis indica or cannabis reuteralis uh it's they're like cousins it's like comparing a lime to a grapefruit they're both citrus but they're not exactly the same but they're similar so the full spectrum hemp oil is because of its cannabinoid profile it's robust it has everything in it what it does to your body when you take it is it puts your body into what's called homeostasis it puts your body into balance and the reason being is because just like we have a cardiovascular system and an endocrine system and a skeletal system all these different systems we also have what's called an endocannabinoid system ecs for short you can google it and do some research i always encourage everyone to do their due diligence all animals on the planet have an ecs insects do not they're the only ones that don't have it but all animals have it so that's why perhaps you may have seen where there's hemp oil for cats for dogs for horses but you can also give it to parrots and other animals because they have an ecs system and it's going to help with their aches and pains or their anxiety perhaps they have cancer animals do have health issues just like humans do you know they they get cancer they get tumors they get arthritis so it's going to be very beneficial for them to have it as well and the beauty of it is there's no placebo effect with animals so it either works or it doesn't and i've seen where it works all the time 100 of the time anyway the full spectrum hemp extract comes in different strengths and comes in water-soluble or oil-based such as mct oil or hemp seed oil or olive oil or grape seed oil different types of oil some people are allergic to coconut and perhaps they want to have something that doesn't have coconut but maybe it's made with hemp seed oil and actually hemp seed oil is a very good oil it's the same type of oil it's from the same plant so instead of using a different type of oil you're better off actually getting a full spectrum product that has hemp seed oil it's made with hemp seed oil but regardless mct which is coconut oil is a great oil as well and it's good for your body so you get benefits either way anyway that is [Music] my anyway that is what a full spectrum product is and what it does for your body again it puts your body into homeostasis because our receptors pick up on uh the phytocannabinoids that we give it we are actually wired to have phytocannabinoids in our system on a daily basis we actually produce it naturally and but for a lot of people our endocannabinoid system is not functioning properly it's nearly dormant because we have stress in our lives which affects our health affects our endocannabinoid system we're exposed to toxins um we don't eat proper properly we eat a lot of junk food and all those things causes stress in our body and it causes our endocannabinoid system to not function as properly so given that phytocannabinoids is a wonderful thing it's the reason why so many people are getting better and getting off of their prescription medication at any rate uh if my next video i'm going to explain what the other hemp oil extracts are in the marketplace there's broad spectrum isolate crude water soluble i'll explain what each one of those are in my next video and if you have any comments or any suggestions and ideas for another video feel free to leave a comment in social media and i'll take a look at it and perhaps i'll do a video explaining some of those things so you can be better informed and make better decisions as to what type of hemp oil to purchase that's going to be right for you thank you for joining me i hope you have a beautiful and blessed day", "xTEzc9SekgU": "hi everyone my name is LOX a pulse and I'm a gold ambassador with plexus worldwide and today I want to talk to you a little bit about CBD isolate and full-spectrum hemp oil and before I get started I just wanted to say that plexus does not claim to diagnose treat prevent or cure any disease this is based on my own opinions and my own research so I have actually my sample of the full spectrum hemp oil which my husband has actually been using for a week now and we have noticed some really amazing changes in his sleep and stress and everything and so I just wanted to talk a little bit today about what this is why it's so important to understand and be educated about it and also the parameters of what it actually can do and how exciting this really is so again this is one of those things that is really taking off CBD is really popular right now you're going to hear about it everywhere and with anything like that it's really important to understand exactly what you're getting where it's coming from how its processed what ingredients are added to it and all of that and plexus is meticulous about that and I absolutely love that I can absolutely say once again plexus has taken the utmost care to make sure that from start to finish we have the absolute best products and I also love that so I want to start by just explaining a little bit about the difference between the hemp plant and the marijuana plant because I think this is where we tend to find a lot of those polarizing opinions where people just don't really understand what it is so let's talk about the marijuana plant so first of all we have the marijuana plant that has a high level of THC in it and THC are those psychoactive compounds so the hemp plant while it is a cousin of the marijuana plant and of the same varietal family it is not at all the same plant so it does not have those THC properties in fact the hemp plant has less than 0.3% of the THC in it so that means that is not enough to ever create a psychoactive reaction it's a very trace amount so think of it for example like if you were to say well I'm going to eat these raspberries or blueberries here because I know that's a safe plant to consume but I'm not going to eat these wild berries that I found out in the woods because that is not a safe plan those can be extremely poisonous and psychoactive and all of those things so they can be related plants but two totally separate chemical compounds families so I just wanted to make that distinction right away so what has happened in our history is that hemp was used for thousands of years for lots of different things for ropes and clothes and medicinal purposes and all kinds of things in the 1970s it was actually made illegal in its association with marijuana because we didn't really understand the science of it then we didn't have the technology and the research then to back that up so it wasn't until the 1990s they started discovering this is a totally different plant and so recently in the last few years we have actually found it legalized because it is a totally different planet so I want to talk to you today just a little bit about the new products that we have coming out that are just in the sampling stages and that's the full spectrum hemp oil and the CBD isolate and I want to explain just a little tiny bit of the science about why that's so powerful for our bodies because I love the science and because I think it's so important to understand the foundation of what these can do in your body so we actually have an endocannabinoid system within our body now that's a system of lots of different receptors in our body that are actually activated by cannabinoids the purpose of that system is to create a sense of homeostasis in our body to really regulate systems create powerful sleep cycles stress management hormone management all of those different things so that's really an important system for our bodies interestingly enough the other thing that activates those receptors is breast milk which again we know is incredibly powerful for creating rhythms of growth and healing and everything in our baby's bodies so there's two different kinds of cannabinoids those endocannabinoids that are found in the body and then there's final cannabinoids and phyto cannabinoids are the ones that come from plants and so those are the ones that we have actually in these extracts and so what's so important to understand about these is that you need to start from when plant is in the ground all the way through the processing into the ingredients with your measures of quality that is the only way to get a really good really powerful product so we have actually partnered with a company called Hemisphere that's a privately owned company they are meticulous about growing the plants in a healthy natural way they are meticulous about third-party testing and quality and we know that we're getting the very best quality again then axis has committed to the way that things are processed the ingredients that we add to it are and ours are actually extract so what that means is they are extracted using a co2 method instead of an alcohol method which means they're soaked in alcohol and a few they usually use ethanol or something for that which is not good because it can really damage the plants and is create kind of stuff you don't want in your body so that extracting and the co2 method is a really important distinction there we also then put them in with MCT oil and that's a medium chain triglyceride excuse me and that is really important because these are fat soluble so you want to have a good strong healthy carrier oil that's really gonna pull that into the bloodstream and help distribute it throughout the body really efficiently we also have some natural flavoring and some slight sweetening in there and it's really really important that you're not adding things to these oils that are going to have a negative effect on your health because then what's the point of taking them so love that plexus has done that again so I want to talk to us a little bit about the difference between the full spectrum and the CBD isolate so the full spectrum is actually that full spectrum of phytochemicals from the hemp plant so you're getting the terpenes the flavonoids all of those phytonutrients you end the cannabinoids so you're getting everything from the whole plant what that means is you're going to have what they call an entourage effect where everything is working together to really have a more powerful impact and that is why usually people will select this product the full spectrum and actually 70% of what we have sampled has been the full spectrum because of that so then you have the CBD isolate now that is just the kanima dials so that means you're just getting those cannabinoids in there and you just getting your MCT oil and you're not getting the terpenes or anything else the other thing is that difference here is that there's not going to be that 0.3% allowed of trace amounts in there it's an isolate so that's only going to be found in the full spectrum that that 0.3% of the THC so well that's not enough to ever be psychoactive anyway you're going to want to make sure that if you are subject to drug testing like you know law enforcement or armed forces or something like that you're going to want to always go with the CB isolate just to be safe now to be fair just to make sure we say this you can always have a positive test um even with just any kind of cannabinoids we always need to just be clear to say that anyway because it is possible depending on the sensitivity of the test but not likely so I just wanted to go over the differences a little bit there you're really going to find that these products are the best out there I have done a lot of research and I'm very passionate about that because I want to know exactly what I'm recommending I want to know exactly what my family is getting and so once again I am just totally so incredibly proud to be able to say we have done absolutely the best options so I want to show you just a little bit it's just a little dropper and for an adult of course you're going to take one milliliter so see that's not that much it's just one milliliter and you're gonna stick that under your tongue at night right before bedtime and hold it under there for about 90 seconds just to let it fully absorb under that tongue and go into the bloodstream and then you're just going to go to bed and it's gonna create a really restful relaxed state of homeostasis for your sleeping at night and what's so important about that is that our bodies are really doing their very most regenerating and healing while we sleep at night and so so many of these sleep issues that we see in all of this stress and oxidative stress and all of the stuff that goes on in our bodies in our lives is really degenerating our bodies a lot faster because they're not getting that time really deep relaxation and restful sleep to regenerate everything and heal so this is going to be something that I think is really powerful in that regard so I think that's everything I wanted to cover yes so I just wanted to clear that up a little bit because I think a lot of people there's a lot of misconceptions back and forth as to what it is and what it's not and so it's really important to understand that it's a completely different planet it has less than 0.3 percent that's the legal limit so there's going to be less than that that's a very extremely trace amount of that THC so it's not gonna have psychoactive effects that's not gonna do that at all you're not gonna get high it has none of that but it is an incredibly powerful tool for that endocannabinoid system that we have inside our bodies to really create that sense of healing and homeostasis and so I just wanted to clarify that and we have two different options that we're sampling right now that will be available soon one is the full spectrum which is the entire spectrum of those plant phytochemicals from the hemp and then there is also just the CBD isolate which is only the cannabinoids and so those are really important and powerful tools to really help balance your body and your stress and your sleep cycles so we are loving it in my house I haven't actually tried it because I am giving this first bottle to my husband and so I hope that you get to try it too and then you love it I would love to hear what you think about it have a great day", "enpQKpXQ-vQ": "have you tried CBD oil for many chronic pain patients CBD oils offer an alternative source of relief CBD oil contains little to no THC

great because the tax act of 1937 and the controlled substance act of 1980 are complete utter jokes don't get me started this history teacher on a tangent of why those are so terrible but the good news is we have two ingredients that have become pretty popular in the beard game especially within the last two years and that would be cbd oil and hemp seed oil but there's a lot of confusion out there there's a lot of mismarketing as i would call it with these two products and these two ingredients and i'm gonna break down the differences between these two different ingredients for you guys today the main thing is the source how it's produced the benefits all of those things and i will cover all of them my name guys is dnc bearded welcome to the channel if you are new here and you like beards even if you're not you just want to check out these ingredients welcome as well and a huge thank you to everyone that is coming back the subscribers the people that are viewing you are appreciated if you like this content consider subscribing it does make a difference for the channel my life and my passion so thank you guys one more time i hope you enjoy this content let's start off by establishing some vocabulary and i'm going to be very specific here we're going to talk about hemp and marijuana they are both varieties of the same species hemp is going to equal less than 0.3 percent thc and marijuana is going to be 0.3 thc or more now they both have different growing and cultivating methods of that same plant species hemp is usually grown outside it can be bigger it doesn't have a ton of control as compared to marijuana which is often grown commercially inside it's very controlled and usually has smaller plants that is the first major difference we've seen between these two different ingredients okay let's talk about where these two ingredients come from and how we actually get them so we established we have the hemp plant which is less than point three percent thc and we have the marijuana plant which is point three percent thc or more usually much more we're getting up to upwards of like 30 percent thc possible well as of 2018 because of the farm bill in the united states it again is illegal to produce hemp but it is not federally legal to produce cbd oil or hemp seed oil from marijuana so we're going to disregard this plant over here and we're going to talk about the hemp plant producing these ones the first one is pretty simple as the name says hemp seed oil comes from the seeds of that hemp plant essentially they take those seeds and they use the cold press method all that means is they squeeze the seed until oil comes out and in that oil there is very little to no thc and we'll come back to that a little bit later in this episode but we now need to look at the cbd ingredient now this primarily comes from the leaves and the flowers of the hemp plant there's also the stalk and a couple of other aspects but primarily we are looking at the leaves and the flowers now how do you get this ingredient now it's a little bit more intense and it is called the carbon dioxide extraction method there's a little bit more to that but essentially they are removing that ingredient now here's the interesting thing cbd is cbd it is the same whether it comes from the hemp plant or it comes from the marijuana plant but in the u.s federally legal only from that hemp plant but we're taking that plant we have two different areas the seeds as compared to the flowers and the leaves for this next part let's cover the question a lot of you are thinking a lot of you have asked or you have looked up and let's again let's establish some vocabulary here thc essentially that is the part of the marijuana or cannabis plant that will get people high now hemp seed oil is very simple there is zero thc in hemp seed oil none easy goes cbd is a little bit more difficult because we have different types of cbd but for this video let's go over the full spectrum cbd that's going to give you all of the benefits and within that it is legally allowed to have up to 0.3 of that thc level now will that get you high no it would take you to consume to drink about 600 bottles of beard oil that have cbd oil in it even full spectrum in one night to fail a drug test or to get high now to feel that you are probably gonna feel some other things with drinking 600 bottles of beard oil before you felt any of those thc impacts on there so no with if you are using cbd in beard products you are not going to fail a drug test you are not going to get high do not drink it do not try to have any result of getting high from these products it is not going to do that with that legal limit of 0.3 cbd with thc next let's compare the different properties and benefits between these two ingredients and to begin the cbd oil is going to be much more expensive than hemp seed oil and you want to make sure you are finding somewhere that has a coa a certificate of analysis because it is important to get these things checked out by a lab do not go on google do not go on amazon to try and find cbd oil chances are you're gonna find it on amazon but if you really look into the fine print and the fine details they're just selling you hemp seed oil now what do these do they actually do pretty much the same thing but cbd oil is just better at it and don't get me wrong hemp seed oil is one of my absolute favorite carriers but everything it does cbd oil also does just at a higher level now the one that is the most common benefit between the two of them when it comes to hair and skin and again that is important if you guys look up the benefits of cbd oil or hemp seed oil online you're likely going to find a lot information about diet and we're not covering that here we are covering how does it help your beard hairs in the skin underneath it and the number one way is they are both great anti-inflammatory ingredients essentially what happens is your skin where it meets the hair is going to swell up for many different things like stress poor diets poor grooming habits just being a man being out in the sun just living life is going to get that skin where it meets the hair it's going to swell up and what happens is it does not allow blood to flow to that source and we know blood flow is important for the growth and health of your hair i've talked about this on many times on live streams we launched the cbd product on youtube which youtube actually took the stream down which was kind of crazy if you guys were there but i've gone over this but just to reiterate that anti-inflammation is really really important hemp seed oil is great at it cbd oil is phenomenal at it right hemp seed oil is an all-star well cbd oil is in the hall of fame one of the greatest pros of all time which is interesting when you look at them but the price also matches when it comes to those two different things so know where you're getting this stuff if you have it if a company is using cbd oil they likely have one of those coas i know plenty of beard companies that are happy to give that to you because they need it to get banking and to get funding and to sell it it is something that is kind of gray area in the us it can be done it is legal but a lot of places and banks in particular kind of like i don't really want to address this because it's just been within the last two years where it has been legal places like canada and europe have been doing it for a very long time and have been really boasting about the properties of both of these ingredients the us we just had some terrible legislation in our history that set us back but we're here now all right i'm gonna come back to you guys in two seconds with a conclusion wrap up all these thoughts and challenge you guys to leave a comment or question down below i believe i've covered everything in this video that i had planned on i wanted to make something that was kind of quick easy to deliver to you guys and to digest because this is a topic that you can dive much deeper into you can get far more scientific than i did today and i'm open to that if that's something that you guys would want in the future let me know in the comments but oftentimes those videos do not do as well so that tells me that you prefer this style but again i'm here to help you guys and give you the information that you are wanting so let me know if this fits your needs or do you want me to go deeper on this so we talked about where they come from we talked about the differences maybe some misconceptions in there and just overall information about hemp seed oil as compared to cbd oil so to leave you guys with two things please help me out here first thing is have you ever had experience with hemp seed oil or cbd oil what are your thoughts did you notice any differences any benefits nothing at all maybe you had some adverse reactions bring that to us in the comments down below and then do you have any questions was there something you were wondering about these ingredients that i did not get to i would be happy to give you guys the answer if i know it or try to find it if i do not or point you in the right direction to somebody that may know the answer so thank you guys for watching i love these kinds of videos a lot of you like to call me the trusted teacher for all things beard related and hopefully i'm living up to that name with videos just like this dancy bearded i hope that you guys stay bearded and stay positive so you", "dBgdrz7luzc": "what's up everyone this video is going to cover the benefits of CBD and hemp oil products I would also quickly get into the reasons why I personally uses CBD and hemp oils to improve a various aspects of my life so let's get into it as many current subscribers are aware I'm heavily into different aspects of training weight lifting cardiovascular stuff and a little bit of martial arts as well so I'm a huge proponent of recovery and that is one of the main reasons I personally use the CBD and hemp oil product I've also covered sleep and the quality of sleep many times in previous videos and on lifehack or articles hemp oil and CBD products are a great way to naturally improve your sleep cycles and remain in a deep sleep state longer throughout the night so I'm big on that obviously I like to recover and the bulk of your recovery is done during your sleep time aside from this a huge aspect of recovery is anti-inflammation and CBD and hemp oil has huge anti-inflammation benefits as of late I've been using a CBD hemp oil product which is called calm and it's by Wellness Co it comes in different flavors the ones I've actually picked up our peppermint and strawberry lemon-aid but they have a full range of flavors that are available and you're welcome to check out the link in the description below I've also included a pretty hefty coupon code down there for you as well so you can get a pretty significant discount if you're interested in trying out have oils and CBD products for the various reasons I'm mentioning in this video a benefit that's important to note and something that many people have expressed interest in is reducing anxiety social anxiety and overall stress now this could be chronic stress or acute stress in response to acute stress the body's sympathetic nervous system is activated due to sudden influx and release of hormones after the threat is gone and after you've calmed down quite a bit it could take between 20 upwards to 60 minutes for the body to return to its pre arousal pre stressed levels this is basically called the fight-or-flight response it is also known as the acute stress response both of these forms of stress can affect the body in many different ways that are pretty detrimental to overall health so I'm big on improving the body's function and just optimizing your overall well-being aside from bringing down stress and anxiety levels hemp oils and CBD oils can also have major impacts on the brain function the brain and hands-on sufficient amount of cannabinoid production and the omega fatty acids especially omega 3 and 6 as well as lonoa acid are all responsible for producing cannabinoids Omega 3 especially is important because of its function and repairing damaged brain cells hemp oil itself can also improve and repair damaged skin cells and also improve moisture retention and delivery to your skin this effect is also apparent with your hair and nails now that we've covered the brain in your head we can get down to the what many people consider the second brain your gut health hemp oils can actually help with your intestines because have oil contains enough omega-3 to support the development of the microorganisms that live in your intestines and with this natural fortification your body can start to build defensive mechanisms to prevent all sorts of different illnesses including the common flu and the everyday cold so once again if you're interested in checking out this particular CBD hemp oil product by consciously calm and Wellness Co the link is in the description below there's a coupon code down there for you as well I encourage you to use that obviously to get a pretty decent discount for yourself and try out some CBD and see if it works for you

products and if you guys remember in my last video they sent me some free samples okay along with a handwritten card which is somewhere near here anyways so this video is pertaining to my last pill with the spectrum gels okay as you guys know I love my hot chocolate right before I go to sleep it helps me sleep for me I feel like it helps me sleep I know for a fact that milk increases your melatonin levels before bed so having hot chocolate warm milk you guys all know about the home remedy of warm milk it's an old past time home remedy to help you soothe yourself soothe yourself to sleep so hot chocolate my last pill of my spectrum gel I gotta say guys I've not stopped taking my name to hemp drops and one thing that I've noticed adding this after about the second or the third day my sleep I felt like my sleep was more sound and I woke up more rejuvenated now I know this already helps me sleep I've made videos about this already but I don't know if there's different kinds of cannaboids and this as opposed to this it's all legal okay it's all 100% legal in all 50 states because there's no THC in it so there's no psychedelic side effects relating to the THC component in cannabis there's only the CBD benefits so look non psychoactive I know that the words or backwards is because I'm using the flip side of my camera but it's non psychoactive so with it helping me sleep I felt I feel like it's helped relax me throughout the day basically be more calm not be as quick to anger that's one thing that I know that I struggle with and something that I have been praying to God about try to work on is my quickness to anger and I'll be honest guys having these two products together like I felt like this helped but I've only been on this stuff for ten days and after about day three I just felt more relaxed throughout the day I just felt calmer less stressed and just felt better about life I guess that's that's literally the only way I can put it like having this and this I just I feel good guys I feel a lot better it helps reduce the frequency of my symptoms relating to my Crohn's disease and my cyclic vomiting syndrome and one of the things that really bothered me was you know battling these symptoms has made me kind of an angry person I felt like it's kind of changed me you know I'm not as relaxed anymore and it's I I know it's related to the additional stressors that have you know entered my life since being diagnosed and these symptoms entering my life so I know that's changed me a little bit because of that you know it's in the back of my mind you know a lot of the stress and then that can change people just in itself just stress not dealing with any physical rehabilitation but yeah guys I like this stuff I really do so I'll leave a link in the

"gSSnC4_8h6o": "Wesley we need to follow oh you see FFT need to pour directly into the water", "pDBaK-Ba9eY": "hey everyone its Josie here with bio MD and here at bio MD we believe that education is key as buyers it's really important for you to understand what it is you're purchasing and what is the right product for you having numerous terms presented in the CBD industry there needs to be some clarification regarding the differences between the different kinds of CBD that are available now there are three main kinds of CBD available there's the broad spectrum CBD the full-spectrum CBD and the isolate CBD and today I'm going to explain to you some of the differences between these different variants of CBD and maybe we'll try and figure out which one's the best one for you now but before all of that let's talk a little bit about what CBD is cannabidiol or CBD is a compound that is found in the cannabis plant there are many different cannabinoids that are found in the cannabis sativa plant the two main ones that most people have heard of are THC and CBD the main difference between THC and CBD is that THC is a psychoactive compound and CBD is a non psychoactive and by psychoactive we mean when you smoke or inhale or ingest THC you feel the effect of being high and you feel a general change in your perception of the world the opposite to THC is CBD and I say it's the opposite in that you don't feel these feelings of high you don't feel any of the psychoactive effects when you take CBD however CBD is known to possess many health benefits and which is why we are more interested in CBD and its uses at bio MD now the sativa plant contains more than just THC and CBD there are other kinds of terpenes and there's other kinds of cannabinoids present in the sativa plant and it is the combination of all these different components that leads to a variance in the different types of CBD that we see so let's start with broad spectrum CBD broad spectrum CBD infuses the various substances apart from THC so it'll include CBD cannabinoids terpenes and other chemicals that are derived from the plant and at the same time it does meet the federal requirement as it has all of the THC removed but even though it has all of the THC removed since it has most of the other components of the plant you still experience the entourage effect now let's talk about full spectrum CBD full spectrum CBD will retain all of the chemical properties of the plant including THC now authentic federally legal CBD is derived from industrial hemp and contains less than 0.3 percent THC now this is very very low amounts of THC and it will not show up on a drug test all CBD products are required by law to meet this percentage and no CBD product that you consume will show up on any drug test that you take similar to the broad spectrum CBD the full spectrum CBD will also encourage the entourage effect to take place but if you take the full spectrum CBD you'll feel it a lot more than you would if you were to take the broad spectrum CBD just because the full spectrum CBD has 0.3% of THC and the broad spectrum has no THC finally let's talk about the third and the last kind of CBD which is the isolate CBD iceless CBD products are labeled as being the purest form of the product depending on how they're processed isolate products have been isolated down to just the CBD molecules so it'll contain nothing else they do not possess any other active ingredient no terpenes or other cannabinoids so this is the purest form of CBD that you can ingest this type of product is generally processed as a white powder and also can be included in oil now again there are many other factors that can affect CBD for example various growing seasons can cause the individual mix of components to vary like one growing season can have a yield that's exceptionally high in CBD whereas the other yield based on temperature weather might have a yield that's a little bit lower in CBD and again the variation of chemicals might be different depending on the state's climate that the CBD is produced in the weather in Kentucky is very different from the weather in California so you will find differences in the CBD that are grown in different states another difference that may impact the product is the extraction process itself ethanol and superficial fluid of co2 both have advantages and disadvantages but do not produce identical product because the extraction itself will impact the chemicals that are resulting from this process I will end on saying that choosing which CBD product that meets your specific needs is a personal choice if you want to assure that there is no THC present in your CBD I would recommend going for the isolate strain however if you want to expect an experience a feeling of calmness that is more tangible maybe like at the end of the night maybe right before you go to bed you want to experience a feeling of calmness in your muscles then I would recommend either the broad spectrum or the full spectrum and there is really no harm in trying out different products and seeing which one works best for you and your personal needs there are many coupon codes available for most of these CBD products and that is one way to save money and still try out different strands and see what works best for you so good luck on this journey you [Music]", "bfLbUHW2iwI": "hi

"VcbIHO5T8o0": "hey everyone my name is Vox Neapolitan a gold ambassador with plexus worldwide and before I get started I just want to say that plexus does not claim to diagnose prevent cure or treat any disease and these opinions are my own based on my own research today I want to talk to you just a little bit about the CBD isolate that we offer and the full spectrum hemp oil those are currently both in the sampling stages but will be released soon and so I just wanted to share a little bit about what they really are why they're so important and a little bit about how to share about them so it's really important to understand first off that these products are something that can be really polarizing and a lot of that comes from people's lack of education and understanding so it's really important when you're talking about CBD and full spectrum hemp that you understand that there is a complete differentiation here between the marijuana plant and the hemp plant so the hemp plant is a cousin of the marijuana plant but does not contain the THC properties that the marijuana plant does contain so if you think of it like for example some raspberries or blueberries or something that you know you're safe to consume but some other wild berries that are a related cousin but a totally different plant with different phytochemicals and nutrients and so they're going to have a different reaction and could be poisonous or psychoactive it's gonna make that distinction the hemp plant has been around for thousands of years and has been used medicinally and for all kinds of other different things and it wasn't until the 1970s that it was made illegal because of his association with the marijuana plant and that was done based on something we really did not understand the science at the time it wasn't until the 1990s that people really began to find out through research and science that these are two completely different plants and then they kept plant has less than 0.3 percent of this THC in it so it does not have those psychoactive compounds in it to the same extent so it's not going to have a psychoactive reaction so it's a totally different plant so it actually has been now made legal again with Swint within certain guidelines in the last couple of years so when you're talking about this it's really really important to understand a couple of things first of all this is a huge market this is a really popular topic this is something that's really exploding right now so that's a great thing that also means you're gonna find a lot of controversy and compliance is really really critical here compliance is always something that should always be a priority that's a really important thing anyway we always want to make sure that our claims are valid and and really well-thought-out and appropriate and legal but you also want to make sure with something like this it has a certain sense of controversy to it based on some people's lack of education that you really are very careful about the way you word things and talk about things and approach these things so it's really important to familiarize yourself with the plexus compliance guidelines and those are on your back office and there's also on hemisphere who is our partner in this their website is hemp fear calm it also has a lot of compliance guidelines on how to talk about it so when you're talking about things that it might help with you want to use terms like May or possibly can and things like that to really make sure that we're not making any hard claims that are not a substantiated we don't want to be doing that at all for sure so I want to talk to you just a little bit about the differences between the CBD isolate and the full spectrum hemp oil so that you can understand that a little bit and then also just a little bit of science as to why these are really important for our bodies so the full spectrum hemp oil is the full spectrum of the phytochemicals that comes from the hemp plant that means you're getting all the terpenes flavonoids all those phytonutrients and the cannabinoids as well so you're going to have what they call an entourage effect that means all of those plant nutrients and phytochemicals working together to make a little bit of a more powerful impact that is often why you will find that most people are going to opt for that full-spectrum 70% of what we have been sampling has been the full-spectrum oil because of that so it's really going to be a powerful thing for balancing sleep that homeostasis in your body really helping with relaxation and things like that and really just a calming effect the CBD isolate is just the cannabinoids everything else is out of there so there's with the CBD isolate you're not gonna have the 0.3% of the THC that could be naturally occurring and trace amounts in there because that's completely removed in the full spectrum you can have up to 0.3 percent of those THC trace amounts now that's not enough to ever create a psychoactive reaction but it could be enough to trigger a drug test so you're gonna want to make sure you always recommend the CBD isolate to anybody who is subject to drug testing or anything like that it's really important distinction there so the other thing I want to talk about a little bit is how committed to quality we are our company has partnered with hemisphere who is also meticulous about quality these plants are grown in the United States they're grown under natural conditions they don't use chemicals in their growth that the processing is very very specifically done these are actually extracts and not tinctures which means they are processed and extracted through a co2 removal process and not a alcohol extraction process which is where they usually use ethanol or something which can be very damaging to the cannabinoids and it's just not something you want in your body so that's a really important distinction because if you're gonna be buying something you want it to be the best quality we also have them put them in with MCT oil which is a medium chain triglyceride the reason that's really important is first of all that's really good for you to start with but it is also that really good healthy fat it's also so important because these are fat soluble so that's really gonna help to get them into the blood system and really distribute throughout the body really well one of the things that we have in our bodies is an endocannabinoid system that is actually a system of receptors throughout our entire body that is activated by these cannabinoids why is that important that's really important for a sense of homeostasis throughout her body sleep cycles hormone regulation rest and relaxation stress management all of those things are hugely impacted by that system interestingly enough breast milk also activates those receptors and we know how great that is for our babies and growth and development and just balancing body so we know this is a really important system so I just wanted to talk a little bit about that I actually have mine and I have the full spectrum here my husband has been using it for about a week and we're noticing a huge difference and just his quality of sleep and stress management and everything so I just want to show you really quickly if I can get it open so you're just gonna take one milliliter and stick that under your tongue every night right before you go to sleep and just let it them to work for about 90 seconds and then we'll just go into the bloodstream from there help to really relax the body and give you a really strong sense of restful sleep and that's really important because our bodies do all their healing and regenerating during those sleep times so we find that all these people with sleep issues and you know it's disturbances and things like that really are needing that restful time of repair and regeneration so this is a really powerful product for many reasons there's a ton of research out there on what it can do and we really want to make sure that when you're accessing that research and sharing it that you're really sourcing it and and really following those compliance guidelines really importantly but I think these are going to be really powerful products we have again approached this with the absolute best commitment to quality and I am just so so incredibly impressed and so proud to be able to recommend it and I just wanted to give you a little tidbit of information on how to talk about it and share it what it is and what it's not so I hope you get to try it and I hope you love it too", "Go_wCV5JZgk": "also have the pain i loved it i i really like this packaging a lot so here it is again here's the spray so you have a sore sore

to start this spring sports season with all of our grandkids so this year we have some playing baseball and a granddaughter playing soccer so spring will be a very busy time for us been blessed with six grandkids who else is on here I did say jessenia she is from San Bernardino California and taupe I believe might be from Nigeria Zen is watching from Washington oh and there's the brass he's out of Florida right here with us yeah beautiful flora and fauna says it is raining oh my goodness well I hope it's not too cold up there anyway don't want to keep you guys too long today but before I talk about the difference between full-spectrum and isolate I just want to give just a few minutes background for the sake of the people that might be brand new to CBD oil so the thing that is most important I think to understand is that our body has an endocannabinoid system they only discovered that in the 90s but what they found is that our Creator actually designed us with this endocannabinoid system and the whole purpose of that system is to self-correct and self-regulate our body so how cool is that I mean where whenever anything goes wrong in your body God already designed us with a system to self-regulate and self-correct so we have these receptors all through our body that are part of that endocannabinoid system but guess what those receptors need they need cannabinoids from the hemp plant that is what activates those receptors so that they work we need those receptors to be working throughout our body because there they are what sends the signal then to your brain that something needs corrected that isn't working properly so prior to 1937 when they first made him feel illegal hemp was the number one crop for all of our livestock so think about that all of the cows all the cattle were out there grazing on him so when we hate the meat and we drank the milk we were getting all the cannabinoids that we needed you know by doing that by eating the food eating the meat and drinking the milk well then unfortunately 1937 they made temp illegal they thought it was the same as marijuana which it is not and they threw them both under the bus made a mill legal and then finally December of last year President Trump signed the farm bill of 2018 and what that did is it separated hemp and marijuana marijuana is still a controlled substance hemp is now an agricultural commodity and it is legal in all 50 states so that is phenomenal news you're gonna start seeing hemp farms again you're gonna see clothing stores opening up with clothes made from hemp hopefully they're gonna start making all kinds of different things everything made from bath bombs but what is he doing it with me I thought he was just imagination yeah bro one out there for you bad bombs that's one of our brand new products we have bath bombs how cool is that I didn't get ours yet they're on the way and I am excited to try our bath bombs no yes they have their infused with CBD oil so we'll be doing a live just about those bath bombs as soon as we get them punitive you will be in the country okay now what I want to talk about today I might have to cover him he is always so silly and then he gets me started laughing what I want to talk about today though is the difference between full-spectrum CBD oil and an isolate what full-spectrum means is exactly what it says it's full-spectrum and has all the cannabinoids in it they know so far that there are at least 85 different cannabinoids in the hemp plant CBD is one cannabinoid THC is a cannabinoid CBG cbn and there's this long list of cannabinoids in the hemp plant when you order full spectrum which when you're looking on our website you'll see full spectrum bottles have black caps that means that it's made from the entire hemp plant and you are getting all of the cannabinoids isolate means they isolate the CBD so they just extract the CBD out and the isolate is made just with CBD so it doesn't have any of those other cannabinoids in it now the reason that we make that one is since THC is a cannabinoid it is found in the hemp plant but it is at a very very minimal level and and this is really the biggest difference between hemp and marijuana they both come from the cannabis Emily but marijuana is very high in THC which is what makes you high and it's very low in all the other cannabinoids hemp is the exact opposite hemp is loaded with tons of cannabinoids and has 0.3% THC that is a very minimal amount if you drank an entire bottle of CBD oil it will have no psychoactive effect but we do offer that THC free isolate just for people that are subject to random drug screenings now Ron and I were not subject to random drug stream screenings because we're self employed personally I don't think it's gonna show up even in the full spectrum because it's such a minimal amount but if you're a very small person if you happen to take a pretty high amount of the CBD oil it is possible that it would store in your fat cells and depending on how you metabolize it over time it's possible that it would show up in a drug test so to be on the safe side we recommend the isolate which is strictly CBD oil and no THC that's the one that we recommend for anyone that is subject to those random drug screenings um anyone else I would suggest that you take the full spectrum now if you're wondering do they both work the same from what we can tell and and we are just strictly looking at testimonials in our private testimonial group if you are not part of that testimonial group make sure that you get back with the person whoever is sharing this line with you they can add you to that group it currently I think we have about 80,000 people in that group they're all just sharing their CBD or testimonies and people are getting phenomenal results with both of our products the full spectrum as well as the isolate so does anybody have any questions or I'm running out of breath I'm gonna let Ron talk and I'll see Oh Donna said bath bombs are amazing jessenia is waiting to try them too Lorelei said hello I think there's somebody right outside on window I saw the manager go by on his call part maybe I hear it maybe he wants to be in our life he's not going to be a good friend of ours anyway anybody have any questions for us concerning full spectrum versus isolate Donna said are you saying there is just CBD in the isolate no CBG and the others that is correct I just watched a refresher by Jen Kerr and she is extremely knowledgeable on this topic and I guess there's no way like because there's so many cannabinoids in the hemp plant my understanding is I don't think there's a way to just remove the THC I don't know for sure I do not know the scientific answers but what I understand about it is our isolate is just CBD which by the way I forgot to mention this CBD out of all the cannabinoids has the most medicinal healing properties so if you're only going to be able to take one cannabinoid CBD is the one you want and that's why they call it CBD oil because it is by far the most healing and like I said has the most medicinal properties so you are still getting just phenomenal health benefits even if you have to take the isolate okay Kathy said hi guys hi Kathy she is all the way from Washington and Benjamin Benjamin we never know where Benjamin he's on the roof someone they pick that Bobby brother Benjamin is a truck driver and he's always out on the road sometimes I'm not sure he knows where he is oh my goodness but he too is sharing CBD oil everywhere he goes as well as all of our other affiliates we are so excited about our team you guys are doing amazing you know we encourage people to join our team not only as a customer but why not as an affiliate

with other people and you will receive a referral commission and it's just for us we feel like we are on a mission we want to see you know how many people can we help can we change their lives help them with their health I mean when you go in the testimonial group and start reading testimonies you'll understand why we are so passionate about what we're doing lives are being changed by the thousands every single day and Ron and I are just blessed and proud that we are with the number one company in the CBD oil industry uh and Laura hey Laura said hi hi guys Laura is our beautiful daughter-in-law from Lancaster Pennsylvania so we obviously are missing her and are the rest of our family back there but it won't be long we are flying home on April 3rd wow that is coming up fast Ron's not quite ready to leave the Florida sunshine poppy back won't be hopefully I don't have to pull him kicking and screaming to get him on the airplane to go home no he's ready to go see grandkids to get into some of their fun little mama that's right don't forget about Lily I don't know if Lily's on here but we miss her too and my parents my parents are back there as well I'm starting to babble he said I'm family I get like I don't know hey there's one thing to take away too if you remember anything from today our conversation yes this is Miss is one of the biggest things I think you could take away today our company offers one a 60-day money-back guarantee on our products that's huge there's nobody in this industry that offers that and number two there's a the hemp industry is governed by a group called the hemp roundtable and they've just awarded thirteen thirteen certificates that are sealed that that companies to companies out there to kind of make it less confusing when you're looking for CBD you all that these seals are say that these company companies meet industry standards they were audited they meet every every safety aspect and it's a true pure CBD oil so when you're out there and you're looking you're gonna be able to simply look for this seal it's gonna say compass or pep Authority seal so big eggs on the bottle ORS are just you know that the labels are just being updated now but if you don't see that seal I wouldn't purchase the product because again it doesn't meet industry standards on a thirteen were rewarded and we own two of those or grower and our manufacturer both or awarded that seal that's huge that says volumes over over our competition where the gold standard out there folks and we do offer that 60-day money-back guarantee you just don't offer that if you don't have a product you can stand behind so if you take away anything I hope you take those two tidbits I just shared with you and if you are interested in a product I just get back there person to share this video today with you and please share and share this with your friend show us some love some emojis we appreciate it that gives us the feel to keep going doing these and hey we're sending some sunshine you're way up in PA I promise I'm blowing it up that direction brother Benjamin tooth that horn baby tooth the horn man for help love you Ben oh dear no I'm gonna read a couple of these comments uh I saw one goodbye here that said my sister's doctor told her to stop her medical marijuana intake because of it affecting her brain she newly diagnosed with dementia it was prescribed to her for arthritis but smoking is affecting her memory she needs the properties of CBD absolutely you are 100% correct you know there there are times I guess there's a time in a place for the medical marijuana and I honestly I don't know as much about that but I do know that marijuana is about 30 percent THC so that is what makes people get high and so it does have a psychoactive effect besides the fact that I don't get personally how it can really be healthy if you're sucking in the smoke you know and into your lungs makes a whole lot more sense to me to use CBD oil from hemp that's the that's the plan that is the miracle plant that are per creator provided for us with all those cannabinoids and when you take our oil you're simply putting it under your tongue and the reason we do that the reason you take it sublingual is there are a lot of capillaries right under your tongue so when you put those drops there you are going to get 98% absorption when you take a pill or a capsule you are getting way less than even 50% absorption especially the older you get the less absorption you have because our justif tract is less and less effective the older we get but even if you're a young person when you take something as a pill or capsule it has to go through your digestion it's hitting your stomach acids and going through your entire gastrointestinal tract this way under your tongue it is going immediately right into your bloodstream and that's that's gonna be so much more effective ah let's see if we have any other comments Benjamin said keep your eyes peeled for the big H it is a big orange h like ron was talking about that will be on our labels very very soon we are so beyond excited about that because with CBD oil being all over the news and all over the media of course everybody and their brother is jumping on the bandwagon CBD oil is going to be everywhere and people do not know what to look for they don't know what to look for on the ingredients or on the label so this is going to at least make it a little easier for people if we can just get the word out look for the big orange H if you don't see that do not waste your money only 13 companies can say that I mean you even want Amazon you'll see them I mean you're not going to get a true pure CBD you all for 1995 - well shred that money up in the grass or you know does it make sense no no I mean what company how many companies out there can say they offer 60-day money-back guarantee none you know I mean that that's a company that knows its product knows it's pure inning playing games it's been in the end like I said we're number one in the industry so you know I took a more of a from the heart and I'm more I know where our company is and I know the product has to offer I get text every day that tell me it works so now I encourage you to get out there we all know somebody who can be that hand out for and like I said be that hand reach out take that responsibility we got a mother you know Mother's Day is coming up great opportunity for bath bombs folks I know and I'm getting my mom coming I love you mom I mean as a as a mom myself and Graham all know I mean there's nothing more relaxing than a long hot bath put on some nice music get yourself you know something nice to drink give mom a break give her those bath bombs and give her at least one hour her cell a nice spa experience yeah perfect easy in the essential oil it's a win-win okay worry guys we don't want to go on too long Ron says I ramble so I need to I know I do I get so excited and probably a little nervous so then I jump out there now like this oh no they're not sleeping okay so one last thing I want to mention is don't forget that you can use the drops topically to we of course we do have a relief cream but if you don't have that or if you just are out and about somewhere and you have the oil with you I just had a friend share this with me yesterday that it is working phenomenally phenomenally that's a hard word on her eczema and she said nothing else has ever worked for her nothing that the doctors recommended prescription creams and she's just putting some drops of the oil directly on her skin so well there's Kathy hey neighbor she said that she lives right beside us oh my goodness I'm so glad you've jumped on here and Angie so glad you were able to catch the live so if you did miss it from the beginning we're gonna end the broadcast now but you can go back and watch it from the beginning and like Ron said if it's been beneficial to you make sure you share it on your timeline share it with your friends take it back to the person that's shared the video with you you up any questions concerns are ready to purchase reached out to them they'll be glad to help us so thank you right guys thank you so much we love you and send us some sunshine your way PA alright see you on our next slide bye for now", "cXbn0ZR75gk": "hey guys Jesse

extremely similar and you can buy them both on Amazon for around the same price however there is one huge difference between these two one of these is not what they say they are with being the one stop shop for any sort of online shopping Amazon is one of the places where you can find many quote unquote CBD products there's only one problem many of these products are not what they say they are if you go on Amazon right now and search CBD products what you'll find are over 4,000 results all of these products don't have CBD in the actual name though they all have hemp oil the main reason why companies do this is that CBD is actually not allowed to be sold on Amazon at all according to their own list of restricted products amazon states that neither CBD or hemp oil rich and CBD are allowed to be sold on their site even though that CBD is now federally legal thanks to the 2018 farm bill amazon does have their own right to prohibit the sale of any products that they want on their web site which does include CBD so with none of these CBD products supposedly having any CBD in them we wanted to see what was actually in the products themselves we went out and bought three of the better reviewed CBD products on amazon ourselves not to take them ourselves but to ship them off to a third-party lab to get them tested this would allow us to see exactly what was in each product first off was the hemp works tincture which overall has really been reviewed quite well so what did the results say instead of having p1000 milligrams of CBD as stated on the tincture itself the test results show that there is only eight point seven milligrams in the entire bottle we were able to reach this final number because the product is in a one ounce bottle with a total liquid inside weighing 29 grams so if we multiply 29 by 0.3 we get the total CBD in the product itself so obviously this product didn't have anywhere near the amount of CBD that was on the Amazon store page itself the next product that we sent in to be tested was the elite hemp gummies which has been reviewed positively by around 600 people so what did the lab result say about the elite hemp gummies according to the lab results there are only 0.3 milligrams of CBD per gummy which is a lot lower than the advertised 30 milligrams found in each coming with the lab tests showing us that there is only 0.1 milligrams of CBD per gram and with each gummy wing 3.0 5 grams we multiplied point 1 by 3.0 5 to get the result going into the third and final product that we got from Amazon we were really expecting there to be a huge disparity between the advertised amount of CBD and the actual CBD content just like the previous two products however this product actually really surprised us with having more than the advertised amount of CBD found in it even with this being a huge change of pace for our entire investigation there were still some things about this product that made us feel very uneasy as we were doing our initial research on this brand we couldn't find a single website or social media account associated to it at first you might not think that this matters but when it comes to only being able to reach a CBD company through Amazon itself and having no other names or addresses associated to it it seems less and less legitimate even with the great results that we got back from this product unfortunately big CBD products are not only an issue on Amazon but everywhere else as well well you can do to make sure that you are never scammed is to make sure that the CBD company in question actually has their test results posted on their website this will help you a lot in knowing what you are actually buying if you would like to learn more about the difference between hemp oil and CBD please make sure to visit our website at made by hem comm if you got any questions about why you shouldn't buy CBD on Amazon please feel free to leave a comment down below and we'll be sure to get

benefits your dog. Cannabidiol, CBD is one of the most\nremarkable compounds in nature. CBD oil has proven very effective for joint pain\nand inflammation. Increasingly, clinical studies have demonstrated CBDs abilities\nto halt cancer cell growth and shrink tumors. There are 60 compounds specific\nto the cannabis plant called cannabinoids and CBD is one of them,\nwhich holds the key to a variety of medicinal and therapeutic effects that\ncannabis offers. CBD oil is extracted from the stalk,\nleaves and flowers of the cannabis plant and contains hundreds of natural\nbotanicals in concentrated form. Just as in humans a dog's body houses an\nendocannabinoid system as part of its immune system which runs throughout the\nbody, and this system is filled with receptors that bind to the cannabinoids\nin the CBD you give to your dog, and this stimulates all kinds of changes in the\nbody which are beneficial. CBD is not psychoactive, the psychoactive effect of\nthe drug cannabis comes from THC only so basically CBD won't get you dog high,\nsimply relaxed with zero psychoactive effects. And more scientific research is\nbeing conducted on the therapeutic effects of CBD than ever before as new\nand exciting evidence uncovers major medical benefits. And with this in mind\nlet's look at 19 different ways CBD oil benefits your dog. CBD provides fast\nresults, usually signs of improvement begin within days. CBD reduces stress,\nseparation anxiety and nervousness to allow your dog to be more calm and\nrelaxed. CBD reduces the effects of arthritis quickly and increases mobility.\nCBD hydrates your dog's skin. CBD reduces inflammation and alleviates joint pain\nand studies have proven CBD is highly effective at\ncanine seizures. CBD Boost's your dog's immune system to provide optimum\nprotection. CBD reduces skin irritation and itching. CBD restore shine and\nsoftness to a dog's coat. CBD improves a dog's appetite. CBD improves alertness\nand mental clarity in dogs, it improves your dog's gastrointestinal\nhealth, and it's important for effective canine cancer pain management. CBD aids\nin post-surgery recovery and it also improves comfort and pain relief for the\nlast days of life, it's also really good as a cortisone replacement. It aids in\nweight loss. CBD aids in thunderstorm and firework phobias and CBD has no known\nside-effects. I've researched these benefits myself\nover the years directly from thousands of dog owners, so I can confirm that\nthese 19 benefits are real, effective and working right now to heal canine\nailments and assist dogs all over the world. Many dog owners report that within\ndays their arthritic, limping or in pain dog is greatly improved with\nfreedom of movement a much reduced pain. There are also lots of reports of\nrenewed energy, alertness and playfulness especially in senior dogs with reduced\nanxiety, more calmness, appetite and reduced use of vet prescribed drugs and\ntheir side effects. You may even notice that once your dog is experiencing the\nbenefits, they'll happily encourage you for more. As a side note, one owner\nrelated how her dog had never let her near the dog's mouth,\nso CBD was added to the dog's food. Well the following day while the owner was\nsat in her armchair, the dog came up to her, place her head on her lap and was\neager for her to administer drops directly into her mouth.\nCBD comes in different amounts per bottle and depends on the strength\nneeded. For dogs you want it in the 350 to 500 milligram range per bottle.\nHigh-quality organic CBD oil is not cheap because extracting CBD from hemp\nrequires a lot of plant material and careful monitoring of the growing\nenvironment. I only recommend an organic product as hemp is known as a hyper\naccumulator, meaning it absorbs contaminant\nfrom the ground it grows in and will pick up heavy metal toxicity\nunless it's organically grown. CBD oil must come in a glass dropper bottle, not\nplastic and be organic. CBD is dispensed into your dog's food or can be given\ndirectly by mouth under the tongue. I recommend giving under your dog's tongue\nif that's possible as it's more effective by this method, simply because\nit gets directly into your dog's bloodstream rather than eaten with food,\nwhich means your dog's liver will filter out some of its effectiveness. It's\nimportant to note that prices range wildly from $20 to $65 plus for a 250 to\n500 milligram one ounce bottle full plant organic extraction. This gives you\n8.3 milligrams of actual CBD, enough to be effective with dogs for the\nbenefits I discussed. Another important thing to note is that I've been working\nwith CBD oil for 15 years and it's only recently that CBD products have taken\noff and for good reason. However the information on CBD oil can be confusing\nas large online retailers like Amazon are not allowing product manufactures to\nmention CBD in their advertising and so confusion arises about whether any given\nproduct is true CBD oil or just made using the hemp seeds, not the whole plant\nextract. So I'll link to a product in the description below\nthat's genuine CBD oil, it's organically grown in Colorado USA and has been\nextracted using co2 full plant extraction and contains all the\nbeneficial terpenoids, flavonoids, essential oils, vitamins A and D, trace\nminerals, phytochemicals and omega-6 and three oils for dogs and cats. And for\nchronic health conditions like phobias and fearfulness, you can give half the\nstate to dosage and this will mean cost savings while still getting effective\nresults. My recommendation is to start with half the stated dosage, observe the\neffects for five days and work up to a full stated dosage if you don't see\nnoticeable effects for the condition intended. If your dog has major health\nissues like cancer, try working up to a double dose, as every dog, just like\npeople have their optimal dose, and there are no side\neffects other than a potential to sleep more soundly during the day. If your\ndog suffers arthritic conditions and especially if they're on vet\nprescribed medications for the condition don't even second-guess this natural\nalternative, get a bottle, stop the meds and treat with CBD and you'll be amazed\nat its effectiveness, without the side effects and the expense of veterinary\ndrugs. Raise the dose if you need to, it's safe and to find an effective level for\nlonger term use and the side benefits and numerous has discussed. Also if your\ndog has arthritic movement issues, an excellent complimentary dog supplement\nto feed alongside the CBD is bacon flavored soft chews, they contain many\nnatural ingredients including the CBD to aid pain free movement with universally\nexcellent feedback. They're also USA made with a hundred percent money-back\nguarantee with excellent customer service, again I'll leave a link to these\nin the description below.

off some of the information that is on this box to give you a little overview of wasp in the actual bottle so the usage they say between one and three drops i'll talk more about my personal usage as the videos go on they say on here one to three drops about twice a day for someone that's probably new to cbd or definitely new to oil i've actually got a little story time in this video and i probably should have followed this advice when i gave this to someone to try [Music] we'll explain more as the video goes on so now let's look at the ingredients for this oil and it is just mct coconut oil and hemp extract that is all that's in this oil so mct oil is a fast actin oil it's got fats in there that are very fast absorbing which is great for an oil like this because if you're putting on your tongue you don't want to wait for two three hours like an edible or something like that so having an oil mixed into this bottle that's a fast acting oil that your body is going to absorb because basically that oil is going to carry those cannabinoids through your system and that is what the cannabinoids attach to the cannabinoids attach to those fats and then push those fats through your system and having a fast-acting fat oil means that those fats are going to shoot through your system really quick giving you that cbd really quick which i think is a huge benefit and i've got to say those fast acting fats that's in the mct oil in this bottle definitely are fast acting as well i've tried a lot of oils in the past and i will say this oil is pretty fast acting red eyes also say that this is a full spectrum oil which means that from the plants that they used they used all the cannabinoids that were included in this plant they didn't take the thc out they didn't take the cbda out they didn't take anything out they basically processed all of the cannabinoids in the plant and included them in this oil and i'm not going to go into it a huge amount here but you really want to look for oils that are full spectrum because there's something called the entourage effect when it comes to using cbd so basically you want to use cbd with as many other cannabinoids as possible to get even better effects and the fact that this is full spectrum definitely helps it also says that he uses a supercritical co2 extraction and it's lab tested for safety and quality which are also two really good points about this oil so guys just as a quick little plug i have just recently started a twitch streaming channel i'm streaming a few days a week at the minute i'll put my link in the description for anyone that's interested in watching me go live while i play some games and here is a little close-up that i wanted to show you guys of the oil in the bottle so this is the sort of color that you can expect from this oil if you do look to purchase it so let's get back to this oil it is twenty percent two thousand milligrams and red eyes and doing it like a lot of cbd companies i've seen make cbd oil a lot of companies will use cbd isolate which is a lot cheaper of a product and mix that into their oils to inflate the price and call it a really high cbd percentage but it actually is really cheap they use full spectrum oil and all the bottles are the same size the price increases on how much cbd is in the bottle so whether you're interested in a 1 000 milligram oil a 1 500 milligram oil or a 2 000 milligram oil the bottle size stays the same but the strength of the oil inside the bottle increases so i'm just going to show you guys how i've actually been using this oil i'm pretty much at the end i'm probably going to get this use in this session right now and i think that is going to be this bottle done red eyes have allowed me a lot of time with this oil which i really appreciate so i've been using this oil for between five and six weeks i would say and i've been using this probably about four or five times a week as well my dosage from what i've been using i've been using probably about half of one of these and that has been giving me the perfect dose that i need but now i'm gonna get into the story time because now we're talking about dosages there is a little story behind this oil that i had with one of my friends that was a little bit too much when it comes to the dosage so i had a friend come to me in work and say that he was just feeling really groggy he wasn't feeling good at all aches and pains the normal stuff the cold weather's coming in now and he just wasn't feeling good so i said to him i'm actually reviewing some oil right now are you interested in trying some i'm reviewing it i'd love to see your opinion on it and see if it works for you so he picked the bottle up and because i've been using about half of one of these he used probably just a little more than what's in there and because i'd been using half i thought you know a cbd there's not really any thc in it it's not going to hit him too hard and that was at about quarter to 10 in the morning so lunchtime came around he said he was feeling a little better but he didn't feel as though he'd whacked him so then the end of the day come around and i get a text from him that's about half past two and the text says i've been feeling quite stoned for the last hour without the paranoia so i actually got a little worried because if anything the last thing i want people to do when they're using this cbd oil is guest owned especially a lot of people who have messaged me have been saying they want to try cbd to get away from thc so this worried me when he said this so when i questioned him about the fact that he told me that he felt a little stoned he said maybe stoned was a heavy word to use for how he was feeling and then he said he just felt fluffy so after about 30 minutes he actually showed up and i met up with him and you could see that this oil had hit him he didn't look stoned he had a slight bit of a glassy eye but he looked super relaxed super relaxed super sat back in his seat and you could just see that he was really really chilled out which was actually surprising because through all my time using this oil i didn't actually feel as though it hit me hard in fact i felt as though this oil really cleared my head put me in a really positive mood but the one thing i love about this oil is the pain relief so before we say any more i think we've got to talk about taking this oil i haven't got much of it left this is probably the last of the oil but i'm just going to show you how i take it so just get the oil and i put it under my tongue and now you're not really gonna understand what i'm saying but i leave the oil under my tongue as long as i possibly can and now we're gonna get on to the next point which is the flavor of this oil i've tried a lot of oils in my time using cbd and this stuff doesn't really taste much different i really didn't like the flavor of this oil is very natural very hempy and it's got a very very earthy taste to it if you guys have used cbd oil this one when it comes to the taste isn't much different this one is very piney very earthy and very very hempy this is a strong tasting oil but i will say after using pretty much the whole bottle it does get easier to use this oil and the last few times really hasn't been an issue for me and i went to the next little test that i did because i wanted to see if food was gonna affect this oil for about two or three weeks of using this oil i was just pruning my mouth letting it sit for a few minutes and then just kind of getting on with my day and i did feel the effect i felt the clear head i feel the felt the positivity i felt the incredible pain relief that this oil gives but i was wondering if food was gonna impact it at all so for the last three or so weeks i've been using this oil with a mix of peanut butter and high fat foods to see if the effects would kick in anymore and i've gotta say i didn't really notice much of a difference i think that is because of the mct oil that they do use in this you don't really need any other fatty foods to help absorb this oil which i think is amazing i think the fact that you can just take this oil you can chuck it in your bag and you don't have to eat you with food it's a very very big plus and i think just the ease of use with this oil yeah it doesn't taste great but i've had this in my bag for about five or six weeks now it sits in the box when i need it i can take a few drops it's fast acting and i really have been getting some amazing pain relief from this and now let's get on to that let's get on to the pain relief for this because i think that is the highlight when it comes to this oil it doesn't taste great it doesn't smell great the oil looks good but the effect for me is definitely where this comes into play and the different effects to what i'm used to when it comes to using flour and stuff like that i didn't get any sort of tire dyes off this or glassy eyes or i didn't feel couch locked at all if anything this oil was perfect for taking in the morning and getting rid of that tired morning grogginess that we all seem to get this oil picked me up got me nice and alert cleared my head and put me in a very positive mood but the one thing i love about this oil more than anything you've heard me talk about a few times already is the pain relief i'm used to cbd pain relief lasting for a few hours and the pain seems to come back i've been struggling really bad with my chest and my shoulder over the last few weeks and honestly this stuff has been a lifesaver and especially today my shoulder my chest has been super sore and i just couldn't take it anymore so i took about half of a pipette of this oil and within about 30 minutes my pain completely disappeared on a scale of zero being no pain relief and be in complete pain relief this is up there i would say the pain relief is better than flour i would say this is on par with the pain relief for extract it seems to just melt it away and not only just melt the pain relief away but it keeps that pain away for about five or six hours i've noticed that the pain relief sticks around which is the reason why it's been in my bag for the last six weeks because there's definitely been times in the last five or six weeks throughout the day when i've just needed some oil to be that quick acting pain relief and this has done it this video was a little different for me i'm used to vaping flower and having sessions on camera but really all i could do was tell you guys about the oil tell you my experience show you how i use it and also throw a little story time in there as well but i've really enjoyed using this 2000 milligram oil from red eyes if you guys enjoyed the video remember to leave a thumbs up put some comments in the comment section hit that subscribe button and if you want to come and watch me stream some games check that link in the description speak to you guys later [Music] you", "-YsvQ67Ykvo": "hello my fellow foodies Taylor here and welcome back to my channel this video is going to be a little different a little vlog style it's not gonna be very polished or anything like that like my normal videos are because I just wanted to show you guys what I got in the mail so recently I started hearing a lot of people talk about CBD oil and I know what you're thinking oh my god is that even legal yes yes it is I actually heard about this company that I'm gonna talk about through mind pump media on Instagram if anybody wants to go follow them their channel is very informational and I love it and I think a lot what I'm learning about weight training and nutrition right now is coming from that channel so with that said they were sponsored by a company called Ned and they have an array of products that have CBD in them but I decided to try out a CBD oil for myself I just want to open this on camera for you guys and then for the next couple days I'm gonna be using it exactly how it says to use it so that I can get the most bang for my buck and then I'll check up with you guys in the next couple days to see how it goes I'm really excited about it so let's just open this package so this is the package I received in the mail it's so cute very neat very little package you have their little net symbol here which I think is really cute it kind of reminds me of something off the periodic table yes I just got one vial of CBD oil at 750 milligrams so let's open and I'm excited I think it's like packaged really cutely is what I've seen on Instagram turns out I don't even need that box cutter full spectrum hemp oil 750 milligrams here in your hand because net believes the world's best natural remedies and restorative traditions belong with you I guess so try it for the first time on camera try not to mess up my Star Wars manicure that I did for myself shake well dispensed two to five dropper 20 drops on your tongue for recommended 10 milligram dose taking three deep breaths and then swallow repeat one to two times a day I'm kind of oh okay I'm not gonna lie and say it smells good it just smells like you know what it's made of I took three deep breaths and swallowed okay it doesn't actually taste that bad my nerves are gone now so that is all I have for today I will check back in with you tomorrow and through the next couple days when I start using my new oil but so far I am really excited it doesn't taste bad and we'll see how it goes in the next couple days so as you guys saw I just put that in my morning coffee protein shake I wanted to see if I had any effect on the taste no it tastes the same well and I put the full 20 drops in there which is the recommended dose so today's great oh that's really good I wonder if I made it taste better maybe I just did the perfect amount of coffee too almond milk this morning ok bye hello friends a quick update I have been using the NED hemp oil for about a week now and all I can say is I am absolutely in love with it it's just very calming and it gives me a sense of being very relaxed as I go throughout my day so all in all amazing experience Thank You Ned for the hemp oil I will definitely be looking into more of your products because this company is legit thank you guys for watching my video if you have any suggestions on what other herbal supplement I should use next please let me know I love me some herbal supplements and I'll see you all in my next video", "Zy2nsYe2BgQ": "hi you i've got a good surprise for you a new company i sent extract labs one thousand and two thousand milligram bottles to two different labs to see if they are real that's two products and four lab tests to give you the peace of mind that you're not getting screwed no you are too smart to be scammed by a cbd company because we have the lab tests i am not in any way affiliated with this company at this time but i do use affiliate links on my website to help pay for these lab tests and products so i can buy what you buy and blind test products i pay the labs too it's expensive no no no need to thank me it's funny i've never seen anything about this company except for on reddit and people love them there it's founded by a combat vet they give 50 off to people in need i like this because i was a firefighter and like those discounts but you should like it too because if you were sick or didn't have enough cash cbd might cheer you up and this company would help you do that i didn't find anything about them in an extensive search where many companies have failed and this is where i would add to their public shaming [Music] shame they came out uh squeaky clean shall we start with the thousand milligram formula actually why don't we go over both of them and you guys can just uh click the link below if you want to dive into the details or see the official lab test so we've got a 1 000 milligram for 50 bucks cheap and 2 000 milligram for eighty five dollars also cheap now that's that's super duper cheap let's just uh google up uh cbd or buy cbd okay pure canada comes up first for me not sure why 154 dollars for their 1 000 milligram bottle regular price that's average 15 cents per milligram is average do you want to pay 50 or 150 and i feel like this is why i haven't seen them on any advertisements some companies pay to play and others just do it cheap and by word of mouth or in this case word of reddit extract labs is insanely cheap and you guys know i'm a cheap guy you'll see why in a second when i break down their milligram price both of these bottles tested incredibly well both had slightly more cbd super accurate a scores from both labs and both formulas are rich in cbd thc good amount of cbc and cbg i like that both of these are excellent full spectrum extracts one thing here a lot of people ask me what's the best cbd there's not a best these cannabinoids change everything and everyone has an individualized reaction i had one person email me this week saying they felt like lazarus was more effective than bluebird and the same day someone else told me that they went back to bluebird because lazarus didn't work as well for them both asked why there's a difference in thc and cannabinoid levels that i test for but there's also other cannabinoids and terpenes that we don't know about so i always recommend trying a few brands and finding one that's good for you according to lab a the one thousand milligram bottle was four point eight cents per milligram and the two thousand milligram bottle was four point two cents per milligram average is fifteen cents extract labs looks extract labs looks at an average cbd product and laughs at it both of these are strong if you're not used to hemp start with the thousand milligram i wouldn't even take the full dropper because over 33 milligrams of cbd is a lot and the 2000 milligrams is over 66 milligrams it's a lot very potent both of them especially the 2000 one milligram is a decent amount of thc possibly up to 1.5 milligrams of thc for the 2 000 milligram formula i uh i really like this brand i can see why people on reddit bring it up so much even the box is super high quality nothing peeling off the label multiple layered textures the inside of the box is even nice the bottle is nice label nice super clean logo out of boulder colorado and the dropper the milliliter dropper is labeled so if you go with the 2 000 milligram you can just take less which is nice they paid attention to detail the owner has got to be out of his mind with this one because everything is perfect there's something off in your presentation private can't place it is it your hair is it the wrinkle in your trousers i have a knife in my foot oh yes of course that's it the knife can i say that he's a military vet i'll just uh i'll just say thank you for your your service and your you're in your mind not out of it and your mind is a very clean and precise place attention to detail i like it the taste the taste is excellent the 1000 milligram bottle tastes great it's just hemp and coconut oil it's got a earthy pine taste that is common in full spectrum extracts but it's smooth and almost sweet the 2000 milligrams 2000 milligrams is the same but it has a slightly bitter aftertaste which is expected for a natural hemp extract that is this strong 2 000 milligrams is potent but it's still excellent in my opinion but the uh the 1000 milligram is uh is better i'm uh i'm a delicate flower i like it light they also make lemon raspberry and banana flavors that i'm sure will be good considering this was great okay what else is there to say i gave them my cbd exam and authenticity award which is the best award you can get the company is top notch this this will end up on my top cbd oils list that's how much i like it see you next time", "eBZjsh-1Lo4": "cbd stands for cannabidiol it is the second most prevalent of the active ingredients of cannabis marijuana while cbd is an essential component of medical marijuana it is derived directly from the hemp plant which is a cousin of the marijuana plant while cbd is a component of marijuana one of hundreds by itself it does not cause a high according to a report from the world health organization in humans cbd exhibits no effects indicative of any abuse or dependence potential to date there is no evidence of public health related problems associated with the use of pure cbd enter to click below to get best hemp cbd", "ydZRyIeEvaM": "Hey it's Dustin in this video i'm going\nto be doing a cbd review on this PureKana 300 milligram mint cbd\ntincture so stick with me. Alright when it comes to cbd oil\nthere's three criteria that i want to judge it by and review it by and those\nare quality taste and price so obviously if we're\nreviewing a topical there's not going to be any taste so\nwe'll skip over that one so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to tell\nyou about the quality of this product and uh and i'm just going to give you a\nbrief overview we're going to talk about taste and price after that and then\nafter that we're going to go over the computer and i'm going to give you a lot\nmore nitpicky when it comes to quality we're going to look at the coa\nwe're gonna look at uh everything that's in it when it comes\nto the different cannabinoids and i'll let you know if this is a quality cbd\noil more in depth at the end so be sure to\nstick to the end brief overview of quality this is a quality product if\nyou're just like hey has a quality product or isn't it\nyes it is and the reason i say that is because um i've looked they sourced\ntheir hemp from kentucky decent place to do it i think uh oregon\nand central oregon specifically it's better to do that because we're on\nthe 45th parallel and so the light cycle is much more natural to grow hemp\nanyway that's a different story it's a little bit longer story if you're\nlooking for the best hemp i'm going to argue it comes from central\noregon they do it in kentucky and that's just fine they if you look at\nthe color of this product you'll notice that it's almost\nclear it's almost see-through it's a little bit golden\nin color and so that tells me that they're not using crude oil they're\nusing distillate so when you extract hemp the oil out of\nhemp it's going to first of all be a dark almost black very gummy crude oil\nand i i believe since this is so light in color they're not using\ncrude oil they're taking it to the next level through distillation\nso it's a lot more refined and so as a result\nthis product is not going to taste very heavy so i'm going to taste real quick\nand it has a good taste this is mint flavor\nand really it's got a refreshing taste you put put it in there you're not\ntasting very much hemp and you're tasting a mint\nflavor and so as far as taste goes it tastes really great\nin fact our product at green method farms we also have a mint product and\nthese basically taste identical let's go into price real quick\nuh we i have it pulled up right here on my computer this 300 milligram bottle\nwhich i bought you can get for 54. if you want to\nupgrade to the thousand milligram bottle which\nis kind of where people usually are at it's going to cost you 139\nand green method farms our product we offer a thousand milligram\nfor 45 on our website greenmethodfarms.com you can check the\nlink below if you want to look more into that\nanyway so these two products here if you got a thousand milligram purcha or the\nthousand milligram green method farms very similar uh in quality\nand very similar in taste this one's going to cost you 139 bucks this one is\ngoing to cost you 45 bucks so way cheaper and so anyway that's kind of\nthe review when it comes to quality taste in price now let's go to\nthe computer and i'll show you a little bit more in depth\nwhen it comes to quality and i'll be able to show you a little bit more\nuh the nitpicky when it comes to cannabinoids because here's something\nthat you need to understand um when it comes to the cannabinoids\nwhen it comes to cbd oils cbd is great right we know that it helps\nwith inflammation and with many other things but one of\nthe ways that the hemp plant and cbd oil that's extracted from\nthe ham plant works the best is through something called the\nentourage effect that means when your oil contains the minor cannabinoids so\nof course it has the major cannabinoid which is\ncbd when it has other minor cannabinoids in there like\ncbn uh cbc cbg those are the those are the big ones but\nthere's also other ones in there when it when your oil contains those as well it\nall works together better than if it was just a cbd product\ncoming from a cbd isolate or something like that where there's nothing else in\nit but cbd so if you have the choice\nbetween a cbd isolate product which has nothing but cbd in it or a cbd product\nthat also has the minor cannabinoids in it you're going to want the miter\ncannabinoids so let's go to the computer and we'll take a look at the coa the\ncertificate of analysis and we'll dissect that and we'll\nactually do a side by side comparison to green method farms versus\npure canna because this is kind of the benchmark because i'm the one doing the\nvideos and i'm the one that grew the hemp and i'm the one that extracted the\nham from the one that created this product\nso i will do a side by side i'm doing comparisons and i'm gonna be i'm gonna\nbe completely honest about it there are some cbds out there cbd\nproducts that are absolute crap they're scam\ndon't buy them uh purecam is not one of those this is a good product\nit's an expensive product but it's a good product so let's go to the computer\ni'll show you what i'm talking about okay so here we are on purecanna's\nwebsite and this is the page for their 1 000 milligram uh\ncbd tincture as you can see it's 139 dollars\ni'm gonna go over to our website real quick and i'm going to show you that the\n100 000 milligram full spectrum cbd oil tincture basically\nthe same thing 45 so let's go over to um their coa we'll talk a little bit\nmore about quality so this is the pure canna coa on their\nthousand milligram uh cbd tincture and you're gonna be able\nto notice here they have 30 39.4 so um\nyeah 39 milligrams per gram of cbd so you can see here on the graph\nthat's mostly what this bottle contains there is\na little bit .06 milligrams per gram of cbc\nso that's a minor cannabinoid there's point three\non well actually this is part of cbd product so never mind on that\num and then uh cbl point zero eight cbn point zero\neight milligrams per gram so very small amounts\nand then uh thc point seven milligrams per gram so a little bit more\non the thc side i wanted to point out that when it\ncomes to cvg it doesn't even register so there's no\ncbg in this let's go real quick to green method farms and\nwe'll do a side-by-side comparison okay so here's the certificate of\nanalysis for green method farms 1000 milligram cbd tincture again this is 45\ndollars if you want to order it at greenmethodfarms.com\num and we'll just look at the graph here because this points out the major and\nminor cannabinoids so we'll go to the big one first\ncbd it's got nearly 31 milligrams per gram\nso of course that's going to be the highest cannabinoid in the cbd oil but\nlet's look at the minor cannabinoids as well\nif you look at the delta 9 thc it is 1.2 milligrams per gram which is going to be\nhigher but if you look at the percentage it is\n0.12 so the legal limit of thc\nin the united states is 0.3 of a percent so we are\nwell we're almost one-third of uh below the legal limit so um\nit's basically a tenth of a percent of thc in this but thc is actually good\nfor you so i mean it's not a bad thing i'm just letting you know that it's\nbelow the legal limit but there is some thc\nin it and there is some thc in the uh purecanna\nversion as well it says full spectrum oil so going\ndown to let's see here um cbg we have a point two\nmilligrams per gram so um cbg at pure canada didn't even register so you're\ngetting more cbg in this and then um that's cbga just regular cbg\nis going to be one uh milligram per gram so\nway more uh cbg than the pure canna and then cbc\nis also a 1.1 milligram per gram so anyway the minor cannabinoids are\nhigher they're more concentrated in the green method farm so again my\nopinion this is going to go this is going to be because of the\nquality of the genetics the farming and the extraction uh process so let me\ntell you real quick what i mean by that so\npurecanna is sourced by farms in kentucky kentucky is on the 36th\nparallel and that's significant because the closer the 45th parallel\nthe better um in on our farm in central oregon we actually are on the\n45th parallel the reason this makes a difference is because of the light\ncycle the summer solstice around june 20th it's an 18\nhour to six hour light to darkness ratio and so when the days become shorter the\nplant the hemp plant decides hey the day's getting shorter it's time\nfor me to start flowering and that's when they produce the most oil so\nin central oregon you're getting a really dry climate which is great\nbecause you can rake it's got you know lots of sun the light cycle is great you\ncan regulate as much water and nutrients as you want\nthrough the drip line and so that's the reason i'm a little bit biased but i\nreally do believe that central oregon is a superior place\nto grow hemp compared to other places like kentucky\nbecause of the dryness of the climate and it being on the 45th parallel\nthe other thing that i want to mention is that uh\npurecanna uses a co2 extraction method where green method farms uses an ethanol\nextraction method now you probably don't know chances are\nyou probably don't know a ton about extraction this might not\nmake a big difference to you in our experience\nco2 extraction produces a real gummy and not as high quality of a crude oil\nand as a result it takes more through distillation to be able to have\na good product and i think that that might be either the genetics or it's the\ndistillation is the reason that the pure canna\nproduct has less of the minor cannabinoids\nin green method farms we use an ethanol extraction\nand in our experience ethanol extraction is a lot more clean of an extraction\nwe take our uh extraction to crude oil and then we water wash it which removes\na lot of the impurities such as fats and lipids and sugars and those kind of\nthings so that you're actually left with a pretty good\nclean crude oil and since that crude oil is clean to begin with when we take it\nthrough distillation it's just an easier process and i think\nthat you're left with more minor cannabinoids as a result so that\nis in my opinion starting with better genetics but also\nending with a more pure uh product cbd product that goes through\nthe distillation process they don't have to refine and pull out as much of the\nstep the cannabinoids like cbc\ncbn cbg as they do with pure canada so anyway both\nproducts i'm going to say are great um you're not going to have any problems\nwith the pure canada product i'm just saying and i'm a little bit biased\nbecause i'm the one doing it but i have spent\nthe entire process from farming through extraction to bottling\nand formulation so maybe you're wondering why are we selling our product\nfor way less when we could be selling it you\nknow if it's the same product as pure canada we could be selling it for 140\nwe've got two reasons for that one because we can we're a small family farm\nwe have 10 acres and uh and so we extract enough oil to\nbe able to produce enough oil to extract at our extraction\nfacility which i work for so we get a deal on that so\nbasically our overhead is just it's just not\nvery high we could charge 140 bucks for this product\num but we've decided that we don't need to\nand because we really believe in the medicine we want to be able to get that\nout there as to as many people as possible and not you know have to\ncharge the 140 so anyway if uh if you're interested in\nbuying cbd oil cp oil tincture i'm definitely going to say buy it from\nus because you're going to get a great product for a fraction of the\nprice if you want to spend 140 bucks this is a\ngreat product go ahead and do it pure canada\ni highly recommend them i mean this is a great product it's just expensive\nso if you want to get the same thing maybe even a little bit better of a\nproduct because of the extraction methods\nbecause of the genetics that we started with green method farms is the way to go\ngo ahead and click the link below to purchase uh 45\nfor a thousand

we're taking a look at the suite of CBD products from Sunsoil. Made from organically farmed ingredients,\nthese oils, pills and capsules, oh my, are designed to embody all the rocks and benefits\nof CBD. But do they actually work? That's what we're here to find out. I tested out all these products and I'm here\nto give you the 411 on how they feel, how strong they are, and whether or not they're\nworth your money. So, ready or not, here we go. Based out of Hardwick, Vermont, Sunsoil uses\na holistic, whole planet approach to produce CBD products that aren't just good for the\ncustomer, but also for Mother Nature. How does the brand accomplish this? By putting a special focus on ethical pricing,\ntransplant operational procedures, and verifiable third party testing. As far as products are concerned, Sunsoil\noffers an array of different CBD goodies from soft gel pills to oil tinctures, hard capsules,\nand CBD-infused coconut oil. Though all these different products take on\ndifferent physical forms, they're all derived from USDA-certified organic hemp that's free\nof pesticides and GMOs. We know all of these products utilize CBD,\nbut what in the world is CBD? CBD, or cannabidiol, is a compound found in\nthe flower of the cannabis plant. It's one of the hundred of these different\nphytocannabinoids, with the most popular being the psychoactive tetrahydracannabinol, or\nTHC. However, unlike THC, CBD is not psychoactive. Yes, you heard that correct. CBD does not trigger hallucinations or intoxication\nand it's mostly used to cause a relaxing effect, to alleviate things like joint pain, anxiety,\nloss of appetite, and yes, poor sleep. I should also mention that it's totally legal\nto consume and buy hemp-derived CBD in all 50 states. Although the Internet has been buzzing about\nCBD's positive health benefits for years now, there hasn't been a lot of research done into\nits side effects. However, the studies that have been done have\nfound it to be a safe and well-tolerated compound. For example, a 2011 study which aggregated\ndata from multiple studies, found CBD to be safe in up to 1500 mg dosages per day. A 2017 study which sought to add information\nto that survey further found that not only was CBD safe for long-term use, but it actually\nhad a better side effect profile at treating certain medical conditions like epilepsy or\npsychotic disorders. As I mentioned up top, Sunsoil has a couple\nof different products. They've got this oil tincture here. They have....What is this one? They've got the hard capsules, they have soft\ngel pills, and they have CBD-infused coconut oil. I tried out all these different products and\nfor me the oil tincture worked the best. If you don't like oils, they have these other\noptions for you. Since this one worked best for me, that's\nwhat I'm going to focus on for the rest of this review as we get into my personal experience\nwith the product. The oil either comes in the 600 mg concentration\nfor $30 or 1200 mg concentration for $60. The higher the concentration, the more CBD\nyou're getting per serving. According to Sunsoil, an entire serving is\none full dropper. In the 600 mg bottle, a full dropper has about\n10 mg of CBD in it and the 1200 mg bottle has double that, 20 mg of CBD. Deciding which concentration which is going\nto be right for you is going to really depend on your body size, shape, and weight. It's going to be different for everyone. For reference, I am about 6 feet tall, 165\npounds, so I decided to take a full dropper of the 1200 mg concentration bottle. Again, that's about 20 mg of active CBD which\nfelt right for me. If you're trying CBD for the first time, or\nyou're experimenting with a new brand, I highly recommend that you consult with a medical\nprofessional before doing so. It's going to come as much of a surprise to\nyou, but I'm not a doctor. Everything I'm going to share with you is\nbased solely on my personal experience. Just keep in mind that your own experience\ncould be very different from my own. Speaking of which, let's get into my experience\nwith the Sunsoil oil tincture which I'm going to break down into falling asleep, staying\nasleep, and the morning after. [background music] Cody: One of my biggest problems at night\nis falling asleep. Even if I'm super exhausted, as soon as my\nhead hits the pillow, my mind starts racing with a hundred different thoughts, worries\nand concerns. When I'm looking at a sleep supplement or\na new CBD oil, I need to make sure it's going to be able to quiet my mind and relax my body\nso that I can actually fall asleep at night. I'm happy to report that the oil tincture\nfrom Sunsoil worked like a charm. I took again, a full dropper of the 1200 mg\nconcentration and found that within 15 minutes I was feeling totally relaxed. My shoulders felt loosey goosey and it was\njust this nice fog of relaxation all the way from the tips of my toesies all the way up\nto my head. It definitely quieted me down and got me all\nready for bed and I found it was really easy to fall asleep. Another huge issue I have is staying asleep. Even if I can fall asleep, it's sometimes\ndifficult for me to sustain that slumber over the course of an entire evening. So not only does a sleep supplement or CBD\noil need to be able to knock me out at bedtime, it needs to keep me from waking up in the\nmiddle of the night, which I do most nights. Unfortunately here, the tincture didn't really\nwork for me that well. I'm not that surprised because CBD effects\nusually last for an hour, hour and a half so even if it's able to put me to sleep, usually\nit doesn't keep me sleeping throughout the night. I found here that the Sunsoil products didn't\nleave me sleeping throughout the entire evening and I woke up in the middle of the night most\nnights. Finally, the morning after. One of the biggest complains I hear from our\nfans and readers is that all these sleep supplements and CBD oils make them feel super groggy the\nnext day. I like to consider how the morning after feels\nwhen I'm reviewing a product. Here I'm happy to say that I didn't really\nfeel any grogginess, any hangover, anything like that from the CBD oil. That's probably because the effects wore off\nin the middle of the night, but I still think it's worth noting that I woke up feeling clear\neyed and ready to go for the day. [background music] Cody: OK, so we've gone over the brand, chatted\nabout the ingredients, and gotten into my experience with the Sunsoil oil tincture. Now, it's time to wrap this baby up with a\nfew final thoughts which I'm going to divide into some pros and cons, starting with the\npros. First and foremost, I thought this oil was\nfantastic at getting me to fall asleep. Within 15 minutes of taking it, I felt super\nrelaxed, super cozy, and my mind was really quieted down so it was easy for me to fall\nasleep. Number two, I love that it's made from organic\nmaterials so you can feel good about what you're ingesting. Number three, I think at $30 and $60, this\nCBD is priced really well. A lot of CBD oils go for $100, $150 so this\nis a pretty strong value buy, especially for how it feels. Unfortunately, there were also a few cons. My biggest complaint is that the oil didn't\nreally help me to stay asleep. Again, that's not really the brand's fault. CBD usually wears off after an hour, hour\nand a half but it's still something I feel is worth mentioning. Number two, I didn't really care for the taste\nof either of these oils which either come in a chocolate mint or cinnamon flavors which\nfor me are a little specific and don't really fit into the palate that I generally enjoy. Well folks, that about does it for my review\ninto the Sunsoil suite of CBD products.

well i was a practicing chiropractic physician for 30 years and i was able to start a medical device company a number of years back and that got me involved with fda audits with good manufacturing processes i've owned a number of companies for operations and they asked me to come out with my science background i've done some published research in the past and with bringing the good manufacturing process and certifications that come with a nutritional pharmaceutical type company i brought that expertise out here and assembled a team so that we could deliver our product in a very

together so let's let's get to your slides dr krauss has some slides that he's going to show us to explain he said he's going to rip through them because there's a lot of them but it's very informational and dr cross can we get these slides later on after the presentation okay great and then we'll be able to ask some questions so go ahead dr press welcome well thank you and i i really appreciate cmta for allowing us to present educational information about how the body's endocannabinoid system works and how a natural product like synchronicity using full spectrum hemp oil can hopefully make a difference in those watching and for the loved ones of those watching here as we know you know cmt with genetic and not really any kind of cure what we're hoping to do is make the lives better of those individuals having the various symptoms so as you've kind of already alluded to i'm the president and chief operations officer here at functional remedies and so i work with everything from our organic farm to our certified gmp production facility to our iso 9001 certified company and we're real proud to have our operations in colorado and this is the view right out of the window just three feet from me uh that i i'm lucky to look out of each week and so uh that was that picture you see that was taken just a couple weeks ago right outside my window so as mentioned uh we're a vertically integrated company where we take care of our own soil our organic farm through our production process all the way to the bottle so we control and own every step of the process so that we can guarantee what's in this product and the safety of it so let's talk generically here first i think there might be a number of individuals who have heard about hemp oil and cbd but they're not really sure what is it so let's just talk a little bit about what are the reasons americans are currently taking these types of products you've got well over 30 million americans taking this now on a daily basis and the number one reason is pain relief and then the next four reasons are pretty close second through fifth you've got relaxation stress relief reduced anxiety and better sleep those are the reasons that individuals have stated as to why they take hemp oil or cbd but i think it's important that we understand the differences and there's a lot of buzzwords out there and unfortunately there's a lot of i guess i'll call them garage companies who are trying to make a fast buck and you need to be careful uh making sure that you're you're getting uh what you think you're getting so let's address the elephant in the room can you get high off of hemp or cbd and the answer is clearly no and so let's describe the difference between hemp and marijuana they both come from the same plant cannabis sativa but the difference from a legal perspective is simply this if the plant has more than 0.3 percent thc it's considered marijuana if it's less than 0.3 percent it's hemp so thc is one cannabinoid in a hemp plant in a marijuana plant and that's what gives you the hallucinogenic or the psychoactive high feeling that you hear about cannabinoids such as cbd cbg all the other 120 cannabinoids that are in that plant do not get you high so with hemp you cannot get high or have altered mental status uh from an uncontrollable factor by taking hemp or cbd you cannot so we've worked very hard over the last 20 years of naturally crossbreeding this plant to make sure that our plant has an extremely low amount of thc so it's important to have a little bit of thc in there and our plant averages about 0.1 and you really need you know anywhere from 7.00 to start feeling something from a high factor so you're not going to feel that you'd have to drink you know a few dozen bottles of this to get anything but then i don't think your stomach would feel so well so let's talk about the difference in plant genetics for just a moment that's really the difference all these cannabinoids and phytonutrients including bioflavonoids which help free you know protect your body against free radicals uh the phenols all these wonderful benefits of skin protecting nutrients anti-inflammatory properties but having a full array of all these phytocannabinoids and a tiny tiny amount of thc is where the benefit comes from and our plant right now is the only fully dna sequenced plant in the cannabis genome it's even published on the nih website if you go to the ncbi website the subdivision of ni of nih you'll find that our plant which we call cbd or x18 uh we fully sequence the dna so we know exactly what's in our plant and this is our plant on our farm right here in colorado and there's a difference between full spectrum hemp oil and cbd all by itself so let's explain that cbd is one molecule there are over 120 identified different cannabinoids 120 different molecules of cannabinoids plus there's another 300 molecules of terpenes phytonutrients so you've got around 400 different molecules in this plant and what's interesting about the genetics is the human body the dna in our human body matches nearly 40 of the dna in the hemp plant it's the most closely related plant to the human body than any other plant even certain vegetative plants they have certain dna similar to the human body as well but the hemp plant has more dna similarities to the human body than any other plant and i find that very interesting now your body has a system called the ecs the endocannabinoid system and it's a it's made up of a bunch of receptors that are located on your brain on your nervous system your spinal cord on your skin on your digestive tract your endocrine glands near your joints your nervous system even your endocrine system where it balances all of the hormones in your body so the ecs system isn't something that any of us were taught in high school and the reason for that is it wasn't until the late 80s early 90s that it made its way into all the medical textbooks and the ecs system the receptors is basically the master system of the body to control and regulate the other systems of the body so that they produce the correct enzymes for inflammation so that they produce the correct hormonal release or the correct amount of serotonin from your brain so that your body's biochemistry is balanced that's what the ecs is doing is it's allowing your body to be in a homeostatic state and the way it does it is with a variety of different receptors now these receptors the majorities receptors are triggered by cbd that one molecule but many many of the receptors aren't triggered by cbd at all they're triggered by the other cannabinoids cba cbd and even terpenes terpenes are found in oranges grapefruits terpenes are very rich in the hemp plant as well and those botanical compounds also trigger and activate these receptors so that they then send messages to the immune system to the gi system and so the difference between full spectrum hemp oil and cbd is this full spectrum means we're taking all of these botanical compounds from the whole planet that's that whereas cbd is simply cbd is simply one molecule and in order to get cbd out what certain companies have to do they have to use an extraction process and that extraction process involves chemicals like ethanol or ether it's a harsh extraction process and the problem when you do that is you have to remove that molecule they cleanse it and then they put it back into the liquid and so it's really not an all-natural process it's a man-made process whereas lipid infusion which is what our synchronicity product is made from it's a gentle hand pressing and so literally here's what we do imagine this folks imagine a container a stainless steel large pot with organic coconut oil which is a lipid and then we put hemp raw hemp material right from the plant and we've already tested that plant to make sure there's no heavy metals no pesticides no chemicals all organic on our organic farm and that hemp product goes into this and under a specialized heat under a specialized pressure we cook and infuse all of those phytonutrients in the hemp plant and they attach to that organic coconut or lipid molecule and literally with our hands we hand press with a an apple press we squeeze out the oil out of that plant we don't use any harsh chemicals like the co2 extraction methods and the difference is this would you like to have the pure cells that you see on the bottom here or would you like to have the adulterated molecules that are shown above from co2 extraction put into your body i don't know about you but i'd rather have these nice holistic all-natural molecules go into my body versus an adulterated biochemical compound that you see above as a result of ethanol extraction and then you want to make sure that before you put that product in your body that it's pure that it's got the correct potency that is on the bottle that you know you're getting the amount of hemp nutrients that it says it has in the bottle and so it's important that it's tested for antimicrobial properties it's important that we test for heavy metals and make sure that there's no residual solvents and make sure there's no toxins and we want to make sure that there is no amount of thc above 0.3 percent and we've demonstrated this so we are federally certified by nsf for gmp and not a lot of companies have that designation and we're the only company that has an iso 9001 certification for the entire company from the farm to the corporate office to our production facility and gmp we're the only company in the united states out of over 3 000 that have that dual certification for as a hemp only company so it's important that you know you're getting pure potent and safe products put into your body and one way we control that as i mentioned earlier in the presentation is that we're vertically integrated because we test our soil we test the plant before we harvest we test the plant after we hand harvest we're literally out in the field and we hand plant every single plant by hand and we harvest every single plant by hand and then it's cared for in the facility and because we use this lipid infusion process it allows for a better bio availability into your body a better absorption because lipids are more easily absorbed in the body and it's important that we are able to get all of those botanical compounds that the hemp plant offers into your body because of what we call the true entourage effect it's the whole entourage of all these wonderful botanical compounds to trigger all the receptors so that your body is fully balanced and the best way i can explain it is when you've got an orange would you rather have fresh squeezed orange juice or would you rather have a concentrate and i think most of us would choose fresh squeezed orange juice right and that way you get all of the cannabinoids and that's what your body needs is all those cannabinoids to balance all the systems of the body so the other question i'm often asked is well what's the right amount that i should take i've been diagnosed with cmt so i've got neuropathic pain i've got some numbness in my extremities i've got achy muscles i've got gi problems you know a variety of issues right so here's what we say in order for you to feel the full effect you kind of have to ask your body you've got to start low and then go a little slow and your body's going to tell you so i'm going to share this with you i you heard at the top of the presentation i had seven kids three in college three in high school every one of my seven children have taken this product whether it be a topical on their skin whether it would be an ingestible whether it be a facial cream but all seven of my kids take this product on a daily basis my college kids take it to sleep better and as an anti-anxiety is why they take it so i recommend what you do is start with 25 milligrams a day and now this depends on your metabolism it depends on what other kind of medications might you be taking so if you're taking a you know i guess i'm going to call it a molotov cocktail of all kinds of medications you do need to talk to your physician about this but the crazy thing is folks most healthcare practitioners out there they don't fully understand cbd and hemp either because when they were in college it was they didn't study it so most of the research has been done over the last several years and on the nih website you'll find thousands of studies ranging from far you know female issues with endometriosis to simple problems like anti-inflammatory where there was a lot of research but my recommendation to you is this if 25 milligrams a day doesn't change anything go to 50 milligrams within three days after that if you didn't notice anything you can go up to 150 milligrams without impacting any kind of liver or other problems in my opinion and anything above that you should talk to your family healthcare provider so one of the studies was done back in 2018 over in europe and what they did they assembled a panel of experts to review over 10 000 different scientific abstracts that dealt with sia with cbd dealt with hemp oil in general and how does it affect the endocannabinoid system of our body so their conclusion was that there is substantial evidence that hemp oil does work specifically the number one thing that it helped was acting as an anti-inflammatory and as you know most pain is from inflammation and we all look at all these various health care conditions out there they all end with itis itis gastritis uh conjunctivitis everything ending in itis simply means there's inflammation of that structure and we all know now that cardiovascular problems is really inflammation of our arterial walls and one of the uh yeah actually one of the world's leading cardiologists dr joel khan over in the detroit area he's published a number of new york bestseller textbooks and he recommends this and he only treats ceos and high-end individuals for heart problems and he recommends you know our product for anti-inflammatory problems for the cardiovascular system um there's a lot of research out there that you'll find on the nih website so i encourage you to go there yourself and if you just google hemp studies on nih thousands are going to show up right from the immune system to the gi tract to the nervous system to the endocrine system uh you'll spend months reading these studies so i'm going to wrap it up here real quick with how do we feel the full effect well it's different for everybody and what form factor is best for you well there are capsules lotions there are tinctures which is a dropper that you might take and so the topicals that you see here everything and all these topicals we've added additional ingredients besides the hemp oil so it's all organic ingredients in the sports balm for pain so for those of you who don't want who don't want to take an oral uh ingestible such as a capsule or a tincture i might recommend you you try the sports balm and that's a roll-on on your skin over achy muscles or joints that you would apply and that's a good dose that's 2 500 milligrams of the total bottle but we've also included a number of other organic ingredients from arnica to menthol and some other soothing items as well and our body oil uh has helped many many people who have had different skin inflammatory processes my my 20 year old son who had severe acne in high school he's not in college it got rid of 90 percent of his symptoms he looks the best he's ever been the body butter on the far right uh cracked heels um on your toes fungal areas works wonders um uh my other son who's in high school is a basketball football athlete uh has worked wonders for him on athlete's foot and things of that nature so that's what the sports bomb looks like and this is what the body butter looks like that we just discussed and then the tincture is all natural or you could have a flavored tincture such as berry lemonade and for those of you who don't like the all-natural hippie taste my recommendation is try the berry lemonade and that'll mask uh any if you don't like kind of a hemp flavor as you put that in your mouth swish it around and swallow it um and the dropper itself uh one dropper contains uh 25 milligrams on if you buy the thousand milligrams uh bottle if it's a 500 milligram then it's 12.5 milligrams so you might take two of these before bedtime if you're taking it for sleep i personally take 50 milligrams every night before i go to bed so i take two capsules every night before i go to bed and then i use the youth serum on my face on my wrinkles uh it's got a bunch of uh organic properties in there along with the hemp oil and it's cleared up a number of my i'll call them age spots here on the side it's done wonders and because cmt was so uh gracious and allowing us to speak tonight and now we'll open up the questions in a moment but you might want to write this down it's cmta 30. so it's pretty easy to remember you all know who cmta is and then the number 30 if you use that on the website you'll get 30 off uh any order that you have and that's at www.synchronicityhempoil.com so at this point i think we can open it up to q a and keeping in the theme with our colorado base this is our red rocks uh outdoor amphitheater that i took this photo at a blues concert last uh two summers ago now and uh it's nighttime now but i don't see a full moon out there like i did that night so we can go ahead and start with q a so thank you so much that you did get through those slides pretty quickly it was very informative um before we go to q a i'd just like to bring dr stilwell who's on our cmt advisory board many of you know him already and dr stillwell is the one that brought this company to us and he himself has experienced the the full effect of some of these products and greg i wanted you to speak a little bit about that before we go to q a well hi elizabeth thanks for having me here i'm so grateful that this seems like a pretty objective presentation stephen so thanks dr krauss for a lot of good stuff you know for me i've been taking this synchronicity for about two years and um for three main reasons elizabeth you know one was that i started off with pain with uh kind of that neurological pain in my legs i don't know you know i i guess everybody's pain is a little bit different but uh what i found was uh i tried other cbd oils and uh capsules and these things without any kind of relief and this one um i would say 80 to 90 percent gone when i take it now i have to take it every day um the second thing is uh kind of this feeling of uncoordination you know that uh i'm sure a lot of people seem to can relate to you know that i feel clumsy when i walk sometimes or maybe my hands don't work the way they should and when i take the hemp oil um you know i haven't actually done like scientific studies to see how much it improves but i can sense that my my hands work better and that my uh legs are less clumsy and um i'm not sure why that is exactly but uh last reason is is that there is kind of this whole mood and stress relief kind of thing you know dr krauss talked about uh not getting high but but but there is definitely something that it does to the brain and um and so that when you take it like your mood kind of is elevated that you know you know um things are happier for me and uh so thanks so much he's good do you take the pills dr stillwell yeah so i take a 50 milligram capsule uh uh sometimes uh you know if i do a lot of exercise or if i have done something bad for my body like traveling then uh i'll take extra but um well thank you so much for that testimonial thank you thank you for bringing us uh we're you know introducing us to synchronicity this is great laurel thank you i look forward to the q a thanks sure yes we've had lots of questions start rolling in and i have received a few um before uh tonight as well so we'll just sprinkle those in so i'm gonna dive right in and um one of the first questions uh dr krauss is how is this good for people with cmt are there special benefits for us i can't say that there's special benefits uh again when we talk about anxiety or we talk about what uh dr stillwell just mentioned you know mood there is a lot of research on improvement that patients have mentioned again it's finding the right dose for that but the big thing to me that i would think for cmt patients is the anti-inflammatory properties that's all natural we all know that when we watch tv and a medication commercial comes on one third of the commercial is the narrator listing off 50 different side effects that occurs and we all know uh if we're going to take tylenol we're going to cause liver problems we all know if we take advil and nsats we're going to cause gi problems and kidney problems uh there's just no way around it so long-term utilization of those types of anti-inflammatory products has side effects and the all-natural organic properties of hemp oil and specifically full-spectrum hemp oil [Music] can give an individual those anti-inflammatory benefits and anti-inflammatory benefits affects the whole body uh i'm gonna just share a quick little story and this is uh just one anecdotal and it's my blood test so ever since i was 23 years old when i started taking my my blood work i have had high triglycerides high cholesterol my entire life and when i take life insurance physicals on myself those results came back i had a heart attack about five six years ago they wanted to put me on statins i did it for one year [Music] i just had another life insurance physical done and they did the blood work i couldn't believe it i went to the hospital did a follow-up it's first time in my life i'm not on any medication i take no statins and i've been taking this product for a year and a half every day and my cholesterol triglycerides are normal i can't say to you it's from this i can't make that statement but nothing else changed in my life because i still eat steak and i still drink a mountain dew every now and then so my diet is not perfect and i'm the worst for exercise so the only lifestyle factor that changed for me is introducing hemp oil and i and i believe it's because of the anti-inflammatory uh effect uh on my blood vessels okay very good can i ask a question you talked a lot about phytonutrients can you explain what what that is yeah so phytonutrients what nutrients in the plant there's a whole host of bioflavonoids the terpenes the phenols it's a way phytonutrients is a way to describe all these other botanical compounds that are found in the plant and so they've identified a little over 400 botanical compounds in the hemp plant and so many good natural ones for the body now granted a lot of them are very very small amounts um with cbd being the largest one of them but again to get this full entourage effect the reason why so many experts are now saying full spectrum hemp oil meaning whole plants you're getting all the nutrients in the plant you're not just extracting just the one phytonutrient cbd thank you yeah okay i'm just trying to get back up to the top of the questions um someone had asked if your products are available in canada salem's helping to answer the chat questions and unfortunately your products are not available in canada um just wanted to share that with the with the group because we have a few friends from over the border up in canada with us um [Music] so we we will get to people raising their hands but also if you could put your ask your question in the chat feature um that is a great place to do that as well is it illegal to send to canada why isn't it can you you can't purchase it and have across the border it's a regulatory factor yes okay all right okay that's supposed to be changing soon we'll see okay that would be great and this question has come up a couple times dr krauss um you know someone is saying this all sounds wonderful and organic but where are the clinical trials to support it specifically um clinical trials in general you might speak to about uh cbd and hemp oil but also as it relates to cmt you bet so one thing that we're investing in here at synchronicity we are we just got approval from the irb the international review board to do a human trial a clinical study and we'll be initiating that in the next two months and the purpose of that study it's a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial and we'll be testing different dosages and its impact on sleep pain anxiety and general lifestyle so a person diagnosed with cmt could be in in that study it wasn't designed for just cmt folks um and there is another trial that is supposed to be released uh in about six to eight weeks and that study had 700 individuals testing liver enzymes and safety at different doses for that if you've read about potential liver toxicity the only reason that came up through the fda is because when gw pharmaceutical it's a pharmacy company that created an anti-seizure medication so it's listed as a drug and it's primarily cbd isolate only it's not the full phytocannabinoids it's heavy doses the smallest dose that i've heard of with that drug is 375 milligrams a day but the studies used thousands of milligrams over 2 000 milligrams in the study a day so think about that we're talking about using 50 milligrams they used 2 000 milligrams each day and it showed some possible in some patients some possible liver toxicity at those high doses for those people with severe certain type of seizures and so my reason for bringing that up um [Music] while this discussion about liver is because of that seizure medication that triggered that discussion and that's why we're also doing safety clinical trials on the liver to demonstrate to the person's question clinical safety thank you dr krause um it's been asked a couple times in the chat does um your do your products interfere with any prescription medications that people might be on whether it's gabby patent something for neuropathic pain or any other medications is there any contraindication a number of studies have been published on nih website and of those it was interesting some medications there can be complicating factors but then at the same time they showed certain medications worked better when the person took uh hemp oil i'll give you one example a certain antibiotic worked better because they have also shown that hemp oil has some antimicrobial properties in it specifically for uh things like staph staphylococcus so but some microbes that are gram positive that test gram positive it's not that effective with it did not enhance it but gram negative it did so my my point here is i mean we could spend an hour going through you know a thousand medications does it does it not and the problem is a lot of research has not been conducted on all these different medications and again that's why i said earlier if you're taking a you know a menu list of medications you should talk to your family physician about it so are you already taking um [Music] you know certain antidepressants and things of that nature um [Music] so it's not well understood yet which medication doesn't work with or not okay um and you mentioned that hemp oil can help with the numbness that's associated with cmt with um cmt cause numbness as a result of sensory nerve impairment what is the mechanism by which hemp oil might help to improve the numbness yeah so neurotransmitters are impacted by your endocannabinoid system in your body so regulation certain release of neurotransmitters again we have to remember what is hemp oil actually doing hemp oil isn't going in there and attacking neuronal issues or the myelin sheath that's not impacting that specifically what it's doing is it's allowing the nervous system itself to regulate itself better or to release certain biochemicals uh at the axonal level and again there are a number of studies that have shown that at the axon level it does actually cause certain enzymatic release that can help so i'm not going to sit here and say hemp oil resolves neuropathies but there is a study on nih if you type in neuropathy and cbd or neuropathy and hemp oil you'll have a half a dozen studies pop up and uh there is some evidence of improvement with those cases okay thank you i think it would be helpful i'm seeing a trend with the questions here um could you just review uh again dr krell's how um these products might help the cmt patient so looking at neuropathic pain sleep relaxation um anxiety anxiety associated with with having a progressive disorder you bet and and with the litany of items you just mentioned there and then of course depression starts to happen because of all these symptoms and individuals suffering from so again if you can get restful sleep they've shown that if people can sleep better and get rest they have more energy the next day their body is healing in that process so what i'm going to tell you is if your body's neurological system and your body's anxiety great you know dr stilwell talked about uh just mood enhancement uh feeling better feeling happier uh anti-anxiety effects so again we're not treating a disease here folks with with hep oil what we're doing is it is modulating your body's regulatory system when it comes to certain hormones certain enzymes certain neurotransmitters to function better which therefore the end result is less anxiety better sleep less inflammation and so while there's no cure for cmt if we minimize the symptomatology that comes along with it uh you're feeling better you're happier and so i'm going to say this because you folks have a sequela of a variety a mishmash a bucket load of symptoms i believe it's not true all the time but i believe you're going to need higher doses and that's why earlier i said consider up to 150 milligrams i believe you should start small at the 25 work your way up find the right dose for you and you will know you will know within three days a week at the most in my opinion based on the thousands of testimonials that we've got on the tens of thousands of people who take our product um i encourage you to try you you're not gonna get hurt um [Music] as long as you're not taking a litany of medications that you do need to be careful with okay thank you very much for that and um this has come up several times will it cause you to test positive on a drug test great question so the answer is it depends it depends on the drug test and here's what i mean by that if we rewind the clock 10 years ago employers would do a marijuana test right when you talk about a drug test what is the drug the drug that they're testing for is marijuana hip oil clearly is not marijuana okay because the federal legal allowed limit in every state is less than 0.3 percent of thc you are allowed to have that the problem is the cost of a drug test that is specific for just the thc is expensive it's 45 retail to the doctor's office they're going to charge the employer 100 bucks and it's for thc so what they did 10 years ago when it was illegal to have hemp oil back then they found that by testing for cannabinoids cbd was much cheaper 14 so the drug test what they thought was well we know there's cannabinoids in the marijuana plant also let's just test for cannabinoids and that means they're taking marijuana if they have a bunch of cannabinoids showing up so what's happened is about 60 of all employers and labs have shifted away from testing for cannabinoids and are now testing for just the thc true marijuana and unfortunately about 30 percent of the labs still use the old method so my answer to your your person asking the question is it depends on the type of test that the employer is doing my advice to you is to quiz them question them on what they're doing or what the lab is doing and i guarantee your employers are saying i don't know i just hire this lab over here or i hire this doctor's office to do drug tests uh they don't know the details and the specifics of it so it's important to understand what they're testing for and then number two even if they are testing for thc if your body's metabolism is poor and you are taking high doses of hemp oil full spectrum headboard that has some thc in it it's possible very remote very unlikely less than three percent chance but it's possible the person could still trigger a thc test false positive granted but it still can be triggered okay um thank you next question is there an age minimum and maximum um what is that recommended age range and i'm specifically asking because one person asked if it's safe for her 91 year old mother well my mother is 80 years old and she takes it every day i know many elderly here's what's funny if you my mom is extremely religious and if the word marijuana came up you were a sinner you know in her mind right so what i'm telling you in their little church group she told me she took a poll and there's like 12 ladies who played bridge and all this eight out of 12 of them are taking cbd and they're all they're all in their 80s that's awesome so the whole attitude has shifted so here's what i'm going to say i don't know enough details about your 90 year old grandfather or grandmother but again it depends on medications and other things and give them a low dose it depends what they're taking it for right now we don't recommend it in children or pregnant women why not that we know there's a side effect it just hasn't been tested there's not enough studies on it so that's why we say no but i will tell you my youngest son uh is 15 and he was taking it when he was 14 for certain things granted his was a topical and just so we're all aware when you take a lotion or a body butter it goes on the skin you will not test positive on any drug test taking a topical because it does not penetrate the bloodstream so when you use a roll-on on muscles or near a joint the topicals will not trigger positive results on a drug test and topicals certainly will not cause harm to those on lots of medications you can put on the skin and just so we're all aware your skin has cb1 and cb2 receptors all over your body you have endocannabinoid receptors on your body on your skin which is your number one immune protector the the immunes your skin is an immune protector and it helps they a study just was released on february 4th of 2021 talking about the protective properties of hemp oil on the skin cells increasing uh the hydration and immune properties of our skin very informational um thank you for that um next question um can you build up a tolerance um for it to where then you would need to escalate your your dosage great question i think that happened to me um after taking 50 milligrams daily for probably almost two years now uh there were many nights i bumped it up to 100 milligrams my brain is going a million miles a minute so in the past a lot of times i would sleep for three hours wake up be restless now i sleep on rock solid five to six hours i'll still sleep another two hours a little bit off but i i get the best sound sleep i've ever had these last few years and it seems like as we get older we all seem to have challenges sleeping and that leads to other health problems if we don't get good rest so to answer your question is it possible you build up a tolerance it is possible i don't have enough studies though to comment intelligently so just pay attention to your body okay um some people are saying that the code is not working so could you just speak to that you have to register with synchronicity um and then use the code or so basically you just have to go to you know you enter the you enter your product and then you put it in your cart and then you put in the code and you have to kind of go to the very end once after you've filled out your billing information and then you'll see that code is applied okay so that's probably where a little bit of confusion is coming in thank you see what happens at the end okay um uh sorry dr cross any side effects from daily use so again if your dose is in that 25 50 to 100 uh milligrams a day uh the only side effects that we have ever had reported and i'm not kidding we have thousands of testimonies we ask was a little bit of some people talked about dry mouth in the in the morning they might get a little dryness in the mouth um other than that uh we have not had any reports and again we we've sold this to tens of thousands of folks okay i'm really sorry if i asked that twice i'm trying to judge 11 different things i'm sorry um hang on one second we'll we'll get to people's questions who's raising their hand i'm just trying to get through the some of the chat things um any research on um the addiction or dependency associated with pure hemp oil no um you know i think what you're going to find is a lot of people will say to you oh i tried hemp oil or i tried cbd it didn't work for me and i will say this again that person probably took a cbd isolate from a co2 extraction method meaning they just took cbd only and the dose was probably so low and if they bought it at a gas station you know god knows where that came from and even if there's cbd in the product the fda did a study two three years ago and they randomly selected i think it was about 80 different products off the shelf and it's unfortunate and embarrassing to tell you that about 20 of those companies in their products didn't even have half of the cbd listed or no cdd listed these are frauds and that's why i say to you you have to get a gmp certified company because it's all validated uh they follow the processes they're regulated um [Music] it's critical but back to the point no i've seen no studies on dependency um or tolerance buildup so i'm not saying there is or isn't the tolerance buildup i'm just saying that there's no studies yet okay but i'm aware of and then um is there a different approach for children one mom is asking her daughter is 13 years old weighs 100 pounds would you start her at 25 milligrams so great question so what i would do so this is what a tincture looks like and so it's a dropper and on the side of the dropper i'm going to hold it up to i'm going to squirt it there's the color here so do you see the numbers kind of on the dropper kind of yes you might see some numbers there so it's got one milliliter 0.75 my suggestion is go with the berry lemonade tincture and instead of doing a full dropper i would buy the 500 milligram not the thousand milligram for your daughter 13 year old therefore one full dropper is just 12.5 milligrams okay and all the information is on the back of the label and so my suggestion is just do a half a dropper of the 500 milligram very lemonade tincture with your with your daughter and see what kind of changes and i'm assuming no try uh no research yet on on children no studies have been done correct uh off the record i'm on the record you're all listening i know i know lots of people who give it to kids uh lots i i know uh of a teething baby that a mother put a one drop on her finger and rubbed it on the goons of the infant um [Music] just sharing that yeah okay um any concerns for anyone who has been through chemotherapy for cancer and and using cbd i'm assuming not since it's pure uh absolutely no concern as a matter of fact uh if you go to the nih website go ahead and type in cancer and cbd cancer post treatment and cbd there are a number of studies showing that those who have undergone radiation or chemo have incredible relief by taking cbd as a matter of fact there's a lot of research on that that many cancer patients uh take that it's not helping the cancer it's helping the the feeling the icky feeling uh after uh treatments okay and you do not need a medical marijuana card of course to purchase these products no you do not because it's not marijuana it's not marijuana okay um mr lopez yes did you want to ask a question soon is it possible to get a copy of that slide that showed the various websites for different parts of the body like the gi tract and so on that looked like a really useful slide i you bet i'll definitely make sure you get that yes if if uh dr krauss shares his slides with me i can get that out to everyone who has registered for the zoom tonight what i'll do is i'll convert the slides to a pdf because right now the graphics on the slide are so thick it won't be able to be emailed so i'll convert the slide presentation to a pdf and then you can give them access to the pdf okay wonderful thank you and also um for the people who came in late and asked if we are recording it and will it be available the answer is yes just give us some time to edit it and get it up on our website but we will be doing that um okay so and just no contraindications for people dealing with diabetes uh no they're diabetes you know we've got liver involvement uh we've got insulin involvement [Music] there's not studies on that but uh that's one of the cases that we need to be careful with if you have diabetes in taking hep oil there's not enough research but that's a kind of health condition that could have potential side effects okay and um so there's no need to register with your state if you're going to be purchasing or using hemp oil or ordering products they just come in the mail so here's the interesting thing every state has different laws on selling cbd so we're based out of colorado so we're selling out of colorado so when you go on the website you bought it from colorado we mail it in a box like this to your home um and the u.s postal service fedex and ups all have policies that they will deliver hemp oil to all 50 states no problem okay um and what product dr krauss did you say helped with your son's acne he applies uh two products he applies the body oil uh to his back so he had i mean he used to get teased that it was very emotional for me he the kids would call pete's face i mean he was just loaded with with acne and again i'm not making a claim here folks i need to be clear that this is me personally this isn't synchronicity making a claim that we treat acne i'm not stating that what i'm saying to you is my son uh applied the body oil to the body because his back was loaded with severe acne with deep pits bubbled up red and then on the face you use the facial cream it's in a jar like this and after about three months let me back up after about two weeks we noticed an improvement but dramatic improvement after about three months and he still applies it and my wife and i are just so excited for him because he was just you know harassed as a kid yeah so could you tell me what what is the difference between the i know the difference like you know um the physical difference but when do you use the tincture and when you use the capsules yeah so here's what i would say to you the the tincture and the capsule both have you know the same hemp oil in it just a different form factor slightly on the organic coconut uh one's kind of an mct coconut the other is more of a liquid so my point is the capsules there's nothing liquidy in the capsule it's hard inside the capsule um it's you'll look at it and you're going to say oh my god this looks green and maybe even a little black it's it's hemp oil it's hardened hemp oil with it with lipid coconut the tincture i showed you is a golden green you know if you see that right on my computer and you'll just put that in your mouth after i went to the dentist i switched that around because my shot had worn off i took three full droppers and holy cow pain 100 gone in five minutes so the tincture is fast acting because it's right in your body okay so if you take the tincture before you go to bed you'll want to take that like right before you go to bed whereas the capsules you need to take an hour before you go to bed okay because it'll take an hour before it starts to have an effect on you thank you so that's if you're doing it for sleep uh my daughter who went to grad school uh is in grad school her first semester in grad school her anxiety level was so high she was away from her boyfriend miles away from her boyfriend away from family all new people hardcore classes and i put her on 150 milligrams a day so morning uh rabbit she got up at 7 a.m took 25 milligrams of a tincture kept her relaxed wouldn't get full anxiety she took another tincture at one o'clock and then so it's 25 25 then she took 100 uh before she went to bed and she did that for a month and then i backed her down to 75 a day okay laurel i think roy has a question i was just missing the exact same thing raising his finger roy go ahead oh he might just have to unmute how big is the capsule um [Music] it's the 50 so we have two capsules a 25 milligram capsule and a 50 milligram capsule salem i don't know if you have one uh readily available but it's not a horse pill if that's what you're asking yeah that's what i'm asking yeah i have trouble with or spills yeah it's not it's not one of those monster horse pills okay good thank you yeah okay iris iris if you want to unmute go ahead am i unmuted now yes you are um did i understand correctly uh dr krauss that yours is the only company right now that's selling a full spectrum version no there are there are many full spectrum companies out there but our company is the only full spectrum hemp oil company that has dual certification the iso and 9001 gmp certification okay uh there are other full spectrum helpful but i will share this with you those other full spectrum hemp oil companies do not use the lipid trans process because we have a patents pending on that process so nobody nobody infuses the way we do it they use it so someone could still use a whole plan and be full spectrum but they still might use a harsh chemical to get all the stuff out and then they have to cleanse it and put it back in and my point to you is it's not all natural they've now adulterated the biochemistry of the cell wall so they still meet the definition of full spectrum but to me it's adulterated it's it's not the molecules aren't in their initial natural state so you have a pat you have a patented process a patent pending right now uh you know how the patent office works takes three years thank you because there's so many cbd products on the market and i've tried a few of them and they do have they do help me but i was just what um you're wanting to understand a little bit better the difference between what's out there now and what you are offering i'll share i can only share what others have said and that is they've taken a buddy one he's the i.t guy he's about 46 years old and he goes i've been taking cbd for years and because he does our computer system here uh i gave him ours he's a holy cow totally different and and to him he still took a 50 milligram and he was doing 50 milligram before but he said big difference so try it you know i i'm getting certified as an aromatherapist and it's very similar to with that in the aromatherapy field when the product is certified and they give you the list of the components in each oil and they sell it out for you and if it's not a good company it's adulterated and they won't provide that data do you so i find it very interesting and so you bring up a great point so on each box you can see what's called a qr code so you see that [Music] that qr code or you can just go to our website and pull up what's called a coa certificate of analysis so every batch that we do we do a coa and it tells you exact amount of thc and all the other cannabinoids and it also tells you the heavy metal testing uh we actually test for over 70 different pesticides because we have to meet california prop 65 rules in that state and so we do we spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on testing every year uh for purity potency and we also have an aromatherapy product that you might be interested in them too i saw that yeah we're coming to a close but i want to take a question one last question from beverly and then we're going to wrap but i just want to know while we're taking this last question um i have put my email address in the chat and if your question was not answered this evening please reach out to me and we will make sure that it's but beverly go ahead so in using a topical say for lower back pain first of all what product would you recommend and secondly would there be any adverse side effects to a patient who has say acid can cause any any side effects for that type of cardiovascular increased blood pressures things of that nature yeah great great question um so for the back pain you would get this it's the sports bomb i know your husband there probably isn't playing a lot of sports so don't let the word sports bomb confuse you but the sports bomb is is a very potent topical will not affect the heart or the blood system at all um so that's my recommendation to you is to use the sports bomb and then you would apply that to both sides of the back uh i can't my my plumber uh he's he's still working this guy's 70-some years old and he's still bending over underneath the sink his knees are killing him and i gave him this as a gift and uh now now he comes to my health hey got any more work i need another one of those you know it helps his knees tremendously is there any way of what about dosage as far as that though is there can you overdose no no way you can't overdose on this just read the instructions it says apply it two to three times a day you'll be fine no problem thank you is your capital considered kosher wow so guess what um we were about to obtain our kosher certification and they bumped up the fee by three grand and so we're going to get it um so i can't sit here and say we're coaches kosher certified it's on our list of additional certifications we are going to obtain but uh they jacked up the price on us so we we pushed it back on uh i have a lot of rabbis right here really good question really good question all right everyone elizabeth um i think we'll turn it over you to you to wrap up well i just want to thank everyone for being on the call dr krauss that was very very informative salem thank you for answering the questions that i would not have been able to answer so i think we got a lot done this evening if you have any further questions just email laurel and it's laurel at cmta usa.org and i hope everyone found this to be interesting informative and i wish you all a good evening and we had a great turnout we had over 200 208 we had about 208

womanity earth name sanctuaries hemp hero cbd line we're going to talk to you today about how to take our oil so in our bottles we have a 80 servings bottle and we have a 240 servings bottle and how that works is you take three drops under the tongue which is at least 10 milligrams of cbd and you let it sit on your tongue for two minutes you can look above yourself you can also to put it on your finger like this one two three and then put it under your tongue and breathe through the nose sit with the oil tune into it absorbing and relaxing the entire body really give yourself this time to just go into the boy meaning to not think about anything except you can think about your visions and your manifestations of what you are working on right now in this divine timing this could take five minutes out of your day it's really refreshing and rejuvenating it's the fastest way to get the oil into the bloodstream is under the tongue so you just let it sit for at least two minutes while you're doing that you notice you'll start collecting saliva under your tongue that's good you're going to swallow that but what it's doing it's like your oil is also too dialing into what's going on in your body and it's like you're creating an elixir with your own saliva your own dna with the oil so when you do swallow that oil that oil is going to go into your body and it's going to know how to work and we know this because of our primordial blends of what we make our oils with and such silver and since our daytime oils frankincense lemon black pepper on the way that we cultivate our hem flowers this is what helps our medicine work like this and that's why people get such results with our medicines because of the way that we process it which is unlike any other cbd companies out there the way that they are doing it it's very natural traditional um we keep it still spiritual which is very important because this is a live plant medicine that was brought on this planet to create the healings thank you so much and enjoy your oil and you can swallow now if you like it's been two minutes and try our nighttime oil with lavender infusion all organic no gmo chemical free oils thank you thank you", "dN9vdR3zMJs": "hey y'all okay i'm gonna jump i wanted to jump on here really quick because um i've been getting so many questions about um my hemp oil that i've been taking and that i've been sharing with you guys a lot of people will say um you know you'll say oh i've tried cbd oil or i've tried hemp oil and didn't work for me and so i want to talk about that because it probably didn't and i'm going to tell you why so first of all a little background on um traditional hemp oils and things like that so hemp oil is not marijuana um it comes from a totally different plant so it's not like non-psychoactive um it doesn't get you high it doesn't um non-addictive it is not weed so then the other confusing part so here's the hip pretend this hand this is my hem pant okay so pretend this is a hem plant cbd is one part of it so there's a lot of different the whole plant does a lot of different things cbd is one part of it so and i can send you literature if you want some more information on that that um piece and see how it's broken down and things like that but what we have what i have and what i've been taking what i've been sharing with you guys is full spectrum hemp oil so that's the whole hand right whole hand hemp oil um that's not really what it's called i just made that up so why is this so different and why did i say earlier that you the what you've taken if it didn't work um or you didn't feel like it worked why it probably didn't so most traditional most of the hemp oils on the market hip or cbd oils on the market only absorb into your body five to ten percent at very very very best maybe fifteen to twenty percent and you're gonna pay a lot for that 15-20 so when you think when you've tried it and you're like you know i tried it didn't really i didn't notice the difference didn't work it's because your body didn't absorb it so what is different about q what is different about our fuse oil so our full spectrum hemp oil has a technology called bioabsorb um bioabsorb technology allows this goodness to absorb into your body 85 your body's gonna absorb this 85 of this so when i'm telling you guys all these amazing things and how i'm feeling so great and um i feel so much better it's i'm not lying it's true i've tried different hemp oils and different cbd oils before and i didn't feel like i noticed a difference um so after i tried this i was hooked because my body's actually absorbing it i'm getting the benefits i'm feeling the benefits my family's feeling the bit of benefits my dogs are feeling the benefits from the pet oil that we have so if you've tried cbd or hemp oil before um i'm asking give another chance google um google whatever symptoms you have or whatever health issues you're struggling with that and full spectrum hemp oil and just look at some of the research um ask me hey this is what i'm dealing with could your oils help me a lot of our products have oils we have roll like rollerball roller balls um we have the oils obviously we have creams our skin care has um full spectrum pimp in it the benefits of hemp are insane there are so many amazing benefits and that's why i'm so excited to share them with you and because it's different y'all it is different than what you have tried and um so yeah that's a little bit more information about that i also have vitamin sprays and i'm going to do a video where i share all the products but i tried that earlier and it was like 35 minutes long because i'm so excited about all of these products um but i really encourage you to give it a shot um before you know you are looking you know first maybe some more pharmaceutical options or spending way too much on something that's not going to work for you because your body's not going to be able to absorb it reach out to me and let me share what i've learned with you about hemp oil um it is a daily thing that everyone in my family uses it is it has changed our life it has changed um my mood has changed the way i handle issues and deal with stresses uh i could just go into so many so many details with you about how amazing it's been but i want you to try it for yourself so um let me know if you want some more info we have three it comes in three different flavors um three different sizes we have i have samples i can send you um but whether or not you've tried hemp oil before you should give this a chance it's different all right guys have a good day", "duDofP7zie0": "hi my name is barb from green Papas and this is green Papa's premium CBD Otto 1,000 milligram full-spectrum full

to be coming to you guys sharing about supporting your health naturally and I am Kalina reborn for those of you who do not know I am a silver ambassador with two sciences I am a registered nurse board-certified holistic health practitioner and currently what they would call a candidate for my PhD in natural medicine I started that program about fourteen months ago and the greatest medicine to me is to teach people how to not need it and if someone wishes for good health one must first asked oneself if he is ready to do away the reasons for his illness only then is it possible to help them and this is from what we would call the father of Medicine Hippocrates and I have a graphic here of this human body with a balance because we want to bring balance back to our body when we are imbalanced that's when we start filling all these adverse symptoms all these symptoms at Plagueis on a daily basis whether that be inflammation fatigue anxiety depression irritable syndrome you know just all the symptoms that can come to us and so what we want to look for and what we want to create is homeostasis within the body so on this slide here you're gonna see a quote by dr. Sanjay Gupta and dr. Sanjay Gupta is a very well-known physician he's in the media a lot on CNN news you'll find various interviews with him on mine as well and he says the most frightening to me is that someone dies in the United States every 19 minutes from a prescription drug overdose mostly accidental every 19 minutes is a horrifying statistic and he later on adds as much as I searched I could not find a documented case of death from marijuana overdose so you'll see this little graphic here plant or poison what you're going to choose and so we're gonna go a little bit more in-depth and talk about planets 42% of CVD users or users of full spectrum pimp oil were able to stop taking pharmaceutical drugs in favor of cannabis so when a flower doesn't bloom you fix the environment in which it grows not the flower and this is a quote by Alexander geun-hye hair that's how I would say it in Spanish you're gonna have to excuse my half English and Spanish accents and I do live in Costa Rica so when you look at this graphic you've got two paths that you can take here you know which one are you gonna take are you going to take the path of supporting your body and your health with plants or are we going to take the path what I call poison and when you actually look up the word pharmaceutical and its original and connotation and lineage of language you will see that the pharmacopoeia and has to do with poison so the person you takes medicine must recover twice once from the disease and once from the medicine so when we're taking medication we think we're treating a disease but then we also have to recover from the medicine because our bodies were not created to react positively to pharmaceutical medications that are derived synthetically um and it's honestly not a matter of should I supplement but what should I supplement with you know supporting the biological systems of our body is crucial to our overall health this is a picture of dr. rafael miss Yulan and he is the what we call the father of cannabinoid medicine he has a PhD from Hebrew in the University in Israel he is a physician who discovered the first endo tchen at annoying AEE in 1992 okay he has published over 350 science papers so he is a very well-versed well published physician and he actually defines the human in though cannabinoid system is a network of receptors throughout our body that controls some of the most vital functions I can't list all the conditions affected by this cannabinoid system that we each have in us because there are too many ok so let's talk biological systems you know when we're in school we learned about the musculoskeletal system the respiratory system the cardiovascular system a gastrointestinal system but what we probably didn't learn about you know for all of us that are better here tonight or adults is the endo cannabinoid receptor system well guys this is a biological system that we were born with just like all those other systems so I can see here I mean we've got respiratory digestive injure can exocrine sensory renal nervous reproductive cardiovascular musculoskeletal lymphatic and there you go the endocannabinoid receptor system so we do all these things to support all those other systems of our body so what are we doing to support the endo cannabinoid receptor system ok so this is a diagram of the human body and I want you to imagine well all of those little dots that are displayed on this graphic those are endo cannabinoid receptors ok so you can see they are located everywhere throughout our body we have a very large concentration in the brain a large concentration in the reproductive area and a large concentration in the stomach area and not only do we have all these internal receptors of endo cannabinoid receptor system but we also have them on our skin as well so as you can see there's the brain these receptors in the brain ok they have to deal with the brain plasticity or memory depression anxiety our way of thinking you know how reactive are me to different situations we have receptors in earth that are attached to our immune system or appetite or mood hormones discomfort pain levels and our sleep patterns you know do we suffer from song me and I just really want you to imagine that all of these receptors in your body are like test tubes okay so their test tubes that need to be filled yes they go back one okay so supporting these receptors okay this is not at all a comprehensive view of what filling and supporting these receptors can do but it will give you an idea of a few things that can happen when we actually support the body with cannabinoids from the hemp plant so this graphic right here shows some disorders that CBD which is actually one cannabinoid of plants can actually support so you'll see my groans migraines multiple sclerosis fibromyalgia depression epilepsy breast cancer there are so many clinical studies out there I mean to date there are over 1,600 clinical studies that show and what the different cannabinoids can do for the body via the research can help with menstrual cramps rheumatoid arthritis diabetes osteoporosis testicular and prostate cancer runs disease along with your bowel syndrome asthma hypertension and look at all of the disease processes dealing with the brain like Alzheimer's glioblastoma is Parkinson's and ALS and PTSD like I said this is not at all a comprehensive list of things so these this is what the endo cannabinoid receptor system controls okay this you see this graphic right here we have all of these plants in our body and the pancreas and the adrenal glands our kidneys our ovaries I mean this is incredible what this system can do and how it can support us it is literally our biological system that is our body's primary tool for maintaining that homeostasis keeping things balanced when the within the body and it is the largest neurotransmitter system within our body and it's actually present in all vertebrates so like your your dogs and your cats they have this system too they have this Dindo can happen your system built within their body and it actually controls our most vital life functions okay so within this graphic right here you have all these little circles and underneath these names you have C D 1 and C B 2 okay these are receptors that are within our body so that previous graphic that I showed you with all the little dots within the body those were the receptors those are cb1 and cb2 receptors so what do they control well the cd1 receptors they were going to control everything in the brain okay tyroid are upper Airways our liver adrenals ovaries our uterus prostate and testes okay the cb2 receptors are actually going to control and then functions with the eye summit heart pancreas diet digestive tract and bone okay so how do we support this biological system you know how do we and get our body in a better homeostatic place and when we are dealing with that and economically receptor system and the best way to do that unless you are munching on I'm some marijuana salad every day which by the way you're not going to absorb a whole lot of that is full spectrum Lynn Boyle and full-spectrum cam oil can boost and support this internal system and hemp actually has the highest amounts of CBD once you guys to really hold on to the fact that CBD is just one cannabinoid found within the hemp plant the hemp plant actually passed over 80 cannabinoids and it is actually 20% of that plant so CBD actually is 20% of the hemp plant while marijuana and CBD is only 10% about alright this is something I really wanted to kind of touch on for a minute is this perception versus reality um I hear so many people say I can't take that you know I I'm from a very conservative area they're gonna think I'm crazy they're gonna think I'm smoking weed or that I'm eating meat or whatever that misconception might be and here's the confusion cannabis okay Kemp marijuana they are both cannabis that they are two different species of cannabis so we have hints which I already mentioned contains 20% and more of CBD but it contains less than 0.3 percent THC okay it's it's a really important part because THC is what can make somebody high it's that psychotropic effect well Ken because less than 0.3 percent of that so you look at species 2 which is marijuana okay marijuana contains 10% we're a little bit more of CBD but it contains more than 20% of THC okay so THC again that is it can have an weight that has those psychotropic psychoactive effects okay a product a full-spectrum can't is not going to get you high for that stone feeling it is not intoxicating it's not addictive and it is not a controlled substance now marijuana and it's extractions are controlled substances in most states what does hemp oil feel like it is different for every single person because it depends on what your body needs what are your biological needs you know it could be the absence of feeling anxious or stressed the absence of like being super nervous the absence of irritability sleeplessness the absence of discomfort maybe it's the absence of GI issues maybe it's the absence of those menstrual cramps whatever it is it's going on in your body it could be it taking a full-spectrum hemp oil like this is going to give you the absence of that so just really kind of think about that okay let's get down to the important stuff how do you choose a hip product this is something that I cannot stress enough and of educating yourself about this educating others about this this is something that I truly have been digging into for the last ten months and this is something that I found super interesting before I ever even found Q Sciences the full-spectrum products that they have to offer people a little backstory on that I learned so much in my research that I quit using hemp products because of some of the things that I'm going to share with you the fact that I wasn't absorbing very much of it the fact that I knew that it wasn't stable and that there wasn't a product out there that I could find that met all of these things that I'm about to talk about so we're going to talk about a full spectrum oil you want a whole spectrum oil where is it source how is it extracted is it stable and what is its bioavailability you have to know the difference okay so we have full spectrum pimp oil what is it what is it not something that it is is it's an industrial oil that has been refined and purified without destroying the medicinal and healthy cannabinoids the flavonoids the terpenes the fatty acids everything that is can be extracted from that full plant we want that is a full spectrum hemp oil what it is not it is not marijuana it is also not hemp seed oil guys if you see something being marketed as hemp seed oil it has no medical benefits to you except for the fact that it's an amazing Omega just like olive oil or avocado oil and it is the equivalent of that pure CBD oil there's no such thing if you're just getting CBD you have actually extracted it so much that you are not getting all the full benefits you are also it has to go through a lot of chemical process a lot of processing to get just the CBD part and when you see something that's just a CBD oil and that can be considered an isolate that means it's just one cannabinoid and you do not want an icing isolate or a distillate or a synthetic you want full-spectrum you want as many of those cannabinoids as possible because it's clinically proven that a full spectrum hemp oil is actually ten times more effective than an isolate alright sourcing where is it source from okay with cue sciences we are we are seed recede to to bottle arm to see like we we've got it all we are certified organic and industrial has actually grown up to 20 feet harvested every sixty to ninety days it's grown outside sorry plugin case and marijuana is actually grown six to nine feet and it's harvested every 120 days and mostly grown inside so you want seed to sell okay like I was saying ours is certified organic and it is comes from a certified Kentucky hemp farm and we are completely compliant with all US pimp laws and it's really actually a harder than you think to find companies that can provide you with that documentation extraction how is it extracted you want an oil that is using supercritical co2 extraction it is really the only way that you can get a full spectrum oil without destroying all those good components that I previously mentioned like the flavonoids the terpenes the fatty acids and as many cannabinoids as possible so what supercritical co2 extraction is is it's a carbon dioxide under high pressure and extremely low temperatures to isolate preserve and maintain the purity of that medicinal oil and some other methods that you might see or chemical stripping where they're using ethanol and you chain one specific brand that does this is there it is farms and what happens is you are getting isolates to slit or you're losing a lot of those full-spectrum properties and that synergistic effect that your body can receive when you're using a full-spectrum product stability okay this is probably one of my biggest ones to talk about this is something that nobody else talks about stability avoiding that nutrient fallout avoiding the fact that things can convert it not bottle so what you'll see is most companies are using liposomal technology or they are using nano emulsion technology and so why presumable technology means that they are taking the pen and they are adding it with an oil like MCT coconut oil you'll see some that are using hemp seed oil and they're mixing not together the reason they're doing that is because native hemp oil native hemp that is mixed with nothing else is proven to not be very absorbable it's absorbable at six percent or less so their thought is to add it with this carrier oil to make it more bioavailable and while it makes it a little bit lower bioavailable it makes it not stable it's not going to be stable in hot and cold conditions it is going to be affected by the stomach acid in the stomach and it does not have a very long shelf life at all so think about it in transit when it's being shipped to the from the warehouse to your house in the summer like you know it could be a 92 degrees outside and what's happening to your oil or it's in your purse and you first got left in the car or you're at Ronald's house and she always keeps her house at 82 degrees and then the Nano emulsion technology again very problematic and not stable at above 80 degrees as well so Q scientists water-soluble pin oil in its 22 nanometers in size and it's stable and has a shelf life of two years plus for stability it is not affected by stomach acid it is stable in hot and cold conditions you can put it in ice cream you can put it in your coffee you can put it in your 98.6 degrees and the stability of it never changes something that you can look at especially if you already have a oil in your home take a look at the bottle and if it's just keeping a dry cool dark place shake before use this is why and this is just a huge key key difference in all of the other oils out there today there is not another full spectrum hemp oil on the market that has mist ability that use as none of the others are stable and so what can happen if you just ingest an oil that is not stable so I'm going to give you a real-life example I have a friend who has purchased a very well-known brand and for a while and tested positive for THC on multiple occasions this is a company that mixes their full spectrum with fractionated MCT coconut oil and this is also a company that provides third-party testing so you can see what's in your bottle and know that your THC content is less than the 0.3% so one would think this person should not test positive for THC well on multiple occasions this person did and it is because that bottle is not stable and you have been a benign THC a which is the raw acidic form of THC it is not psychotropic it is an amazing NAV annoyed with many health benefits but if it reaches a certain temperature granted it's a very warm very hot temperature but if it reaches that temperature that THC a can convert to THC so now you have a bottle that has or you have ingesting something that is now higher levels of THC than what showed on that certificate of analysis bioavailability this is the absorption okay like I mentioned before native full-spectrum and oil in native CBD oils that are not mixed with anything else or proven over and over again in industry they're only absorbed at about 6% okay so that's like taking a bottle and chunking 94 percent of it on the ground and only using 6 percent of it because your body can only utilize and do anything with that six percent and the onset of action for those is about 60 to 90 minutes so like the example that given here is going to get gas pouring 90 percent of the gas on the pavement waiting for an hour and a half to start your car that is initially the comparison here and and for teeka coconut oil or other emollients like hemp seed oil or olive oil and people say can double or triple that absorption and that is questionable because we did a clinical study and it showed many of those brands still only observing at six six to ten percent and that was with checking the flat the plasma blood level at the CBD and so this is I'm showing you right here with this graphic that standard full-spectrum cam oil is only absorbed at six percent chain so when the cube views on a full spectrum hemp oil we had clinical testing we had a clinical third-party clinical study three of those done two on humans one on animals because again our cats also have this biological endocannabinoid receptor system and means support as well so it was proven that it was at a minimum absorbed at eighty five percent that was tested by blood plasma levels it also showed that our onset of action um was around 15 minutes so a lot lot faster and you know so just for example you know you have a thousand milligrams oil from from somewhere and if it's only absorbed at six percent that means there's only 60 milligrams in that entire bottle that your body is going to be able to utilize and you know you can I can share with you the documentation that describes what kind of technology the accused oil is we're using bio absorb technology within micelles and replicating what our body does in the absorption process and can also share with you the clinical study that shows this data um testing this is a super super important you will find companies out there that are not doing third-party testing and if they're not doing third-party testing how in the world do you know what isn't that bottle so every single one of our products on the box are either on the actual container itself is a QR code like on the top of the certificate here you can scan that with your phone what will come up on your phone is this product test here that you can see on my screen you can click on whichever batch and code yours is and then you will see this certificate of analysis that looks something like this it breaks it down to the cannabinoids and exactly what is in that bottle here we go I forgot my little cool effect here the third-party testing and a certificate of analysis another thing that I have noticed with companies when I have wanted to compare things is it has been an act of Congress to get this third-party testing or when I asked for it or you go to their website and literally there was nothing on there for the last year and a half so this is what we call the hemp movement first thing we have here this first graphic is hello that system was discovered this system that god blessed us with has been here forever we just didn't know about it until 1992 now we have tons and tons of research like I said there are over 1500 clinical studies you can pull them up they are available to the public results and we're getting the legal experience so you know we have that farmhouse bill that has approved this in all 50 states it is it is on the news everywhere there is a need for it all of us need it and literally it is the next cash crop so support the endocannabinoid receptor system this is what I support mine this is what my family uses q sciences currently right now is offering cinnamon and mocha that is our full spectrum and oil it is 400 milligrams in the entire bottle we don't need a thousand milligrams because remember we're absorbing a minimum of 85 percent of that currently right now our mocha oil is for kids and it is sweetened with sucralose very very soon we are going to be releasing releasing a full spectrum hemp oil that has no sweeteners no flavors at all and that will replace our mocha and be our pet friendly one you're also going to be releasing a very berry flavor and and everything is certified organic and this particular graphic right here does not have that labeling on it but it will and our stabilizer is going to be colloidal silver so for all of you out there who are health fanatics like myself you know how amazing that is and we currently have roller balls so we have pain relief these are that has all of our full spectrum hemp oil but the bio observed technology has the same milligram egde in that bottle but is mixed with certified organic essential oils so the pain relief one is obviously to address pain the relax is more for a calming effect and to help you relax maybe before you go to sleep or in a stressful situation and then the defend that one is for immune boosting and support it has amazing essential oils in it for that like oregano oil and then we have our rest file which again is our full spectrum oil mixed with other things to induce sleep like lavender and I believe kapustin is one of the Larian route I'd have to look at the ingredient list again and then we have two different hemp creams we have a cute renew cream which is I mean can be used anywhere on the body it is to help alleviate pain but then we have the excel which takes it a step further it has all the same ingredients of the renew but is enhanced with the menthol IcyHot effect and extra components that are specific for inflammation so components like arnica is something that is in that and then we have just recently really released our full-spectrum protein shakes we are the only company on the market that has a full-spectrum protein shake within that protein shake you're going to have pre biotics your BCAA so your branched chain amino acids and it is it's phenomenal it's really like three to four products in one so these are just all these are just different ways that we can support that endocannabinoid receptor system right we've talked about pimp we've talked about supporting that biological system and I really want to touch on on supporting our other systems this is in no way extensive of everything that Q science has to offer but me as a practitioner I love their product line I love the ingredients I love the science I love the clinical studies that support that these things work so our main pack that we have is aq core q max you can buy these products in that Q for Q max separately that I highly highly recommend it as a whole because it truly supports the core functions and the core systems of your body so the Q max is our multivitamin it's not just a multivitamin is a micronutrient mineral nano chelated multivitamin it is completely methylated right now we are releasing an enhancement of that Q Max and we will be the only product that has completely methylated b6 so you have your methylated folate your methylated b12 and your methylated b6 it is amazing it is amazing for prenatal health it is and we have children that use it there are clinical studies that support its effectiveness for brain and mental health disorders our Q biotic is a 12 hour time release probiotic it literally is going to supply your microbiome with the bacteria that it needs and help to fight that Candida that can be in there so Candida can offset the balance of our GI system and really truly our entire body and so there are by having that 12-hour time lease probiotic you are able to then absorb as much as possible because it's not going to be killed by the bacterias in your stomach and literally when we are feeding that micro our microbiome and giving and providing our body with the bacteria that we mean it can literally help push out that Candida then we have our Q Omega which is a plant in Mary 10 based Omega and it's actually being enhanced at the moment as well and it's going to have an increased amount of D and a e amazing support for brain health and also for inflammation and skin issues then we have cute prime just also being enhanced and is going to be a layer called to align it is for your vascular system it is to help reverse damage that can be done to the lining of your vascular system it is also the supplement that is going to aid all those other supplements to be able to travel in your body to the most inner depths so that you can be able to absorb and get the most of the supplements that you're taking the q aline enhancement has so many natural herbs being added to it that are anti-inflammatory inflammation is a cause of disease inflammation causes disease it causes so many things to happen in our body and to create where we are not balanced and we are not in a stasis so I'm super excited about that one vitalize we have a men's idolized women's idolize these are adaptogenic herbs they are literally where you can have a woman who is going through menopause and a woman who is of childbearing years their hormones are not the same at all their bodies need different things and when they can each take that supplement and those adaptogenic herbs are gonna help their body become more balanced help their hormones and meet their body's needs when they H need it it's going to support that the adrenal glands it's going to support the reproductive system I I can't stress enough how amazing adaptogenic herbs are then we have vitamins phrase okay vitamins phrase are amazing they are sprayed sublingually so you have that an instant absorption of b12 methylated spray a vitamin d3 spray which actually has 5000 units per dose which a lot of women take prescription vitamin d3 I know my mom was able to replace her prescription with this one and we have a relief spray that has amazing herbal components that bring down inflammation IQ boost spray which has comeon and other natural agents in it that are for blood sugar regulation and to help with with appetite so our diabetics do really well with support from that supplement we have a cue sleep spray everybody everybody's like any more sleep spray any more sleep sprite again everything all natural to to help support the body with all those different things we have nutritional support and we were about to release a line called cue trim that the basis of it has clinical studies and that are it's going to support blood sugar it's going to be able to support the body in losing my train of thought here supporting the blood sugar you know helping us to you know not overeat but it's not something that's going to make you not want to eat because I am a major proponent of health and starving yourself is not the way to do it and we are also reformulating our protein shakes that we have a line that does not have this full-spectrum hint and those are true meal replacements so not only do you have these products but when you purchase these products you get nutritional support from our nutritionists on staff with meal plans that are broken down into macronutrients so if you have somebody who is wanting to lose weight for somebody who's needing to gain weight they are able to help them and support them and help them with their body's goals and their health needs again along with that comes the exercise support and meeting that person where they need and the support to help them accomplish their health goals and then our skincare line we currently have a supplement that's absolutely amazing it's a cream as collodial silver in my house it has replaced the neosporin dr. band it is hands-down amazing and super cheap and then in June we're going to do a soft launch of our full-spectrum film skin care line that will be certified organic and it will only have five ingredients in it like the cleanest skin care on the market and not only that you know all those blue light things everybody are talking about everybody ran the glue my classes being concerned about the damage to their skin from the blue lights from our computers or phones or devices TV at night well this will be the only product on the market that will help reverse that damage and actually block the blue lights so that is something amazing coming so we kind of started with this picture and I kind of want to end with this picture which path will you choose okay are you going to choose the plants or the poison like what how do you want to support your body and it trust me I get it there there's a time in a place where people need Western medicine to come in and help with an issue but more often than not the one medication that you add is going to you're going to need five more medicines for the side effects that it's going to cause and so in choosing a natural route and most specifically with Q supplements that is what I am a obviously a major supporter of and there are two ways of purchasing and that's as a preferred customer and the second way is as an ambassador both ways we pay the same price there is no reason to join as an ambassador unless you want to share this with other people if you choose to be an ambassador because you see this health and hemp movement and that is really just taking place all over the world I mean it truly truly is and as an ambassador we are paying for different ways we are paid Commission on our customer cells we are paid monthly team commission on everything that's done underneath us from our customers and our ambassadors rank advancement bonuses but I love the fact that this company is all about financial freedom and being debt-free so when you start getting certain rates within the company you actually receive an debt-reduction bonuses that they pay to your debt of choice or a financial retirement name so this is just a this is a picture of the compensation plan we have places of business so q sciences was actually started in 2012 and they only did bulk cells to white coats so they were only selling products to physicians offices and practitioners and then in January of 2018 we transition to this compensation plan that you see here which is network marketing structures so it is a ground floor company opportunity but not a brand new company in the sense of nutriceuticals so we have the nutraceutical line and our full spectrum pimp line we are the only company that is permitted to sell by the only u.s. company that's permitted to sell hemp products in the UK in Europe and in Canada and just a little side note I'm taking a phytotherapy class right now and in that class I have had to learn the regulations of every country in the world and the Canada and the UK are they have the strongest least strictest regulations of anywhere in the world and our products are Health Canada approved and we have gotten the go from the UK as well and so that's just more affirmation that these products are top-of-the-line with very clean ingredients and since they were originally a company that only did bulk sales to white coats they maintained that as part of their compensation plan as well so we are actually able to do both sales with places of business so for those of you who may be practitioners or maybe a massage therapist and this is a great thing for you to incorporate into your practice too and also for those of us who are in the network marketing sector of it being able to share with places of business and then bibble being able to purchase the products put them in their place of business and bulk sales are actually sold cheaper than what you and I can actually purchase these for so if after this presentation if anybody is interested in talking more about the structure of joining this movement and then most definitely get with the person that invited you here and I just really want to close with truly thinking about investing in yourself ok your health is an investment it is not an expense and I have been there and I have I have been able to reverse lupus rheumatoid arthritis Hashimoto's and multiple connective tissue disease and I did that with my physicians and following me following those labs and seeing the transformation of me doing that naturally and getting off of the medications that were not sending me in the direction of hell but sending me in a direction of more illness and so this is truly what led me down the path of sharing natural medicine this is why I share what I share this is one of the main reasons and why I am partnered with Q sciences I wanted to find a company that truly has something to support our body and all these biological systems and not have to pull from 30 different places to find the products that I need to support my body and the products that I want to be able to share with other people and so it closed with knowledge this power to change your lives and someone else's life and I tell people this every day you know some people come on and they love the product or they want to see you know what else it can do for them before they share with someone else your story in my story or two totally different stories your story maybe be debilitating pain and you can take one dose but if I wait for my story of healing my gut or whatever it might be it might take a little bit longer we're each in different places for each big difference of symptoms but what if I shared with you that hey you can take this and it really could help you it could help that person now so last but not least I am a firm believer of treating mind body and soul and if you are not addressing the aspects of all three of those things then you or your body and your health is not going to be able to find that balance so just want to thank each of you for being here at this health event and any questions that you might have we are here to answer those and I'm super excited for each of you to start your natural health journey and to be on a path of reversing symptoms and being able just to put yourself in a better place you guys have a great evening you", "a05zDAb3-0g": "hey everybody Jennifer Dixon here with thrive yoga and wellness and I wanted to shoot a super quick video to talk about a brand new product that we just got into our hip store I'm super pumped because it is not only is it a Chattanooga company but it is also owned and run by one of my old old friends and so I'm so so pumped to be able to help him start spreading the news about the benefits of CBD and helping to carry his products it is called Bodhi life it is a full spectrum CBD they currently have two items that that they carry and we're going to have them both in studio this product is their tincture it's an unflavored tincture it is actually processed right here in Chattanooga - so that's really cool it's not just a chatting to own company it's a process right here in Chattanooga company and they use a what's called cryo ethanol processing to get it out so it's a it's a very efficient and it's it's kind of taking the best of the both worlds with an alcohol extraction keeping it very pure and it's a full spectrum oil so that means you're getting the entire plant so you get the CBDs the cbn tea a little bit the legal limit of the THC and it's in a carrier oil and MCT carrier oil it comes in a package that looks like this someone put it really close oh my gosh that's gonna be backwards for you guys because I had the camera showing to me so that might not be that awesome okay so I'm gonna have to pretend that you can read this backwards and so it comes in a little package it's got 250 that means if you take a full dropper full it's about 17 milligrams of CBD which is is a pretty good sized dose especially if you're starting out this is 15 ml so there's actually 15 dropper full so if you take one drop a day it'll last show that over two weeks if it's or if you take two dropper tools a day it will last you you know right there about a week it just depends how often you take it and how much you need to take is really really depends on your own personal have what your personal needs are to say the least okay so it comes in a box like this you'd have to open it up today the serving size they do suggest in one full dropper but if you're new to it you can start out with half a lesser quantity of it for each dropper fool I know me personally I usually take between seven and ten milligrams at a time I'm kind of a lightweight my husband on the other hand he he needs a little bit more like 33 or so each time he takes it so this one full dropper would be 17 milligrams and this is what it looks like it's a like kind of dark brown opaque bottle and then when you open it you'll see the little dropper and if you look at the limit get out if you look there's little delineations that says 1 ml and then point seven five point five one point two five and so that's a really great way for you to judge how much you're getting and so again if you take the full dropper full you're gonna get that 17 milligrams right now when I just did it I did one I squeezed the bottle to bring it in and it brought up about 0.75 milliliters hey guys thanks for watching so um it's a great way to be able to tell if I'm taking 0.75 you can kind of do the math one one milliliter is 17 so if you're taking about three-quarters of that you're gonna get what is that like 14 my math right oh my gosh math in my head that's so scary so I love how the the thing has how much are taking 0.25 point five because you can eyeball it and be like I think I took a half of it on this way you kind of know you're taking more like three-quarters of a full dropper and that was when I did just one squirt I guess I squeezed the lid a little bit and then pulled it out this time when I did a brought out the full one milliliter so you know one milliliter is 17 milligrams with this particular brand it tastes really mild especially compared to we have another alcohol extractive company here in the studio that takes a lot more like alcohol this one doesn't taste nearly as strong of the alcohol it tastes a lot more mild you still taste a little bit I think the the going the going saying is earthy if you're not taking a big taking it because it tastes good you're taking it because it's gonna help you to relax it's gonna help you to sleep it's gonna help you to experience all the benefits of CBD like pain relief and things like that so again make sure you stop by and try some of this we do have some samples here at the desk so ask for samples and I'll do another video here probably in a few days and talk about they also have a vape cartridge which is pretty cool too I can't wait to see it thanks for stopping by and don't forget we have some great stuff going on this weekend we have the free yoga in the park at here pitch park and that's tomorrow night at 6:30 and then KD from the river Yogi's is leading I think we have one more spot left if Amy hasn't taken it then there's two and that's gonna be paddleboarding out on the lake watching the sunset which will be really awesome on the 21st and then on Saturday we have the nutrition to help you thrive with Natalie base from connected Kyra's thank you so much for tuning in I can't wait to see you in the studio soon take care bye bye", "TlruiEjz3Vg": "do you know your medicine weed maps and sc laboratories bring you an educational series on the science of clean and safe cannabis today's cannabinoid profile is on cannabidiol [Music] cannabidiol or cbd for short is the second most prominent compound found in the cannabis plant a lot of the medical benefits of cannabis that are attributed to thc or other cannabinoids are actually due to the cbd content of the cannabis it has very strong anti-inflammatory properties and not only does it help suppress inflammation but there was a study that showed that it also helps the body to not make the chemical that causes inflammation so it actually has somewhat of a preventive role cannabidiol has also been found to have anti-convulsant properties in that it can reduce the seizure threshold for a number of patients i've had my own patients who have said that once they started using cbd-rich strains they have found that they have had less episodes of their seizures cbd is synthesizing the plant through the same pathways as thc cbc it starts out as german neopyrophosphate and alatolic acid those two compounds join together through an enzyme catalyzed reaction canogiborelic acid cbga is the starting material for cbda thca and cbca so cbda synthase if it's found in large enough amounts will take this canon gibberellic acid and make it into cannabidiol carboxylic acid which is cbda cbda is cbd with a carboxylic acid attached to it now with heat or through time this carboxylic acid will naturally release from the compound as it is very unstable and become cbd this process right here where we lose this carboxylic acid happens at about 80 degrees celsius a number of studies were done where they actually gave patients an overdose of thc to see what would happen when they then added cbd and cbd completely turned around the negative effects of an overdose of thc without changing the levels of thc in the blood so that means that cbd exerts its own medicinal just doesn't reverse thc it actually has its own medicinal properties cbd has been found to cause cancer cells to what we call commit suicide while preserving the normal cells and what appears to happen is it appears to bind to the receptors on the cancer cells which then induce the cancer cell to kill itself cannabidiol has also been found to be what we call biphasic in terms of sleep so at low doses it's what we call alerting it kind of keeps you awake at higher doses it can be very sedating and cause you to sleep but what's nice about that is you can control whether or not you are alert or you're feeling tired when i started testing cannabis about two or three years ago we saw virtually no high cbd plants almost every plant we tested was high in thc anywhere from 10 to 20 percent thc with some outliers on either end some plants would have maybe one percent cbd at the max one and a half percent cbd at the max now that we've been testing for a while we see anywhere from eight to fifteen percent cbd and maybe five or six percent thc will be strained some strains we get a 50 50 ratio it can happen in in all different ratios but what it is it's a recessive gene in plants so we have breeders have to actively go and try and breed this back into these plants and find these high thc plants that might have that high cbd gene locked away and and breed them together and see what they find and really the only way you can know if it's high cbda is testing with testing and and growers or breeders having access to that knowledge base we see them coming back and reversing some of the trends of the last 30 40 50 years and breeding the cbd back into the plants now there have been a number of studies that have looked at cannabidiol cbd exerting a protective property to damage neurons and it appears that in the studies cbd protects the nerves by inhibiting the process by which nerves are damaged cbd has also been shown to protect against a brain injury when patients or lab animals have had a brain injury cbd appears to protect the brain from damage that occurred to the nerve cells the studies have shown that it can actually fight mrsa which is methicillin-resistant staph aureus a notorious bug that is resistant to a number of antibiotics a topical application of cannabis was able to fight the infection and the mrsa was eradicated from that infection site sc labs tests for cbd with a high performance liquid chromatograph also known as an hplc there's two different ways you can test for cannabinoids it's either with an hplc or with a gc if you hear someone testing with other methods it's probably not a scientifically validated method but with the problem with the gc is is that the gc uses heat to test for these these cannabinoids and as i said earlier all the acidic cannabinoids are very sensitive to heat so the gc can give you no information about the acidic cannabinoids it can only tell you about the non-acidic cannabinoids the heat is decomposing these compounds it's definitely decarboxylating all of them and you're trying to measure it as these compounds are in a state of flux and that's just it it's kind of fuzzy so we use the hplc because it keeps the cannabinoids in their natural state they're in their liquid state there's no alteration there's no heat or anything like that happening and so we get a much more accurate and a much more realistic picture of what's actually in the sample that we're testing one of the important things for people to understand about cannabidiol is it is not psychoactive that means it does not change your mood your mentation the way that thc has psychoactive properties and can actually cause what we call the high cbd does not do that for patients who are not interested in the thc effect but are interested in the cbd effect this is a terrific choice for them to have", "ai6_o3qCy-k": "yeah so I used this product it's amazing it helps me sleep I was surprised and how it helped me sleep for the first time in a very long time I slept through the whole night and even wake up once I woke up I throws the middle side that's how relaxing it was and I haven't taken it every day it slashes me about 2 weeks and I can't be happier here for more", "PjyIomI_ijk": "using CBD oil for anxiety miracle cure hype stay tuned and find out [Music] my name is Douglas Blanc I'm an author and depression survivor welcome once again to your depression recovery channel where each week we talk about practical tools and coping strategies for healing from depression anxiety well today's title the video is CBD oil for anxiety miracle cure or hype before we find out of course we have to tell our joke and I was gonna be one that I thought was pretty good but Jerry my videographer liked this particular one so this is for all you history buffs out there what do they call a history book about cars an autobiography we both like that all right so let's go to our subject here which is anxiety and a while ago and maybe you're so I did a publication of a video called which is worst depression or anxiety oh my god I mean they're both horrible aren't they but a lot of you chose anxiety and I can see why because when you're anxious severely anxious over time you become disabled you can't do your regular routines you can't go out meet with friends work and pretty soon you're not accomplishing anything and that can be very depressing and so I anxiety often turns into depression however unlike depression where you can have in a depressed since which you can take for a long period of time those of you for whom they work anxiety medications known as benzodiazepines or habit-forming or can be and you can create dependence with them so as a result many psychiatrists these days are reluctant to prescribe them thus I became intrigued when some of my group members told me that they were using something called CBD oil to bring down their anxiety I thought well this is interesting so before I talk about my take on it I just wanted to give some basic definitions of what it is so CBD oil is a natural compound found in both the marijuana and the implants and because it contains less than 0.3 percent of THC which is the psychoactive component of marijuana you can't get high from it so unlike smoking pot when you take CBD oh you don't feel anything now the story behind CBD oil is quite interesting it burst on the national scene in 2013 there was a six year old girl named Charlotte Figi who in Colorado and she suffered from Ola rare form of epilepsy called Gravette syndrome and she was having multiple seizures in fact 300 grand mal seizures a week it was eating up her brain the parents were desperate nobody knew what to do and then someone suggested using marijuana and because medical marijuana was legal in Colorado at the time they found a grower and they got a strain that was very high in CBD oil and very low in THC and they gave it to the girl the doctors were quite skeptical but sure enough the seizures stopped first for an hour then for a week and pretty soon the girl was healed so now I think she's 11 she maybe only has two or three seizures a week and most of them in their sleep so this this strain of marijuana CBD was called Charlotte's Web and it's now famous and there's a bunch of brothers in Colorado six of them who had developed a foundation where they give this away to people who need it and it's a wonderful thing they're doing because you know in a lot of places people can't afford it so good for good for Charlotte and good for a humanity that this substance was discovered the next question we're going to cover is how do you take CBD oil well it's taken by mouth and it comes in many many forms when I took it it was a tincture but you can also use pills chewable gels vape cartridges cream on your skin and foods like chocolate that's how marijuana is often delivered - well remember marijuana brownies anyway the amount and quality of CBD oil and these products can vary greatly so the next question I want to address is is CBD oil addictive well no not pure CBD but many of the products also have THC in them as a matter of fact and the research i've done talking to the pharmacies in oregon and washington they tell me that a ratio of nine part CBD to one part THC is very helpful because the THC potentiates or increases the power of the CBD oil now if you're taking something like that and there's THC you might be affected so the key is to know what you're taking and what percentage of CBD THC it is but if you're just taking pure CBD well derive from the hemp no addictive properties and again no soy no psychoactive properties so the next question that comes up is what conditions can CBD L treat now if you remember it became famous or you know became used initially because it helped this girl with the seizure syndrome called Tourette syndrome epilepsy and sure enough it's been researched there also for pain my brother takes over pain inflammation believe it or not psychosis and also it helps people supposedly break the addiction to of cigarettes and drugs like heroin methamphetamine cocaine because it relaxes the muscles and gets people no more less anxious state so people are investigating CBD oil for a variety of conditions nothing definitive has come yet but I know do know people who did take it for pain and a nurse I know it was quite involved in in the alternative care industry here in Oregon says that a lot of her patients take it for pain okay so now we finally get to the topic in the video or the main topic which is CBD well and anxiety now when I first heard about this connection I hooked on myself well this makes sense because CBD oil is an anti-seizure medication as we saw in the case of charlotte and klonopin which is a benzo that I used to take it essentially saved my life even one of my episodes is also an anti-seizure medication so klonopin and anti-seizure medication helps with anxiety CVL and anti-seizure medication should help with anxiety well here's the testimonial money'll from oh one of my group members who first turned me on to it he she said um I've been using see video orally for a year now I've been experienced quite a lot of anxiety due to stressors in my life I was having a hard time sleeping I started to take a dropper full of bedtime and again if needed when I woke up too early in the morning the CBD oil greatly reduced my anxiety and had a nice side effect or side benefit of reducing joint pain as well I've never felt groggy in the morning after taking it I highly recommend CBD oil this is one person who obviously worked for now I want to bring up my particular case so in June of 2000 and 17 last year visiting my brother in New York unfortunately has chronic pain by the way for you any of you out there who are dealing with pain I'm going to be doing a video on depression and chronic pain because as you imagine that's a really bad combination anyway he was prescribed in New York medical marijuana is legal so he was prescribed this by his physician and he ordered this stuff on the internet but it had a strawberry tent he didn't like the taste it was a hundred eighty bucks I said wow that's a lot of money he said no you take it I'll get I'll get a different flavor so I took it home back to Oregon and one night I woke up and late morning or 4:00 in the morning as they often do with you know anxious discrimination my heart was beating rather rapidly and normally I just lie down there and breathe and try to calm myself down but this time I reached for the dropper you know put it under my tongue took about two drops and I start to notice that my heart rate went down slow down and it's my heart race slowed down I felt more relaxed and my muscles were less tense and within about ten minutes I was back to sleep so it really took the edge off the anxiety and got me back to sleep a lot quicker than I would have had if I hadn't had it so fortunately I haven't had very many of those awakenings but when I do I have the the oil by my bedside to use in case it happens finally I talked with a worker at a local pharmacy here in Portland Medical Marijuana pharmacy and I he mentioned to me that he's been using CBD oil to replace an X the anti-anxiety drug he says at night it helps him ah breathe more easily relax the muscles of his chest and as he breathes deeply ah he can relax more and go to sleep he also said that some of his customers have used it to minimize the brain zaps that come when you come off antidepressants and also that they have used CBD oil to minimize the withdrawal symptoms when people take opiates after an operation so it obviously has many many uses so now comes the $64,000 question is how do you obtain CBD oil well first a good news if it just is derived from the hemp plant and has no THC as was the case with my remember you can get it in any state in the country us except for Idaho on Nebraska and South Dakota and they ban all marijuana even products coming from the hemp plant which which I said we're not psychoactive so most of us can get CBD oil over the internet or in various other places however if the CBD oil has some THC in it I mentioned that the THC helps to make it more effective then you can only get it in states where medical marijuana is illegal which i think is only four or five states so you're much more limited then but still the hemp derived CBD oil can be effective and you're much more likely to get that so in conclusion the purpose of this video was to describe my research and looking at the CBD oil as a treatment for anxiety and also for pain and I found that many people do use it effectively now this doesn't mean you should run out and get her I'm advocating you do it you should probably check with your prescriber or your doctor to make sure it's not going to adversely interact with any medications you've been taking however I did call the pharmacy right before I shot this and they said it what they tell their customers as long as you don't take the CBD at the same time that you're taking your other drugs maybe wait two three hours then there shouldn't be a problem but again the final authority is your physician well this has been Douglas block I hope you enjoyed this video I hope you gained something from it if you did so give it a like or leave your comment in the comment section as always you can email me douglas blog at gmail.com and i wanted to let you know once again

Karl sparazza on board certified in Family Practice and I hope first of all that everyone is safe with this covent pandemic I've been seeing a lot of anxiety and my patients and rightly so a lot of stress we're doing telemedicine instead of face-to-face contact yeah the world's changed and patients are asking me for different treatment options for anxiety and a lot of patients just are trying to avoid the pharmaceuticals so they're going the more natural route and one of the products that I found to be helpful for patients has been hemp oil and you really need the right product the comparison I make with hemp oil is that much like brand-name drugs and generic drugs they're not identical and the same is true with hemp oil so if you've tried hemp oil in the past and didn't get a favorable result maybe it didn't deliver the bioequivalence of the active ingredient that's supposed to be beneficial for you so I wouldn't give up on it make sure that you have to make sure that the product is organic that it's processed safely and most importantly produced and grown in the United States you want a product that's consistent one that's been cloned year after year so that there's consistency and product so that batch to batch it's gonna deliver the same equivalence so through the years of practice I found that perfect edge botanicals is one such company and I found it to be consistent and pure and helpful so I hope you find this beneficial of course talk to your doctor see if it's suitable for your certain condition and I wish you well and please be safe thank you", "3rM4OyOu39Y":

reigns Brian Reed founder CEO I wanted to show you we're always innovating new ideas new ways to create these products to be absorbed into your body what we've come up with which is a genius and in my world here I think this is an incredible idea so basically we have your standard tincture typically you get the dropper for the tincture what we've come up with is a spray top so what we can do is we're gonna send these out with your teen sure if you choose you simply remove the tincture it does have this little straw you're gonna have to cut that accordingly to get it the correct size when you receive it because they're sterilized so we don't want to obviously touch those we'll let you do that drop it in screw it on it fits perfectly on there just so you can spray it from there you can simply spray it into your mouth and that will spray into your mouth it will absorb in the glands in your cheeks under your tongue in the back of your throat and interest instantly go into your system through the blood-brain barrier and into your bloodstream and then of course into your brain so you're getting the effect of our product which is the point and again I always want to make sure that everybody is crystal clear this is not oil this is water and that's what set us sets us apart we're the only true water-soluble CVD company on the planet so this for me I'm always in a hurry I'm fumbling around with the tincture of the dropper we have come to get the dose which six sprays equals one ml so you can measure off of that if you want a full ml it's six if you want an ml and a half you can go nine if you want to it's 12 if you want 10 find what dose works for you this also works on the sleep it can also work on the pet so anything that we had you know if your pets you just want to spray it in their mouth if you think that's easier just spray it on their food things along those lines it's a new innovative way for us to just constantly give you new ways of taking the product and another way for us to set ourselves apart from all of the other CBD companies out there and I think innovation is important so this is just something that we've come up that makes things easier if you choose to use that if you like the tincture then continue to use that form as well thank you"}
