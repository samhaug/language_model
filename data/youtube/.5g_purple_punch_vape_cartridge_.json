{"TMteMpw4YCY": "what's good YouTube today guys 1-1 like alright before I get into this video I just want to say I drove literally over like I think close to an hour to go to verified spot where I could get this and I'm gonna go ahead and put that spot right here so you guys can to see like that it's legit so as you guys know heavy hitters right here it has a reputation it's been getting a really bad reputation because there's been a lot of counterfeits a lot of fakes and then you know a lot of bunk [ __ ] going around was like these these things have been sold on eBay the cartridges in the packaging for like five cents and you know people have been filling them with hot dog water man and then they used to be one of my favorite cartridges so you guys go back in my reviews I used to reviewed like five different ones of these and they were so amazing I remember everything all the time smoking them I'm just like do this this is the most enjoyable moment of my day you know so mmm let's get let's get straight into this man heavy hitters purple punch I'm sure you guys a close up I haven't opened it this is a brand new brand new packaging this is my first time getting a heavy hitters in over a year at least a real one so let's go get into here you see the heavy hitters purple punch alright let's go ahead and look at that oil man app that bubbles not gonna move that's huh that's one way that you know you'd see nope it's not moving Bo and this is the new packaging has the heavy hitters down there push to release purple punch it has the THC percentage cannabinoids all that good stuff and then so it says push to release and then I'm guessing you just pull okay no apparently not let's see push to release how hard do you have to push man I'm literally better break it doesn't want to come out it's probably cause of this sticker though let me give me one second guys so push to release right here and then boom you get out the packaging heavy-hitters is very very nice holographic super clean man get out of the packaging boom look at that beautiful oil dude wow this is what a real heavy hitters is supposed to look like none of that bunk ass [ __ ] moving as soon as you flip it upside down so get rid of that I'm not sure if a sticker supposed to come in here or not but I'm guessing not so get rid of that here's a packaging and then like that still hasn't moved still hasn't moved look at that amazing boy so back to the video main when you go ahead and drink some water shout out to hydro class keeping my water cold at all times you gotta stay hydrated it doesn't matter what what time of the day it is doesn't matter what are you smoking up you gotta stay high you're so heavy hitters I'm excited man whoa alright so I missed these tip I honestly like the tips these cartridges have to be one of my favorite ones they just look so clean man whoo I mean I don't even yeah I'm like a purple like a great kind of so first we're tried on the ooze battery man hopefully this thing works last time I tried trying on the Gras garden didn't work so sitting nice and flush these cartridges always stay nice and flush tell your truth that's why they have on the poems problems because some of the batteries they don't have these little openings right here to let the air go through so you have to keep it kind of loose but with this one it does have the hole so you don't have to worry about that so 3.3 volts and then let's see man let's see your cheers boy so you guys are 18 and over 21 and over y'all know the deal man Mich you guys are smoking along with me y'all all that good stuff let me know what you guys are smoking on if you guys ever tried a real heavy hitters let me know what your experiences it was with like what flavor did you like what flavor didn't you like and et Cie so yeah choose guys yeah right off the bat it has that og heavy hitters taste dude has that taste that like it tastes like piney and that's the signature of the heavy hitters in my opinion you know that little piney tastes like it tastes so nice and so like earthy and that's what I like tasting about this like the one other strain I think it's at the Northern Lights oh my gosh amazing dude this purple punch though so far I'm getting a very very hint of the purple punch like if he has ever smoked purple punch who whether it be from my the purple punches that I have some up from his jungle boys loud pack and bear farms so all dude purple punch is just like one of those flavors that's going around in a super popular but not a lot of people can perfect it you know they put fillings in it like when making consec concentrates especially they put feelings that make it taste like like you know like kool-aid stuff like that for example astiz II I'm not bashing on Suzi there are purple punch is amazing but it tastes too much like candy doesn't taste like you know wheat it doesn't taste like that good good man this punch this tastes exactly like they got a purple punch flower you know just squished it put some mother did their disel it and then mix it in with the distillate and then boom in a cartridge that's it it's very nice the cold filtered just I love the cold filtered on these man so like I said like I took two three hits and the oil still not moving there's still no oil no bubbles going up man this is definitely I'm happy I caught this man I'm happy like I went drove an hour away to get this man so off with the ooze battery we're gonna try it on the bat mod the one you don't really these are just pull and then screw it on slap it on there it looks pretty nice I just don't like that these are like super wobbly so yeah cheers guys so not too much power you get you get a lot of flavor not too much clouds I'm still don't I still don't get a hype and this is this is tested at 90 percent total cannabinoids so I mean I don't know though we we have to check that the website I might have to check at the website out after the video until you as if it's legit or not you know cuz heavy hitters lot also they had I think they had pesticide fails I'm not too sure about that I mean I was gonna use the bat mock but to heat up the oil but it looks like the oil is doing pretty good still no air bubbles so don't need it you guys didn't know this is the one that you put the little tubing around and it moves the wax on top so yeah put this back on the O's and then we're gonna take some hits off of 3.5 setting and then see what those are 3.6 get some heavy hitters in there alright so cheers guys I'm gonna do five to seven second pulls on this you would just just get try to get nice and baked so yeah it's pretty good for the most part I'm getting like some pretty decent hits off of this and the oil still you know just chilling dude still hasn't moved that's what I like to see it is moving a little slightly ever so slightly though and that's what you want out of a cartridge man I'm getting the the mellowness I'm getting everything it's a very very mellow it's not very too like strong in your face and that's kind of one thing that I've noticed about purple punches like when people make the Pens like I've never had a purple punch that hits me in my face you know it's always channel like subtle very mellow and this is it you know heavy hitters brings you just that but I feel like they for sure have I don't know I don't know if I can say they have the best purple punch but it is definitely talked to I would have to go back and see what concentrated cards have the purple punch like for example raw garden is killing it if you guys haven't seen my last video go check that out this one right here is the berry punch and it's amazing dude I got this one the raw garden so amazing this these guys perfect every single cartridge ever like their their cartridge like I mean I know I don't want to bring it in while I'm reviewing it disel it this is a refined light resident but you know the purple punch on these are amazing so get back to the review man we're gonna take one last rip and finish it out for you guys and then this is going up on Monday by the way so I hope you guys have an amazing week you know go follow me on instagram at back without if you guys enjoy the video so far if you guys are new here go ahead and hit that like comment and subscribe button so cheers guys yeah whoo it's a bit it's very very smooth dude that's one thing that I can say about it very smooth if he like I could probably take like 20 hits of this no problem it doesn't really have me coughing that much as like the raw garden usually does the raw garden has me freaking dying after I hold in for two seconds and but yeah it's a very nice I'm getting the very eyes are going down my head is probably starting it's starting to think freely and I'm just chilling you know that's kind of what you want out of a pen I already see I had to take a lot of hits to get there I mean I see they lower air bubble on top just kind of um opening up a lot more and that's probably just because the wick is getting waked up and but yeah man it's not bad it's definitely a comfort of the price that I got it for it's nice like I said I'm gonna put the dispensary right here and on the in the description below if you guys ever in the area and want to go check them out they have two amazing prices so yeah one last hit for you guys are for the boys for the boys and hold it how very very smooth like I said yes so overall heavy hitters um what I buy it again probably not and the only reason why I wouldn't buy it again is because heavy hitters were back in the time you know they were great they had their they had the competition on lockdown they had they were beating everybody that's just because there were so many people doing this you know doing this game and then now that there are so many other people's like you know like these raw guard and I'm I know I talk about them so much but they're just a perfect example because they bring for the perfect price in the perfect product into the table and then you know like heavy hitters you can either get it at a very low price like I did or get it at a very high price and that's kind of what a lot of people are doing right now because they're sort of scarce like around there is and it just sucks but yeah I definitely wouldn't cop this again you can easily get something better for equal price and yeah but unless you want to try something original something that's been around for some time you know you know like if you're new to the to the scene and you want to try something that's been around for a while I recommend definitely recommend going for these you know to get a get a taste of what people in five years ago we're tasting the four years ago or tasting you know and yeah it's pretty it's good it's a good smoke overall though I'm not gonna lie just my tolerance I'd I wouldn't want to buy it in so yeah heavy hitters eight out of ten I would say you know the high is a good 7.5 the taste is amazing I would eight point five and then you know the Terps they were there they were there there but like I said heavy hitters isn't very chirpy chirp central but yeah overall that's a good quality project I would buy it I wouldn't buy it again though you know we're just rambling at this point so I'm gonna go ahead and end the video

bell", "G-J0sfa4EuA": "well w2 this is AI style images with a quick like review on two of my most recent flavors of platinum tapes I've gotten the only one I'm gonna hit in the video is the first one I'm going to show you you know I can just talk about the other one you can't taste it I can recommend it for you but so the first one is a purple punch it's sixty five point five three eight percent THC zero CBD it's the new distill it cards color looks really good so I'll hit that one on my my palm battery that I reviewed in one of my last videos the other one is diamond doji 67.8% zero CBD and Sam's you did they're both indicas it's not what I wanted no first team is in hybrids versus you know getting couch locked and like passing out said I'm not passing out but falling asleep the purple punch tastes exactly like it says it's like a very berry sweet flavor I don't really get the grape as much same thing with the diamond I don't really get the citrus but I definitely get the earthy piney taste I know most people aren't gonna recommend platinum dates just because of all that crap that they were talking about with pesticides and all that I'm in the BET's VIP group talk about weed and cards and wax and all that [ __ ] all the time any time anyone brings out cards so many people are quick to jump on saying that they're garbage I haven't had an issue with him I've liked almost everything I've gotten but primarily just the weed flavored ones not their cherry pie dragon fruit cotton cane most of those I didn't like at all cookies and cream no no none of that [ __ ] for me um but you know they're quick to just dismiss him completely that they're crap I don't agree I like him but a lot of people like dank babes I've had a couple that were good and I've had a lot that are just crap I got two in my house right now that I'm gonna be getting rid of I don't like him strawberry coughed and the diamond doji in that I don't know if they're fake cards because I hear that there's a lot of those going around you know I understand like there's ways to tell you know look at the bottom look for this number look for that but people are smart people can come up with ways to put their own [ __ ] inside but with that aside it's [ __ ] whatever really I'm gonna hit it off my palm battery that I did review the last one got a couple scratches on it now from being in my pocket at work still big hits delicious X punched immediately I've charged his battery I think twice since I've bought it and once since the other video and that was just cuz I decided to just throw it on a charger but other than that I really do like these new plantain babes the claw fried wedding cake I've tried can't remember the name of it when I got the boxes inside but but I also do like the claw you know the battery setup for that the V fire pods you know I like a lot of it but you know can't be for 400 when it comes to these carts you know 25 per gram packs a punch taste good I do understand that personal opinion and everyone's got different tastes and flavors that they like so everyone's gonna be pretty biased towards the ones they like like I loved flavor X you know I used to stand by those big time and I started buying other ones and I haven't gotten any play direction probably for years now not because I don't like them I just didn't buy them but other than that that's pretty much all I wanted to talk about it's [ __ ] about some weed you know well I mean let you know that a if you haven't tried the new platinum dates and the new box colors and all that with the new flavors go ahead give it a try if you don't like a comment below tell me what you didn't like about it if you tried these flavors once again comment below you guys don't mind hit the like button and subscribe maybe videos will get better as time goes on I just still so new to this within the next hour - I'm probably gonna be doing a review on some headphones that I picked up really dig skull

this saturday morning cheers everyone nice tasty cartridge tell you what thc in this particular batch is 385 milligrams that comes out to 77.1 thc um 1.2 cbd i'm glad that there they listed the cbd even though there is uh such a little amount i mean it's over one percent but i'm very glad they listed it most companies do not as well as we're going to take a nice close up here of the cartridge itself a couple things i wanted to point out first thing has the clarity logo there right across the side you can see it there as well as it has the type of strain it is indica hybrid or sativa this is an indica so it says indica right there on the bottom i'm trying to get another focus on my face it wants to do that for me as well as i wanted to point out the color of this oil this is some nice golden colored uh distillate here very very uh opaque and nice looking oil i'll tell you what go ahead and get that screwed back on go ahead another rip cheers everyone [Music] oh very very tasty cartridge got a nice um i would say sweet floral peppery uh taste there as well as the uh the smell definitely represents that um it definitely reminds me of some like uh grape candy or like a sweet tart almost but it definitely has some like peppery uh notes there on the end but the main the main flavors on it i would say like a sweet flower or sweet candy flavor definitely uh enjoyable holds up to that purple punch name and i definitely think uh granddaddy purple and larry og made it because both of those are very sweet grapey strains so definitely did this well this cartridge had me feeling very relaxed and sedated um i would say this medication is perfect for a nice afternoon sesh or uh it's a great nighttime medication i would definitely say you wouldn't want to use this if you have things to do during the day unless uh perhaps is the mental health date you don't have much to do or you know you're taking a day to relax and uh focus on your own do some nice uh projects around the house that kind of thing perfect for that otherwise i would say stick to the late afternoon or uh you know before bedtime sesh for this purple punch it's definitely very relaxing very sedative this medication is great for i would say reading a book taking a nap or binge watching some television that's what i've been doing with it i know i haven't taken that much of a dent into it but i've really been enjoying this pen go ahead and get another rip here guys cheers everyone very very tasty indeed leafly says purple punch helps patients with insomnia nausea pain and stress i'd agree with all those uh insomnia definitely i'm gonna take a nice nap after i get this video uploaded i know it's very early in the morning but uh i have a weird sleep schedule so i'm gonna get this video up and uh get some nice uh medication and i'm an insomniac i sleep when i can nausea the pain and the stress um like i said it's very stress-free it would be great for a nice afternoon sesh after uh after work and like i said to de-stress get uh after you've done everything you need to do for the day this medication will help you get your mind in the right place to uh relax and get where you need to be so yeah definitely recommend this strain to indica lovers as well as people trying to uh you know de-stress and relax at the end of the day i wanted to talk quick about clarity brands if you guys haven't tried these cartridges um like i said i know they're in uh several states but here in the state of florida they're only located or sold at uh liberty health sciences and they're all very very great cartridges i've had uh i think three strains so far i've had the mimosa purple punch and the maui wowie um all of those uh the purple punch is a hybrid maui wow is the sativa the most as i or punches the indica maui is a sativa and the mumbo's is a hybrid i'm very baked already i'm sorry but no all very great very uh nice effective very tasty strengths i believe they have a blend of cannabis and

we'll be funny signing off", "v7eQ8UTo-Ug": "howdy y'all Dan Scott lean here joining you from legal grass that she sits the heartland of America so for today's episode I'm going to be reviewing this Delta 8 cartridge yes Delta 8 not not the Delta 9 that you commonly associate with THC but there's another form of THC there's Delta 8 that comes before 9 and there's also Delta 10 but I haven't heard of any vendors creating Delta 10 carts at this moment in time right now so I'm just gonna be reviewing what I do have in my hands which is a Delta 9 THC cartridge from 3qi and I've plugged them before on this podcast but I've actually given this actual vape cart the the light of day I've given it a chance and Delta 8 I got it quacks very much like the same duck of cannabis they did it's it feels if you told me that this was a different form of THC I wouldn't I would have I would I would would think it's the same wing of the of the same bird and but yeah so I bought their purple punch Delta Delta eight cartridge that the particular cartridge has about 900 milligrams of Delta 850 milligrams of CBN and CBC and 50 milligrams of terpenes alright so I got this purple punch vape cart from from the folks of 3qi and so do this all right this is what this looks like 3qi this is the cart so you're gonna vape it right now in front of you guys if you look in the video version of this excuse me all right so I vaped it it's like any other vape card if you vape a little too much and you put a little too much we're taking a little too much vapor we are gonna get the coughs and that's what happened I mess with the rooster and got and got the beak but but now with that hefty sort of vape poll that I got you could you could taste the purple purple grape II sort of sweetness to it and it's very apparent in that and in this cart so does it does for taste and flavor it tastes like purple punch concentrates I've had in the past so it does hold up I feel high I don't feel the same debilitating high that a good edible would make me feel or even just like a job two bowls of a 2 2 full cannabis bowls smoking before bed that kid it packs a punch and does the the what I find with Delta Aid is that it feels I still feel the same body it effects of a that I would feel from a good indica I sort of I still feel the same sort of Medicaid medicated that I would with with regular teeth see um what I do notice is that the Delta eight by itself I just vape it by itself like it tends to fade very quickly or in my experience it like you feel the high but then it just it fades and I feel like it fades quicker than if you had had a regular THC count cart so I I do feel that the sticking power with the high in the duration of the highs is shorter with this Delta aid cart and with this Delta eight that I'm trying but I'm what I do notice when I combine it with my THC and CBD I do notice that my sleep is a lot better because I'm getting the anuradha fact and I do feel that Delta eight with Delta nine by itself I feel like it's a lethal combo for for my sleep like it's you take it and it's like oh man it's like I'm hitting the snooze alarm again like I feel that my suppli supplementation of Delta aid with that my Delta nine in my CBD I feel like that's done a world of good and for for treating my illnesses that works actually better than just typical Delta nine I've a fried CBN concentrated like I've like I've mentioned again didn't see the big ruckus in it but I put a gram on my flour I put no I put a little bit on my own flour I put a little bit when I would vape and I again I didn't really feel that much kick from cbn I didn't really feel that oh I'm so gosh darn tired I feel like I get more of a kick from a delta eight and then Delta nine and having that together I feel like I get way more doing that than just getting cbn pills or cbn concentrate which I've gone before and didn't really didn't really live up to the hype but this Delta 8 stuff like if you want a good sort of if you want to replicate that body high and you know you move to a new city or state and don't really have your connects like this is as close as you'll get to the actual THC without having it without having to take spice or anything like that you still all the hallmarks of a traditional high are still there it's just just a bit less intense and it just fades quicker like that's what I've noticed from taking this powerful punch and what I've evaluated over the course of a few days but what I do feel that we're gonna learn and what what people a lot smarter than me are gonna find out is that Delta eight and nine and when you combine it can work very very well when when when taken without Delta eight so Delta eight and nine complement each other very well I definitely feel the hallmarks of a traditional high without you know the without the sort of oh my god this is out of control Ness about it like you you feel high but it's a very sort of controlled high you know it's not it's not like a sound like a sativa edible or whatever that oh my god I'm high I'm high and I don't want to be high anymore pleases no I don't I don't know I don't feel that with Delta eight it's a very it's a very controlled sort of high doesn't feel too much different than a one I would say a one to one sort of strain might offer you a comparable experience my opinion where you feel both he feels M you feel sort you feel impaired but you still you still don't feel like it's out of control boy so I feel like that's what I feel like these are going to be like the new one to ones or maybe you'll have one part Delta a one part Delta nine I feel like that's gonna be the way of the future I do feel that you know for sleep having supplementing with Delta Aid and my THC I feel that the sleep I get is deeper when I sleep when I wake up I'm hidden snooze a little bit more often because the claudius lead that I'm used to getting under Delta aid definitely improves when I paired with Delta nine flower but yeah we've gone into what Delta eight is in previous episodes I would I would recommend you check out these cards they're the one milliliter card was honest aid after shipping was $65 or something like that so if you live in a state where the met both medical or adult use are still very new and still very expensive you may be able to come out ahead buying Delta eight cards as they continue as more continue to go in the market there's another vendor I just ordered four cards from that that's selling their cards for ten bucks apiece which is a lot cheaper than than what I got with three tree but um but again that's it's it's that's still in the mail now so when we get those cards were gonna review we're gonna review that vendor there are new vendor to so we're gonna be what among the first people reviewing it hopefully but yeah I'm if you want something that's gonna complement the medical reasons why you use canvas I guess let's say you use it for anxiety use it for whatever I mean we're all different you know CBD affects me different than it affects UTC affects me differently Delta eight will affect me differently or affect you differently but I do notice that it amplifies the qualities that I find so medicinal about about indicas and it complements that body hi that I need and I need to treat my illnesses and my symptoms in compliments that perfectly it doesn't make the hi out of control it's it's a good enhancer you know and and I find that I don't get like I mean I don't get as paranoid anymore with with with cannabis but I do find that with this Delta eight like it's it's it's kind of like CBD but not you know you know in a sense that it it's able to neutralize it but you are still gonna feel impaired compared to not taking Delta eight or Delta nine you like you're still gonna feel something it is it is gonna so pack a punch and you should understand how your body can handle it before handling heavy machinery but yeah I would highly recommend checking out Delta eight cards if you have the ability to do so again the entourage effect you know all these cannabinoids work better in concert as opposed to just in isolation so again if you have the cash you have the funds and have the ability to get Delta eight cards and you're looking for something that might enhance or amplify your body high from cannabis that you use to treat various different illnesses like if you're sewing in which the body high is needed or the effects that are granted from a body highs needed then Delta eight is gonna be your friend in my opinion I I will say that before letting you all go but yeah I would highly recommend you check out three tree & shaki to live in a state check to see if you live in a state where Delta eight can be shipped to you first make sure you do that before anything else and yeah um if you have the funds and you have the ability to do it and I would check it out so as always everyone I'm their humble and gracious

review today we're gonna be reviewing purple punch [Music] purple punch is a sweet union of larry og and grand daddy purple this is a delicious dessert stream that it's better when you like after dinner you just smoke one of these you can start feeling really relaxed look at the size of this knot okay this is the this is a seven gram nug look at this he said oh my whole palm the ceiling there's a beauty look at that look at the little logs down it has like little nugs inside nuts like if you if you look in here you see this little knot inside of the knot inside of the nog i think they call it foxtail and don't quote me on that but i think that he has like mug inside not inside now a bunch of little knots inside lugs and in all different directions look at those orange hairs all those trichomes what a beauty beautiful whoa here's one nog they're a bunch of little nugs like they're dense too they're they're pretty dense i wonder how much one you know what let's not wander this really find out let's actually find out how much is one this like this this is this this is a small knot but it's go oh whoa whoa boy where are you going let's put this that's a gram point nine or a gram basically wow oh it has a really good smell it has like a sweet smell to it like almost grapey you can smell the terpenes i mean it's not really strong but you you smell sweetness to it like oh it smells pretty good oh this reminds me of gorilla grape have you guys ever smoked out or smell that that grape smell to it it looks beautiful you can see the purple oh look at this one look at these terpenes i mean these crystals [Music] and you can see all the purple here too look some of that purple in the leaves see it and and i haven't seen a butt like this where it has different tiny butts inside of the big buds it's a lot of little tails everywhere coming out from all this side so you can you see tail here here here i like the sweet smell that he has it's a dense bud grapey smell i wonder if he's gonna taste like grapes as well or i mean it has this sweet smell it's not pudging it's not too strong it just it has like a like a sweet grape smell to it almost candy let's let's go ahead and break one off well here it is it's gonna have this granules strained it up and as always we're using a clean bow and a new screen so that way we taste the actual kindness instead of resins from whatever so this bowl basically every time i use it i put it in solvent and i cleaned it so that way it's always a clean bowl for reviews on let's get all these orange hairs wow that's a nice crunch to it this train has 20 to sea levels and it will hit you like a train oh man this was claimed to be grown by somehow wired brilliance i mean somehow wire breeders and i think those supernova gardens however the true origin of this train is still a mystery like there's no official origin all right let's see this strain is also good for like stress um it's good for stress anxiety depression oh it smells really good as soon as you start grinding up you start spinning that grapes that derping oh it smells so good it smells like sweet no wonder it's like a good for after dinner it has that that sweet smell to it and that creepy smell oh man stays like grapes oh it says mood too you can definitely taste those terpenes that sweet grapey flavor it just hits you on the way in on the way out some but some strains that i have reviewed before they were like you when you when you breathe them in when you inhale it they don't taste the same as when they're coming out and when they when the smoke is coming out when you is when you really hit the flavor with with me on some strains and this one as soon as i hit it the smoke was on my mouth i started to taste the terpenes and the grape and the sweet flavor i inhaled it and let it out and it was just like tasting it again it was pretty good the third hit in i'm already feeling it i'm already feeling it i'm feeling really relaxed again i'm liking this i'm liking this only three hits didn't took that long to hit me i still say it has like it reminds me so much of gorilla grape because of the smell and the taste of it what i gotta say though i like this string better because i mean gorilla grape what was that i don't know it took like a whole bowl maybe a little bit more for me to start feeling the effect and it didn't last that long at least not on my i mean that was my experience with it this one three hits as you can see the bow is not even completely clunky it's still green all over i just hit it three times on this side and i'm i'm feeling it i'm feeling it right now i'm feeling like really relaxed right now i'm feeling a little giggly but hey that's i don't know i like the flavor smooth going in and out [Music] for hit end i can still taste it i still think the grapes not bad not bad hey you know what i wonder what it tastes out of a joint i say we roll the drink and we find out see how the ash burns see if we get a nice white ash or flavor so far flavor is good the butt the looks are really looking good it looks really nice it has a bunch of orange hairs white crystals all over it's dense it's not dry it has a really good flavor and and now smooth going in smooth going out i don't think this is gonna be enough usually i like to put one gram on my joints so that way to burn evenly and it burns slower because it's tight you know if you if you have a joint you don't roll it well you're going to lose you'll start side tracking or canoeing or even tunneling and um so i like to put one gram and that's gonna do it so we're gonna take this one now that's a half a gram there so you see and we're just gonna see if this yep that'll do that'll do i like to put filters in my joint so that way when i'm smoking the cannabis i don't eat it when i'm inhaling it i'm actually smoking i like to cut my paper too as you can see i did a fold here so like that i'm just gonna cut it off the less paper the more canvas i can taste i don't know it's just me it's probably not even true though but that's how i feel so like i take as much papers i can't i use i use raw blacks raw blacks it is so good because like ultra thin paper they're almost transparent of how thin it is and they're watermark so they burn evenly so you really taste what you're smoking with regular rolling papers if they're not thin enough you start tasting like burnt paper i don't like burnt paper so with this super ultra thin paper then watermark even smooth burn and more taste of cannabis than paper here we go so you see that filter now i won't eat the canvas because it's being hold back like a filter nice tight joint and you can you can actually see the canvas through the paper that's how thin it is so you can see it through the paper if this thing won't actually well take my word for it you can actually taste it on a joint too i like it i like how it's good smooth burning nice white ash this part in there [Music] even burning you can see the ring of resins forming around the joint actually yeah i feel like it's a lot smoother in a joint than it is on the boat like in the bose smooth but this right now is like super smooth i'm feeling so relaxed right now i feel good he already hit me like i'm already high i mean why could you expect 20 percent you know this is disturbing is between 20 and 23 percent but this particular batch was 20 percent seriously okay so i finished the joint and it burned smoothly it tasted good it was no problem but here's the problem that i got with this strain it's only been 17 minutes and i'm sober i'm like i haven't smoked nothing and that's not fair that's not good this is the first train that i reviewed that the effect doesn't last as long any other strain that i have reviewed before this minimum of a minimum of an hour then the effects start wearing off after an hour and and it i mean starts wearing off not like it completely improved you know it starts wearing off about an hour so i still continue to feel the effects for over an hour with this one 70 minutes into it after i smoked a bowl completely so it was a gram on a gram and a joint i don't know how much you can put on the boat but you know a bowl is worth and i feel like i haven't smoked that is terrible purple punch my ass i don't see the punch this is that punch line uh-huh i see what i did there i'm sorry that's what happens when i'm sober i get this lame ass jokes i'm just gonna keep on smoking this but you know so to end the video and wrist and to resume the whole thing it okay so it looked good because the butt looks really good it was real cured it had purple all over nice dry columns it smelled really good okay it tastes like smell smells like sweet grapes and um when you smoke a joint with it it burns right you know it's really smooth but when it goes down to the eye it will hit you fast and it will go as fast as it hit you so like three hits in and i was already like oh i was already fitting four hits in so it hits you fast but as fast it hits you that's how fast it goes away because in 17 minutes later here i am smoking water so i mean based on that if they have to give it leaves i'll give it a six leaves and that's because you look good and smell good and taste good but to me the effect is what matters not the looks so yeah six leaves and i'm gonna leave it with that guys because i'm gonna start with another bowl and start working my next review hopefully the next part is gonna be better than this we'll see what happens i'll see you guys in the next one don't forget guys i'm streaming on twitch twitch.tv slash lurk city i'll play games and do the same thing just get stoned and play games with viewers so if you guys on twitch find me there let's play some games in day high i'll see you guys later in the next episode [Music] peace [Music] you", "SMFil50N8Kg": "what's up everybody it's your boy heavenson this is my smoking channel hold up power up turn that off if it's a little battery it's your boy haven't seen this my smoking channel you guys my last video was a fail because i went and tried to open up a jeter juice cart and i tried to use it and it wasn't working on my battery i went to try and use it off of a different battery and sad story is that it doesn't work off of that one either so i got a faulty card as you can see the top isn't even really on right it's a little bit tilted um and it just it doesn't work so that's a little bit of a bummer from the dispensary never really seen that before but um i'm gonna put it back and see what they can do about it because i can't do anything maybe i'll try popping the top actually on it but i doubt that would help so my last video i opened up this jeter juice and it doesn't work so this is a faulty cartridge i'm gonna set it to the side thankfully if you guys watched my dispensary haul i have another jeter juice that i decided to open up right now and see if this one would work and it does um it works on the battery so i'm gonna start off where i left off in my last video by taking a blinker off of this let me put on some music really quick i'm gonna have to adjust how loud it is as well for sure but yeah i'm going to take a blinker off of the jeter juice purple punch last video it didn't work out too well because i got the faulty cartridge but what can you do about it that's been the only card that i had that hasn't worked that i've gotten in like the past six months so i'm pretty pretty excited about that um just one car it doesn't compare to the like other tens and twenties of cards that i've opened already so thankfully those have worked um only one card isn't too big of a problem but enough enough uh yipping and yapping i'm gonna take a blinker off this it's a pretty yellow distillate pretty clear as well it says jeter on the top purple outline of the cartridge but yeah let's take a blanket if you guys have a card make sure you're taking a blinker as well make sure your cart works cheers broccoli cookies that was a sweet taste um can't really say it tastes um like a grape or like blueberries i say it uh it's just a overall generally fruity taste it's not um not the best tasting card i've ever had not the strongest either didn't make me cough up for the first blinker let's take another one um pretty quick like right now right after just to see if i can actually cough off of this thing see that's just my lungs cheers don't really get the urge to cough um as much as i do when smoking other carts it's really smooth it's 82 thc so not bad i've had jeter juice before they're not the best company but um they're definitely not the worst either they are pretty tasty uh distillate um as far as potency 82 isn't bad i'd like to see it more towards the 90s but it's not bad i'm vaping on my geek baby sex in case anybody's wondering sitting at 130 watts tfv16 tank on top the juice that i'm using is called the doodle drips it's like a snickerdoodle cookie it's by choice e-liquids all my juices come from 120 milliliter 120 ml dot co no sponsor no plug it's just where the juices come from in case you guys are interested in them [ __ ] i wish i had to sponsor a plug i don't thought but as far as taste on the cart i'll give it like a eight out of ten it's not bad at all but it's not um remarkable either it's pretty average it doesn't taste bad and it tastes good so that's why i'm giving it an eight it's not it's not horrible but um i've had better that's all i'm trying to say but um as far as potency to 82 percent um i just came from smoking a cart that was 85 so um it's not too potent but it's not too shabby either um it's definitely a lot higher than any flower that i'd be smoking or you're smoking out there but um unless you're smoking on moon rocks but um yeah definitely doing better than flower wood i take another blinker i don't think there's been a time where i've taken so many blinkers and within such a short amount of time but that's just how the strength got me feeling like i might run through this cart a little bit quicker than my other carts if you guys were wondering what i was doing right there i was changing the song my bad for the um shitty angle for a second i got it uh i got the phone set up on top of my uh laptop so [Music] it's not a bad car at all i think i'm just a little salty that the first one i tried off of them didn't work and that i had to open up a second one [Music] unfortunately if you guys enjoyed this video um make sure and slap the like button down below if you have any comments or criticisms like always let me know in the comment section i'll make sure to respond to you guys as soon as i can you guys enjoyed the overall video so far make sure and subscribe to my channel so i know to keep on producing content that's similar to this [Music] you guys have ever had a faulty card before let me know in the comment section down below this is the first time i'm ever getting a faulty card that doesn't work so i'm not too mad about it just a little confused but um we'll see what the dispensary can do about it that'll determine if i'm mad or not to be honest um but i've been a pretty loyal customer to them so they should uh just switch out the cartridge especially if it's unused but [Music] i don't want this video to take too long so i'm going to go ahead and end it out for you guys if you guys enjoyed this video make sure to check out some of my other pieces of content they're all pretty similar but until next time you guys stay high", "2Ez-_fyqK7g": "[Music] you

it's good it tastes nice you know ever gets me high oh yeah get to it please sure you just pull this this came out today was a good day I only use a blue battery keep away from heat and Sun if clog of the Curie's detach the battery unit and help through the cartridge until the clog has been fully dislodged basically just how to use it I don't need this you hear that it's like Christmas right now okay I'm [ __ ] confused oh okay it was this side take that out boom so it's here let's go hopefully this is real you know some face shape but if it is Wow I guess it was 20 bucks that's pretty sketch but I was like I don't know maybe he's like running out well like nobody's really buying it I don't know why the [ __ ] it's 20 but Browns greens on boom I have this battery but I don't I forgot what it's called it's moving but very slowly I [ __ ] what they go oh it's pretty like yellow it looks like a like the KRT oil I don't know how I feel about that I didn't really like the Quixote's we're trying something new so let's go this battery I'm gonna show you guys how it works here's to like turn up the heat look at this 3.8 here's the power button / the hit button to like press it to take a you know whatever I'm over this review let's go see how it tastes it smells like sugar smoke like honey I'm scared what I'm smoking honey breath okay I'm just hitting it tastes like [ __ ] sugar that's what I'm saying like what the fight this should taste like sugar like I don't know something sweet sweet sweet sweet oh it's cool I've heard of these before though the Bloom cards this kid in my class he would always talk about it he got so high that off like one blinker he was like darling he could feel it as soon as he was hitting it and [ __ ] this one I don't know like I feel like you overhyped it I don't know if you were just excited or maybe I just got a fake one I don't know like I don't know what the situation is right now but because it doesn't taste like wax you know it tastes like sugar do you like I don't know how to explain it let me take another hey you know I'm tripping make sure you guys are smoking with me not this for you yeah that should taste sweet as food people like overall I don't really know how to feel about this I don't know if I got a rule one ever I would have got it from a dispensary I would have loved it pretty good card for like cheap you know but I got it from a plug so that makes it halis good just like so scared to sleep I just got it because it was 20 bucks and I was like dude like that kid was always talking about is a lip mac and B get it I'm asked for their opinions yeah they like yeah they like oh froley like keep smoking they don't like it I'll throw it away book that I'm trying to get what you could get from like smoking pesticides and [ __ ] probably [ __ ] bad you know probably overall just sketch about it because I got a funny play basically because you know what I mean I've never picked up from that play I don't know if it rings fake shit's not gonna wanted to get my reaction to be oh you guys all that Tennessee doesn't really see how much place we're presenting it whatever I'm over this review I don't like it was a waste 20 bucks and I saw it at the dispensary and probably get it though cuz you know I know that it's legit this though trash trash absolute trash anyways hope you guys enjoyed this little review in the next video peace", "m_RvuDfuNIA": "hey guys we're going to be talking about delta 8 t8c uh i've been educating myself on it actually picked some up thursday before last it was by treetop himco it was orange cookies and it was the last cartridge they had so i figured why not you know just try it so i i wanted to try three chi um i actually picked a cartridge of that up this past weekend um that was purple punch i had to go to kentucky for that actually they didn't sell it in my area even though it's made here in indiana but i actually had one coming in the mail ordered it two sundays ago we just got here today and with the holiday and covid and coming from wisconsin it just went all over the place but it finally arrived so this is uh what that looks like and i like the packaging of it you can actually feel the uh the grooves these lines it's all they put some time i guess into their box and it's pretty cool how you can actually feel the ridges and it's not just a flat box and on the back they they do give some uh pretty detailed uh info which i like um now these are both uh purple punch um this i have not uh tried the effects of the purple punch tree top yet just got it in the mail but um dry hitting it it tastes uh pretty good um not very grapey um but this cartridge tastes more like grape kool-aid um as you can see there's the package and on the back they they tell you all kinds of stuff 931.6 milligrams of delta 8 thc 17.6 milligrams cbn 0 delta 9 thc and 0 cbd it tells you only two to three second puffs i recommend only take two to three seconds you're gonna get choked up and you might risk burning out the uh you know the cotton inside of the cartridge and you don't spend all that money to waste um no ingredients hit back hip extract terpenes directions remove silicone uh take one puff wait 20 minutes before determining if you need more that's only to me if you're not used to thc at all or if you've never had thc or it's been a while just take one because i've read about people you know just getting so stoned because they're not used to thc at all um don't use it pregnant or nursing uh i i i don't condone this if you're under 21 and use this um i was under 21 whenever i started using cannabis and i if i could go back i would just wait you know just live your life and uh just be happy and be a kid don't waste your brain cells on this [ __ ] right now you know just wait through they're a little bit older you know for me it's more uh medicinal i don't go around with people and do this recreationally it's personal i just want to let other people know that this stuff here is legit so we're gonna give her a role i have been kind of tugging on it now i paid 29 for the treetop one and they gave me a code and if you buy one they'll give you another code to get like 20 off so you save money either way every time you buy hemp living usa is where i got it from and it seems that that is the only one that i found that really gives you discount codes they have like my cbd haven and all that and i haven't ordered from them yet i'd like to order locally you know because uh this comes from fishers indiana by indianapolis they say not to screw this on tight i usually will go tight and then i'll unscrew it and i'm using a goo stick battery if anyone's familiar with that and i'll wait until the letter c cell are matching up with the uh button and that seems to do all right and uh we're gonna go here i picked this up uh last saturday i've kind of been using it every night and uh they last a good while if you're just not being stupid with it either so here we go now i will say that do not exceed two to three second puffs just take two three seconds stop two three seconds seconds seconds breathe in let go and then you can take a couple more and two at a time if you want to so here we go first hit feels like nothing but you'll get choked up as you keep hitting on it this stuff is very good if you're trying to abstain from flour or delta nine you know this is a very good replacement still get you to sleep still get you through the day still make you high it was just a bummer the flower illegal in indiana but i can drive 10 minutes away from where this video is being made in illinois completely legal in that [ __ ] but this is some pretty good stuff you know you know this here is more of like a one-two punch to the head they describe it purple punch hence the punch but it uh i prefer orange cookies now i've only tried now the purple punch and orange cookies but orange cookies was more of a cerebral behind the eyes you know really good for bed uh good for the day if you're trying to get stuff done this here just kind of like makes me so unproductive for the day it's better for night you older dude it seems like if you hold it on like for like even four seconds like really it's like a one-two punch to the head but this stuff is uh legit guys it's uh it doesn't last like forever you know if you just want if you just take one or two you're still gonna feel it but it's not gonna last like super long um other people will tell you it doesn't do anything um maybe they didn't consume it the right way um i did try the gummies by treetop hemp co i tried the rainbow ones they were like 30 milligrams a piece uh and i just i never was an edible guy never had him around i was just i like that immediate feeling from smoking and i get that from the cartridges i just gummies is i don't like something that just hits me you know whenever i'm not ready for it um but this stuff is good i uh i highly recommend it as a replacement um i picked one up from my local shop uh an hour away from here and then i picked the three chia from a shop uh cbd time in lexington kentucky um but then i ordered uh this purple punch from hemp living usa from wisconsin the only thing that went from wisconsin to illinois to indianapolis to kansas to missouri back to indiana then to kentucky and then indiana and kentucky again and then back to indiana so it was like all over the place but i can still track it you know on usps and uh maybe that was because it was a holiday weekend uh and then coveted also but um you know it did arrive and now i have a little bit of orange cookies left i have three cards so i'm probably gonna order uh some more so i do recommend this stuff um try it out make sure it stays legal because it is hint derived it follows the law according to the 2018 farm bill so you can't just give us a good thing and take it away so make sure you try it make sure you buy it make sure you support it and just keep it on the market because one day us here in illegal illegal states are gonna have delta nine we're gonna have cannabis legally and this is just you know a stepping stone so thank you guys for watching uh if you wanna see more um like comment subscribe just leave me a comment if you want to see some more of me sampling different strains and letting you know the effects so thank you guys see you later", "qGjvbtb-XO0": "well Aloha brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel I'm so excited to have all you cannabis connoisseurs and enthusiasts with me today I have a classic strain in vape cartridge form for you today pineapple express baby coming at you from the good people a good supply this is a THC heavy vape cartridge coming in at seven hundred sixty four point one milligrams of THC less than five percent milligrams CBD today about seventy six percent THC in less than a percent CBD so as I said heavy-hitting hybrid THC cartridge coming at you from good supply I'm very excited to try this out pineapple Express is one of my favorite strains of all time probably one of yours too it's classic its legendary they make goddamn movie out of this thing one of my favorite movies probably one of your students hilarious I was very excited to see this in my own cannabis shop even more excited when I found out this thing's going for 40 bucks 40 bucks for a 0.5 gram 510 thread vape cartridge that's the best I've seen in the Canadian market personally so far so I snapped it up right away very excited to check you know he's gonna show you here on the side of the package I'll hold it up for the camera hopefully it doesn't bore but it does let me know what is let me let you know what it says it says our oil what's inside cannabis distillate plant-based terpenes no additives our product the cartridge premium ceramic or anti leaked technology direct airflow system you know I appreciate this kind of information being put on the package I like to know that it's plant-based terpenes not artificial I like to know that it's cannabis dislike to know what's in the cartoon you know more information is not a bad thing I would like to see some other companies follow suit on this good job good supply I like that so without further ado I'm gonna break the seal on this bad boy and figure out how to open it again you know it is some kind of heavy little feels thick cardboard packaging here feels a little wasteful but yeah it's a Canadian market let's open it looks like you pinch the sides and push yeah there we go so here comes the reveal for y'all and there we have it um it's nice-looking let's rescue it from this package yes some heavy thick heavy-duty cardboard packaging for a little item this has got to change um yeah this is a nice-looking cartridge let me hold it up for you all there oh it's got a nice metallic finish on it silver I see a THC logo there I know as it said pineapple Express on that green band and good supply I think at the bottom hopefully that's not blurry for you more importantly though I know it looks great check it out that oil is nice and clear it's a good color hopefully it's coming through clear for you because it looks clear and good that looks smokeable I'm excited that mouthpiece condom and rubber nub oh look we dropped it and yeah it's a nice looking cartridge let's get it on the old standard 510 battery here and the excitement grows as intensifies as we screw it on I'm really looking forward to this everybody I talk know it's tasty hmm yeah that's pretty good you know his little plug there but first John just came out of the package tastes really good kind of a citrusy sweet taste on the intake there and kind of held up on the way out mixed with a little bit of a herbalist herbally kind of taste there kind of herbal and citrusy sweet wouldn't necessarily say pineapple but let's check it out again yeah it's yummy man yep so sweet citrusy taste he definitely tastes that on when they first take a drink and then the exhale it definitely holds up and yeah it's kind of horrible I like it kind of tastes like smoking flower you know it's not too bad it's a good taste in the vape cartridge you know a little distracted here because I've noticed you know this is only 1/2 fault here it's kind of a big cartridge it's dawning on me here that this must be a 1 gram cartridge because it's a point 5 gram you know this lid in there they must be making one gram cartridges in the future that got me excited so yeah breaking news one gram cartridge is coming up looks like from a good supply but you know back to the flavor back to the taste this is pretty good to get a pretty good vapor I see it's not harsh pretty smooth yeah very good vapor production and yeah that's a good flavor I'm really good to enjoy vaping this over the next couple days and as always come back but you know what I think then all right so the final verdict on the old pineapple express some good supply here you know I've been vaping the hell out of this thing the last four days I've run a readout and tell you what I like he didn't like about it I liked a lot about it to be honest favorite thing about it was a taste flavor was great out of this world spine Apple Express baby from the first drag to the last flavor holds up never waned and never weak really good really strong you nailed a good supply you did a good job I can't always say that about all cartridges the flavor held up throughout the whole thing we really get and the flavor that was there really loved it I'm big fat it's pineapple Express it's great you're gonna love the taste the effects really nice effects you know it's a little milder than you might think at a 76 percent THC level so it's not a super heavy hitter you're not gonna get blitzed big stoned out of your mind but it's a good all day strain it's a great way can be extreme it's a sociable strain very conversational motivate you get through your day really happy up with the kind of feeling throughout your day that's a good strain you know what I mean I love it it's a good strain of having a pandemic you got to keep your chin up your spirits up there's a little tank of getting your spirits up that's for sure so you know I really enjoyed it's a little milder than some people might like but I thought it was great really good all day straight it's a hybrid strain I find it to be a lot more sativa meaning like I say it's all day long stream it's not going to let you know you're not gonna feel really tired it's not gonna burn you out really good strain three four hits on this thing lasts about an hour hour and a half before you kind of feel like you might want to have another pull fantastic good job good supply I really enjoyed it only downer to this thing oh you know another thing I really like is I like the look of this I mean look at that it's just nice right it's really shiny really metallic nice look I'm a sucker for a good look looks good but let's get into the only negative I have here well I got one small negative this little green band that you got down here kind of blocks how much oil you got left in the cartridge that's a bit of a bombing event it's alright it's not that big a deal the biggest deal that I have with this is it doesn't seem to last too long it's four days later in a mountain you know what I'm saying I mean like I noticed it moved around real easily in there it's kind of a thinner oil and a thinner oil is gonna vape alittle bit quicker so might want to take that into consideration with your value proposition with you know hey it's 40 bucks 4.5 grand cartridge but it doesn't seem to last that long I don't know personally I still recommend it it's alright I mean you know I was vaping it a lot you know not as much as I have other ones that have lasted longer but you know your mileage may vary out there as always but for what you get I recommend it I'd buy it again if I saw it in a store I'd buy it again I really liked it really impressed I enjoy the price enjoy the effects enjoy the taste I enjoy pineapple Express from good supply good job I liked it so hope you like the videos thanks for stopping by and watching I hope you get something out of it fun in Ford of it informative entertaining I don't know thanks for watching brothers and sisters leave me a

safe taking care of each other and above all everyone keeps smoking", "9UL9r1VbJ6k": "[Music] guys everything 420 and I'm back with a new review as y'all already realized I have been getting some good dispensary cards and I ended up getting another one and they just came out legalized and I licked them up on reader maps and their brand news and they don't have no ratings so I'll probably be the first one to rate them after this video but it's boolean air feingold 999.9 a thousand milligrams and it's purple punch really shiny gold box it's a really nice packaging you can see on the back tells you everything you just you know with the shine on this box it really is hard to read and as well right here in this very small little print it's ninety percent THC and it has a whole bunch of type of THC for some reason is d 9 THC eighty one point eighty seven percent D 98 C 818 point seventy four milligrams as well oh well it tells you and then d8 THC forty seven percent and then it's transferred two milligrams is four point seventy two milligrams THC v 68 so it's six point 75 milligrams CBD 86 so is eight point five milligrams at CBD CBN two point two milligrams so no 20 yeah two point two milligrams it's on CBN and then CB 6 is 24 milligrams of C v6 and in CBC is 15 milligrams of cv 6 no CBC so it's a whole bunch of stuff right here like it's telling you everything that's inside this cartridge and then the total is ninety point 10 percent and then total milligrams is nine hundred and ninety seven milligrams no nine hundred point ninety seven milligrams really nice packaging look at it their Instagram is at boolean air underscore and it's purple punch it comes with a seal at the top a seal at the bottom that says indica and then the ingredients are THC cannabis oil and organic terpenes only really hard to read but it's right there so we're gonna open a box from the top you take up the little sticker and you pull this off look it comes with a whole other slide I'll get the looks gold as well look really nice packaging and then the cartridge comes in the little doobie tube and they're boolean air image in the back all of its gold as well and the cartridge comes really tight inside here like you gotta pull it out guys really nice packaging but the only thing that I just realized is it comes in a I push your right crusher cart the ones that exotic cards use and Mario karts but that looks like some clear oil comes with the California assembled sticker right here on the on the doobie tube and then you gotta pop it open slide the cartridge oh look at this guys clear oil has a seal at the top and a seal at the bottom if you take off the seal the seal at the top has a little hole so I can actually hit it but [Music] well that makes it look gold but look it doesn't even move though he was not moving guys I looked him up on Instagram as well and I was realizing that this is how their oil looks in the images in the video that I saw so it's not supposed to be I think it's like clear distilling or something but it's clearer than any other oil I seem like I have asked is e right here that I'm almost done with and it's gold but this one is like a clear oil like we know we're guys look at that no leaks at all it's a really nice oil let's see I have my vo-tech battery right here I will be dropping their review soon as well I've been kind of backed up on the reviews cuz I have a lot but let's see if this one works for this cartridge it's a really nice battery guys if y'all haven't looked them up y'all should look them up they're called Bo Tech and they actually make like concentrates and everything as well so they decided to make their own company that makes batteries for cartridges to burn them at the perfect temperature so let's see this is boolean err guys y'all haven't tried them out I definitely recommend them they are at dispensaries they are brand new so check them out let's see bubbles still there and moved it's about time it moved but that's a really smooth hit let me take this skill up so really smooth hit really clean and is not too much on the lake flavor side like Dinks and like other cartridges do it's more like a very light hint and it's funny cuz this is purple punch in the review that I did it for this dizzy there's purple punch as well it's just as fizzy has like a it does have a little bit more flavor than this one this one's really light so let's go for the second hit cheers guys to see how the high is it's really good it's good that hits like really strong really smooth it doesn't give you like a hitching your throat nor when you French inhale it won't give you like an itch of your nose I don't know if you'll have that with things before but I've gotten it before like once or twice and this one doesn't have anything like that really good dispensary question you tried the suspensory cart they're really clean now this won't stay tuned for this this would be good as well but it's just a whole different type of oil like it's nothing like the street cards look at that guy's clear oil let's see cheers again yeah built boolean here flavor eight out of ten over to say this should give it like a little bit more flavor because it just tastes like more like weed which is pretty good but I was expecting like a little bit of like more fruity flavor of like a grape or something just to give it that purple punch flavor but the high I gotta give it like a 9 out of 10 it is pretty it is like really strong but it is really smooth so you don't feel it when you're hit taking the hits and it got me baked I had already smoked some of my Stacey because I mom was out but this bullying air right here definitely a definitely something that I should try cuz I was kind of skeptical trying them out they look really fancy they look nice they look you know like to catch your attention but I didn't really know if their oil was gonna be good or if they're even like known cuz they're brand new but you know why not and it's actually pretty good so definitely try them out and they're worth you know but I'm hi guys hey I'm bait hope you have been smoking with me and cheers again let's see how this oil because it hasn't even got to the top yet so I want to see what big of a bubble is gonna have almost at the top there's gonna have a pretty big bubble cuz there's another one coming with it it's a little one but it's gonna add up so stay tuned guys definitely start trying these out I do recommend any dispensary Kurt that I do try not none of the like you know street cards but if it's a dispensary curry and I actually like it and I feel like y'all will be interesting now reckon I do recommend it but any Street cart you know there's all up to you dispensary carts you know that's something if you like what I'm telling you then you know definitely try it out so stay tuned don't forget to Like and subscribe comment down below and stay high with me guys another one blow my nose

you got your blunts your bongs your joints vape pens pipes whatever you gotta do to get feeling nice and right nice and medicated this morning believe it's a sunday morning cheers everyone very tasty flower this morning let me get my notes standing up for me so we can go ahead and talk about this strain there we are off the rip very very tasty so i just got a nice uh [Music] say uh like sweet gassy flavor to it go ahead put it down for one second so i can show you guys the nugs here oh [ __ ] there we go had it on tight some very very dense no buds there's one right there we got a few left so there's only about uh about five or six in here i think there was uh four big ones and two small a couple more and these are very very dense well-trimmed nugs uh they did very good on the trim job on this flower i will give truly that we got the last one in here there you are now it doesn't look like much but no i mean they're decent sized nugs there's probably about two grams between the three of these nuts they're that dense go ahead and uh get this closed up and we'll keep talking about this strain and keep puffing on the hip wrap very very tasty flour cherry punch is a satima sativa dominant hybrid it is a 43 strain for the eighth over there from truly florida the lineage on this strain is cherry ak-47 crossed with purple punch and those two strains come together to make cherry punch the white structure like you guys saw are very very dense nugs um they're like a light green color to them um very frosty uh with i would say red and purple hairs like it's definitely got some uh some oranges and purples in there whenever you grind up the bud and as you guys saw they're very very dense very frosty looking uh buds the trichomes come off on your fingers as you're uh as you're touching them no matter if you're breaking them up or not you know just me uh you know bring them out showing you guys i'm sure trichomes are coming off my fingers i can tell very very frosty almost white looking [Music] flower thc in this batch is coming in at 20.9 thc so almost 21 it's total of 734 milligrams in the entire eighth there's no cbd listed uh at least on the information on the jar i don't know if there is any in this batch truly didn't care enough to put it on there if there is but i am uh definitely feeling this flower already i'll tell you what i was saying earlier the taste on it is i would say sweet gassy but it's definitely got a little bit more in there like a peppery or a piney flavor on the end and that definitely translates through with the smell the smell on it is uh very sweet berries and then it's got that gas in there at the end and that gas comes from the gassy smell comes from uh the ak-47 and uh the sweet berry flavor almost comes from the purple punch so i would say both strains translate very well as for the feelings as for the the high it gives you [Music] i'd say it's a very euphoric um starting out very frontal head high i would say you definitely get that head head buzz that uh sativas are known for but it soon settles out mellows in to the rest of your body that's why uh it's a sativa dominant hybrid i would definitely say there is some indica uh indica effects in there not just straight sativa but i would say it's uh majority sativa you definitely get that head buzz and that uh very uppity euphoric happy high but it you still get that you know full body effects it's not just hearing uh cerebral definitely feeling it between my shoulder blades as well as you know in my legs you know it's definitely settling out very very creative high [Music] [Applause] i would recommend this flower to uh start your day or um you know if you got something that you need to do very creative wise whether it be uh you know you're not creative with something you need to focus i would say you know whether it be work or if you want to you know listen to a podcast or something something that doesn't need a lot of uh what's it called something you could focus on but that also doesn't need a lot of i would say attention but at the same time you know if you're working obviously you need attention but no this this strain is definitely good for that i would say this is definitely a nice euphoric uh creative focused high like i said i this isn't going to put you out in your ass or make you sleep or anything you're not going to want to watch a movie or anything on this flower it's not going to do that to you i'm definitely going to record this edit this get this video up very soon this uh flower very productive uh strain that's that's what i can say [Music] i thought it was gonna be a cherry pie in purple punch cross but it is cherry ak-47 if he was cherry pie he'd be more of an indica dominant hybrid but it is uh in fact sativa leaning after i uh researched into it [Applause] well very enjoyable indeed i went over there to uh true leave 64 their 64th location uh over there in puna gordon florida nice location uh it's one of the newer ones i've uh been to a few now i think i've been to about 10 locations in the state now uh true leaves and uh all very nice including this one nice uh helpful staff wasn't very busy at all i think there was a two or three of the people in there i went uh yesterday and there was a nice 25 or 25 discount 25 off discount statewide so if you went to true live yesterday you could have took advantage of that it was only yesterday uh what was it yesterday was saturday the 13th or 14th whatever day day before i put up this video whatever [Applause] [Music] it's very very nice enjoyable flower [Music] though definitely something to burn in the morning i would not suggest uh doing this in the uh the evening or you know especially at night it's not gonna help you with that and uh leafly said it helps patients with stress depression and pain i'd agree with that like i said it's a nice euphoric happy uplifted high so that'd be the straining depression stress and depression that it helps with and then the pain i do feel the tension between my shoulders being uh you know diminished definitely uh starting to loosen up a bit there so i could see the pain part as well [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] just a little hemp wrap here almost done i'm definitely enjoying these i should gonna pick up a few more if you haven't tried these guys you should uh cyclone hemp wraps they're not uh not sponsor anything just a nice little brand i like but no main focus is cherry punch over there from true leaf definitely recommend go ahead and get a few more puffs get out of here hope you guys have a great rest of your day smoke one for me smoke with your mama it's the weed funny signing off i recommend the uh cherry punch flower i i get it again

joints whatever you do to get feeling nice and right nice medicated with me hope you have your big cards as well cheers everyone it's got a nice um like a sweet um i would say flora as well as a little peppery um spicy uh aftertaste there to it as well definitely uh enjoying the taste of this cartridge it's uh very tasty like i said um i looked it up on leafly they described it as hoppy as in like a hoppyism beer um i would give it that yeah it's definitely got like i said some spice or a little bit of herbage and they're not quite like uh you know your normal like pinene or whatever terpene that is but uh definitely enjoying this um half gram cartridge uh 48 over there at true leave it's indica strain lineage on this is grape vape grapefruit and then there's another third uh strain in there that we don't know the lineage of it's not listed anywhere nobody knows what it is i think that's what gives it that uh that herby hoppy taste there in the end the particular thc in this batch itself is uh 414 milligrams of active thc or 80 82.8 percent uh thc and 1.6 cbd in this particular half gram cartridge uh smell like i said uh definitely peppery i got that floral sweet notes in there i said uh not quite candy like i was hoping for skittles but uh enjoying all the same effects and flavors the effects left me very clear-headed but i'm still mellow and relaxed like it's definitely an indica in my opinion but it's not gonna put you on your ass like a nine pound hammer or something like that it's not as sedative as that i would recommend this for people that want to spoke indigos throughout the day you know that don't want that jitteriness that a sativa or a hybrid would give you you know like uh i don't know if it's just me but i get very anxious from uh sativas during the day that's why i don't smoke a lot of them that's why you'll see a lot of them here on the channel it's only a couple sativas that i really enjoy and i try to only review the products that either are really bad in my opinion i won't i won't get them ever again as well as the products that are really good for me that i really like the effects and that i think other people in the florida cannabis uh community would really enjoy this to help their elements as well well we got that we're gonna go ahead and take another rip cheers everyone it says on leafly it helps with us patients with stress pain and uh depression i would definitely say that uh like i said i'm clear-headed all my stress stress-free worry-free as well as my back pain my lower back as well as i mean between my shoulder blades significantly lowered my lower back i barely feel it at all honestly so definitely say this is a nice one for uh pain relief as well as um i guess stress and uh depression management you know if you're going through some [ __ ] smoke some skittles and i take care of your skittles however else you want however you want to pronounce it it's spilled with the z i'm sure that's just copyright [ __ ] but uh is what it is definitely recommend this i went over there to uh uh the north fort myers location because i was uh visiting my brother over there in uh lehigh but i thought i'd stop by the north fort myers location to pick up some medication on the way home and uh definitely recommend uh definitely i definitely um [ __ ] what am i trying to say i definitely um am glad that i picked this up i do not regret purchasing this medication that's for sure i've never tried this i'd be interested trying it in a distillate particularly for edibles as well as uh i dab it a little bit i'm interested to see if they have this in the full grandma syringes because that'd be very more cost effective i mean sixty dollars per full gram syringe of distillate can't be that [ __ ] i get a full one of these as well as a half gram to make edibles or whatever else with that can't beat that i mean in our market that's great price i mean i have my edible recommendation on my uh on my recommendation but i still haven't used it yet i was gonna get it today because they had those green apple gummies in at the north fort myers location but i didn't almost pick them up it didn't i'm uh i think i'm gonna wait i'll get that uh one of those dark chocolate bars i love me some dark chocolate so i think i'm gonna try that if there's anything you guys would like me to review go ahead

think this battery is dead tell you what this little thing here on the bottom no that's what it is this little thing here on the bottom that you have to have the little connector so if there's one thing i've noticed with this battery so far this little connector here on the bottom has to be screwed in all the way on your cartridge otherwise it won't hit and i think we'll go ahead and get out of here everyone this video is getting a little long so we're already up over eight minutes uh overall definitely recommend this uh skittles cartridge and uh the distillate to uh indica lovers as well as uh people that like in that like indica is um they like to have them during the day you know what i mean they don't want that like i said generous of a sativa or a hybrid that gives you during the day you know that emptiness you know i used to smoke sativas before i would go to work a lot of times and wouldn't want to go to work you know what i mean i would feel like i was anxious didn't want to be there so now for that regard daytime indica use definitely recommend this it's not going to make you sedative like you're going to want to i mean it's sedative but it's not going to make you want to couch like you're just going to want to eat some food and take a nap not going to make you want to do that go ahead and get one more rip here guys i think i got that in there right cheers everyone and get out of here very tasty this is way funny signing off smuggler for me special for mama have a great day everyone cheers", "ZCkB7iHG6Nk": "at YouTube so today guys brand-new video men new different product different strain different review you guys another deal men it's actually off date it's been kind of a gloomy day so I've been just out of it and plus I just got at work and it's been a really long day at work so I'm kind of looking forward to making this video kind of not but it's gonna be satisfying you know just being able to enjoy myself after a long day of work and a long week of work at that it's already Friday you guys will be seeing this on Monday so this is the Friday before that Monday so yeah as you guys can see by the title the video man like always we're getting straight into this no hesitation needed so we got the see the purple punch full gram right there boys this thing has been out already for like oh like almost a month I would say three weeks you know things like that but like I barely got him in my area probably like not even a week ago so I decided to cop that and then just see what it was about some got this last night still haven't hit it so this is 83% point 83 percent of total THC thirteen point four milligrams of CBD and 832 milligrams of Delta 9 THC this was packaged on for 819 and manufactured on 12 12 18 so yeah and you got the safety like always already opened it up just to take a look and make sure it was cool so boom you pop it open like that that's how the packaging comes in and there you get the pod stick it out the full gram you know the full gram always looks beautiful like always guys remove the sticker on the bottom and boom that's that's the oil for you guys that's the oil for you guys if you guys can see that hopefully it's focused in so very nice oil no movement at all like as per usual and hey man I'm charging up the regulars dizzy battery right now as we speak and I got the big battery on deck right now so we're gonna go ahead and smack that on there and then hit this man let's see what this thing is about I've heard so many things about it I mean no one's gave it a bad review to be quite honest with you like I've read all over the weed maps things like that no not one person has gave this a bad review so if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you guys know the deal man make sure you guys are smoking along with me let me know what you guys are smoking in the comments below and then if you're not smoking well man sucks to be you right so cheers boys so right off the bat yeah it's like kind of like those first couple of cops always kicking in man so and right off the bat it tastes like like kool-aid powder right like no doubt a grape kool-aid 100% nothing else that is there I'm not getting any of it flavors well that is just based off of them with the first hit then again so you know first flavors I'm getting a very very grape like dust a very grape dust flavor from this and then the high it's already mellowing me out very nice indica this is an indica hold on let me check yeah this is an indica punch is always the any good I don't know what I'm thinking so take it off the big one let's go ahead and try the little one see if I could get any more prominent flavours things like that because the little one is always good for just like being able to enjoy the session you know so Cheers once again boys [Music] hmm actually I tasted it more on the big battery but honestly this dizzy miss flavor dunno I'm not really getting much out of it to be honest with you guys like it's good don't give me what we're like wrong the flavor profile is amazing you know like and who doesn't like grape kool-aid but you have to be weird so let's take another hit see off the big battery see if that's any better yeah very very deep great flavors on the big battery on the regular battery it doesn't know justice you're getting the clouds on this moment but you're not getting that full flavor profile that's what I'm trying to get up so who I'm priest I'm pretty faded during I'm getting signed to get a little bit more and more faded so yeah I'm like I said admit I was finishing I just finished out my week or actually not really because I have overtime tomorrow shout-out to overtime man you guys know always complaining about overtime but when you actually get there and do it it's just like whatever but in easy two hundred and fifty dollars in only eight hours is like pretty cool you know it's not bad especially when you're slacking off most of the time and just enjoying like your work with your mates and things like that so yeah well back to the cartridge sorry I just went off the track try to get a little bit talkative with you guys so who like like alright the big battery maybe these cartridges maybe these cartridges that they made are a little bit more sustainable against the big battery because I know the big battery was pretty much branding all their old cartridges and that was an easy fix luckily for force dizzy like people were saying oh they have to make new batteries they they have to release another battery no you don't you just have to adjust the how much the or is it called dude the resistance of the coil can take and then that'll be that'll be it so because I learned a lot when vaping resistance and temperatures and everything you know the ohms and it was such an amazing experience I do recommend if you guys are really into vaping and like not only just vaping like THC but jet in general like get into it especially getting a RDA those things you can learn so much about removal dripping atomizers things like that so you get to learn so much about one thing then you can just build and build and make your own so yeah I recommend back back to the product I recommend getting the big battery for the purple punch I mean I'm guessing that the new carts are more sustainable like I said hmm ad yeah it doesn't taste burnt at all and I'm taking pretty decent rips I need to compare this to the plug-and-play definitely if you guys want to see that review let me know because a lot of people have been asking me to do a plug not a lot of people I haven't seen some here and there but if you guys are down to do that versus versus I'm down to give it to you guys because like they're just so comparable do they're both dis Allah they're both in a pod system and they're both based out of Los Angeles I mean these dudes are just hit going head-on but obviously like marketing-wise dizzy is 100% better because they've been around longer their product has been promoted better so that's really where things come in and getting back into the cartridge I just keep getting sidetracked I'm so sorry let's take another hand then we're gonna close this video [Music] all right so my final thoughts on this product right so my final thoughts on this product damn whoo yeah like I said final thoughts on this product would be the flavor profile you taste like grape kool-aid it's amazing you know who doesn't like grape khuda' like I said earlier it's an amazing flavor I recommend to try if you're into those type of cartridges that are just mostly for flavor cuz dizzy does a lot of that and um alright and then like let's let's go into the more concentrated version there was the THC part so the high I took you guys I don't I don't know I didn't count how many rips I took but I took a decent amount of rips and after like sometime 10 minutes already I don't really feel too much tell you the truth so and this is a 83% THC so it's up there not super after but up there enough to the point where you should get you high enough because it's crazy dude like I I spent so much money on this cartridge just because he came from a licensed dispensary so for them to be like just promoting things like this and then you know getting the hype about purple punch is one of those strains that any company that makes purple punch has to make it good because if you don't you kind of just like wow this company can't even make good purple punch like what like what are you doing bro what are you doing and like yeah the high is there but it's not a strong high definitely not a strong high I could see it being a strong high for beginners or people with the low tolerance but people with the high tolerance definitely should be using something better than its dizzy tell you the truth yeah and then the Terps the Terps are very very lacking the Terps aren't there at all tell you the truth like I didn't let me see you get a little little slight kickback in the back of your throat from the Terps but it's not much it's not enough to like you know make you want to take another rib things like that like the only thing making me want to hit it more is the fact I taste like kool-aid so the high I would rate a little maybe a 5 out of 10 through the flavor profile I'm ready to get 9 out of 10 just because it's grape Terps I'd say good 3 out of 10 and yeah I mean stays he kind of let me down I mean it might just be my tolerance like I don't want to bash them you know like it's a great product I'm focused Izzy but just the purple punch needs to have more of a really heavy high in my opinion very indica dominant high because anything like I said anything that's purple punch it it just has that very very high def of like OG marijuana I didn't know I'm saying so yeah I mean yeah like I said I'm in this video if you guys like purple like kool-aid flavor things and then I would recommend go copy this if you can if not I want to go try that that juicy melon and you see BD 1 if you guys want to see that once you let me know so I'm gonna go ahead and end out the video if you guys enjoy today's content make sure you hit that like comment and subscribe button and we'll see you guys later", "HQc9FXLOkiM": "what is up YouTube family boy baths is here I'm gonna be doing another cartridge of you today for you guys now today I had 10 ran into some new cartridges so nothing for like a little that like a catalogue that had gaming at the dispensary so about these new cartridges just explaining about like you know the new flavors that they had and like what they were about and [ __ ] picked up with this I was gonna get like a rock garden or like maybe like a plug and play some but I just didn't want to have the same [ __ ] you know I like trying new things you know it's not bad to try anything so you know that way you guys can like see what's good and what's not you know but these cartridges really grabs my attention there's a church Church cartridges I had never had it before the thing that really caught my attention was they have like this adjustable airflow you know which is pretty pretty dope you know I've never seen adjustable airflow on these cartridges I only seen them on like got 2020 vapor now if you guys had seen those where you could like that just like on the bottom yeah you can they're pretty dope you know you can hit them hard in it would be really smooth it which is pretty cool you know and there were like 40 bucks no $40 a car which is you know they they're pretty neon the marquee I've never seen them before and on the bots on the back that says their Instagram and whatever so it says super premium cannabis distillate you know so it's um it must be some pretty hard dis Allah you know it's a sour it's [ __ ] a super premium distillate you know it's pretty far cartridge guys for the price you guys can't complain so let me know how you guys been let me know how my new subscribers been I've been pretty good as well let me know how life's been treating you guys I really appreciate you guys watching my youtube video you know my videos as [ __ ] you guys are [ __ ] awesome for that you know for taking the time out yesterday and watching my videos I really appreciate that and [ __ ] trying to fix the camera a little bit but you guys are awesome for that and you guys just keep it up you know like an income that on my vetoes and you guys are my snapshot you know you guys always cool you know really appreciate you guys adding my snapchat and [ __ ] but yeah guys let's get straight into this cartridge this cartridge like 40 like $40 you know so also about the barrier that goes along with it Hey look is this for the thumb now so it's Asif so here we have the battery so we're just gonna go in the shimmery drop in the cartridge and ship but but yeah guys it's Sunday afternoon tell him not he has been um it's gonna gotten a little tab on it so it has a little sticker on the bottom so the THC on this is 81% it's a strawberry cough so it's gonna be good guys that I mean we finally we so we finally got the [ __ ] cartridge open after a while struggling you know they gotta like I might work on the [ __ ] cases or something but here we have the church or I don't know if it's just me but I have trouble helping this [ __ ] ship but yeah guys so the thing that really caught my attention was a the design of the cartridge and it kind of looks like a heavy hitter but it's like a really really different different company so we're gonna open it it's a nice really faculty and also really caught my attention so as you guys can see it's also so the coil itself compare this the size of the cartridge this is really really big guys compared to like you know that it's really really a big cartridge and like no joke guys right when I pulled out the cartridge you can smell the the terpene something smells really really fruity and the really thing that's really cool about these cartridges that not a lot of cars you just have to have this adjustable airflow so you guys can take big big clouds or you know you guys can get it really really smooth hit so so there's the cartridge itself right do the bullet test and this thing does not have a bubble in it this thing is like literally filled to the [ __ ] top so it has a really really thick oil in it big coil I mean so this thing should have some good airflow in it and I have this battery along to there you know it's the same battery for the cartridge so I had a copy you know had to it's a adjustable 900 battery the ma battery so it's it gots to be a good Betty so we're gonna pop it open just like that this battery was like twenty dollars so and also you know it's a surge protected so I don't know what I think it sounds like if it blows up on you or some [ __ ] but the max on this is like a four point one voltage so we don't we don't need that much so we're just gonna use the lowest setting on this it's pretty dope these guys packaging is pretty DUP you know everything comes the nice hard plastic packaging so it's pretty dope so it's a battery I really needed a new battery I mean that yoke and it works pretty good but to be honest with you guys I don't know if you guys are the same way but do you guys get tired of using the same [ __ ] battery for this cartridges like this time we're like I'm like [ __ ] I want any battery but I mean even though I don't need one I still want one so I don't know if things just mean I like using these stuffs all the time but here's pretty ears battery and here's the charger simple plug and play for the thing you know it says search on the over and here's the battery it's a nice thick like a brass knuckles really really thick so this battery right here should [ __ ] last you guys for a while the quality on it feels really good it's nice and heavy it has this little rubber tips on there we're gonna take that out and has a California warning sticker logo whatever so you guys know you guys smoking a good cartridge so the the quality on this is really really amazing I had this Cadillac that explained everything about it the oil and it looks really really thick it doesn't move at all and I'm recording uh as yes can see it has this little adjustable air flow net where you guys twisted so that's really really dope you know I had a cartridge before they had that it's the 2020 vapes the feature is something like that and they were [ __ ] fire so imma go ahead and try hit this and I'm gonna go and let you guys know what it tastes like oh wow I'm not gonna [ __ ] what you got your nama straight up guy up on sugar Coast [ __ ] you know if something's bad I'm saying it's bad you know but the tip the terpene profile this is [ __ ] amazing you know the flavor on this it's a strawberry coffee and it tastes like really really fruity you know that's really crazy I don't really think there was gonna taste that good but it tastes so fruity so you know we got this nice big thick battery the same same church on it and like the logo as I said as a cartridge as well so we're not going to see if it's charged hopefully it's charged man I don't know pause the video and alright so turns on so it's on yellow and I'm see that's on the middle one alright so we're gonna put on the 3.2 volt which is the blue light it's already going to screw the cartridge on it sure looks [ __ ] dope guys I'm not gonna lie to you it's really the quality on the quality on the battery and all the cartridges it's amazing just the way it feels in your hand it feels like if you're holding like like a nice gadget you know what I mean so it's pretty dumb guys so we're gonna close up as you guys see these these are really neat to the cartridges so we're gonna quote go ahead and close this little this airway we have here see you ask him alright guys my bad so how to delete some footage up my phone and you know get the video start again because I ran out of footage of storage so we have the cartridge here we're going to just take the sticker off you know just to get that [ __ ] out the way so we're gonna go ahead and hit this and if you got a smoke let me go ahead and do so I'm gonna get back to real quick I'm gonna be heading to follow me on snapchat go ahead and follow me you know yeah that's where I keep up posting updates you know about my lifestyle [ __ ] cheers guys we got this church here so we're gonna go and see this is really good I had to close this airflow so I'm gonna compare it whether it's open and closed I'm gonna tell you guys the difference so Cheers Wow you get this nice really really fruity strawberry taste you know that's [ __ ] awesome it's like and you get some actual terpenes in there I don't really taste like distantly to be honest it tastes like some really top-notch distally really really fruity guys so I'm going um you didn't really get a big cloud as you guys see I don't really get a big cloud with a little airflow closer so I'm going to twist it I'm gonna go ahead and open it and I'm gonna see if I can get a bigger cloud with that as you guys see I took a blinker really really thick oil you know you don't really get big clouds so we're gonna ahead and bump the [ __ ] voltage level on this siren garden one two three ICS conceived so I got in close the thing again and we're gonna hit it cheers guys smoke along with me take a blinker now you really do get this little bigger cloud yeah that's what you needed to do is pull up the voltage on that so you really get the same flavor but it tastes a lot way way better you get this nice fruity Strawberry Cough taste it tastes amazing for the price the cartridge was like thirty six dollars guys now you guys can't beat that to be honest it kind of reminds me of a what's a call you know it's kind of hard to burn so we're gonna go ahead and I'm going to open this airflow let me see what's the difference with the higher voltage oh wow tastes pretty good but to be honest you get a big you get a bigger hit whenever the thing is closed I don't know that's just up to me and it tastes a lot better but I think it's just a preference just depends on anybody but we're gonna flip the thing go over it just to make sure you know there's no [ __ ] bubble in there it's really really really really thick guys all honest it's like amazing if you guys haven't had these Trish partridges I guess you really check them out I would really ricky'll recommend them to for the flavor you guys really get a great great profile terpene profile so I'm gonna hit this again to see if get it cut for you guys I don't know if the batter needs to be charged or some book oh yeah you definitely get bigger clouds whenever the dings closed so yeah guys I'm the hive I really feel great you know I'm really like ready to talk [ __ ] some other [ __ ] you know I mean I'm usually quiet I'm the quiet guy but I guess a now it makes you kind of feel like you know you want to talk a little bit more you know makes you talkative and she like that cuz I'm really like the quiet guy you know you don't really hear me around like I've run a group I'm like the one that Lena talks less but whenever I smokes the teal of products and [ __ ] sativa strains it like makes you want to like I don't know just conversate more you know it makes you want to be out there a little bit more and that's where the kind of mission field right now you don't mix me [ __ ] there didn't know god makes me want to you know hope conversations should but I'm gonna rip this again for you guys and hope you guys are smoking log with me I'm gonna turn the voltage up to the highest setting which is on the red so cheers guys took a blinker and the taste still the same you know this oil is really different than what other distillate is get the nice big cloud guys so if you guys ever see these Church cartridges get the battery as well cuz that [ __ ] oil stick as [ __ ] you know you guys need something good about it to burn them on the [ __ ] book I really appreciate you guys watching my videos and you guys stay tuned for more guys", "HongNCihfeo": "what up

[ __ ] THC here 25 [ __ ] years growing smoking and fighting for cannabis rights yes that's right 25 [ __ ] years I've been in [ __ ] car serated I've been fighting for a cannabis legalization in if you support cannabis legalization like I do then hit that [ __ ] subscribe channel right now people so check it out I want to do a review on another carvanha vape cart that I got I did my first review on the Anisha haze gave it two thumbs up be sure to check that video out if you're new to the channel and you like the videos hit thumbs up leave a comment and I obviously hit that [ __ ] subscribe button check out the other videos and today we're gonna get right into it this is the said curve wanna freaking purple punch here and this is delicious now you'll see as I open it up that like three-quarters of the [ __ ] cart is gone I've done smoked it but here's some cool [ __ ] these are the batch codes and everything you can see when the ship was made they tell you pretty much everything on here it was manufactured on ten eleven of 2018 they give you a batch ID they give you all that information and that's kind of why I really like this company and I'm really filling them right now these Carmona's are awesome they are [ __ ] expensive don't get me wrong but as the saying goes you get what you pay for this is 75 bucks for a gram but again it's all lab tested you can see that the THC is 816 milligrams which basically translates to about 81 percent THC and then it says 3.90 milligrams of CBD and that's a very high count of CBD um so usually they cards in you know strange they don't have too many CBDs in it however this purple punch is loaded with CBDs now if you're not familiar with what cannabidiol are they are good for inflammation pain relief relaxation sleep and stuff like that so this is a this is an indica the purple punch is an indica and basically this is a good strange smoke at night when you're trying to relax and if obviously you have anxiety disorders and stuff like that you want to be smoking on in because if you have any type of you know type of digestive pain or IBS indicas are real good for that type of stuff they help your stomach they help nausea if you're going through radiation treatment any type of that type of stuff indicas are great for that now I really am filling this purple punch I love it I love the packaging I love everything that the corona is doing the other thing I don't love is the [ __ ] price seventy-five bucks is really steep on this but I mean check this [ __ ] out it almost looks like a small package the way they do this [ __ ] and um it's it's you know it's it's definitely a very good oil I'm not gonna deny that and again it is primo you can see that that's how much I have left of it I mean it's basically not under there but it's nice and gold it tastes really fire has a great taste and it definitely hits well it's well-constructed you can't pull these things apart like some of the cheaper ones like the date fake cars or some of the other ones it's really well put together and that I definitely give it two thumbs up as well so what they suggest they even give you a little manual in here and what they suggest is that you vape this on like kind of like a meat like a low to a medium setting so you don't want to be bit too high because you can burn the oil and room kind of the taste of it so we're gonna get right into it I'm gonna screw this right on my pen right here take a few puffs of it and give you a full-blown review here here we go now instantly I gotta get that grapy florally taste and again I'm just I'm really loving that purple punch I'm loving the way that the CBD or hi it has a high kind of CBDs it gives you that relaxed feeling definitely great for pain arthritis all that good stuff it hits great it's a well-constructed car great freaking oil and you know if you have the money go on and grab one of these now people are not endorsed by this company I'm not endorsed by anybody at all I'm doing this [ __ ] out of the [ __ ] love of the [ __ ] scene my heart and I'm doing this [ __ ] to give everybody some real like unbiased reviews and again I'm doing this for me and the everything you see on this channel I'm not telling you to go and use marijuana I'm not telling you to smoke marijuana the mr. TV channel channel mr. the room is for THC channel is here for educational purposes and everything you see is [ __ ] on edited off the top of my head so like I'm here just kind of [ __ ] do these reviews and again on their unedited they're straight up and I'm not endorsed by anybody and I'm not telling you to use cannabis that is my decision use cannabis and if you want to do cannabis and use cannabis then be smart about it and use it wisely because right now what we're pushing for is Lee in this country so again if you support me listen you should hit us up and subscribe buddy and put me on your alerts you know when I dropped new videos again this is the purple [ __ ] punch were reviewing we're gonna take another hit of this you can see how thick the smoke is I mean it's a really well-constructed cart you get a nice up-close look at that I mean that's a really nicely well-constructed car and gets you a nice big thick hit a [ __ ] vaporized smoke oil the oil was [ __ ] primo it's been tested the [ __ ] lab results are right on the [ __ ] package right here and I find that to be very important as a recreational per user and a medical patient I like to know how much THC is CBDs are in the oil gland I'm smoking I also feel comfortable that this oil has been tested this means that this company has spent enough money to test this oil and package this product well enough that translates to me that they're not users of [ __ ] [ __ ] oil or some take out [ __ ] that doesn't even get you [ __ ] high or like pain relief so ascend carvanha they're doing a great job they have a bunch of other flavors I've only got a chance to try the purple punch this is my second review and they amnesia haze not the Amiga Hayes's of sativa this is a straight into cup arm obviously they're apples and oranges fuch and the sativa gives you an immediate uplifting efore high the indica gets you a [ __ ] down more relaxing high that once again is great for sleep pain relief and anxiety disorders and so forth so if you have an opportunity try these out go out try these out if you like fruity [ __ ] strains the purple punch you can't beat the taste I [ __ ] love it it tastes like grape fruity delicious and it's [ __ ] primo so thanks for checking the [ __ ] video out guys I appreciate your support and all the new subscribers thanks again for stopping by and if you haven't

review once again on the purple punch qivana faith cards check them out they're one of my favorites and B's", "ze4NTGF23OY": "i know that they want to do all the [ __ ] i've been doing but they cannot do it i went through my city my gang rolling with me no time to stop what's good youtube it is i the ganja vape here once again with a brand new video but for all my continued followers fans supporters and subscribers with that notification bell turned on y'all already knew that i hope everyone's having a great day fantastic day a blessed day a fabulous day we got a new vape to review now i don't know if any of y'all have noticed but every vape i've gotten from truly or for the most part from any dispensary has mainly been for the most part either a sativa or a sativa dominant hybrid i am now officially breaking the chain because i have no more uh nu sativas to try so i am now officially breaking the chain and i bring to you this indica that goes by the name of skittles and that is pronounced with a z so let's get on into this bad boy here with a percentage thc wise of 80.3 and a cbd of zero that's about it folks the lady at the shop says that people say it tastes pretty good and off rip it smells just like skittles ooh i like how the top has a nice little burnt amber color if i could really get it this brown at the top like chocolate brown and then amber gold underneath i like that but to really nah i would say to really do a last honorary let's do the jack error that i was just recently hitting from true leave but there's still plenty in there technically did the last honorary but it wasn't from the last card from the last video but nice all right now for the skittles cheers not really getting enough of dry hits but off the first hit first lick tastes a little sweet little fruity kind of like skittles i feel it working in the background in the background nothing in the forefront oh yeah fellas this is a nice one for the ladies a nice sweet one okay it's already starting to take effect environment oh so i feel like this is gonna be a really good one i really can't wait to see how this one's gonna work at work how this one's gonna act at work either one will work i i have nothing else to say more at this point hello stay tuned for my analysis also while i was at true leave i managed to swap out my mystica because that one's been old and used ran through and beat up for the past year and a half so this one was currently on the charger still has a little bit more charging to do so i gotta say this skittles is pretty nice but it's a sneaker there are a couple times where i was working and it just just hits you and it just whoa just phase out a bit but i managed to keep my composure while on this so it's a sneaker but it's not a sleeper at least not for me if i had to rate this i would give it a 6.5 because if it did a little bit more of the sneaking it would be good i'll give it a 7. but it's still not that bad of a vape i wonder if they have a skittles flower i mean if they have the oil they ought to have to flower so i will be on the lookout for that in the near future but this is also one that hits the throat a little hard giggity it's been a while since i giggity i also noticed that the smell it started out like a little fruity you know candy-like smell and taste that faded over time and it eventually turned into a more charrier taste if that makes sense as if you were partaking in chimney why am i even using code if you were smoking but it's not a bad thing it didn't leave me dry mouth or anything like that it's just not that strong i feel and when i say it's not that strong i mean like it doesn't fully sneak you like you'll feel it but i don't know i guess if you're not just constantly sitting on it it won't keep that feeling if that makes sense but it's still not a bad vape as i've said so if you would like to pick up a vape that has a nice little fruity taste for your girl or for a girl that you know who likes to vape get the skittles i wonder if i'm saying it right it's probably skittles but it still sounds like skittles i'm not gonna ramble on that anyway let me know down in the comment section below if you have tried skittles and how it has made you feel what would you rate it what do you think about it what would you even pair it with maybe the member berry maybe the l.a confidential i was about to say ignore i should be getting some more flowers soon should be looking into some more flour because i have a couple of vapes here that can last me until then so hopefully they have some new flower that i haven't seen yet that i can snap and until then don't forget to hit that subscribe button and that notification bell until then if you are new here don't forget to hit

last two they lasted forever that plum crazy there's actually a couple hits left in it and uh the sour uh diesel good taste uh good day strain um yeah i'd recommend it uh there's better ones out there but uh it's good how because it lasts it lasts long [Music] everyone keeps telling me i gotta try the birthday cake i have it i've had this thing over a month this is my next cartridge to open i promise um all the ones i've had yet have been bangers except for the bubble diagonal it wasn't that great but other than that these are smack yeah that rhythm cart oh definitely fire definitely for the day um it wasn't like you know nothing spectacular but it was a good daytime cartridge you guys [ __ ] rock like subscribing now", "iIwabDKM61o": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at another vape cartridge traditional 510 threaded uh this is our second look at a company and our first look at their premium line we are taking a look at carvana again uh we reviewed kirana a couple of years ago with they're very very popular here in southern california um k-pen originals i believe is what they call them the uh karana excuse me kirvana originals line a much cheaper more affordable line that i don't see as often anymore as their new ish uh much more recent premium line although this has been around for a couple of years now uh and this routinely ranks among the most expensive weed cartridges that i find uh in southern california the carvana ascend brand that's right uh a s c n d uh this is the ascend line the high fashion strain from carmana ooh la la how fancy uh it's a sativa with uh let's see in terms of thc it's got 87 thc so super high thc percentage uh and then with the whole cannabinoid package uh rocking 92 and a quarter percent really nice lab testing results really nice break down there i still don't like the trend of putting the number of total cannabinoids as a bigger more noticeable thing than thc but you know uh everybody's doing it uh gives you the primary terpenes if you are really into that um and then uh we know that from kirvana's website and the packaging here this is a full spectrum product uh which leads us into a little bit of semantic trickery in terms of what do any of these things mean so this is a full spectrum um a full spectrum vape cartridge uh from kirbana meaning that it is uses all of the spec all of the cannabinoid profile theoretically from the high fashion strain but it does not mean that it is necessarily like live resin or extracted in some different fancy way or some different fancy kind of oil it simply means that it uses the entire cannabinoid profile of the strain um so uh carbon claims on their website they use their proprietary 50-point different extraction uh method that secret whatever yada yada yada i appreciate they're not lying and saying they're you know live resin or whatever when they're not uh this is just good old-fashioned cannabis oil and then added cannabis-derived terpenes so old-school style now as i said this is the most expensive uh these are routinely the most expensive cartridges i see in southern california uh i know this isn't gonna sound like much to a lot of you but believe me uh for where my area or my dispensary this is this half gram cart costs uh 46 bucks which puts it well well well above many of its competitors uh i routinely see you can find one gram cartridges in my area for forty dollars fairly easily uh and this is a half gram cart for more than ten percent more than that so uh not cheap but let's hope it's the premium experience let's go ahead and shut up and get into it uh the most important part of these reviews the actual testing uh let's try to figure out how to open this in the least destructive way possible which i fear may not happen i think i'm gonna just cut this sticker which you know oh i do have my scissors excuse me i did come prepared all right easy desert girl don't and by easy desert girl i guess i mean me don't stab and kill yourself i've got half the sticker oh damn it let's just go for the whole thing so uh take this into account anybody who is uh planning on doing this somewhere at location you've got a pretty gnarly sticker here to contend with before opening this rather uh elaborate packaging uh you are definitely paying for some fancy ass packaging here which to me is a not uh something that i'm very happy to do even though i own a house full of apple products uh okay so there we go there is that oh look at this a little pool tab oh ah so oh a an acrylic tip which is not what i was expecting to see i was thought for sure something nicer material wise there but whatever uh as long as it still works great and the mouth feel is fine so you've got a plastic acrylic tip um otherwise the oil looks nice a little lighter than i am used to um seeing but uh that doesn't necessarily that's no indication of any kind of quality all right well there is what our what is this called again uh this high fashion looks like i've never actually had flour high fashion before anyways uh i've been told that it should have a uh sweet berry like taste let's give it a try whoa wowzer holy [ __ ] [ __ ] what a crazy crazy flavor profile wow uh it immediately comes out tasting like peppermint like a but not a burning awful too much peppermint a very um i don't know uh s gentle subtle pepperminty taste um not overpowering any way shape or form that very quickly turns into something much sort of fruitier and more almost more floral it's delightful wow yeah um in terms of taste uh this is after three or four hits here this is like a top five uh flavor terpene profile for me in terms of just pure taste it is it's it's trippy almost um how how much it changes on you let's get another big one here before we talk about how high it's gonna get us whoa that is amazing tasting wow i rarely find ones that like the taste alone is something that would make me want to um sort of uh try something again exclusively for the way it tastes but this is this is different this is something special and it's not just the taste uh this is strong as [ __ ] holy [ __ ] um that last hit really really did it um 87 thc for sure plus all those other various delightful and tasty cannabinoids for that what was it 92 and a quarter percent uh various cannabinoid profile and what a delicious 92 and a quarter percent it is um holy [ __ ] is it expensive but holy [ __ ] are the initial impressions equally i mean this is uh wow yeah uh i am i did not expect to uh review this this quickly and have such conflicting feelings i i thought for sure i was gonna come here and say like oh you know it's good but it's not worth it but uh with this taste and with this potency man this is really good stuff let's get one more in uh real quick here excuse me holy [ __ ] yes wow um i would put this as oh my god i am quite high um this is the only and this is early in our review because all of our wheats reviews is not we're not just going to review the first little bit we're going to review all of this half gram and boy am i excited to do it but this is the closest i have ever come to finding anything that um competes i'm not gonna say it's better than plug play but this is in conversation with plug play uh and it is not something i was expecting wow this is good stuff um let me get one more before we say goodbye for now uh and i'll see you guys again in a couple of days when i sadly have to say goodbye to our cravana ascend high fashion until then guys stay high stay healthy and i'll see you back here in just a few days goodbye welcome back to wheat skies it has been four whole days uh with the carvana ascend lines high fashion and that 87 thc and here i was pretty effusive in our first half of our review and i am happy to say i am just as pleased here four days later as i was at the beginning this is truly high quality stuff here from carvana this is probably a top five favorite cartridge for me um now it is a premium product again it comes in at 46 bucks for that half gram but this half grim did last me about a day longer than average mostly because it's just that strong and i was able to hit it less more infrequently and it lasted longer as a result but it is more expensive by a decent margin than a lot of products out there um so you should factor that into your buying decisions especially if you are value conscious uh but if you're looking for something a little special a little different um the kurvana ascend line at least the high fashion is going to get a huge huge thumbs up for me um really really enjoyed it uh take a look at your dispensary if you're looking for something a little bit more premium a little bit more [ __ ] i forgot to do and i can't ever think of one while i'm doing it what was my cherry on top why did i do this oh my god i had one in my head and then i just premium premium what's premium [ __ ] welcome back to which guys cherry on top real quick i wanted to uh drop with you guys before we go here a little something extra when we like review this much we like to give a little extra something that isn't weed related but you might want the carvana ascend for this one because it'll be nice and trippy that's an uh year old or so show on amazon prime called undone from the creator of bojack horseman uh it is an animated show starring a couple of different folks including everybody's favorite um uh saul goodman um bob odenkirk himself uh great animated show rotoscope style like a scanner darkly so it looks vaguely real but with this bizarro trippy animation style over top of it and it's a pretty interesting story i think it's like 10 episodes each about 20 minutes it's really worth checking out uh both of these things are the karana ascend high fashion and that is also undone on amazon prime but things i highly highly recommend and that guys is going to do it for our cherry on top and that's going to do it for our review of the cravana ascend until we see you guys on our next review live stream whatever stay high more importantly stay healthy", "TOJR86ZbQXs": "you would yeah I just like this because it's oh hey everybody Britt Mason from humanity house CBD here aim on Indiana I've got Thaddeus with me hey we're just sitting here chatting a little bit and I was telling Thaddeus said one of the one of the questions a lot of people asked when they come in and I'm showing them products that you know they're becoming and they've asked about maybe a particular ailment that they're dealing with or whatever and will show them some of our products and some of our products listed list as an indica or sativa and so a lot of people are like well what what does that even mean I've heard that term you know in in the arena I've heard that term before over over the time what it what does that even mean so I was kind of asked at that what how do you how do you explain that to people when they come in so a lot of the times I think people think that has to do with the CBD levels so like people think maybe if it's an indica that means it has more CBD and if it's a sativa it has more THC and that's not really the case the hemp plant is more than just CBD or THC levels or cbn or all those cannabinoids there's also terpenes terpenes are actually what determine if it's going to be a sativa or indica so I got like a couple of our most popular ones The Incredible Hulk is probably our most popular sativa product and then the strawberry napalm of the Delta 8 by the way is polar most popular indica so say if you were trying out the strawberry Nathan for the first time how does read you the description do they have in the back of this and this is gonna be most generally like the best way to describe a an indica to put it a bomb to the senses this is the bodies of all of our Delta H strains it combines the heady motivated effects of Belt a THC with the same also relaxing terpene blend and we use for our comfortably numb' products so like they even set it there they use different terpenes to determine the indica side of and bran could read the description on the Incredible Hulk a cross between green crack and Jack hair strands so if anybody that those are two very common very traditional strands of cannabis out there and our people know the effects of those that are sativas so you get soothing happiness strapped to a rocket ship great for getting stuff done socializing and anything active this might not turn you green but you're gonna feel like the good monster yeah so again uplifting Zack you know maybe more of a daytime thing you know sateen yeah I mean another way I like to describe it to people is uh it's kind of a funny way to remember it is indica in the couch so it means you're more relaxed or chilled out you want to lay back watch a movie that kind of thing and then sativa I'd use that that s-sounds sativa stimulant now it's not a stimulant and the indica is not a depressant but that's the easiest way I like to explain to people in the most basic terms and there's so much more that goes into all this and we won't go into that embassy actually in a week or so we're gonna meet with one of our vendors here in Indiana up in Lafayette Indiana in northwest part of Indiana where all of our farm ground a lot of our farm ground is one of our vendors that grows our hemp goes the hemp that we buy has invited us to come up see their facility talk to them well there we'll get a chance really to talk to the guys that are growing this that can really tell us the the different even different terpene profiles on so and so forth that's that's not what we'll get into but anyway yeah that was that's kind of one of the great one of the one of the most common questions must come with so anyway I hope this helps a little bit you know if there's a lot going on out there come on in and see us will talk to us some more you can obviously reach us at humanity health CBD at gmail.com websites humanity health CBD calm for all our products subscribe to our channel I can subscribe like and subscribe below hit the bell bring the mill so anyway appreciate it we got to go take care of everybody each other take care of yourself and peace",

the weekend so let's just go with sure it was fabulous so for today's video i've got a two for a two for for you for a keeper we are going to talk about two products from cetera i went down they actually had a they had a buy they had a buy one get one free on their distillate oil and i picked up wedding cake and uh grape cake was that was that right no i got wedding cake and purple punch and i also picked up a vape cart because they were on sale so the vape cart that i picked up is sunday driver uh it is a it says it's hybrid indica leaning i suppose and this one was clocking in at 87.2 thc 0 2.4 cb for a total of almost 88 not bad stats on the wedding or the stats on the grape stomper which was in indica was clocking in at eighty four point five percent thc point three nine seven on cbd oh total of almost 85 and i believe i don't i cannot find honestly i put the uh wedding cake in a vape cart so i can't find a little thing so there's that but i have this one so we'll talk about this one talk about the way it's dispensed we'll even do a dab of it let's go ahead and talk about this vape cart though this is a float vape car it says it's drifted the indicating hybrid and i will say it is very tasty you know i will say this i've always you know i'm not a huge cart person but i've always enjoyed zotero's cards i really have i know this is a newer one that they have or it's newer to me i haven't seen this train i really like this i like this sunday sunday sunday driver the half gram cart you know it kind of i'm gonna have to do a dab of this to see the difference i gotta see though this stuff right here is so tasty it tastes so freaking good it really does so all right so as far as let's go ahead and talk about the drift car real quick for uh this car i do like carts uh i probably would get this card again if i were to get a cart and if it was on sale i would definitely pick this uh this sunday up why do i keep calling i want to keep calling it funday sunday sunday driver okay so this sunday driver is a pretty good strain i definitely have to agree that it is an indica leaning hybrid i've been using it all week it's been actually really pleasant i actually enjoyed the taste i really enjoyed the effects definitely indica leaning hybrid foot chisel 10 out of 10 would get it again if it was on sale all right so yeah definitely worth it on sale [ __ ] right so let's talk about the well they're not new this is the first time i've ever gotten one of these that dispense this way let's do a dab of it let's get that i will say i did it took a few minutes to get it down now you twist it and it was a lot when i first got it i didn't really have a hard time getting anything out of it no it's not really that hard you just kind of twist it and it pushes it out but uh vicki celtech tree of life she actually cut the living [ __ ] out of herself with it and was able to return it but as you can see it's kind of hard to get this last little bit out afraid to turn it too hard because vicky [ __ ] her hand up well that ought to work we'll just do that we'll just put this in the damper again there we go let's shoot my dog to sneeze man this should taste so good like sweet grape candy almost and the wedding uh cake was very similar they both really tasted good but it wasn't like a weedy terpy taste it was like a fruity weedy terpe taste if that makes any sense i don't know so let's talk about the i keep it's purple punch let's talk about the purple punch god i smoke too much purple this grape that [ __ ] i get confused oh i have eaten some of it as you can see there's still some of it coming out so if it does start coming out you just twist it back and we'll suck it back in but even it tastes like candy-ish it was towards the end yeah it is kind of hard like oh look look it's breaking oh snap oh no oh it didn't break what it's i don't know what's going on now try to just get the rest out oh no that's the wrong way god dang it i [ __ ] this up i think i broke it yeah i broke it i'm pretty sure i broke it well um purple punch distillate from saterra that happened yeah no i like the distillate but uh this contraption which i did like at first has now at least it did on video so if you enjoy your distillate like this [ __ ] get it so purple punch distillate from saterra let's talk about it i like the effects it is a nice indica i liked it eating it as an edible i like vaping it but i won't be getting again this is why i don't like this i thought i did like this until this just happened hmm why i think it all get all

pot - man it makes me cough but the policy I gave it a five true to his word flavor guys before I judge it even when we're here so one thing about is that poor flavor I'm gonna give it I'm gonna get a for now bear with me I do taste the lemon but I don't really taste that cookies I mean like I thought it was gonna be more of a ginger gingerbread cookie flavor with the lemon on top you know some I'm sure you have tasted those this isn't one of the most common ones I thought of him he's taste just like that but I can't really taste the cookie or the cookie dough whatever you know but I do love the lemon it's not overbearing either is now bursting with lemon it's not bursting like like how sativas have it sometimes you know mmm-hmm I can't really taste that cook you taste the lemon I can't

grass or calm check him out guys is the only one that I know that have Legion of bloom and reasonable too so oh man the effect guys I feel well-balanced hybrid it's kind of early in the mornings like 10:30 in the morning and I feel the uplifting height where I just want to just go and start my day now you know to me and it's a good it's a good balanced hybrid guys really recommend it who want to just smoke throughout the day most definitely recommend it so in fact I gave it a five only four star I give it the flavor because you know maybe my reviews maybe my reviews different in others but maybe other can taste the the cookie and maybe I can but for me overall guys it's a great pod great company great distillate check him out definitely want you guys check it at least once you know

the freaking channel my name is shakka x420 and i'm back here for another video guys and sorry i'm not in my usual location honestly i honestly don't have a usual location that i do my vlogs in but today i decided you know i'm coming back from work right now as you can see i'm walking and there's this trail right before you feel me before i get to my house and uh i was like why not just do a little quick little vlog for you guys before i get to the crib and relax and tell you guys what happened guys like what the heck so i was on my skateboard guys and it was raining the other day so man it's so slippery out here and i slid off the skateboard trying to like you know i'm just like cut just curving if you ever long board you know when you're just curving and you know you're just curving the street and [ __ ] so freaking hey i freaking fell off my board guys and i scraped my arm i'm not going to show you right now but i scraped my arm and i'm hella pissed cuz i also [ __ ] up my [ __ ] phone guys it's even work but the funny thing is guys the phone still works guys the phone still works so i'm just walking home basically and there's this little trail so you know i had to make a vlog for you guys hold on real quick we're gonna try and get past this house with all the dogs so it's not too too loud for you guys it's okay puppies it's okay it's okay puppies so we're almost past the dogs and today guys you go you guys already know from the title you guys already know and i'm hoping you guys can see this vlog well the lighting is a little bit different because of uh a lot of the shade but today guys we got a ursa extract i'm just gonna stop real quick i'm walking while i'm doing this guys i'll walk all the way from down there but we gotta ursa extracts guys and today this is a ursa extracts this is a strain that you know a lot of people [ __ ] with like this is a big strain that a lot of people [ __ ] with and it's purple punch but it's purple punch and it's the ursa extracts hold on guys let me open it up real quick so here we go guys here's the ursa extracts and if you know ursa astrax usually all of the ursa extracts oil looks pretty pretty alike except the oil that they put in the avd carts if you guys already know um ursa extracts they put a lot of their carts in ceramic ceramic carts but recently because of kovid they can't put it in ceramics so they put an avd but your boy got the ceramic cart all right let's walk forward guys hello so a lot of people actually come on this trail guys so what's up man i show love to everybody you know you gotta say hi to people man if you haven't said hi to someone today guys go outside say hi to someone man um spread the love because you never know how someone is doing and you know just saying just saying like saying a little bit goes a long way just saying a little bit goes a long way sorry guys i can barely speak but um you know just telling someone oh i hope you have a good day or have a good day good morning saying good morning because that's how you you're helping someone start the day by saying good morning you're trying to put them in good spirits that's the whole point of saying good morning because you want someone to have a good morning guys that's why you say good morning good afternoon you know um i hope you have a good day like if you're not having a good day just you know keep it pushing just say good morning you know don't ruin someone else's day too if you're having a bad day just you know keep quiet don't say nothing at all if you can't say nothing nice don't say nothing at all but um that's me rambling and we're gonna stop for a second i'm right here guys uh still on the trail because i haven't even walked that far down this trail honestly guys but i wanted to take a quick hit for you guys so and these ursa x-ray cars i think the um i think the ceramics are different the ceramic looks different and then the top the tip looks different than the original ceramic that ursa extracts actually had so we're gonna turn it up a little bit that'll turn up the temp we're gonna take a freaking hit guys and see how good this is [Music] heck yeah guys but off jump man and this is what i like and this is what i like about ursa extracts guys is the fact that they're consistent like other than the fact that you know i'ma be honest their avd concentrate doesn't taste anything like the concentrate they put in ceramics but you know other than that man their concentrate has been freaking um very consistent like on raw garden level but not raw garden taste but it's always have that dank dab taste see it doesn't have much of a you know flavorful taste because obviously it's not distillate but it always has that good dank ass taste so whatever formula that they are doing man keep using that formula man cause you're creating something good all right guys so this is a dank as [ __ ] but yeah man today has been freaking rough on your boy i'm walking home because your boying got a whip then i fell off my skateboard fell off my damn skateboard guys that was the worst but i'm just happy for the simple fact that i'm off work i don't have to do anything else i get to [ __ ] just make vlogs for the rest of the day hit a dab edit the vlog and just chill you know [Music] because honestly guys that's usually what i do every day monday through friday that's my freaking um that's my schedule monday through friday i got work and then you know if you're a person that works you know i'm saying and you also have other goals you can you know you got to put eight hours in at work you feel me that's my motto and then you got to put in you know a couple more man eight more hours if you can and your goals and into your dreams you know i'm saying so that's what i'm doing right now guys you feel me i'm on the vlogs making a vlog and you guys already know i've been consistent for a good year and we're 3 000 and climbing so i'm not sure what i'm gonna do for 4k 4k subscribers but we're going to do something super nice for you guys man because i appreciate all the support shout out to everybody in the live streams you already know what it is thanks for all the donations too guys because as you guys already know youtube only pays certain people they pay whoever they want to pay if they you feel me they they have their own strict guidelines on what they want like content-wise and if you don't follow their rules you don't get paid by them they they'll let you put ads on there but they'll barely put ads on your actual video because they don't [ __ ] with your content so it don't matter if i have 10 000 or a million subscribers they still probably won't pay me on this channel so make sure you follow my backup channel so i can get paid that's where i do my normal vlog stuff guys where i post my music also i'm gonna start posting my music but i'm gonna start posting normal vlog [ __ ] there too guys um let me take another [ __ ] hit eh we're in california shout out to everybody from california man bay area but you know we're in the valley right now what's good [Music] we don't consider out here in the bay area no i'm just kidding we could start out here in the bay area but call it the valley now i'm giving you guys my location please do not hunt me down i don't want to be hunted down but shout out to you guys man this freaking oil is freaking amazing if you guys have yet to try ursa extracts i recommend that you guys try ursa extracts man because you feel me it's one of the realest live resins i feel that are out there on the market right now a lot of these other live resins aren't even real live resins and this [ __ ] i don't know man it's hard to to say what what's what's the real live resin what's the real this what's the real that when um i'm not the actual one making the product i don't get to see them fill up the cartridge i don't get to see how they make the carts i don't get to see the whole process so i can't you know but in my honest opinion opinion from all of the live resins that i've tried man ursa extracts they're in my top five they're in my top five live resins off jump just because of their consistency and stuff like that there's like i would put select up there but select there's a lot of selects that i don't like and ursa extracts they have a lot of concentrate that i do like i like whatever formula that they they made but um man i'm actually rambling for a long time i gotta start rambling hello you know nice people man lovely neighborhood but let me take another [Music] see sometimes guys even if someone doesn't say hi back you just got to keep it pushing keep it pushing and don't let them ruin your day but i'm pretty much almost home guys i hope everyone enjoyed the

nice and medicated let's get it shot the game alright y'all right here we have the mojito right here we have the lemon head Jacques and toe these are my dang fate so I know everybody be talking smack about these you know everybody has different opinions on them depending where you're at that depends on the quality you know depending who you're getting them from if you know what's filling them that's even better y'all so you know what depending on where you gotten from the [ __ ] everybody's gonna have like a different feel on them but basically your boys gonna go ahead and start writing these but the lemonhead first off I rate this one a 7 out of 10 yo the quality on this one the oil is stick yo y'all can see the oil stick it's not really moving at all takes a while to drip down the windows nice intake yo the flavors are right on the lemon head you kind of get the lemon head flavor on the exhale but on the inhale you don't really get no flavor it tastes kind of like the lemon peel to be real job but this one I'll have to rate a 7 out of 10 and definitely more of a body high type strain pretty tasty on the exhale besides like the lemon peel type vibe but I mean you still get the lemon flavor in there in general but yeah similar 10 body hi let me head right here by dancreep your boys gonna go ahead take another hit let's get gang [Music] getting nice and medicated right there yup I want to see these DAP pins right here for some reason it takes a minute to hit you boy just for the living head like probably about like a minute or two and then you start feeling the effects these are great for pain and stuff the THC and especially if you're not an illegal stage show that's the thing you're not a legal state these are very popular yeah as long as you know what's going in here everything should be good but um yeah lemonhead right here seven out of ten some watching the mojito y'all BAM got it right here in the CBD twist 650 let's go ahead take a hit it was gonna go ahead and review this one took a drink from our beer then blew that out and honestly the flavor my mouth right now is crazy and what I want to say about this mojito right here if you guys have ever had an actual real legit moan you know this is what it tastes like right here I don't know what they did with the turkeys and everything excuse me your boys died but the terpenes that they put in here is pretty [ __ ] good excuse your boy I think that definitely caught up to me I'm definitely faded tarentines stone to the boner no y'all but yeah this mojito the flavor on this one is pretty good it hits you instantly I would say way quicker than the lemon head I would say this one hits almost immediately up definitely hits me in between the eyes definitely in the face I would have to rate this one a high almost 10 you know almost like a nine point seven five or nine point five almost a 10 this one's almost perfect Joe y'all can tell the liquids nice and thick right here let's go ahead take another [Music] the flavor is definitely really limey on the inhale definitely extremely like kind of tangy kind of sour on the exhale you definitely taste it in your mouth definitely a hard hitter this mojito right here I would definitely ready to nine point five out of ten it's pretty clean ding Fame seal your boys opinion king-chavez trash or gas I would have to say gas you know depending on who's making them who's filling them because they are being filled by somebody in your guys local area if you guys don't know you can buy the packaging online and stuff but huh make sure you guys check him out make sure you guys go ahead and like try to get to know who's actually filling these holes that's all I really got to say about them but I'd go ahead and rate these gasps right

reviewing jeter juice cartridges i picked up their purple punch and jeter juice is a distillate line for jeter a dream fields brand i've been seeing these in a lot of dispensaries so um i was curious because it kind of looks like a dank vape or a car cereal cart even down to the nutritional facts in the back so yeah let's take a look at the cartridge though so there's no discoloration it's very minimal and you see the jeter logo and it's color labeled as well and it uses the n60 c cell much like the old dr zodiac cartridges and yeah so let me take a hit yeah it definitely tastes like welsh's grape juice and with a harsh like perfumey aftertaste so i'll definitely i would definitely recommend some other cartridge over this one including heavy hitters absolute extracts plug-and-play and carvana [Music] so continuing off of what i was saying before they actually use botanical terpenes for these cartridges so that might be the reason that i'm getting a headache from uh trying this cartridge so yeah i wouldn't recommend this at all", "PxpxZhZjcS4": "yo without 425 GC man had to go and pick up a couple more packs of that purple punch man yes sir you know I hope you guys are

I upload here I upload there you know that's just another platform just in case YouTube wants to start tripping and [ __ ] like they have been you know well I'm still here we're still blowing trees man I still got you guys showing me love man and uh real quick I can't even lie man I'm [ __ ] bombed high right now my face is like full of pressure right now I feel like this super pressure at the top of my head at the same time we're almost at the end and I'm like man thinking about putting me [ __ ] out saving it for the ride home you know because I got a little bit of like a slowdown you know I feel a little bit of slow motion going on not too much though but man the smell the taste purple punching some straight fire guys I've done a strain review before if you guys haven't seen it man I had a pretty acid batch I had a fat ass snug like the size of my thumb man go watch that video if you haven't seen it yet but I got a gang of blue cookies in my flour room right now just waiting for me to chop them down but I'm just letting them just just push out as much as they can you know fatten up as much as they can but I got a couple plants in there that are still showing me some white hairs man and whenever you see some white here is that means you trying to give you some more so by all means you know I'm just letting them take their time I got a couple in there that are just ready though so I'm thinking I'm gonna chop those down first you know I got a few runs in there you know something are just smaller than the other ones but I'm about to be swimming in birds man it's not easy man like once you start to see that [ __ ] come in it's hard to not be like alright I just want to cut one off you know and just dry it out and try that [ __ ] you know but I'm pretty discipline nowadays because when I first started growing I was doing that you know just experimenting you know getting to know my bud and the anatomy of a plant and [ __ ] you know there's trial and error man and to anybody who's thinking about growing buds 21 and over you know if you guys are young get the [ __ ] out of here man because you to be tripping but to anybody 21 and over that wants to grow their buds man in the state of California I highly encourage that you do man stop buying weed stop going to the dispensary and paying top dollar for [ __ ] that's not even that fresh you know what I'm saying nothin beats self-sufficiency man and that's what I'm all about nowadays twenty twenty I just want to encourage people to grow their own [ __ ] man all I could stress to you guys though to anybody who's getting started and maybe anybody who's kind of like trying and kind of losing confidence because they're not really seeing results do your research man [ __ ] research wish research nothing but research man I highly encourage you guys do your research man get to know everything about the weed plant you know any time I've ever read anything about weed man it's really just someone else's experience you know personal experience trial and error man just do it yourself you're gonna learn as you play along straight man that's the best way to do it man I felt like nothing is really gonna break [ __ ] down for you like hands-on experience you don't I'm saying just don't [ __ ] yourself you know doing one thing and seeing the result in being like okay I'm gonna try this different next time and getting a different result than next time you know like this run of my blue cookies is the Frosty's I think I've had so far because like the trichomes that I have our mind right now there's three different stages you got baggage trichomes which are the smaller ones and ones you just see like little bubbles of it then you got capitate to sell or Cecilia I don't know if I ever like pronounce that [ __ ] right but that's your more medium size tricone and then you got capitate stock like that's the longest track co-managers hella elongated stocks with a phat Bobby's head man and those are the super long ones that you could see really well man with your naked eye and everything you know so I'm definitely pushing out some you know between the capitate Susilo capitate you know they're not the longest but they're [ __ ] long man like and that's like the most highest quality of concentrate right there you know everything so yep I'm exciting guys I want to say thank you guys for tuning in and [ __ ] with me though but on another note man I'm [ __ ] wrecked like I'm just rambling at this point you know I could talk about weed all day man hear me when I tell you this guys it's all about your environment it's all about the medium you choose and you got to show your plants love man you got a pH stat water you know what I'm saying then your plants aren't gonna soak up all the nutrients that the medium has to offer you know if you don't got that pH right it's not gonna eat right your honor saying so yeah man highly encourage you guys to start growing your own [ __ ] but you know there's always that slow season you know and I'm trying to adjust to that but you know I find myself having to buy some weed here and there which is fine you know because I like to try different [ __ ] but lately I've been kind of consistent with like purple punch and Khalifa Kush and royal highness and wedding crasher just because I really been [ __ ] with my homies right here I'm actually chillin in the parking lot right now I just picked these up and I support my local growers man straight-up support yours you know if you're not growing your own so thank you guys for tuning in and [ __ ] with me man I'm about to get back to what I had going on so I'm gonna catch you guys next time and juicy ganja", "JK8Ir4QUnmA": "what's going on everybody's Vic here Napier and I'm here

of this divulge yeah or is it just gonna be like the bull for ji-yong a deeper indica mmm yeah straight into it look at me I'll show you what you get so you know people there is fix about gout there so we'll be careful what you're getting you'll know where big trout so if you could taste and smell that stuff got ya yeah it's absolutely William now I've heard the new ones are coming with these little jungle boy your seal stickers on it too quite simple Jerry to open it up yeah now these come again doing point fives they're not grams a point valves these ones at saw nobody's appointed if you oh no rumor I thought they'd come in become if you get on TLC in LA you can get more as you can see there so the exam that Bucky what with a little doubling the a little bucket inside you can see tin box they should have can you see how it's really should be like that do not if you get any any type of sticker it's wrong it's wrong people so make sure you're getting that stuff so it comes out that and then it comes with a little seal package that is how you should get it every single one out from TLC in that Los Angeles doesn't look like this that it's a look at me again more stuff looks greasy we don't need to calamity of you is equal a bubbles well as disco fear cuz it's come over on feedings back and it's been stored quite a while in wherever it's been stored it started to sugar but for me that's not a bomb at all I have salutely all the Warbeck when it's a result I can see just from the little a little wrap there and you can see they're absolutely I mean look at the Orioles are measured use on that it's absolutely you can see how it's all should we know or you twinkling and sparkling studying anything it's absolutely stunning store so look at me give me well a peewee well again I don't know it can be less so maybe if you want to clean your shatter or something like I don't know what you know I'm woody well well happy week so I'm give me I'm gone I give that what 910

out pretty to there it's gotten really really sugar X or if I can get it on there you can see it comes off in a big slab lock up now sometimes you get it and it is real shatter job lot this this happens to be a real sugar we do and it's absolutely stunning so I'll consistency on it again simple simple this is sugar if consistency it's a lot like a caramel or something like that to eat I think yeah so consistency what 1000 or do you like depends what you're like do you want use sugars that's to me but I open up I think you too what have you got what people in there just that the same thing now again again people storage next you've got he's out the previous all we do saw you featured on and now about a lots of impede form on families or different bits justice in it can it carry it reality or with the early perhaps a suitable different two tablespoons these people same again it's all too little lovely stop bloody lovely so consistency nine I'm gonna go for our pivot up yeah I

it's ursa or if it's ursa but either way they have some really good concentrates i tried one of their concentrates before and this right here is the purple punch so i decided to give it a shot this is the close-up just like live resin goes you know it's really nice and saucy i actually got a little bit on the top there which is you know a little bit disappointing but i'll get it off and um yeah this is pretty much just the standard the smell is just absolutely outstanding that's one plus i like about ursa they're pretty much hitting the ball point when it comes to the smells and the aromas i like that this right here is the scoop the consistency is really good um just like most live resin batters you can't go wrong you definitely can't go wrong with how well it heats up and how good of a dab you're gonna get out of it so this is the slowdown on the meltdown look at that perfect dab in there and it's melting oh man so i went ahead and got this semi i went ahead and gave it to my 100 and tasted every aspect of this concentrates i went ahead and waited a good half an hour to let everything kick in and see how i felt the taste of this is so amazing it definitely puts into perspective as to what a good live resin could be and how live renzo should be and most of the live residents that i choose out definitely have really good taste of the roblox that's one really good thing about the live resin and one good thing you should seek out if you have the opportunity to either taste or smell your live resin before you pick it up i thought long hard about this one i ended up giving it 8 out of 10. thank you so much for watching y'all please like this video if you like it subscribe peace", "YeJkZLXw9kk": "what's up everybody they support via cross Comanche we're not on the bait pan review today it's gonna be on the exotic cards we're gonna be puffing on the purple punch today about nothing right here's strawberry shortcake it's the first time trying these cards on the back of it if you turn it around it says what it is what their Instagram is it's lab tested all natural no PG p EG or VG 80 to 85% this is the purple punch the battery I'm using is called preheat 380 mAh it rips I usually use my CF Q sub I don't have it today have this one I went down to Lucy oh geez and they showed me love and these exotic cards I appreciate it and they hooked me up I got a real good price on them and right now this is the liquid the only the only real problem I had is that liquid is real running and usually I'm real big on that and I don't really you know [ __ ] with the with the liquid when it's like that but this I mean there's there's a slight exception I mean I would like to see you know real lab results from it it would be you know real nice but for the most part it does you know it does get you high this one is a hybrid it's the purple punch on the same has the same 8285 every single package is list 82 85 it doesn't identify each cartridge with the percentage on it which is another thing it's like you know what I mean but I know they're uh you know the brand is its it's been booming a lot of people tried it they're good I've tried them different flavors I've actually bought five different flavors to try them out and I'm gonna show you the cloud on it purple punch it really does taste purpley it's really good I give it I give a 4 out of a 5 the liquid I'll give it a straight 5 if the liquid is a lot thicker but you know I don't mind this it still does a job so if you take thinking about getting some exotic arts you should this one is a

with my ace review I believe you have a spot review like I said it's another lesion lesion abloom this one's actually I've been waiting for this one I've been wanting to try it and without further ado here it is it's the grapefruit OG guys a legion of bloom and we see if I could try to understand right now great for og guys now there's a hybrid there's 395 milligrams of THC so that's like roughly little like 78 79 percent THC 1.8 milligrams of CBD guys so grapefruit OG you know these guys are from Santa Rosa like I said in my last couple videos you know what so it's just gonna be a short review guys so here it is grapefruit OG but I already have in my pack spawn guys check this out it's freaking nice and go guys look at this this thing is freakin nice guys yeah look it's nice and go

this thing is legit real good oil so good distally all right from Legion a bloom pop it in so try it out pretty excited for this one you know excited I personally love fruit grapefruit if you all know what grapefruit is it's kind of it looks like orange oranges and tangerines but the inside is different kind of more of a reddish like top pink color if you're in a verge of losing weight you know what grapefruit is the grapefruit is really really healthy for little people who want to lose weight and just you know fast out all that bad stuff in your body grapefruits have really good fruit guys so that's just a little side fact so yeah great yeah grapefruit hybrid I don't know I don't really know that the two strains that come with it but you know everybody has internet so y'all can look it up Oh we'll see what Omni fix is very quick way too bright BAM there we go all right guys Cheers first hit my champ is that 650 guys 650 that's my preference everybody has their own preference go ahead Cheers very smooth very smooth I mean legions their pot has been all of them have been very smooth I can bear I can taste the grapefruit it's not all there's not burst in it's not natural either is you know it seems you know the turkeys are not natural what I meant to say was just understandable but Dan it's smooth you know let me take another hit oh yeah now I can taste it it's not it's very subtle very subtle but you can taste it like a little hint a little pin to it Wow like I said it's a hybrid you know I feel chill feel very mellowed out you know I feel mellowed out and I'm just sitting here and I'm already thinking about what I got to do when I get home you know it's giving me that creative you know cerebral high where I'm just chillin I'm thinking of what what to get done you know out of me like it's that kind of hybrid of me I'm not to couched hi but I'm hi but I'm very creative in my mind right now what I got I got [ __ ] to to do this weekend I'm sure a lot of you guys do but uh you know let me tell you one more head deep here for you guys oh my god it's good oh yeah that's good guys oh [ __ ] dan so far all the legion pots I've been by your California sauce Danine only one check out those other reviews on my past videos we have not this is my third apart from Legion of boom bloom excuse me it's bomb guys 79 79 78 % TC grapefruit you could taste it very subtle I'm high but I'm not couched hi I'm just chilling also giving me that euphoric kind of like creative you know cerebral high to see with the mix of vamps - the higher I'm swimming that's the little hit a sativa that's in it but oh damn this is wrong guys man I give this a 5 on the flavor because it's not all-natural like how it Aylin is but it's there you know and and it's good the poem see it's a 5 I'll probably give it like a 4 and a half but I'll be kind enough to give you a 5 since the past pause having a 5 you know it's not like if they're but it could be stronger you know it's just my personal opinion but you know it's good see goose it's a good hybrid I love it price it's a 5 guys I got it for cheap you know - the referral program but I'm gonna leave the description I made my description I believe the URL and in the description of where I got it and another URL for the you know legion of balloons page just check him out guys read the stuff the legit clean and just a

eight vape pen review as you see i have it here i'll be doing an unpackaging tool just so you guys can get a real look at it and again this is thc delta 8 vape pen right here um if you guys are not aware yet uh delta 8 thc is actually legal federally you can get this at most smoke shops most gas stations a lot of corner stores um and you guys ask how is thc being legally sold so here's the deal there's delta 8 thc and there's delta 9 thc now delta 9 thc is the chassis that gets you extremely high and which is what is found in all of your marijuana and regular flour whatever you care to call it um so delta nine and thc a are the main psychoactive ingredients in marijuana and those ones are still illegal so you can't get any cartridges or vape pens that are just regular thc delta 9 or taca the main two active ingredients in marijuana that gets you high as [ __ ] basically excuse my french um so right here i have a delta eight one now the main difference is delta eight is missing a few atomic bonds is what they like to call it which makes it legal um it is a little bit less psychoactive but it still gives you a nice high and it's not cbd this is delta 8 thc this is not cbd but this does have some cbd in it and as you see here i have the treetop hem company it's a 700 milligram vape pen delta eight and one actually one of my favorite strains right there blue dream i love me some blue dream and that's cool part about these things it's just like your regular thc it comes in different strains um and again this became legal in 2018 it got approved by the agriculture improvement act here and the company i have here is a treetop hemp company that sells the delta eight thc pins and as you see i'll let you guys examine the packaging and i'll do an unpackaging so you guys can get a real look at it and again here's you must be over 21 to order this product um they as you see they have a suggestion date when they use it by so basically i got a year with this and they even have their website here this is shopyourthcbd.com so as you see this company sells cbd also um and also here too you see like i said um this product is in compliance with the section 10113 of the 2018 farm bill and it contains less than 0.3 percent d9 thc like i said d9 is the active the main active ingredient that gets you high in marijuana this is not d9 thc this is d8 thc and as you see where it says contains is hemp derived d8 thc it also has your cbd in it which is great cbn and contains like again less than 0.3 percent of d9 thc um i'm not sure exactly what cbn is i'm assuming it's similar to cbd but it also has that in it i'm sure it's just your regular hemp and the ingredients here as you see are contains canniboids delta eight and is flavored using terpenes and the great part of it is uh here it's domesticated i live in new york but as you see this was made in california so it's a domesticated product to see what's product i think these are pretty dope i already smoked um a couple of these before and it definitely gives you a high like i said it's less psychoactive the high might not last as long but it definitely does give you a high delta hthc right here we have um and i'll do it on packaging just give me one second so we have it here they put in a nice little concealed plastic packaging too again this is the blue dream strain as you see it says it right on it looks like it has it on the the pen itself too which is pretty cool tree top hem company shout out to the treetop him company let me go ahead and just open up this uh plastic packaging too all right here you go so it basically looks like your regular vape pen but um there's no tobacco or nicotine inside this ladies and gentlemen this is delta 8 thc like i said this is legal federally so you can get this at most smoke shops corner stores or even gas stations here in the united states [ __ ] i don't know if i can go ahead and just uh hopefully it's already working so i'm go ahead and hit it see what it does oh yeah that's a nice smoke oh that's like extremely nice smoke got me coughing so like i said guys next time you go to the smoke shop or gas station or corner store see if they have delta 8 thc there's a variety of different companies that are making them um the research i did on this company they're actually pretty good pretty good quality there's no nicotine in this no tobacco and all the [ __ ] this is actually a pretty good one right here 700 milligrams so i'm already i already feel it feels good too so again guys this is delta 8 thc vape pen um they're legal here in the united states this is not delta 9 thc that's the main the main active ingredient that gets you high in marijuana and um it is not thc a which is other main active ingredient in marijuana that gets you high this is delta 8 thc which is basically scientifically just different by a few atomic bonds if i want to get rick and morty on you guys and that's the main difference is just the main difference is really just how it's made what it's made out of and um the us technically has not uh made this illegal thc the thc that made it legal is like i said delta 9 thc and thc a and this is delta 8 thc and it still gets you high um and like i stated before it doesn't get you as high as your regular thc and when i say regular chc i just mean delta 9 thc and thc a but uh it definitely does get you high and um you can get a variety of strains i got this from a smoke shop a good smoke shop here in my neighborhood i live in new york state so um they had a variety of streams they had like i said as you see here i got blue dream they even had girl scout cookies they had wedding cake they had a sour diesel they had a bunch of them so you can even get your favorite strain out of this shout out to the treetop him company again that hit i took earlier definitely uh definitely did uh feel nice so again guys delta 8 thc is legal here um the main difference between the illegal thc is just a few atomic bonds so next time you go to your local gas station or corner store or smoke shop act if they got delta delta 8 thc and try it out yourself guys um these things are good i know they just don't have them in these vape looking things they also have them in cartridges cartridges excuse me um i actually have a cartridge myself and you look at the cartridge most of the the delta eight cartridges it's a clear liquid in size which is unusual um when you usually buy just the regular thc delta nine uh cartridges you're usually some type of color to them but every time you get a delta eight cartridges uh it's a clear liquid which i find uh i don't know i don't think about it to be honest with you i don't know if that if it being clear makes it a better quality or whatever you want to uh call it but this vape pin right here delta eight vape pen definitely hits nicely so hey guys that's my review shout out to the treetop hem company again and um as you see their website right there shop your thc cbd.com and now you must be over 21 to purchase this product ladies and gentlemen and that hit i took earlier i'm already feeling high so this thing definitely does its job it's more than cbd don't get don't get this confused with cbd guys this is not cbd this is thc it does have cbd in it but it's predominantly thc delta eight so yeah you guys have any questions or concerns leave your comments i've been smoking these for probably about over a month now so i can't complain too much and that's a wrap stay blessed ladies and gentlemen and stay high", "tU_s_zWnKYw": "I am the 4/20 gamer and I'm back with another strain review what is up guys today I'm going to be reviewing this pristiq batter I bought this gram of concentrate from maniac sesh a cool little event that happens every Saturday in Los Angeles this company was there they had a booth and I thought it was pretty cheap so I decided to try some out I'm gonna open it smell it okay so what it looks like [Music] they put the little peepee on the bottom side the purple punch and you get like a berry smell a sweet smell a little bit of a purple smell the strain is purple punch or punch is a sweet and sedating in the cut dominant hybrid the genetics are Larry og and granddaddy purple and it's known for smelling like grape candy or kool-aid the healthy dab from this with that pretty big guy very huge all right here's to sampling it if you're under 18 years old please click out of this video this video is only intended for viewers who are 18 plus years old I live in a legal medical state so I'm a lot to do this I do not condone illegal activities don't do anything illegal Cheers I'm gonna taste this [Music] guys an ant happened to stumbled and landed on the tip of my dapper and somehow he was able to ruin my giant as that another dad no ants Cheers pristiq purple punch you're gonna be trying this let's see what it tastes like [Music] [Music] some of the berry flavor comes through I also get a lot of pine flavors overall flavor-wise I'll probably give this a 3 out of 5 the price is five out of five being at $15 [Music] the cool thing about the strain is it gives you a two punch effect both to the cerebral and to the body this is a perfect strain paired with desserts or as a dessert the effects may help with nausea stress body aches sleeplessness the main flavors that I smell from this is the berry and the sweet I get hence maybe Hensel flickery but doesn't come through very well on this batch and that's the purple punch by pristiq they're better thank you guys so much for watching this

delta 8 new products on the market and stuff like that if you're coming on my channel and you're spamming porn stuff kick rocks man find someplace else to do that [ __ ] because this ain't the spot

gangster man don't be putting porn [ __ ] on my [ __ ] okay find someplace else to do that kick rocks man if you want to do that crap go to [ __ ] fort hub um also sorry about that uh because that kind of stuff just pisses me off a little bit um also talking about free stuff they pull supply had sent me some uh products and what they sent me an extra uh a cart and i told you guys in the past that uh you know if they send me uh free stuff i will get that stuff you i'm not rich you know i like free stuff too um but i'm i'm blessed to have a girlfriend and a family that supports me um in the things that i do in my life so uh again i i get down to my last cartoon like everybody else but again if they give out a free card um i'm trying to pass that on to you guys so if you guys have uh ideas on how i should go about doing that do me a favor man put some comments down in the bottom i passed one out to the guy that comments the most on my channel which his name is t-birds he's got a card coming to him from maple supply now um on the way to him and so when he gets that hopefully he'll tell us how that works out and we can you guys can have another review of it besides just me okay uh going to pensacola today um i talked to you the other day about ion cbd new company i found down in pensacola really really great clark man really smooth couldn't make myself cough on it got a potency compared to vape supply of about 8.5 really good cart and want to see this guy today talk to him and see what's going on the other thing i'm doing too is i'm going to go to crestview and hit sweet southern babes i don't know if you guys remember but way back in the beginning i did a review of uh hemp lively's gummies and then i did a review of treetop gummies and then i told you that uh you know my girlfriend thought that the hemp lobby gummies were better than the treetop gummies even though the treetop gummies had uh 30 milligrams of thc and these only had 25. having said that i'm about looking for the you know the perfect heart man i'm about looking for um those hidden companies out there you know they've got these carts and stuff for sale that are pretty potent um i don't believe that i'm going to find the perfect part in uh you know with him fire direct and these places like that real flashy i think the perfect car is probably a hidden gem somewhere underneath the rock and having said that hemp lively they're a company that provides ingredients to a lot of companies out there that you're actually uh ingesting as far as delta t uh delta atc and cbd goes um now they are just now coming out they've got their own gummies and they sell other vape carts for like treetop and stuff but they're fixing to come out with their own [ __ ] vape car man they are coming out with their own edibles their own gummies and stuff like that and i i'm trying i want to get in on the ground level of something like this man because our opinion you know uh can have some effect on the way that they you know produce uh delta htc products in the future and that's kind of where i'm at with that and so i'm going over i'm gonna go over and see him lively um probably uh saturday i'll talk to them i've been talking to them for a couple days on the phone uh they've got a youtube channel over there that they want to crank back up i don't know if i'll you know maybe do some videos for them and then do some videos here and do some reviews of their products so just so you guys know but my my main thing is like you know trying to get to the point where we have some effect on a company as far as how they're making uh delta t 18c maybe we can affect the flavors and stuff like that um moving on from that going on to this purple punch from delta farms let me tell you something folks i i've said a lot of stuff i love bay pool supply uh they pull supply has the most potent carts on the market today i've i'm listen if there's others out there i'm trying to find them you know i mean i'm gonna put it up to the pepsi challenge every way shape or form or fashion um up to this point gorilla glue is my number one uh cart from delta farms and it still is uh northern lights was second but i'm gonna replace the lights with purple punch man for sheer potency if you uh ranked up there with a with gorilla glue man purple punch is probably second on the list as far as potency goes you can go to uh they pull supply i'll put a link for them down at the bottom if you use code whatever you can get these cards for 25 off they're 29.99 i think with 25 off they're like 22.50 you're not gonna find a more powerful card on the market today um check them out they're i don't even know what else to say about them man they're my favorite card and by bar none i mean and not only that not just what's in the carpet check this out these carts are jewelry grade ceramic okay they have a japanese organic cotton in the middle of viton seals these are the best cards these carts do not plug now they may stick at first but when you pull they're going to pull right through there's a lot of parts out there that i get man that i hit and i just can't [ __ ] hit them anymore because they clog up these carts are not going to clog up they go the extra mile every step of the way at delta farms man and you can get these cards for 22.50 and i did the tincture yesterday by the way and i told you this is probably the most concentrated [ __ ] tincture that i've ever tried in my life um you guys check them out man maple supply for punch is probably second like i said behind gorilla glue northern lights is up there because of flavor um i've got another flavor i'm going to do lemon bliss and i think i s strawberry cough i've done um i've got that and then i've also said i think a strawberry call for a limited bliss to uh t-birds man so i think that's the flavor you got coming hey man you guys check it out man maypole supply whatever code 25 off and i'm going to let you guys know about him lively and i on cbd tomorrow man i want to see both of those people i'm going to definitely see eye on cbd today i will probably see uh the other one saturday hey man um like i said figure out the end this is the end if you'll go down to the bottom there's a link for a giveaway uh click on the link it'll take you to the site into your email and you can get on this for

grams all together it's like 2:00 a.m. right now if you guys got some [ __ ] to smoke spark that [ __ ] man smoke alone man now the thing about going back to the neighborhood is I don't got the luxury

at it knowing what to look for and walking away taking it or leaving it I'm saying straight up man but you guys know I know what the [ __ ] I'm looking for it she definitely had the body definitely had to trichomes on there and she definitely got the nose on her man this [ __ ] right here is sexy it smells like blueberries with like a vanilla black licorice smell straight up those are the three notes that I picked up real quick when I started to smoke this [ __ ] and purple punch is an indica dominant hybrid man she's about 80% leaning I would say dang [ __ ] man she burns beautifully and this is a quick contact bug man straight face note and let me tell you when it does not take much and it does not take long at all it's like you can taste it and smell it at the same time it's a beautiful combo like this is really a good time smoke right here like this is some good [ __ ] a good time smoke right here one thing I did notice about smoking this train right here put me in the

blueberry almost like it almost has like a great smell to it but not exactly almost pickup it kind of has like and it burns really good man like check that [ __ ] out even burn its consistent because it's light and fluffy and that's like some of the best burning blood to me cuz I get some buzz man that are just super rock hard dance man and they just don't burn well I really love like a fluffy Airy kind of but you know what I'm saying you know you tend to get that more in your indica strains but that's when you let them dry out too much you know the perfectly cured indica to me still has some balance to it you know and I love those fluffy strange man you know it's all you sativa lovers out there you guys know what the [ __ ] I'm talking about that's what you get with it's a team of man some fluffy Airy like Foxtel Brack tight like just some straight pillows man smoking on pillows you know I'm saying just smoking on Kush pillows you know that type of hide and kind of like makes you want to smile you ever see somebody superstone and they come into smiling like this is what that [ __ ] is right here this is one of those this is the type of blood right here that just have you smiling looking weird for like no reason like it almost makes me want to laugh like it makes me smile loving it I should have got more shared six grams and that'll last me like a week some people like purple punch and some people don't man I've heard a few people say like not I should don't get you high like that it don't last according to me though like even the last batch I had was pretty good that [ __ ] was like lower quality than this this year right here is a lot more cakey this [ __ ] right here is a lot more fluffier has more moisture to it it was cured better so it hits better taste better smells better all that [ __ ] the whole package this batch right here so compared to the last video go check that [ __ ] out man you'll see the difference in the bud alone just me showing you

and let's look at some undisturbed trichomes all right so I basically want to kick off this strain review by mentioning that this is probably one of the most visually attractive strains that I have picked up in a good while as you can see here from some of the close-ups very very bright orange hairs huge white trichomes absolutely amazing stuff here so as you know we're gonna get some close-ups break open some nugs show some undisturbed trichomes and get into a bit of the background and what we know so as we know the purple punch is a very well known strain going around the community at the moment a lot of people trying it a lot of people smoking it now for all of you guys that haven't tried it yet obviously the strain reviews for you so the purple punch comes with a range of complex aromas the closest thing that I can compare it to from smell and taste is blue Powerade absolutely amazing never smelt or tasted anything like this and it's actually kind of crazy to say that this bud can taste and smell like Blue Parrot so very very cool just want to get into some of the effects here so the effects will include relaxation euphoric happy sleepy and up lifting effects and as you all know this is an indica strains so if you are an indica lover definitely recommend it give it a shot let me know down in the comments if you have tried this before and let's get into some smoking people Cheers so hope you enjoyed them close-ups of the purple punch absolutely amazing flower and super effective and when I first picked up this strain no obviously we did the smell and the taste test and could not put my finger on what it smelt and taste like and then somebody pointed out that it smelt like Blue Parrot or like Gatorade or you know like the powdered drinks drink you get the paved mix you put it in a cup and then you mix it with water like an energy sports drink that's what I could familiarize this stream with I have a bit of a mind blank there so very tasty like berries it's it's like a very nice taste of berries so we're gonna take some more berries to the face hope you all enjoyed this strain review guys like I said make sure you smash that like button if you haven't done so already it is much they appreciated I'm gonna take this second rib to the face first ones already catching up with me so this is probably going to put me to [ __ ] bed very quickly

[Music] [Music]", "CvJTMJxWpqA": "yo how's Emma doing today diving down here back with another video in this video we're doing a cartridge review more specifically we are doing the purple punch from trap house cards I really like this packaging and I'm gonna turn not to be so loud because my baby's in on the room sleeping so this packaging is actually pretty damn cool those stars right there and then right there it says the undisputed heavyweight champion as you can see he's like a boxing and stuff there's a purple punch purple punch indica we're gonna try to use the magic spending ten battery but recently on previous chocos course this it doesn't hand for some reason like the little red thing that comes on when you're hitting it it doesn't come on for some reason and I bought this battery just in case it doesn't this is the bolts battery I was a fifteen dollar batteries at 900 mah I'm not sure what that really means variable volt is preheat system and then I here just tells you how to use the thing so we're gonna try to use the Magister meter let's open this bad boy up so you guys the oil so you gotta close up of it it is the oil I already know the deal with Chop House cause man we're taking this one is off the previous part so yeah man get into it and I'm not sure if I did a cartoon video before I'm gonna go check real quick to see if I did Rogers review before that I used to do and after a Purdy looks to be refined guys I remember what the cartridge was it was the benefit library culture stitches down and an overview of that cartridge it was a good party is very good oil very potent oil there was a live resin so my brezin should come like bring it up just that much knowledge and that's what it does with the better face the taste I thought I was more of I suppose as I smoked more of it I realized that the taste was a root beer tastes like I don't know man I don't know it was a root beer taste but it was a good punch is all around I would definitely probably buy it again but they have other flavors now I'm gonna buy those yeah so let's get into this reveal of the Chop House art for hole punch see if it works on there's nothing see it doesn't hit so I don't know why so overview of the Madison 710 battery start working after this is a magnetic okay nothing so we're gonna be using this bolts battery glad I bought it then I don't know why the magic semi 10 doesn't work on like even on the better baby didn't work so be careful when buying this little battery the cool little battery but then they don't work so what is either between this battery or the vision spinner battery and I've seen other people have those batteries before but it was $10 more you know and they didn't come with a charger so the battery it's a nice battery man it's a big like so five times to turn it on let me see the voltage since my lights when you're walking alright so if you press three times green is 3.0 I'm on green now blue is 3.6 well I'm gonna have it on blue and then the next one is red which is four point man I'm gonna preheat it twice did he stay like that oh actually I'm gonna do I'm gonna see if there's any flavors that come off the cultures like dry hitting any like put a bowl maybe like a purple kool-aid as you know man this is the Chophouse cotton reveal corporal punch Cheers okay so you do get that purple that beautiful taste but it's not strong I didn't get a strong purple taste just a little purple the taste is there and I like that it's not an overwhelming taste because sometimes it can be too overwhelming the taste again sometimes you just want to piney earthy weed taste to your pack and this one it kind of gives you that it gives that little bit of the purple and then a little bit of the turbulence in the cannabis the strength of it I mean I'm not too hard right now I'm not gonna lie I'm not baked almost only two aides let's take another one Cheers there's sleep family spice just clean this out I was gonna get it in a black color but he didn't have it easy the bluish color so I just got it holy crap I wish I could like put it on his own imagine a 710 so I can maybe get a different flavor or there's something like that man but doesn't want to work it does not want to work let me know what you guys are smoking on down below in the comments students blinking back tell me get some water real quick agua h2o stay hydrated let's go damn it I'm gonna I'm gonna wait for this odd three two I don't even know what this song is but here we go blinker oh no that was a long blinker let me tell you

lives are here and today we're talking about fake cartridges there are so many cartridge friends out now carvanha flavor brands jetty extracts heavy hitters king penn exotic cards so many brands and manufacturers now it's very difficult to figure out whether or not the product that you got is a clean genuine cannabis cartridge so we have 5 ways for you to determine whether or not what you're puffin on is the real deal if you feel in this content and you want to see more videos like this hit that subscribe button down below the like button shoot me a little feedback in the comment section we're trying to build community here so let me know packaging on legitimate genuine cannabis cartridges are very distinct and there are a couple things that you should look for a genuine cartridge we're gonna use this carvanha here for example a genuine cartridge always has the potency information listed on a sticker as opposed to printed on the box so if you see here the carvanha the carvanha potency is on that little white label I could peel it off with my finger if I wanted to that's not necessarily true for this flavors brands which claims that it's 91% on the box I can't take this off the reason why this is an issue is because each batch of oil needs to be tested individually depending on what state you're from every state regulates the cannabis oils differently and a third party has to test these not and ready oh gee so there is no way that they can know that this is 91% if your package comes with the potency pre-printed on it it's probably fake [Music] next is the bubble test if you don't know the bubble test is check out my video on streets disease versus legit disease will be bubble test of streets is e and aced is e that I pick up from the clinic and the bubbles move at different rates high quality cannabis oil or distillate moves a little slower than whatever junk they're putting in these cartridges so I'll pull the bubble test for you guys for my example cartridges for you to see but this is a great way for you to tell if what you're getting is booth and homemade or the real deal if your bubble races to the top is probably fake so we're doing a classic bubble test to compare our raw garden cartridge to this flavors brand and andragogy cartridge compare how fast these bubbles are moving you can see for yourself which one has the thicker oil [Music] the next way to tell if your cartridge is fake is brand recognition packaged counterfeiters have gotten very good and there are certain brands that they are known to counterfeit repeatedly brands like kingpin Stiggy plug and play oh man I've seen stuff called pissing excellence there are certain brands that don't have the cachet as a lot of their legal counterparts if you live in a if you live in a illegal State this may be harder for you to ascertain but for the most part if you here in California or in Nevada most brands have a well distinguished brand identity you should be able to Google their name find their website find out information about them if your cartridge is lacking in any of those areas it's probably fake the next way to tell if your cartridge is boof is through the cartridge design itself most manufacturers who exist in the legal market try very hard to distinguish themselves from the pack there are so many cartridge brands out here but this is the hervana C cell you see the custom bottom here a unique great tip here is the raw garden C cell note the plastic on the tip and the bottom and then at the bottom there's also an embossing like a chrome embossment saying raw garden extra touches extra touches now if we're gonna if we're gonna compare that to our suspected Street cart this andretti OG it didn't come with a tip on the top not nearly the level of customization here not nearly the level of customization and personal touch that you would find on other brands so if your brand is lacking in some of these little accouterments might be booth last way you know whether or not your cartridge is legitimate genuine or fake is through the taste test sometimes you just know if you get an uncharacteristic burning in your new clean your

your [ __ ] delta 9 thc cards blood for a while to get a tolerance break just some good stuff anyway ingredients contains cannabinoids delta eight and is flavored with terpenes obviously all right so it contains hemp derived delta eight thc cbd cbn and less than point three percent of delta ninety hc unless i'm reading that wrong it's more than point three percent in other words delta a um i don't know is it a plant probably yeah what i do know about delta eight is it's mixed with it has cbd and some delta nine i'm not too [ __ ] i'm not listening no in common i'm not too keen on this but has them those two mixed into one or in the same plant as the delta a ah i don't know what i'm even [ __ ] trying to say but anyway also wait i'm gonna put the link down these guys [ __ ] sound [ __ ] starburst with it i'm not even making this [ __ ] up they sent out [ __ ] starbursts and it [ __ ] like tied it in here so [ __ ] hard to unwrap it like damn they were cracking the [ __ ] down oh and it came with all right let's just hit it no the fans on it couldn't do a trick damn i was wondering what my characters just [ __ ] all right yeah guys this is something there's some good [ __ ] y'all need to try", "RsxL412U_6U": "this video was recorded in a legal state in its intended for 21 plus or 18 with the medical cards thank you and enjoy the video [Music] we got another Susie pod review actually decided we're gonna [ __ ] review all of Susie pods for you guys but when we go to see like what I see where at least three or four I've weed yeah and that's bad because I see I see people go pick up in bulk so they don't do that but we happen to pick up in bulk and then we still have to go pick up and then we don't pick up in bulk and we still need to go [ __ ] Picasso it's the same situation but order so we're doing in the COS first we reviewed oh gee coach last week so this time it's purple Pines but which is monkey like my second favorite streamers dizzy yeah purple plunge is no joke up there it's up there with OG Kush and something with OG Kush when she's definitely out there competing with all of them don't see though on [ __ ] oh all right so we got it picked up a half round this time we usually get the four grand this one does have a lot of CBD which is what I like too you got a little bit of that see do you feel the CBD though that's like a psych bra you can't tell me I have 100% CBD and it's like okay brother that's why but you're not supposed to feel it it's just supposed to like I know but it's like I just like there's something yeah you love knowing that there's something in there as facts don't get fooled people though like not like that be like let's see what them anyways alright quick hey I won't tell you know yeah we need to get here before any of this [ __ ] because I realized a bunch of the videos are lame as [ __ ] cuz we don't smoke it up and you remember watching old weak tubers and then you would think I brawl shut the [ __ ] up just hit it he doesn't yeah so what kind of doing the same I know [Music] it's for sure smoother than the OG curve and it has a my opinion better better taste good cush it also added this little tropical taste but this one seems more more like for punching no yeah that's what I'm gonna say look up here reads tropical punch flavor and on the OG Kush it reads it reads rainbow flavor so they're both going for like a really really fruity flavor which is a rare something different a different it's kind of it's risky to do first it's risky first easy to do to try to get a flavorful oh gee because you know how people they are with the oh geez I want it straight okay watch they just just I exactly and people still manage to love no I would you cut like myself oh there's not all G cut review this purple point so yeah the flavor just like the other videos we're gonna raid it out of ten so the flavor would you rate it out of 10 labor actually I would do what I could eight point five to nine if I hit high nine no no not a point five eight one five eight point five final answer for favored 58.5 you guys haven't tried the purple punch go ahead and pick it up I wouldn't damn okay let me ask you this how would you compare it to like the sleepness I like this lg cush if you know how the og cush is that [ __ ] is no joke but this one is more if you're if you should like to be feeling mellow throughout the day but you don't want to get something like I have to be in the couch just having to take a nap through this if you want to [ __ ] take a little nap or it's time to go to sleep get yourself the whole G Kush and the really Dutch bump you it takes your whole body down and take your hat down it's it's a really heavy high well this one is more of a it's a it's a heavy hot but it still gives you this energy to do [ __ ] isn't it no I just Reina gonna see isn't a hybrid there's just straight indigo we're doing indicas first I just took a dull blinking one but [ __ ] Rufus back we also are how boxing because we realized we couldn't do a video at our house at her house yeah we complained about in the last video but yeah we had to come to a parking lot to make this video for you guys so drop a like if you guys enjoyed this video at all for sure another lying [ __ ] at Tony let you guys know how it tastes you let you know how it compares to the old you cush I want to speak on you can't see it in the video cards have a smoke Union and I have this really bad habit allowing to spit after I take a really fat ass hit low key I was just gonna cut my address because I'm feeling it slowly creeping in more and more so I thought it was already like don't let me but now I'm starting to like feel it more and then more well that is true the highest very different and sensor yeah this one's not gonna smack you sleep you in 20 seconds yeah the [ __ ] is gonna like slowly increasingly get higher and higher and higher which in my opinion let me wrong I love being smacking points in second foot I don't know there's something about like like gradually getting higher that [ __ ] you up mores because you're not smack smack smack see like what the Freak keep hitting it yeah cuz you're like what the [ __ ] is not hitting I don't see you know you're [ __ ] it all hits out 1 2 your [ __ ] out if I had to rate the taste out of 10 I would not whatever I rate the og was part of like a [ __ ] 10 and 9 but I would rate this I like bateman's a little time I thought that's pretty good it wasn't too harsh it is a lot smoother but I would say has although it's called purple punching you would expect like a bigger punch of flavor that's like it doesn't have as strong as a taste as the OG Kush and that's the only thing I'm gonna compare it to right now because I know you guys are gonna come in with y'all haven't tried the Bluebirds you ever tried this sure Nana believe me I have like those are flavorful as [ __ ] but talking in the car like I thought the og it has more of a flavor than this one this one tastes more like like you said like it is smoother but I thought it's four reasons because like there isn't much to work with you given it's just perfect on strike yeah me I don't know how to explain it like I taste it right now and I thought it was because I took two blinkers on once and there's a reason why I couldn't get a good good taste book I just make the right now and it just tasted like smooth small like I didn't really have something there like sure I know I know my head goes to like tropical yeah but it's like you don't get that strong purple like taste yeah I don't I really don't yeah yeah like you get more of a purple taste on the og in my opinion yeah so the flavor I would say it's like a seven hot like a eight eight yeah like a I'm never gonna talk about I'm never gonna get to be honest I don't wanna I was always say I probably won't give Stacy ever a bad grade on the taste cuz they're tasting it's always just clear nice smoke but I already know on that which one Scott Walker yeah I was gonna say I also say I was gonna speak to something good I wasn't thinking as far as I walk around seeing him [ __ ] nasty eyes bloopers all my I haven't even gotten a blooper I forgot she brought that [ __ ] is like that when did we get a less now I don't know but I remember I didn't have a good know I'm ever I told you that I don't wants to love from like too much taste and my knowledge [ __ ] I was like bro it tasted like I like was sucking okay that's day I was like sucking on like a million different flavor like Jolly Ranchers or like it was just too much flavor yeah I was like what the [ __ ] is going even like what is even going on [ __ ] bloopers okay now I'm gonna make this a blue burst hey buddy oh yeah perfect flange tastes amazing the smack just like telling you say which I love so I would give that [ __ ] like a eight or nine I [ __ ] love it because they just gave me a ride all the time it's amazing I love her lunch and omerod all brought have instead of rolling over all what I les I have a list of our top fives that are gonna be in there okay all right now right now you would have just the og cush and if you want to throw this one in but I mean there's no secret we used to pick up all I would say but that's because we never really would we're now inside our here we always look for the same only [ __ ] sure sure when janaab not bad because that's what we like but there's this series of trying to every city potter is really gonna make us try every like make us see what's really out there because i feel like there's some flavors i haven't even tried glow just thinking the same thing there's some [ __ ] I'm pretty sure stuff they're strange we haven't tried it has to be I'm hyped on the hike [ __ ] yeah I'm gonna take one more here Tony's gonna take it one more blinker and we're gonna get to [ __ ] about it here a couple more videos in this in this little spot cuz I like it it's away from everything and not yes like anybody I'm gonna take this blinker and get the [ __ ] outta here thank you guys so much for watching if you guys enjoyed this

we got the Jenny extracts mm-hmm we got the skittles I might be sure if it's you know focusing or not but it's whatever man we're just going and going and go so hmm so this one manufactured on to 2219 packaged 425 so it's fairly new it's a little over a month just barely so let me see it's a indica dominant it's 83 percent THC 415 milligrams and oh I like the packaging dude I love the packaging the packaging on this thing is pretty amazing so let's go ahead and open it for you guys oh so pop this sucker open I still haven't opened it this is actually the first time I open it so pull out the little hack and then boom boom let's see what's in here Oh a cartridge that's not really filled up all the way what what is that dude it's not filled up all the way that's a weird but they got the wooden tip the wooden tip is a new to me I've never seen any weights with [ __ ] wooden tips on it so let's go ahead and crack her open I'm just trying to his review yah I'm saying you gem that dad man out here boys so let's go ahead and take the battery out we're doesn't even get straight into it man I hope you guys had an amazing Memorial Day weekend shout out to all the soldiers that have risked their lives you know for everybody out here man it's appreciated even though even though people want to say it's not appreciated you know it is appreciated you know there's tons of people just because this little group if people aren't supporting these soldiers aren't supporting the Memorial Day a holiday it doesn't matter you let them be [ __ ] let them be they obviously don't know how great this this data is how great I mean not the state like you know this whole country dude so yeah JD extracts skills let's get right into man trying to hurry up so cheers boys because they're 18 over 21 and over make sure you guys are hitting along with me let me know in the comments below what you guys are smoking on so cheers boys so right off the bat I'm hoping at the window hitting me too hard about keeper so right off the bat to Hungary sweatin like I was saying before I died there dude it was a little this is literally the first time I've smoked it I do I've been so busy like I said I haven't picked up this weekend I haven't done anything so that hate low-key hit me I didn't really get a taste of it but I'm headed again just for you guys so I'm getting like a skittles flavor with the taste like oregano what yeah it tastes like oregano dude so weird this is by far the I don't know dude it could just be like my my tastebuds right now but literally tastes like oregano with skittles but overall the potency it's pretty potent I would give it an 8 out of 10 the Terps are lacking big-time dude the Terps there's no Terps there it's just straight-up dislike if you've ever had like just straight-up desolate like plugging play like that's pretty much what it is just straight-up dissolute you know turps added how's it very very oily taste to it too so I'm gonna take another hit for you it was up hmm it's not bad like I don't get that oregano taste anymore I just get like a very very subtle skittles flavor it's not bad yeah man Sogeti extracts it's a it's a like I don't want to hop on this train but simplistic he did a review on this but he did it I think he did an alien OG I'm not sure and he said that it was a good mid-level cartridge and I kind of agree with him in that point like it I would say maybe if you're a beginner this would be something that you should be trying to get at yeah it's definitely like on the lower quality that's kind of why you don't really see this too often out in the in dispensaries and things like that delivery services you know so I actually came across this because I was like dude what do I get look I was like what do I get I tried everything I can't keep giving my viewers the same thing so I decided to do this you know I'm sorry it's all right there I'm not a bad cop yeah I would say mid mid entry level just straight up desolate you don't really taste much yeah late at night doesn't I'm not really getting anything how do I do so whatever I'm man", "-v9m9I_BFck": "how do y'all dance Kotlin here joining you from legal

cart review now I had a number of people complain that I don't show my face here it is now happy alright moving on so this is purple punch this purple punch right here [Music] that's better people were complaining they don't see my face alright so this is Delta 8 in case you don't know it's a cannabinoid that appears in in cannabis and can be scraped from the industrial hemp that's been federally legal in all 50 states due to the 2018 farm bill this so this is a precursor to the Delta 9 that we're all accustomed to but because there are regulations on Delta 9 and in in in in hemp where you can't have more than 0.3 for industrial hemp federally in the US and I think it's point to in many EU countries so so yeah you can get this Delta 8 cannabinoid that that is THC as well in a lot of states I mean there are some states you can get it like believe I mean I think I think Mississippi you can't get it Montana you can't there's a number of other states but but Delta 8 does feel like tape see does feel like the high for the most part just for me when I vape it it tends to be shorter lasting than a delta 9 cart equivalent right now let's try this purple punch I've tried purple punch from 3qi I'll link to that review in the description and I want to see you how tend all their carts renditions of purple punches so now you'll get to see with me alright see that you you I think the taste is slightly more subtle than the 3qi purple punch the 3G purple punch no pun intended packed more of a punch in terms of flavor this one's a bit more subtle but it still sort of does the job definitely does taste like purple punch for sure you know I just prefer the three chi flavor just slightly more but this definitely tastes like what it what was advertised so this was the second cart from this is the second cart that I've tried out of the out of many of them this is the second one where the flavor actually matched up my I know in a number of videos I've done with regarding Delta B regarding ten to all their carts Delta nine cards I had said that the flavor while the flavor is still good and many of the carts it's not exactly at spec with some of the with the advertised flavor they said it would be but with this what you see tends to be what you get which I like and the effects feel subtle I mean I don't feel like woohoo but my limbs do feel a little bit heavier than they felt before using you yeah I'm gonna film that limb yeah I'm feeling been like my limbs are a little heavier than they tend to be don't feel pretty functional it's sort of hitting me more like a hybrid than a full-on indica like like advertised but I mean but if if you need sort of because some people need a mixture of CBD or THC or some need THC sativa you know so they can sort of focus and get stuff done and I feel that purple punch the or at least this rendition from $10 cart I feel that that could fit the bill so if you if you got stuff you need to get done you can get it done you're calmer you're it slows the game down a little bit but not so much that you feel like like you're being flown to the moon or anything so I would say that this is a very sort of versatile strain if you need versatility during your days and what-have-you but yeah it's such a good taste it's really growing on me I'm almost I almost I almost think it's as good as the 3G but I do think that the 3G was slightly stronger in in taste but it is growing I mean it does taste very very good like I would say it's one of their better tasting tarts from $10 cart but overall I would I would say I would give this fives all around it's you know it hits well the flavors good the drawers aren't too harsh I know I tend to take pretty big drawers and you know that's my fault I've seen that I've seen people comment that on videos but you know it's go big or go home baby alright but so that sort of wraps up my review of purple punch from ten dollar cart compared to the one I tried from three Chi the three Chi one a bit more powerful and tastes and kick in effect but this one the taste and the effect pretty good this purple punch I would say in in lower doses and even with the three Chi one is good during the day but I think as you use more of it I think it's one of those strains as you use more of it then you start really feeling the traditional indica effects and that's what I'm feeling with this right now but I hope you guys enjoyed this as always I can be found anywhere you find podcasts such as iTunes cash box pocket cast podcast addict Google Play Store iTunes stitcher tune in radio I

make sure the rest is good looking see damn it's like the desert in my mouth I guess you can say I'm a thirsty NS dude there we go there so yeah I'm pretty high already though man to be honest with you like having Keith really does complement the bud man it really does especially wanting some fresh [ __ ] I probably got enough for like if I ration you know I'm sexy look I'll be watchin znation so much I'm over here talking about rations and [ __ ] yeah now the real stoners rationing their [ __ ] man if you don't got it man make it laughs I'm saying shoot I'd rather be a little bit high now and a little bit high later then to be high all at once right now you anything [ __ ] that I'll go pick up today I gotta go see the homies man see what they got well home he's put me on to some like mr. Magoo or some [ __ ] yet so how do you check that out see what that's about but me I'm like a deal chaser man like okay yeah I like some fire ass but I like top shelf [ __ ] but like what bills do you got for me man like I'm trying to walk away with grams you know like and I'm not gonna just walk away with any grams I gonna want some good [ __ ] you know like you know let me know put me on game like I grow my own bud but I love to buy them straight and just try again so I could do these reviews for you guys I see myself as like an up-and-coming kind of sword you know studying getting my feet wet you know but there's better ways to taste the but then the smoking in a hemp breath you know thing that's why I be really considering getting like a bong but I'm gonna slacking on that [ __ ] I don't really know which one to get there's so many out there different price ranges and different qualities and different types of glass and [ __ ] like it's just a lot to consider so if you guys can help with do that man what kind of bonds that you guys have what kind of brand is it you know do you recommend a you know I like a long bubbler that's what I'm looking for and I'm not too familiar with like perks and shade or know like trust me like when I tell you guys I'm a classic weed smoker flowers and blintz you know an occasional pipe maybe a joint you know that's why I really want one bet I want to switch it up a little bit I got to stop [ __ ] with these lighters like I need to get a hit wait like there's levels to me in a connoisseur you know you're doing it the right way at least so it's not about just looking for the good but it's consuming the bud correctly at the same time [ __ ] I don't listen to me man I'm not no professional I just bi and talking you know but don't we all we did so rambling and [ __ ] that's the beauty of marijuana manages causes like the storm of beer man just thoughts like everything I'm thinking I'll just kind of spit out you know but I like a black that keeps me together like I mean like I like to be wrecked [ __ ] but when I start like studying and learning super are kind of like fading away I mean those be the best eyes but as far as like getting [ __ ] done and keeping your [ __ ] together like I like the but that really just keep some nice balance like I don't feel too heavily sedated at all I don't feel I feel wrecked but I don't feel dead you know I'm saying like I don't feel any kind of like immobilized Tapout feeling you know what I'm saying like but that goes into play with what you're doing man what are you doing when you're smoking your we like are you out and about with friends and [ __ ] like a social atmosphere cuz then you can smoke and it couldn't be alright you might be a little more blow than usual but it depends like if you're at home chilling smoking like how I'm doing right now sitting down and [ __ ] like you know just taking it easy then you're gonna feel some kind of lock because you're just gonna allow yourself to be in that relaxed state you know I'm saying so when they tell you the teen was our daytime strains in nighttime strains I mean there's truth to that but like you could smoke either or at any time of the day it really don't matter you know I mean if you're a new smoker yeah you're gonna be a lot more sensitive to these stronger buds but you'll be alright it's not like being drunk for the first time like for the longest I smoked weed way before I started drinking just because like I was introduced to this first and I never really been like AHA man I wonder what that tastes like I came upon the Weed Man and I just was like that for a minute and it wasn't till like I was like 19 or 18 and I really started drinking it was kind of like I didn't want to just because I didn't know how I was gonna act you know what I'm saying because people get belligerent you know I never seen anyone smoke weed and be acting stupid and crazy you know but there was a lot of friends that I had and just people that I've seen you know get stupid drunk and just be throwing up or like end up in jail all kind of wild [ __ ] man so but I started drinking issue but I'll drink that much no more at all I left that [ __ ] alone because I started to see that I was getting like heavy I started to feel like bloated and I wasn't feeling that like I was packing on some pounds like I'm really starting to slim down right now like getting back to how I was man and I really don't drink at all like the last time I really had a drink like that was like April and we are in February occasional beers hearing they're like on my birthday I've had like one or two the homies come thru I like one or two but I don't really chase that buzz no more like that all I care about is smoking is weak if I'm high I'm cool I don't even drink I could drink soda or whatever the foot so I got a blend I'm happy I'm cool all right guys I'm rambling man I gotta put this out cuz I got [ __ ] I got to

by Stevie he's been out for a few weeks now and first time I've been able to actually locate the cartridge and over here I come - our tangi about to switch it out real quick you know just to try the purple punch now this is one of their flavor strains normally their flavor strains will have a description on the top of the box now if there's no prominent flavors there now just be clear and pretty much we'll just have a loti cush taste to your oils alright so this purple punch was actually the last one my shop had so he came in clutch so cut this thing open all right like always tear a soil seal bubbles there appears to be no leaking no nothing looks mad cutter so far looks good alright let's try it out purple punch 1/2 gram indica tropical punch flavor Cheers we go clouds with the bigst Izzy big old battery alright so starting off the flavor is not that bad it's not overly empowering it's a little subtle as well if you hit sin and I don't feel as mellow and chill as a would feel with any other indica but we're still going to keep going yeah all right so I always tell you guys that with this big battery compared to the smaller stijn battery you don't need to take a Fathead with a few seconds you get a lot of product down so you feel like you just gotta be smart with how you smoke your oil if you're over here taking a blinker every hit then half grandma's not gonna suit you at all you might as well go for a full gram a full grabs dizzy can last me up to seven days that's what now having friends have a stash out of it once a day so yeah taste honestly I'll give it like a 8 out of 10 it's almost like a grape slushie it's not that bad so yeah later", "8gLu6aKZtmE": "[Music] damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel so this is another three chive delta eight vape cartridge review the last one that i did did so well that i just well i had to do another one if i release a video and it gets 800 hits or 800 views in a for like a week oh yeah i'm definitely doing another video so the one that i got is blue dream and it's a one milliliter container brand new sealed and that's how i like it and you can see right there it contains 95 percent eight delta eight th oil and then five percent of [ __ ] which you know whatever i guess you gotta i guess it can't be a hundred percent or it would probably just knock you on your ass and stuff uh the directions remove the silicone cover and screw into the battery do not over tighten take one puff and wait 20 minutes wow wait 20 minutes um usage is between one and two puffs let's see here i'm trying to focus it for you guys i can't focus it whatever uh says do not operate any machinery while using this product do not use if pregnant nursing or under the age of 21 this may cause a positive drug test well no [ __ ] oh my god uh let's see here if you need more typical usage it's one or two puffs do not operate wait a minute where's that one part at wait 20 minutes before determining if you need more oh okay 5 10 battery 100 percent hint driving contains 0.3 is that a 9 thc batch 6 out of 15 2021 batch id three chives fishery blah blah blah blah all right blue dream sweet so i have a couple other ones over here these are the fx these are delta eight fx cartridges um and i designed this little thing to keep them in the upright for me because sometimes i'll run out and these right here will be enough to get you by for a few days especially if you leave them in the upright these are this was like orange crush and like granddaddy purple if i remember correctly i didn't really care um for the granddaddy purple i do want to say one thing though there is a big difference between the ethics cartridge and the delta eight cartridges i feel like the delta eight cartridges these are put together better they just seem to be i don't know i don't have any leakage they hardly ever clog they just seem to be a better cartridge than the fx the fx are also a lot cheaper too these are like 30 something dollars and these are like 60 something dollars okay now the effects of this all right let's say you're sitting on the couch smoking a blunt there you go you're going to get high but this is great because you can be out public you could be in a mall walking around hitting this and people are just going to think that you're vaping and that's the beautiful part about it and it delivers i mean just one one good hit delivers like a serious bond grip i mean it's depending on your tolerance and how much you smoke it can get you really really really really really high um like for instance i got friends that do not smoke like me i consider myself to be a pothead meaning that i i blaze it up every day we smoke it down okay that's just me i've been like that for 20 years um but we're not talking about me this i hit it one time and i'm like whoo all right if i get somebody that doesn't smoke like me and they hit it they gotta sit down and sometimes they're out for the count like uh like i actually had one friend hit it and it ruined her whole night she felt like [ __ ] it just messed her up and then i had another buddy uh i mean it put his ass on the couch so i guess the effects is just different depending on who you are and how much you smoke but let me tell you what it's definitely worth it it's discreet nobody knows that you have it plus there's no smell like you blaze that [ __ ] up man you hit it pow pow pow you get a big old dragon's breath cloud and it don't smell like weed it's awesome you can take it to work that's the best part about it man is that there's no paraphernalia there's no weed nobody knows you have it on you the only way somebody's gonna know you have it is if they physically see it no smells man i i've been pulled over by the police and i had this on me he didn't even ask me not clean as a whistle goodbye give me my ticket leave awesome these things definitely have their benefits definitely and if you're going to have this you got to have a 510 battery okay this is an e-leaf very simple 510 battery plugs into the bottom i don't know an hour charge you're good to go all you do is you hold the button wait for it to get to about there and then you start hitting it hit it slow you're not trying to rip on it you're just trying to take a slow even deep breath and even that might be too much for you three child blue dream now one thing i did like about it was all they had so many selections for these and then they told you about what they did like this is a sativa brand um this is supposed to give you clarity um it's not supposed to make you foggy it's supposed to give you energy and make you awake and whatever whatever whatever like it claims what it is it's a um a sativa synthetic it's a blend of you know indica and this brand i mean like it tells you what they are and what they're mixed with their strands and everything so you really can't go wrong so it's not like you don't know what you're buying you know what i mean sorry if there's a little bit of an echo i'm trying to do this privately this is illegal in my state you know so you really don't want to be advertising what you're doing that's the other thing like a cop a cop knows what this is because this does not look like a typical vape that's the other thing that you need to be aware of this is very identifiable if they're a cop and they deal with this [ __ ] they've seen this before they will know exactly what you have in your hand so be aware of that uh your average person not so much you know i mean you go out for a cigarette break you hit it once or twice nobody's going to even say it or even notice it but be careful because police they they probably will know what the hell that is i mean because all vape cartridges come the same basically the same look you know all right we're actually starting to get to the meat and potatoes oh come on [ __ ] come on out now here's another thing i like is that they come with these uh get out damn it [ __ ] it's pressure treated uh is that they come with these plastic things right to keep them covered now when i transport mine for instance see like these these even have it on them when i transport them because sometimes i'll take this with me and then i'll take another flavor with me it's very important that you keep that cap on there all right because if you don't keep that cap on there lint and trash and garbage and other things that are in your pocket will get into these little holes and ports and you don't want that because that's going to mess everything up for you so it's very important that you keep these little plastic covers and if you want to even keep the mouthpiece because you know see like this mouthpiece see all the stuff that's in there that's from it being in my pocket like lint and trash and other things get up inside of that you know what i mean yeah you don't want that that's bad so definitely keep your plastic covers man you got to keep those and try to store it upright because if you laying it down you can take a good chance of it leaking and it'll this [ __ ] takes forever it's like molasses to go back in the upright um but let's let's plug it in and check it out not only that check out the quality this is the end cap that came off of the uh the new delta eight cartridge see it see how thick it is all right and then this is the end cap that comes now i ain't trying to knock the the fx vapes i'm just trying to justify the 30 something dollars more that they want for the vape you know [Music] all right and then here's theirs see what i'm saying see the difference look at the difference in the caps big difference this one's nice and meaty and this one's real thin and kind of cheesy looking but uh you know i guess that's part of the difference is that you get better coverage with it also when i bought these these just come in like kind of like this thing here uh but it doesn't have anything covering the mouthpiece the mouthpiece is wide open so but with these you get a mouthpiece covered which is nice because like i said i transport these in my pocket and stuff so yeah you know what that um this this right here it kind of it kind of sneaks up on you god damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high yeah one hit y'all one hit damn yeah see i can go in there right now smoke a few bowls that [ __ ] won't get me like how i am right now good god oh [ __ ] all right yes um forgot what i was saying yep don't remember now okay so back to what i don't remember i was talking about y'all need to get this i don't know what else to tell y'all three chive delta eight vapes leave me a comment subscribe to my channel check out my other videos i build computers and do all kinds of custom water cooling and technology stuff so you all need to come and check that out check out my channel i appreciate y'all for watching", "-sOue_y2hRE": "oh yeah what's good youtube today guys little video man you guys it's gonna be another cartridge of you usually on Fridays I was gonna start putting up logs man but I got something special for you guys coming soon and when that comes in the middle imma shoot you guys the sickest vlog of 2019 dude I swear so as you guys can see by the title of the video man we needed a coffin one thing that I was excited for man one thing I never thought would be on the market dude ever so we went out of our way and then I'm sorry I'm just trying to look for the picture of it but thank you guys it doesn't matter so we went out of our way hitting my delivery service it yes don't know I do delivery services more than I go into dispensaries because I have to delivery services around my area they're licensed and I was like you know what it's cool man i like using delivery service because you get rewards points things like that and then the only bad thing is honestly it's just the [ __ ] delivery fees that they charge but you know if you're chilling at your house you don't want to drive 20 minutes to dispensary you just call them up so right here I ended up hold on let me just cross on my name I ended up ordering a full gram raw garden berry what is it berry punch one of their new ones and he came out to 68 68 o2 or something like that yeah so 60 and 70 so I'm like I think I'm one of the first people to review it on YouTube I'm not 100% sure on that don't quote me on that but hopefully I'm that'd be pretty sick so get rid of it right into the packaging man this is it right here all right I'm gonna show you guys a little closer so raw garden berry punch cart this is the new one by the way usually they come out and um the little small boxes I don't have them anymore I threw them all away but yeah they come out in these boxes tells you everything you need to know and then right here it's an indica hybrid and then yeah right here is usually where they have all the the lab test results and etc' you know let's go ahead and open this up yeah like I said berry punch cart I hate the stickers on this though because it's nearly impossible to open the box without like ripping it open dude and sometimes you know just sometimes I like to freak look look at this this stickers just stuck on there way too hard rock garden come on bro like I shouldn't be having to struggle this hard to open a package so Rygaard and rip it right through the bottom boom Oh already drop the boys so we're our garden right here doesn't have their normal logo usually has a raw garden logo right here but these are the new full grams so let's go ahead the first unboxing for you guys right here let's get it oh come on down on that on first off you get that big big big air bow right there which is whatever you know but look at that beauty dude look at that beauty sure we fall to the just that little air bubble obviously they suck up the the coil sucks up the some of the freaking juice so that's why you see it not fall all the way oh yeah man we're gonna get we're just gonna have to get straight into this nothing flew all right so back to the normal setup let me just go ahead and put this away real quick and we'll get straight into the review so they give you this usually it so you don't get stuff inside the mouthpiece cuz it if it bugs but let me show you guys before I get into smoking this I'm gonna show you guys this cool little invention that I got from one of my homies so basically what it is it's a carb cap not a carb cap by a protection cap for your for your carts and all you have to do is just slide it on top put it on the bottom and then I mean that's pretty much it obviously you can go up higher if you have a full gram which is this is a full gram that's why it looks like stretched out but yeah that's pretty neat I mean if I do say so myself if they come out and different colors dude that would be sick like maybe like an orange one red blue and then yeah so no late getting in here nothing coming out at all so but just take it off and it holds on there that way you're not losing it like with this piece with the piece that they give you right here you can keep putting it on and off you know but eventually you're gonna lose it you're gonna put it somewhere and you're gonna be like I forgot where I loved it so a berry punch man who already tastes the [ __ ] berries in the punch shit's insane bro so screw this on it we got on the handy-dandy raw garden battery I'm gonna go ahead and take this off I don't really need it right now show you guys how it sits flush on this very nice if you guys have never seen the raw garden battery it's pretty much it has a raw garden logo right there at the bottom yeah that's pretty dude that's pretty so boom first hit for the boys and the girls because I know people or if I can commenting you know you need to do it for the girls I mean I just don't care about the girls you know I'm a married man but yeah this one's for the girls and the boys so cheers guys this is a really it's pretty liquidy no like insanely that one snow now and just snuck up on me neato AG alright so for the initial hit I don't even know what just happened ooh that cough attack got me so we're gonna take another hit and then we're switch it to the whose battery and then usually when I get on the use of batteries when I get the full effects of the raw garni cards so here's another hit for us alright so listen just hits you and it isn't my first time smoking today - alright I haven't smoked since yesterday morning it's already been more than a full day so whoo so right off the bat the taste that I'm getting is like yeah a very very propyl punch taste I'm not getting and none of them the like the whole on yeah I forgot what what kind of car cheese's is in the berries I don't really get that much of a berry taste you know it's more of the purple punch if you guys are no purple punch it has such a pungent it overpowers anything honestly all the all the strings that I've ever seen crossed with purple punch are like the purple punch dominance so I don't know man I feel like purple punch just isn't one of those strains that you should be crossing others with you know so right here got the battery my favorite battery if you guys didn't know that nice and flush no I'm not super flush but almost there but sitting nice and Danny on this I'm gonna put it down to three point three we're gonna take another rip so far2 rips in and a lot has gone by so this with that with the full grams man I'm happy about him though like I hated the fact that with the half grams like they just go so fast like I understand technically it's the same thing you know to have grams and it makes a full gram but whenever I would just like hit the five grams I feel it would be gone within a day so I love it so cheers guys no no way and it's dead dude it's dead oh wait is it no no I mean all right so we're gonna put this to charge real quick sorry about that guys but I literally thought I charged it I didn't think I was using it that much so we're gonna charge it for like let's just say five minutes and then we'll keep using the raw garden for now gonna try to whip the coil a little bit more see if we get any more flavors the Terps though Oh hold on hold on this is this is this has been in the back of my head since the video started well since I started hitting this so just thinking that I hit though it's amazing dude I'm kind of I I kind of get that that berry it kind of reminds me of the three bears in the three bears cartridge it tastes very very similar I t's very very similar to that without a doubt but I like it I want like the three bears has to be my favorite one out of all of them and combining with purple punch you know it's kind of like oh my god it's an orgasm in the mouth so oh just take another sip of the water I hope you guys are having an amazing day this is gonna be a late late upload it is Friday I didn't purchase anything you know this week other than that Jenny extracts that I had to make a video on on Monday it's just been a busy week for me man but we're back on track things are gonna get done the next video hopefully hopefully there's gonna be the puffs coat man I shot the O so the people when you're watching comment send him the puffs CO and my boy my boy Garrett will know what that like exactly what to do it does it so type in the chat if he has you have gotten this far put send him the puffs CO and then yes hopefully we'll be seeing a puff Co within a couple of days so we're gonna be having a phat session let me know what you guys want me to get us obviously some raw garden but other than that if you guys have any recommendations on waxes let me know do please know bunk [ __ ] though won't take another day for you guys this is the last one until we wait for the booze battery but so far man this this cart is amazing I love the one gram cards I've never seen it I've never seen anything this this perfect you know other than my wife yeah that is an amazing flavor but as you can see right there I don't know if you guys can see that but yeah that back gap in the top you can expect that with raw garden dude like that's what I was saying like imagine getting a half gram cart and then boom it's pretty much already gone so I'm showing that this this this has me ad like I would say an 8.5 i haven't even hit the the whose battery yet though that's usually a sleeper for me but yeah hey before we get onto that though I want to give a quick shout out to the supporters to the new people here especially you guys are making my thing blow up or it we just hit 16 came in so that's a good that's cool and then hopefully reaching 20k soon shout out to everyone we're gonna keep working hard you know achieving that goal achieving everything that we have envisioned for this channel and more so cheers to that you know I'm sorry that were so interested to who's better you know alright so who's let's get it three point three men here's another deal for some reason it's still blinking maybe it's not dead maybe it has something to do with the cartridge itself I don't really see how though let me see your fingers I don't know if that works but I mean island cye all right let's try to turn it up to 3.5 yeah doesn't work I had to fill the first cartridge that doesn't work on there whose battery so I guess we're just gonna have to stick with the raw later boys mm-hmm so is it likes a nice oh I can't I just really wanted to use it on a variable wattage battery I'll probably end up busting on another one probably make some videos on Instagram for you guys like with some batter you should go follow me on Instagram have backwood a D and then I'll keep you guys updated with batteries that are good for these cards because these carts burn dude like do not use this battery it'll burn through your car within a day actually you know if you're if you're a heavy smoker like within a day its you're gone so one more for you guys I'm gonna get done with the review post this video up and you blah blah blah and get your weekend started yeah heavy heavy three bears now I don't know if that's what they meant when they met Barry White our berry punch I mean but if it is nice raw garden this is definitely a ten out of ten in terms of quality and taste the Hyatt that I'm getting on it's honestly amazing dude is it I haven't been it might be just good it's my first smoker than like in over a day but I don't know it's amazing it has me chilling right now so definitely I would bump it up back up I had at 8.5 I think now it's at a 9.5 definitely could use a little it doesn't have that maybe if I take another hit it'll give me to attend but I'm cool off the you guys gotta know your new limits you know I already hit this thing like seven times so yeah overall raw garden great product the new full grams are amazing um like I said go follow me on Instagram I'm gonna let you guys know if they leak anything you guys will be the first to hear but I'm only gonna be using it on my raw garden battery if anything on with a I'm gonna switch to a variable wattage and then I'm just gonna use it very scarcely because it like I said it does burn but yeah overall 10 out of 10 must cup you guys could go cup like copy delivery services if you guys are in Hesperia the rehab rehab is a very good one that's kind of that's where I got this one so yeah am I in this video here guys if you guys enjoyed it make sure you go hit that like comment sub you all know y'all know the deal man and have a blessed weekend boys and girls", "yjm0Avm9fY8": "[Music] greetings everybody this is a Chicago cannabis connoisseur and I'm coming at you with another Sunday strain review this Sunday I'll be reviewing the strained purple punch purple points is an indica dominant hybrid and was bred by combining two strain Larry OG and this strain granddaddy purp hence where it gets his purple color from I've noticed this strain is very popular amongst growers in cannabis those enthusiasts alike and I can see why the dense trichome development and this wonderful purple color it's very appealing to the eye and the smell is also appealing I would describe the smell is similar it's a great candy or grape soda with a hand of pepper to it maybe a little bit of pine and this strain is strong with the average of 20% TAC 1% CBD some say it's hard if I had to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 I will probably rate it maybe a 6 or a 7 all the normal already enjoyed this strain and wish I would have done a review before I smoked the restaurants so you could have seen how beautiful it was", "hAeL-nK-FBE": "what up and welcome to another edition of canopy where we are bringing to you honest and unbiased cannabis strain review so today we are going to be reviewing purple punch by sonoran roots now you guys purple punch is no stranger to me but if it is new to you i want to go ahead and i want to start by talking about it so purple punch is an indica strain that is a cross between two powerhouses from the purple uh the perks genetics which are larry og is one parent and the other parent is grand daddy purple so two huge powerhouses from the purpose department coming together to create this purple punch the one two punch so before we get into this review i'm gonna bring this stuff up on the screen and then we will go ahead and jump right into this okay so what did you guys think of this purple punch by sonoran roots you guys i honestly think this stuff looks amazing but let's go ahead break this bag open and see what this stuff is all about wow immediately first things first you guys i am just punched in the face with sweet fruity terpenes you guys if you haven't watched my strain review for tropical heat or tropic fire by 22 red the tropical heat was by sonoran roots the tropic fire is by 22 red it smells a lot like that very fruity you guys very sweet smelling and honestly it smells like tropical like sweet um so man i really really love those terpenes and wow you guys this stuff is so frosty it almost looks white and let me take out one of the nugs that we were looking at there on camera so you guys can see it here get a load of this thing you guys let me get out of the way and see if i can't show you what this bud looks like you guys those orange hairs are so bright they almost look neon you guys and this butt is like covered with these purple undertones which are beautiful i see there's like one dark green leaf there there's a neon like light light lime green leaf this is like literally stuff is multi-colored but mostly purple and it is just beautiful this bud structure is amazing trimmed right up to the bud all of the leaves they did a great job trimming this stuff and god that sweet smell is amazing amazing and you guys i picked this stuff up for 35 dollars for an eighth you guys so at 70 on the quarter at 140 on the half and then 280 on the ounce this stuff if it hits could be the deal of a century um because sonoran roots does put out high quality blood now most of the buds were those little small popcorn size buds but i did get two or three that were a little bigger than popcorn size so man this stuff looks great it smells great i can't wait to see if it translates and it hits really hard as well so today i'm gonna be enjoying this purple punch from sonoran roots out of my air riser extreme q desktop vaporizer i've got this bad boy set to 375 degrees fahrenheit you guys see it just came to temp there and then i'm going to take the whipping that i plug into the vape and that has the screen on it so that was just clean you guys that's going to go into the vape itself i have one more male end that is going to go into my scientific inhalations triple filtered bubbler now with the triple filtered bubbler you guys the first chamber actually sits here in the down stem that's where carbon goes i've left that out because no ash will be getting into my second chamber which is basically just some brand new purified water and as always i put a brand new organic cotton filter into this piece to filter out any remaining impurities so i know i said triple filter bubbler i'm using it as a double bubbler uh or dual filtration bubbler but i'm so excited to get right into this and try out some of this purple pudge we've been really impressed with sonoran roots before so let's see if they knock this one out of the park again and see what this stuff is all about okay so here's the deal guys the first rip was very very subtle i barely got any vapor at all from that one because i think this thing is just starting to get going so i'm gonna go ahead let's start round two and see what happens with this flavor on this purple punch by sonoran roots okay so you guys here's the deal just being full frontal and honest with you guys that second rip still didn't produce all that much vapor now just kind of to give you um a little bit of reason why that might be happening is i didn't let this bud heat up quite as long like just sit on the vapor vaporizer to kind of warm up quite as long as normal i'm about a minute or two behind so that might be one of the reasons that it's not releasing all those vapers just yet like the flavors that i'm getting you guys personally are kind of just um like they're sweet but they are not overwhelming by any means you guys so um yeah i like i don't really have a lot to report on the flavor because it's just very subtle so far so what i'm gonna do you guys is i'm gonna go ahead i am going to bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under a 25 times macro lens you can get a little bit of a better up close and personal view of this stuff while i'm finishing out the bowl to see what happens with this flavor and to see what the potency and all the other effects are like on this stuff so here it comes now so check out the purple punch by sonoran roots you guys oh my gosh i know this stuff is called purple punch and you guys can see that purple all over the butt here but i think the star of the show are those bright neon orange hairs you guys oh my gosh are those beautiful and look at how they are just surrounded by trichomes you guys this bud is so beautiful i feel like i'm staring into a rainbow there's hints of light green there's that leaf that's kind of right in the center of the bud that's got this dark green the bud has those beautiful purple undertones and then surrounded again by all the neon orange hairs and the trichomes which in my opinion are in great proportion plenty of both truthfully this stuff looks wicked all right so you guys just got done checking out this purple punch by sonoran root so what did you guys think under that macro lens honestly you guys i think it looked unfreezing believable in my professional opinion but you guys this strain is crazy there is so much going on with this purple punch and honestly i'm like i i have a few different areas that i'm kind of a little bit torn in and i want to get right into those but you guys before i do that i kind of want to run down how i rate all of my strains and how we review these and then we'll go ahead and as soon as i explain that i'll let you guys know what my final rundown is on this purple punch so all of the strains are rated on a scale from 0 to 10 0 being the lowest 10 being the highest i break that down into four different categories the look the smell the taste and the potency or how effective this medicine is right each of those categories can earn up to 2.5 points each in its respective category and at the end i'll go ahead and tally up the points that i give to each and assign to each category and then we'll give this purple punch by sonoran roots our final rundown so i want to start by talking about the bag appeal or the look of this stuff so i'm going to go ahead i'm going to bring it up on the screen one more time for you guys to check out and then we'll go ahead and jump into my final rating on this stuff okay so you guys have seen it multiple times you guys i don't think i need to harp on it anymore because honestly i think this purple punch speaks for itself truthfully you guys this bud looks amazing there's no question about it it is absolutely beautiful it's frosty it's hairy it's got these dense nice little nugs um and you know i could tell that they were just trimmed perfectly you guys this stuff does not look like it went through a machine and even if it did go through a hand trimming excuse me an auto trim machine the machine did a good job it removed all the you know crap leaf material and yeah maybe you lost some trichomes but honestly you guys from a looks perspective out of 2.5 i'm going to give this 2.5 because there's nothing that they could have done better in my opinion from the times that i've seen purple punch this is done outstanding um and i really i don't think there's any room for improvement so 2.5 out of 2.5 in the look we are off to a good start now you guys the smell second i break the bag open this tropical fruity sweet flavor it just like blasts you it's loud like i can hold my my nose away from the back and it's still smelling which means if i keep this bag open it'll stink up this room you guys those turfs are so loud they're so sweet they're so unique and like it doesn't smell like perps you guys so if you guys are buying this bag expecting to smell like that quintessential purp smell that's not what you're gonna get here you're gonna get a very sweet sweet flavor and it's just gonna be tropical and fruity like you're sipping on some sort of mixed drink at the beach you guys or a mixed smoothie at the beach um so 2.5 out of 2.5 from the smell there's no way it's gonna get any better in my opinion from a smell perspective like they're loud the terps smell good sweet and fruity if that's something you guys are into so we are off to a perfect start it's five for five right now now let's go into the taste you guys you saw my first two rips the vapor was very very subtle it wasn't very dense and i have this set to 375 degrees fahrenheit you so you guys when i have it set to 375 degrees fahrenheit the reason i have it there is because that should pull out all of the flavors like low temp vaping starts at 350 and then um you know 375 is about the middle and then 400 being about the high so like you guys when i'm at 375 it should be pulling out all of the flavors and you know the flavor was just very subtle it was that sweetness a tiny bit of pine on the back end as i kind of had even in the smell of this stuff um just a tiny tiny tiny bit you wouldn't even get it until after you blew out if you gave yourself a chance to kind of catch it um you know but it's mostly sweet it's mostly fruity um and you know the thing is with this stuff you guys is that it wasn't very pronounced like that was what i was bummed out about you guys was why wasn't the flavor super pronounced like it was subtle and it just kind of died off and went to like you know more of the plant material as the bowl progressed so that was kind of a bummer for me you guys honestly and i'm going to decrease at one full point just for that alone um so only a 1.5 out of 2.5 from the taste department i think there's room for improvement from the flavor of this stuff and i bet you i bet you you guys i know what would happen if you rolled up a j of this stuff like it would be good at the very first quarter to maybe 40 and then 50 of the way through it would just be bad i know it i know it and that i think there's that's something i don't like you know so i'm telling you i think that there's room for improvement there um but the potent to you guys it's effective medicine it's clean medicine now i know this says that it's in indica um and while my body is super chilled out my mind is actually pretty darn clear so like i'm getting a little bit more of a hybridy effect i would say for somebody who's doesn't have a tolerance you know this stuff is going to hit hard it's going to hit strong but for me somebody that has a tolerance like this isn't the strongest most potent medicine that i've puffed you know especially on an indica strain like it should put me down a little bit more but i do have that kind of like nice kind of this is not the annoying beanie type like squeezing on my head it's just kind of like softly there and noticeable um so just a little bit of kind of floatier dreaminess in the head but again i'm still pretty clear-minded to be honest i don't find myself like um grasping for words or lost in thought or daydreaming or anything so pretty focused actually but my body is very mellowed out and very chilled out and honestly i mean for 35 bucks you guys that's unbelievable so a 2.0 in the potency and not a 2.5 so you guys if you were following we were running five for five uh from the look 2.5 the smell 2.5 and then the taste is when it went downhill that's a 1.5 and then 2.0 for the potency so i gave it an 8.5 you guys i was out of nine i was going to give it a two in the taste but you know i think honestly the fact that the bowl kind of died those flavors were a little more subtle i had to decrease at a full point there and give it an 8.5 and the closest thing i told you to have i had to relate this to was like that last batch of the tropic fire by 22 red which i think was a nine and i think those flavors were just a little stronger um when i was smoking like not a little stronger they were significantly stronger when i was puffing it and they were they lasted throughout the bowl so i'm gonna uh i'm going to experiment with some low temp vapings maybe at 350 see if that flavor can improve a little bit which honestly it might be able to but again i still don't think this was better than that tropic fire um that i had but i'll tell you this you guys for 35 bucks if you're between the 22 red for 50 and this purple punch for 35 from health for life my tropic fire i picked up at soul dispensary in tempe go to hell for life spend 35 bucks and you know you're saving 15 bucks that is a huge amount almost 33 or maybe more you know 35 it's a great deal you guys i love this purple punch sonoran roots so stoked about their strains honestly i'm trying to get in there you guys to do an interview do a tour of the facility get them on the show and honestly i'm gonna keep working to make that happen because honestly i like what these guys are doing i think they're one of the fastest growing cultivators in the state and i'm really excited to see what they put out so absolutely thumbs up here from us for the purple punch by sonoran roots um but have you guys tried it do you guys think my 8.5 is fair you know i've recently had a lot of people kind of going back and forth with me on like oh you gave this or that like a nine or whatever and i wanna entertain those conversations you guys if you guys think my strain reviews are completely off or whatever leave your comments below you guys i wanna engage in that conversation let's have that conversation and see like where do you guys think i'm going wrong is it the looks was i giving it too hi there or was it the taste or whatever but it's like you know somebody was like recently saying and i don't want to call anybody out but it's like oh you know like you're giving a nine or a ten you know it's like a six or whatever it's like you know this should be a 20 out of ten whatever and it's like you guys here's the deal okay like we're all entitled to our own opinions i don't think that i'm the end all say all be all we all like what we like and we don't like what we don't like and if something doesn't jive with me it doesn't mean it's not going to jive with you and you guys got to take into account the fact that i do consider the fact that these strains are the prices that they are when i'm giving these final reviews you guys so like the price i know i don't have a category for price but you guys like there has to be some consideration there you know when i'm reviewing these strains you guys so um some of the strains that i give high reviews like this i'm going to give a higher review it's like i don't think like it deserves an 8.5 but like the fact that it's 35 bucks like it could be a nine because of that you know and i didn't give it a nine i gave it an 8.5 but again i just kind of wanted to throw that out there and again you guys let me know if you disagree i want you guys to be part of this channel and to help improve and you know see this thing while it grows from its grassroots so um you know again do you guys think my my rating is fair go out and try some pick some up and let me know what you guys think but if there's any streams you guys want to see me reviewed leave those in the comments below as well but you guys that's gonna do it for us and until the next one you guys take care of yourselves and one another and i will see you guys soon peace", "fC5Kh6H5M5Y": "[Music]

soon guys peace [Music] you", "4YGrQaN6hBA": "[Music] what is going on you guys so truly just put out there new CEO to bait pin earlier this week and I stopped by and I grabbed one this is what we're used to seeing from truly right now usual truly packaging co2 bait pen says on top co2 this is what we usually see from truly for a co2 vape pen but now we have their new open vape reserve co2 distillate cartridge bait pen so in this video we're going to go over the difference between these two pins we're gonna say this is jacker rare right here I have jacker rare from the open bait so if I have two of these co2 pins that are the same strain what's the difference between the two so we'll go over that today but first we're gonna check out their Instagram right here you can see their Instagram and here's my Instagram as well in case you guys have never seen it this is a great page to follow as well I post on here all the time and I show you new stuff that's getting ready to come out and it's a great place to see sneak peeks for videos that are coming out you ever want to contact me this is the place to do it and I even put you guys in some of the videos to go check it out alright so here's their Instagram page as you can see here at the top they are High Times Cannabis Cup winner and they are in several different states Arizona California Colorado new New Mexico of that and Florida being their newest warm we got three strains for right now San Fernando Valley oh gee which is a hybrid Jack Herer which is a sativa and Master Kush which is a indica so the one thing that I saw on here that I wanted to show you guys was the cartridge that it comes in the Saran cartridge think this is supposed to be the newest version of a C cell which means it has a ceramic ceramic coil which will help burn the product better than a wit coil I know a lot of times with wit coils they can burn out real easy but with this ceramic oil you won't have that problem this is just the newest version of C cell truly uses C cells for most of their babes except for their cheapest distillate faith and their true pod so it says this cartridge is supposed to deliver up to 110 percent larger hits I'm not exactly sure what they're comparing this to but it seems to hit about the same as a regular C cell from B and you also have the open 2.0 battery which you can get if you like you don't have to get this battery this cartridge will screw on to any 510 thread battery alright so let's check out what all we get when we purchase the bait cartridge so we have that then it comes in a separate little two as you can see here open bait and right here it has the terpenes listed the dominant terpenes are turpino lean trans carry opaline and our lemony and the cartridge is coming in at 87% THC and 0.4% CBD total so to open you simply squeeze the sides and it will slide out just like that nice tip I like the tip on it it's a plastic hard plastic type tip that looks like glass but it is plastic on the bottom you have your little cap to keep it from leaking we won't need that anymore and this oil in here looks great too i mean it's some really good looking product inside of here so you can see it's really nice [Music] so as you guys can see right here this is as full as the cartridge is they say that that's headspace where it has go as gone into the coil but I remember the first time I got one of these I actually had to get it going before the oil was even in the coil that's the only thing that I see so far as it looks like they could fill the cartridges a little bit more and I have had this same problem with these cartridges they're just not quite as full as they could be that's the only thing that I don't like about these half Graham carts is it doesn't seem like I'm getting the full product for the price that I'm paying I mean if I'm buying a full gram of this stuff I'm paying you 110 dollars just make it full at least and I have seen them completely full so I mean that whole headspace thing to me just doesn't make sense so let's try it out I'm just gonna screw it on to my favorite battery as you can see here it's a 5-10 thread it will screw on to any 510 battery and you can also see it says jupiter-c cell that's how you can identify if you have a real C cell it will say Jupiter on it just like that alright you guys so everything you've seen so far has been recorded over the last couple of days and I've really had a good chance to try this product out now and I really like it it's a good product but I'm not quite sure I like it better than the co2 bait cartridge right here from truly do like how hard the new C cell hits it does rip really good check this out [Music] nice hit hmm so and then rips really good you can get really nice rips off of this especially with an adjustable battery which is what I have here it's an adjustable battery goes from 4.8 bolts down to 3.8 bolts in a 3.3 volt so that way you have a choice of what temperature you take your head out and how big of a hit you take and that's kind of similar to the 2.0 pin that they have as well I'm sure it's just a little bit more pricier than the one I have here so if this was a jack herer cartridge what would be the difference between these two cartridges since they're both co2 cartridges well this company right here open they have some award-winning strains that they have and they have the terpene profiles on them so that terpene profile is basically what the difference is between these two things right here you of course have different phenotypes of plants you may have jack or air and jack or air so they're gonna be two different phenotypes and they're gonna have two different types of terpenes in them this is just the terpene profile for their phenotype of Jack Herer so what is a phenotype well to make it easy basically not every plant is the same and every different plant is a phenotype and some are better than others and this is why sometimes you guys will see let's say blue dream and it will be really nice-looking and then other times you'll see blue dream and it won't be as nice-looking it's because it's two different plants and you have two different phenotypes we'll get into all that some other time but you guys did want to know one other question and there is one other difference on this product let's jump back on this screen real quick and check this out all right so I'm on true leaves Instagram here and in the comments of one of their pictures from this new product someone asked as anyone tried these what can we expect are there any cutting agents so truly the answers with cut with nothing but terpenes so everybody wants to know of course what these terpenes come from are they fruit food terpenes or the cannabis terpenes so we see right here that the answer they will be botanical or fruit terpenes basically and down here we see some people are not really excited that they are not cannabis Dr terpenes like the co2 pin the co2 pin from truly has cannabis derived terpenes and right here in this message they tell me one is botanical and their co2 pin is cannabis derived terpenes now true leaf also has to do this with any other things that are distilled that of course is a different process than the co2 distillate but regular distillate who has the terpenes added to it to recreate that strain the profile of that strain this is why they came out with the co2 true clear or distillate is because they are using food grade or botanical terpenes and the regular distillate and that is pretty common practice around the country but the co2 distillate has cannabis derived terpenes in it regular distillate does not have any terpenes in it until they are introduced back into it because it is cooked off during the distillation process and is basically just raw THC without any terpene profile to it at all and it is built from there you guys may have remembered a little while back when they came out with Gainesville green this actually is a strain from a long time ago long time Florida strain from way back when was supposedly lost about 30 years ago well this is how the strain was recreated they actually went to Naiya being godfather of gainesville green and had him approved the terpene profile for Gainesville green and that is where we got it from this is actually derived from gorilla grapes though and this is why you don't see any Gainesville green actual flower in the dispensary because only the terpene profile is available for it and only Rick nya supposedly knows it so that's enough for right now take that in and let me know down in the comments what you guys think would you rather have food grade terpenes or cannabis derived terpenes keep in mind both of these products are half grams and they both cost fifty five dollars I hope you guys liked the video give it a thumbs up if you did and subscribe below to learn some more we'll see you guys next time [Music] [Music] [Music]",

was almost a little bit over 50 bucks almost not over 60 though so I'm really excited these cartridges are new they just hit my dispensary I looked them up on Instagram I have like 2000 followers so they're just like kind of new to the market as well but these these are like alright these are game changers you know as you guys can see the on the side that says it what's a sale man it says less than the 2 v battery you know you don't to burn it and it says distillate free guys this is not a distillate cartridge this is a straight liquid diamond sauce car I've never had a liquid diamond sauce card I've never seen a review on YouTube there was only one guy who did a review there IRS's it's an ice cream cake and yeah this should be pretty bomb you know the it's full gram I don't know where these guys in their Humboldt County so yeah guys we're gonna get in straight to so you have this little button here press this button hey let me show you guys a little close-up ice cream cake and it's a 76 percent THC what I think yeah 76 percent so yeah guys this is pretty dope you know the everyone that the shot was telling these are pretty far and we're gonna go ahead and see I'm gonna I'm gonna let you guys know I love rock garden and [ __ ] but I'm gonna see if these are better than raw garden so you know I've never had a liquid diamond sauce car which it says there is pretty dope you know so if you guys ever see these be on the lookout so as a little button there and you got impress it and you gotta twist it off slow sticker pull out I don't break the damn thing oh [ __ ] Wow looks pretty dope guys so we're glad mom how do you do this do you just pop it up just pop it out and bam down this is a pre feels pretty good no nice and heavy the oil looks pretty decent you know it looks kind of different from what other cartridges would look like gots nice little day in there but you get a full ground because I I was reading their information on Instagram as well you know if there's a big day is because the Okoye in there has a nice big koala as you guys can see you know it's a pretty nice big coil in there so it's what it does is the coil sucks up some of the oil in there so that's what put some damp but you guys took it you're full ground you know I'm saying yeah I ain't getting ripped off or nothing like that so like I said these this is probably like the second Ursula review on YouTube guys there's gonna be you know these cartridges just hit the market so I don't know how long they've been out but I heard they taste like exactly like [ __ ] like if you're taking adapt hey you know what I mean like straight really it's it's is it I'm think no distillate so I'm gonna flip it over hold it for a little bit this is a distillate free cartridge guys it's just gonna be fire as [ __ ] it was like 55 bucks you know out here 55 bucks for cartridges it's kind of expensive you know and with tax on top of that so we're to be him I'm going to try hit those imma see if I have some flavors but I'm sorry you do get a little clean taste like a live resin like what's it called like a raw garden would taste like so you don't really get like in a specific flavor to it now I want to let you guys know um I just hit that criteria for for YouTube to be for my channel to be monetized so I'm not really really excited you know I'm really hoping you know the channel pays off that we can help the channel grow buy more products and [ __ ] like that so you know for you guys and as if it wasn't for you guys I would never got my channel monetize you know it's [ __ ] crazy so if you guys ever see ads on the videos don't [ __ ] skip them guys watch those ads watch them all please it really helped me a lot in the channel but thank you guys you know you guys are awesome so we're just gonna go numb we're going to hit this and I'm let you guys know if it's really worth it or not you know what I mean but cheers guys if you guys are smoking out with me go ahead and do so take a little hit just to get some flavors I could taste it oh wow the flavors guys I would describe it is if you guys took a literally a [ __ ] DAP it oh wow that's crazy so it literally tastes like some real real wax guys they don't taste like a cartridge you know this thing is amazing the flavor I would describe it like if you would take like a literally a dab of the raw garden taste like waxy clean taste to it it's [ __ ] bomb but you don't really get like an ice cream it's an ice cream cake strain so you don't really get the ice cream cake in it but you do really get this like I could cushy like a clean taste cushy taste it is so good it tastes so clean I'm gonna go ahead and hit this again I might hit it a little longer and try and kill myself at awaken Bay but cheers guys hope you guys are smiling on with me mo oh wow most definitely I will be getting some more of these this one's only flavored they had it was a ice cream cake I'm not heard they had like a banana oh gee they have a lemon tree but I'm I shot the only Hodgins ice cream cake but if you guys ever see this ice cream cake you guys got a copy I'm not [ __ ] around with you I'm over-exaggerating it sings fire I'm not playing it tastes exactly like [ __ ] dab it tastes so like that's so real like it's crazy I'm sure you guys the packaging again so you guys can see you know it's distillate free or 100% cannabis which is pretty dope you know the thing these are game changers right here you know liquid diamond sauce cards these are actually liquid diamond sauce cars not no [ __ ] and the cartridge itself you know they got to it's really cool they got the nice new ceramic tip on there everything's ceramic on the cartridge I'm pretty sure cuz it looks pretty dope guys so if you guys if you guys want to go on Instagram and look up Ursa to get some more information or you know just to check the cartridges out for you guys itself and I also seen some cartridges that had like some fuzziness and they're like they actually know like I had some actual accidents so it just depends on the cartridge you guys get well but hope you guys are ready for that Super Bowl if you got a Niner fans like this

guys stay tuned I'm gonna be coming up with a new beat as I said and yeah", "NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "wwLFNAGRECk": "[Music] l will make the beat down welcome to my channel welcome to this hippie headband channel this is a channel where we review carts and we review beat moments now before anything I want to start by saying thank you so much for taking this time out of your day to come watch this video thank you so much now today we got a little special product for you guys last video I did a little dancreep review purple punch not gonna lie to you change it changed my perspective on take beeps was not bad at all but now today you know we came in we came through with another dispensary [ __ ] I got two products for you guys today but I'm only gonna be reviewing one we got the new kingpins this is the Skywalker og which is an indica this is the gelato which is a hybrid now these are the new newest newest boxes so before I open this up I'm gonna show you guys how to make sure that you know if you get these new boxes and how not to get scammed so with these new boxes [Music] instead of having the seal that was more of you know it was it was kind of patched on this is fully printed on so this is on here you can't scratch that off for nothing like this this is on the actual box it still has all the same information it still has the manufacturer date the best body the batch number everything like that you know I'm saying and of course ingredients just cannabis oil and then of course one second draw is a single-serving you know they always say that but you know for today let's try out this gelato so today we're gonna be trying out this gelato kingpin next time why have the Skywalk OG the reason why don't want to do the Skywalker og just just as yet I had the Skywalker og strain and man oh man it is a night night hitter like the Skywalk OG is very strong in - that's the thing was trying to have you do it just it just have you all types are completely gone so let me start right here by Samuel it says on here this is July - of course a thousand milligrams the THC amount is seventy seven point 38 percent total THC is seven hundred and seventy-three point seventy six milligrams there's zero point thirty percent CVD and it's 2.99 excuse milligrams of CVD so push I already know C so don't judge me we're using a plastic knife today to open these up yeah sorry for that that didn't work so we're doing the crackhead way the only choices now if y'all haven't have this tool you need to use this please don't use this tool I done damaged up the box oh yeah I forgot whole sides both sides both sides now a lot of people was saying that with the kingpins you can get the stickers online don't be real with you for you to try to take this thicker Zoff as you can see watch I'm trying to take a sticker off and show you guys you can tell if it's tampered with you see how dingy and everything on top of that looks already so you can put like no and look I've ripped it off and you see what happened the whole bottom came on you bro you you know what you didn't when you know what you're getting this very very hard to do it with that look and I rip off the other side look what happened same thing with the other side you can't just rip you know rip them apart put a new one in there these kingpins are different they're different I mess with them heavy heavy heavy oh okay okay with these new boxes they went back with the regular black of course got the insert [Music] [Applause] [Music] got that my stinker there it is right there as you guys can see of course has the grommet of course has the grommet on each side just take off the holes take off the top let's take off the bottom this one no leakage at all I mean the last one was months and months and months old I live on the East Coast so to ship it and whatever it's been stored it kind of makes sense that it was a little bit of leakage so you know for that last King and it kind of makes sense with no leakage at all for this which should be expected the fact that it only has been manufactured about a month ago and other thing about the king pins where I don't know if you guys could really see but what the king pins being on here there's an actual physical reflection that's all in the back of it that reflects everything that says gonna sit on it so on the back of it it basically has the exact same thing as this kingpin is it has the kingpin man what is right honest so of course as usual we're using the yoke and mini today fully fully fully fully charged today for this video have a whole day rest in peace - Dex screw this all I [Music] [Music] [Music] already know kingpin oil is so thick so big so thick all right let's get to it let's get to it person oh what's the justice real quick let's give this a fool I remember with this review we reviewed three things we review the color taste and how medicated they get you but of course that says reach full its peace right now I can't I can't I can't pinpoint an exact taste but I said this again [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm sorry for that oh [ __ ] oh wait that just felt like my ancestors came back and slept this [ __ ] out of me for every wrong thing I just did what the [ __ ] gotta take this drink of this Depot ooh oh man let's take another three-second hit again [Music] so I mess up with this heavy and this is a hybrid - I'm messing with this heavy heavy but you guys already know always give you guys a 15 minute prelude to tell you guys the effects so that's what I'm gonna do we don't take one more hit right now and at this I'm I'm a class back in with you guys and tell you guys the effects what's up I'm clocking back in with you guys you know I'm saying it's been more than this move 115 minutes actually made of this video already looked at it I didn't like it so let's do our ratings taste I don't know if it has anything to do with the fact that I don't have like actual gelato tastes but I will say one out of five which is gonna be a ruby it's definitely only a three at the highest three entire three second we're gonna get to the color really nice color [Music] [Music] nice honey-colored so I would give that a fire of course and last but not least it's actually a really good balance of a hybrid - this is so for that I would definitely campaign so thank you for staying tuned for everyone that stayed tuned for this home time video and watch this video I appreciate you guys tenfold it's been hard to get a lot of these premium products that you see me getting now but I'm trying hard for you - I'm really trying hard you know I'm saying I get a lot of negativity and I'm not ever gonna respond to it I'm sorry because there's a lot of things people don't know what's going on in my life one time one last thing

always was pretty song I'm not sure that's closer looks you know but yeah so yeah this purple punch it's like dark green mm-hmm a few little orange hair so it's not so much like crystals - in Chinese oh man different yeah there's like a bunch of quick crystals looks pretty nice hey there's some prep on it too right I guess right here you like dark green or purple some grinded purple punch and what's up you guys were bad you know we just finished cleaning some we so just did a ball right now [Music] but yeah we'll be reading some reviews from people you know that well first I'm going to read the highlights and then I'm gonna be like on the highlights of purple punch all right now lately they yeah so it says here that purple punch is the sweet and Union up to and the I'm gonna make by reading Larry og with granddaddy purp the astonishing shreya then in my purple punch with wine smelling of grape candy blueberry muffins the potency this strain again the consumer a one-two punch to the head and body internally going up potentially blinding between the eyes and selling lips purple punches a delicious dessert stream that is that is best suited for after dinner may help with my engine nausea minor body aches sleep sleeplessness that's pretty cool oh yeah so like this dream there's a combination of Larry og and granddaddy purple that's pretty cool yeah I wasn't thinking because I got ready for you Italian mom but I like Alaska could you say a key I know like it gives you like the consumer of one or two punch to the head and body huh that's kind of true you know I give to that punch of kind of how you know when you smoke propaganda actually yeah like like afterward like like in the beginning you get a kind of got some more high and then increase those but once it gets high yeah and so says here that the effects you are relaxed unequal and preventative it says stress pain and nausea insomnia depression and headaches and of course they get a beginner and yeah

like but I'm see such a tasty treat the fruiting grape flavor is really prominent the but smoke really well and create a pair definitely had that waving you go for it before you definitely had a wave in Astoria from smoking equal it gives a great feeling of relaxation body height it also is a appetite simulator so a well carcinogens or any this product is dangerous but I'm a cause so this person
