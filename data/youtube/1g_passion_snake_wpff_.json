{"c2zn8hrEVdo": "yo yo yo what is good you guys welcome back to another live stream getting ready to get down with this mendo breath wash it's been a long ass [ __ ] day but it don't matter we got [ __ ] to do we got to get them that grizzy so got the freeze dryer i just started it up right now it started its freeze cycle so it's going to take approximately 20 to 30 minutes to get down to an appropriate temperature to be ready to handle the hash in the meantime i've got everything else set up we'll go over that in a minute once we get everybody else in here and uh we're gonna be washing two pounds of some mendo breath nug that was cultivated by hambone gardens and uh dudes an excellent grower smashed it with this [ __ ] mendo breath and the um the wedding crasher he has coming down right now [ __ ] phenomenal um so i'll be running a few pounds of that next but um yeah we're gonna get it done what's up loan loan i was just talking about you earlier i need a paddle bro i need a custom paddle pay you cash your dabs whatever just let me know i need a custom paddle made bro so uh we're going to chill for a moment i'm going to take a dab or two we're gonna get everything kind of started and then uh once it's time to start i may go ahead and put it on members only mode so that way as i'm working if i look up and i see a question i know it's from one of the members and i can make sure i respond if i have time or at least get back to it lego you're gonna get in this runts guts right now yeah i feel like it's almost a sin almost to mix it with other [ __ ] but i'm gonna mix it with some of this ice cream cake oh [ __ ] [ __ ] balls isn't it crazy these two different rosins came out of the same room harvested at the same time processed the same exact way and they have such differences in color texture and smell and potency i mean everything it's not a one grammar it's a 0.3 maybe price machine is playing catch up right now i probably went through about 250 to 300 pounds of ice today getting the reservoir ready to go if it was summer and i didn't have this ice machine i probably wouldn't be making ash right now there's just no [ __ ] way i'd be able to keep up you guys make me wash too often damn it now i'm going to throw you down here for this melt shot because it's not often that i do the runt and the ice cream cake together in harmony i'm gonna sit down though because i feel like i'm about to [ __ ] myself over so hard so let me just sit my ass down right now okay yep am i comfortable yep i'm comfortable now cheers you guys [Music] oh yes let us go cheers it's all about to be uh on youtube bro uh you know when you blow smoke out and you think you're done then you go to talk or cough and more smoke just keeps on [ __ ] coming out that's how those low temp dabs hit all right let's get things started i gotta remember where the [ __ ] i'd be putting the camera in [ __ ] welcome to the daily dabbers all eyes on me all right let's get you guys so you guys know this setup i went ahead and bought some five gallon buckets today instead of using the uh big 20 gallon lids we're gonna use the five gallons since it's only two pounds we're not washing if it was three or four pounds i would maybe use the 20s but the fives should be able to handle it i gave them all a good alcohol bath today rinsed them out with real good cold water and made new bucket lids like i said so now each one has its own all the way down to the bottom so i'm using a 220 here then a 160 i'll collect everything between 160 and 220 and use it for edibles or test pressed whatever and then i have a 45 everything between 45 and 160 i'm going to use for full spectrum rosin and then 25 to 45 we may or may not end up using it we'll collect the first two to three washes if it's dumping we'll keep collecting if it's not we'll pull it out and not use it that's also going to be for test pressing so we got that and then underneath here we got a little pump a little eco plus pump power cable comes out this way it's plugged in when i need it to turn it on um and then the dump comes out this way a little ball valve here i'll turn it on when i need it and i drop it into here and uh got a p-trap and that goes out to my drain outside which drains it out in a way we got a huge 160 gallon res with ice cold water in there a couple hundred pounds of ice this [ __ ] has a jacket but it needs a beanie because it's sweating got the cold sweats and then we got the avanti not gonna be washing in the avanti today we're going to be washing by hand with the spoon 20 gallon wrapped in a pele using rosin evolution all mesh bags 5 gallon here 20 gallon here and uh yeah that's the plan just got it sitting on a cooler down here so it's stable and it's more at an appropriate height for me and i'm [ __ ] killing my back you know what i'm saying only thing is i wish this was longer and bigger and had a better handle come on loan where you at dog take care of me baby take care of me [Music] so what are we gonna do we're gonna do a couple things here finish prepping [Music] probably gonna need to add more ice in here once we get the where was i gonna put this over here like come on dog how high are you probably gonna get more ice in here later once this gets going spoon get it cold now we're gonna start prepping this okay oh yeah i'm gonna make some rso and i finally found my mason jar i'm gonna use it's my old gallon that we used to keep on the counter to drink water to fit perfect all those mace or all those hash pucks and it's got a spout even perfect i don't think he weighed them 100 percent i'm not sure if you mark them no so i'll grab the scale and get these weight up oh yeah you're gonna come with me in the house oh my magnificent wife brought it back outside to my workstation without me having to ask her and i didn't have to go get it that's because she's better than if it was something of hers that [ __ ] would still be out here i'd still have it

the ice is so [ __ ] clear i couldn't even tell that most of the buds right here actually submerged already this first this first wash is going to be tough boy there's a lot of ice in here and this [ __ ] paddle is too small for this dub i just want to get all this submerged not sitting on the top don't worry i'll make the ocean sounds go i'll do it for the avanti all right that is about as we gonna get right there boy i tell you would cool 20 gallon 220 yeah took me three years to get the gopro yeah well back when i first had a gopro like the hero 3 you couldn't stream from the gopro at least not directly from it and i wasn't into streaming and all that background so i had no idea all right we're gonna let those hydrate i need it there we easy go to get that all underneath there all the ice is in the bag and now i just want to make sure that all of these buds stay underneath the water level so that they get hydrated it's so the water is so [ __ ] clear i mean it looks like you're not even looking through water almost at least on the gopro that i'm looking through she looks wild what's up no limit giveaway winner i've been getting so many copyright strikes let's try not to get

forty-five percent of small businesses [Music] [Music] we all gotta eat you're gonna end at the fullest [Music] people that really [ __ ] make me wanna crap i'm just spinning [Music] [Music] [Music] that's moving good i like the feel just to write about a movement in there [Music] oh yeah [Music] [Music] the nugs in here are [ __ ] stupid fire i mean just [Music] all right my man hammy threw it down and if i'm not mistaken this may have just been a small tester tank i don't even think this was a full sin i think this was a tester the wedding crasher you pulled down [ __ ] fire you guys are going to go bananas over that honestly i'm only going to be running a couple pounds of it you guys might want to start putting in your pre-orders now because if there's a big enough demand then i might be able to run some more for you guys but if it's another two pounds that's just gonna be gone like i'm not even gonna put it out there for nobody it's just gonna be gone off rip off vip clientele it's crazy but estimated yield today um you know going off of the runs that i did previously with the runts that were pretty damn frosty um you know 20 average return from starting material to hash and then from there um you know average 75 to 80 percent back as rosin so [Music] we'll go from there we'll see probably about 130 to 150 grams of rosin out of this when all said and done but it really just depends not everything dumps the same some stuff you think it's gonna dump really really good because it's frosty but not always the case but this is [ __ ] gaff i can the smell is just all up through my nose still like sweet caramel baby [ __ ] tammy you neglected to tell me there was a baby [ __ ] smell in there it says sweet caramel [Music] flyer this is like sweet caramel and baby [ __ ] there's no just floating by [Music] [Music] keep on floating bye [Music] [Music] dried before freezing is the only way my personal opinion is if you're washing it fresh frozen you are losing out on the maximum potential because i feel like once you let it dry you get rid of some of that water content the terpenes become more concentrated you lose that chlorophyll taste i haven't had fresh frozen yet that didn't have that green fresh frozen paint to it so drying is a must in my opinion quick dry though not a normal 14 day dry like a six seven day dry works good uh-oh internet might have dropped you're gonna need oh it reconnected huh seeing here people always ask me if there's like a way to stir it personally find your groove whatever the [ __ ] works to make the motion in the ocean you do it i personally like to do a grabbing motion so i'll push all this down and stir it and come up on this back end push down stir come up on the bathroom so that's that's kind of my technique and then go back the other way you get you know at the top layer you know i'm only about three or four inches below the surface right here i want to go oh you know that's bottomed out right there i don't need to go bottomed out but every once in a while i do want to go to the bottom and pull that material up so i can mix that right push down and pull towards me that's another one i like to do [Music] [Music] so uh [Music] oh yeah oh yeah we in here [Music] ah [Music] is [Music] oh yeah i don't know if you see them i see it i see them heads in there and there's a lot of them so we're going to let this chili chill chill you know the dividend diversity in honor of our 50th anniversary and while we do that scholarship funds because we believe in the pursuit of purpose and the difference you make in the world [Music] what [Music] you let your wife borrow the scale one time [Music] don't do that oh [Music] time to fold all [ __ ] days [Music] so [Music] so [Music] number two ain't no feet [Music] my oh no mystic needs to feature me on one of their songs i got bars man i can't afford that feature though can't afford that feature i want 10 racks for every [ __ ] four bars [Music] all right trash let's take a dab of roni eat your bronies yeah bro this is mystic [Music] [Music] um [Music] i feel you ain't smoking and uh [Music] that [ __ ] in there y'all don't know he's talking about me right [Music] i wish [Music] [Music] i'm dabbing runts and i'm smelling mindo woo wee woo wow [Music] oh [Music] [Music] so so the way that i do this is i use the avanti as a storage vessel can i move you over there that far i don't know maybe let me see yeah so i use the avanti as a storage vessel [Music] [Music] [ __ ] cold in here like foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so what i'm gonna do is i didn't realize you're like right there on my [ __ ] ball sack but i'm gonna empty the uh the washer real quick because uh this is a fresh run and that's what we do in between every run you guys know this stick that drain hose in there plug in the washer turn it on switch to drain mode boom it's going to start draining so i'm going to take the plug for the pump that's in here and i'm going to go ahead and put it in to my power strip here now when i need it i turn it on when i donate it i turn it off and i obviously just blew that down with over 130 programs and certificates gives you the opportunity to start or continue your education wherever you are what do i have plugged we're committed to making your experience english and rewarding when you choose open you join a community where success and affordability okay that is right now one more time this time i'm gonna make sure that i'm getting fresh cold water out of the [Music] drain [Music] it's 58 degrees in here [Music] and dabs got me feeling warm [Music] we haven't changed [Music] [Music] cool yes i smell it boys i always smell the water in here it's not a habit i don't want it to smell stale at all this smells stale then you got a [ __ ] problem but i rinse pulled out water through it before and after everything i do cold ro water it's deionized and desterized so came out nice and clear and the reason i do that is because i'm getting ready to use it as a storage vessel for the bag that i'm about to pull out which means that i need it to be very clean you know what i'm saying clean and fresh [Music] [Music] my process for this is not a a gracious one by any means not at the moment especially because s9 steel works just went mia and hasn't answered any dms in weeks about that 2400 vessel i was trying to purchase from them they told me oh it's going to ship in a week and then [ __ ] m.i.a so i'm kind of upset with them you know what i mean that's kind of [ __ ] right [Music] [Music] and [Music] so fantastic i've been lifting [ __ ] trash cans full of ice up over my shoulder all [ __ ] day long filling this up i think it took [ __ ] like 10 of these at least if not more now the advantage i had with my other one when i was running um the 20 gallon catch containers is it was a lot easier to catch all of this but i'm lifting this up so i could use a pump i could scoop this [ __ ] out honestly [Music] but let me see how heavy this is first go from there i'm going to come up with a more disabled veteran friendly way you got what i mean so i put this in the corner so it can't roll away [Music] and then this is pretty solid i'm just going to take this up kind of set it on here slow pour and hopefully it doesn't go away you know like [ __ ] 20 gallons of water compassionate [Music] [Music] [ __ ] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] oh my god let me show you what's coming out of the bottom of this [ __ ] bin right now oh i'm gonna change my underwear first [ __ ] god damn son [Music] you guys already know what i'm gonna do with hash like that right you guys already i'm skeeting all over y'all bangers with this [ __ ] drop [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] so before i filter what's in the bags i'm gonna fill this up so that everything in here is gonna stay really really cold it's gonna stay colder when it's filled up with uh water versus when it's open air right now so look at what we're catching in the [ __ ] 220 come on look where's this y'all see that [ __ ] 220 come on bruh you dumping in here we dumping in here good job you pulled it at the perfect [ __ ] time my perfect [ __ ] time that guy [Music] [Music] uh [Music] i need a big ass hammy slap trying to put a pork chop up here [Music] and actually you would be the first co-lab that i have a sticker up on my wall from wow oh that's not enough water i'm gonna go less water than last time but more water than this [Music] oh [Music] here's here's a good trick people say how do you know if you have enough ice you have enough water you want enough ice that it's gonna keep the water as cold as possible right around like you know 30 38 degrees is cool enough you know 28 to 38 is good you don't want to go above 42 and uh [Music] make sure it's covered the material enough to where you can easily move the material around with your stirrer with one hand and then you know move all the material it's not like they're fighting it just kind of fluidly move [Music] and it's covered and uh yeah that's good enough and then now i'm just going to take the back of the spoon and kind of push everything down right below the surface this is where having that ice on top helps because it helps a little [ __ ] sweet there it uh helps hold the bud down underneath the surface of the water so if you need to add more ice now is a good time [Music] okay we're gonna let this chili chill chill and then after uh we get done sifting this we'll come back and stir this [Music] um [Music] i need to go inside and get batteries because the 10 more washers staying [ __ ] dead right now for free visit minute clinic at cvs today no cost flu shots with most insurance restrictions apply so clinic.com replacing tetris here you ready [Music] [Applause] him [Music] takes me back to high school buckingham [Music] [Music] [Music] now i'm going to open up this valve yo this thing the magnets are like going like [ __ ] ah that's not what she said [Music] is [Music] right sorry i'm trying to get you guys set up [Music] i have to sponsor this man and get him some proper recording equipment all right that's good enough [Music] so [Music] [Music] this is the 220 my boys [Music] [Music] what [Music] trash [Music] alcohol wipes [Music] [Music] oh yeah [Music] there we go that goes back a nice one this goes to the side now here we have our 160. this is going to be test press material most likely but we'll see what happens [Music] it's up to the farmer what happens really with it it could become it's usually the way i do it is it's test press and then depending on the quality it either gets mixed in with the rest because some strains really do feel better at the higher microns so depending on how well it does you know it'll either go with everything else or it'll just get made into edibles or something [Music] it could be pills could be whatever stash for the homies right like a lot of times this 160 will make fire head stacks for the homies and you don't have to dip into your uh you know your normal full spectrum spot it's not gonna hit the fan [Music] okay cool so there's just not a whole lot of that and that is good good good that means majority of what we want is in the 45 where it belongs [Music] taking this where's deals at deals is in here [Music] shout out to the cultivator everybody [Music] okay oh my god oh i love it when the 160 comes out looking like this you guys remember how the runts 160 came out looking well hammy's mendo it came out looking just as good i do not i have never said that about another person's material that i've ran except for my own like straight up be honest as [ __ ] call it snobby call it what you want but i've ran a lot of [ __ ] material and it takes one hell of a [ __ ] grower to pull off 160 micron hash that comes out looking like that like and i'm not even in good light damn it but it's a little [ __ ] caked up mountain the [ __ ] white 160 here looking proper you guys know because you've seen me process enough material you know not a lot of collab material comes out looking that good period and that's the 160 we're not even on to the real deal holyfield yet so set this one aside now you're not ready for this 45. [Music] [Music] oh [Music] we're gonna get rid of some of this water first so we're gonna pick up both the 25 and the 45. give them a little shimmy shimmy [Music] hammy um what ppfd were you running for your 11 13 do you know what dli you were hitting sorry i'm loud right there oh [ __ ] the wife's gonna come down and not be able to walk wife's coming to take it down [Music] oh [Music] some people don't go as long as me on the first wash i like to get all the chlorophyll that i can out on the first wash the first wash was always going to have the most contaminant it doesn't matter how long you wash it for so you might as well just go ahead and get all the pores all out that you can [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm going to spend a little extra time just washing it down making sure i wash my floor full out the best of my ability remember what i tell you guys you're not just filtering the water you're washing the hash you're not washing the nugs okay you're you're washing the house [Music] ready baby do you have shoes on you got chocolates on okay cool come on in baby they can't see you it's pointing straight down [Music] i think it's cold i don't know it's 57 degrees in here [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] who's your dad [Music] jesus take the wheel i still got work to do you swap the deck real quick on the banger [Music] [Music] those of you that are hanging out i go live every day every morning doing gross [ __ ] processing [ __ ] talking [ __ ] doing [ __ ] just cool [ __ ] man we got some cool people come check it out [Music] it's called the daily dab [Music] i put it on members only mode most of the time where everybody could watch and you know but only members can chat and ask questions and you know but for the first 20 or 30 minutes it's usually open to everybody [Music] so come on over and check it out [Music] wash the [ __ ] half don't just filter it wash that [ __ ] homies wash wash it wash it wash it wash it how much water is going in that bucket it's gone you don't even know it's empty all right [Music] [Music] um you guys aren't ready for this [ __ ] i'm not ready for this [ __ ] watch excuse me excuse me chef chef i'd like one mindo breath hash burrito please hold the cheese extra salt for all of my haters that's a fat dumper for our first year my boy tammy who washes your hash like me let me hear you say it nobody breaking babe nobody i'm just playing [Music] but i do it with love and care like it's my own like it's my [ __ ] home you guys want a high def picture of that from the phone um [Music] let me turn off that [Music] i almost forgot that i unplugged my sump pump out there so i had to go plug that back in [Music] one [Music] um [Music] [Music] so [Music] yeah i i found out you [ __ ] yes you weren't in here when i was telling you you're a dick that's the first thing i [ __ ] said is it smells like a straight hot baby diaper oh funny he dried it with my quick drape my quick dry technique baby i told you guys i've been doing it that way for five [ __ ] years now five [ __ ] years let somebody tell you that they've been doing it longer this fresh frozen [ __ ] shenanigan ring what in the [ __ ] is going on with that all right we'll capture the rest of this next [ __ ] go around okay i got it now we're going to see what the 25 looks like and if it's worth um keeping at all and if not we're going to get rid of that [ __ ] and not mess with it because it slows down the filter process for everything else i thought yeah pretty much everything else above it so great [ __ ] baby [ __ ] you know um my buddy goodbye [ __ ] has a cut of ice cream cake that's the exact same [ __ ] way and it is your [ __ ] god awful stanky good [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [ __ ] you 25 micron appreciate you savage um so savage said how long did it take me to get where i'm at now any growing tips you want to work your way up so basically um i started growing at the end of 2014 with my very first grow and my very first time getting high i started with a 4x4 tent a 600 watt air cooled hps and a 15 gallon tote where i did deep water culture with two plants [Music] i ran a strain called gold leaf from a site called i love growing marijuana and i had acupuncture gold and something else and off that 600 watt i ended up yielding uh 21 ounces um which i was [ __ ] thrilled about because my first grow in a [ __ ] 15 gallon dwc show [Music] so the 25 is going to go on the same tray as the 160 on the other side though so growing tips i would say do as much research as you can about basic plant science and plant nutrition photosynthesis right what the different nutrients do for the plant how they show up as deficiencies or toxicities all of these things have been thoroughly researched and documented in scientific ways not on forums that you can get a really really good understanding of what you're going to be doing before you go to do it which is going to put you ahead of the game and you're not just going to be doing something based on the fact that somebody told you to do it when it comes to your grow you're going to do something based off of somebody recommended something and your research shows x y or z so you know then you choose how you want to buy it or not apply it but um you know it just i would say stick to learning from like dot edu's you know look up just scholarly journals um try and find out pretty much as much science as you can about the plant the anatomy of the plant and its functions the circadian rhythm you know i would say start off by picking a very simple nutrient program like a two-part salt based program it'll be cheap effective and um reliable consistent athena is good um hvg like ham bones running is really good all right it's gonna be a long one folks i think i'm gonna have to uh [Music] all right this chat is bumping i don't know how you guys are keeping up with it i'm on top chat right now i just realized that all right so now i'm on live chat let me get this out of the way it's still got a small amount of draining it's doing but not a whole lot better yet oh no don't die i plugged you in at that three percent i plugged you in though if it dies i'm coming right back y'all already know baby so oh my god i forgot to move that over for the wife so now i gotta go over here move it from over here over here [Music] anymore i cannot wait to move into a bigger [ __ ] area i underestimated my own growth and didn't realize i was gonna need as much space as i do you know here's what it is it's not a bad thing good thing no problem right first yeah it's time management how you want to throw your bag like that's why i have a nine to five hound bone has a nine to five andy hustles you know what i'm saying you gotta do what you gotta do when you got [ __ ] family to provide for and you wanna live a certain lifestyle and provide you know a certain amount of security and for your future and your children's

tomorrow with the kids so my wife could sleep in and i'm gonna [ __ ] hustle throughout the day like it's another day so that's just what you do [Music] how cold did you get the room at the end tammy [Music] i like how far the it calyxed out i don't see a lot of people crown their buds out as much as you do it's something that i was taught to do as well if your calyx's crown out towards the end you nailed it and if you don't know what a crowned out calyx is it's probably because you're getting that pgr [ __ ] where it just looks like a [ __ ] golf ball with sprinkles on it i get so tired of people trying to tell me that they don't pgr their bud but it literally has no type of calyx terrain there's no it's just a straight just [ __ ] dense ass hard ass smooth surface that doesn't happen [Music] naturally one thing i've experimented with a couple times that works really well if you have the ability to chill your reservoir a little bit and you start tapering it towards flush it'll start bringing those colors out a little bit more and i noticed with the temperature drop it affects you know some plants more than others because they're more exposed to that temperature and the wind and they get that wind chill coldness but if you hit them at the root zone it affects like almost all of the plants the same way and so you can drop the internal temperature of the plant and get some of that purpling the same way and get it more across the whole canopy you know you do it in combination with the air temps just don't drop it too much in the root zone or otherwise you're gonna pretty much like stop uptake i ran a whole entire crop at um 58 degrees which is the temperature at which you can hit 100 dissolved oxygen supposedly and uh since i ran it at 58 degrees since the start of clone i didn't run into any issues with uptake and they were super productive and uh one of my best fields did that aeroponics [Music] nice oh my god smack that ass mindo sexy [ __ ] [Music] yeah you guys take advantage of the fact that um we actually have the grower on right now that's a very rare occasion that we get the grower on with us so definitely take advantage of that we're gonna let that chili chill chill for a minute [Music] [Music] froze it all without drying ah that sucks too late [Music] too now i have to run inside grab a drink real quick we're gonna let this settle for a second i'll be right back and we're gonna continue to party [Music] [Music] don't really know", "PJe2k_PFSBE": "not all snake species have heat-sensing pits but those that do have the amazing ability to sense the radiant heat of their surroundings so today we're going to talk about what species of snakes have heat-sensing pits what they are in the first place and how they work it's a common misconception that all snakes have heat vision and that isn't true only the snakes that possess heat pits or pit organs are able to see the heat of their surroundings for example snakes in the colubrid a family like this tricolour hognose snake lack heat sensing pits they just have their eyesight in their really good sense of smell to find their food heat sensing pits are also referred to as thermal pits or I was taught in college that they're technically called pit organs but they all refer to the same organ on a snake it was originally thought that pit organs were used only to find prey items but recent research suggests that they're also used to avoid predators and to thermoregulate by finding sources of heat in their environment pit organs are found in a variety of snakes they're found in all pit vipers of course that's how they get their name they're also found in many boa constrictors and they're found in most Python species including this green tree python right here however there are of course exceptions to every rule and the pit organs found in pit vipers versus boas and pythons are structured quite differently actually so let's talk about how they differ between snakes pit vipers have just a single pit organ located between their nostril and their eye and this is called a loriel pit organ whereas boas and pythons have pit organs located on their upper and sometimes lower lips these are called labial pit organs labial scales are the scales that surround the mouth opening or in other words the lip scales so labial pit organs are just the pits located on the lips basically but again the structure of the pit organ is different between vipers and pythons and Boas in pit vipers this organ has a membrane that stretches across the opening of their pit this membrane is covered in heat sensitive receptors behind the membrane is just a little pocket of air though but in boas and pipe they're labial pits don't have a suspended membrane at all their heat sensitive membrane lines the inside of all of their pits this membrane whether suspended for pit vipers or along the sides of the pits of pythons and Boas is highly vascular meaning it's also full of blood vessels these blood vessels transfer oxygen to the heat receptors and help cool them down if these heat receptors aren't able to cool down almost instantly after they set something warm then the snakes will probably see is some sort of after image even after the prey item leaves their site so the blood vessels have a very important role in keeping those heat receptors cool the information collected by the pit organ is sent to the brain of the snake which is then overlaid with their visual map of their surroundings which is of course collected by their eye sites so put two and two together and snakes with pit organs have both a visual and an infrared view of their entire world since we switch snakes this is our sarong green tree python we don't have a name for her yet we can't find a good evil Disney character to name or after cuz that's kind of our theme with green tree pythons so if you have any suggestions let us know we already have Cruella and Dolores and Ozma so a well Kronk for the male yeah if it is the girl we need another girl's name so let us know your suggestions the presence of heat pits and snakes is actually a great example of parallel evolution this is sometimes confused with convergent evolution but there's a minor difference the difference here involves the ancestry of the animals involved the three basic types of evolution are convergent evolution parallel evolution and divergent evolution divergent evolution occurs when two species that are very closely related evolved apart from one another convergent evolution is when two unrelated species evolve a trait that is very similar for example emerald tree Boas and green tree pythons aren't very closely related I mean once a boa and one's a Python but they both occupy the same niche in the rainforest environment they live in so parallel evolution is when two different species with a common ancestor evolved kind of alongside one another the same or similar characteristic for example pit vipers evolving there loriel pit organs versus boas and pythons the ones who have them evolving their labial pit organs they have a common ancestor but they are different species and they evolve kind of that same trait along the same path the presence of pit organs is not a very good way though to differentiate between boas and pythons yes most pythons do have pit organs however huama pythons and black-headed pythons don't have any pits at all scientists don't quite know why these two species are the only species of pythons that don't have heat-sensing pits but I think the current hypothesis is that it's because these love to eat reptiles in Australia and reptiles being a cold-blooded animal wouldn't show up very well in infrared vision so we think they maybe just don't have them because it wouldn't help them find their food anyway it's also pretty well known that a lot of boa species have pit organs but there are a lot of exceptions with those for example common boas and red-tail Boas and rainbow Boas sand boas rosy boas anacondas rubber boas there's a lot of exceptions to the rule that all Boas have pit organs not all of them do there's quite a few that have no infrared vision at all a lot of people always think dug here our common boa has heat pits but if you take a look there are no pits to be seen sorry Doug you only have your vision and your good sense of smell to find your prey I'm going to end today's video with Popeye our albino labyrinth mutation Burmese python which is another snake with a great representation of heat-sensing pits look at that aren't you gorgeous you're so cute thank you to all of our patreon backers for supporting our channel if you guys are so generous thank you and thank you to everyone just spending your time with us and watching our videos I hope you learned something new from today's pit organ spectacular video and if there are any other subjects like specific topics relating to snakes or just reptiles in general let us know in the comments below we're always looking for new things to teach you about so thank you everybody and we'll see you next time in boas and pythons however their labial pits the multiple smaller ones on their lips nice strike there oh you're so scary look we have an et moment where is she where is she oh there's only stuffed animals here pigs have them what they are oh she did she got my ear [Music]", "WRpH84s-5YU": "well you never know what you're going to see in florida so proceed to the route got a big gator here going off the road let's see if we can get closer proceed to the route there he goes hurting him to get him to go back to where he was going big dinosaur all right see you later gator [Music] hey we're looking for short tail snakes uh one of the rarest snakes in north america [Music] yes yes yes yes yes yes the rarest snake in north america yeah oh my god the rarest snake in north america and not hernando not marion now you see that head twitching this is what we wrote the paper on that head twitching right there when we were studying uh short tail snake what's the genius is it still pepper peltis now what's stylusoma yeah oh look at that now look at the size of this snake it's a shoestring oh my god i love these things too this is so cool oh my gosh i haven't seen one of these in i don't know four five years garrett's when's the last time we got those two twenty fourteen that's defensive posture well the short tail snake it don't scare it yet no it this is a snake that's got a really small range in florida so that's what makes it really uh unique and uh and special look at that look at that head twitching it looks angry there's almost no color on it yeah look at it there he goes we've got the tail shaking wow it's trying to act like a pygmy rattlesnake right now look at that mr pygmy rattlesnake but it's not it's a short tail and it's cool so this snake is protected in florida and it's a no touch so we scooted off the road we're doing some photographs now and uh we'll be on our way these snakes uh eat tantilla crown snakes moleskinks blind snakes and any other probably smaller snakes like ring necks things like that the head bobbing is a defensive behavior unfortunately one day there's probably not going to be any habitat in florida for these guys and they're going to have to live around homes hopefully to survive if their food is available [Music] finding the short tail snake yesterday was pretty cool we went out to look for that and that was our target it's a county we've been looking to find one in for a long time now and it's taken a good three or four years it was an area that i had to survey when i was on the rare snake uh study in 2013. so knew there were records from there but i had only found them uh in hernando county and uh this is a different county further north and they're just pretty happy to find that when you've spent a lot of time looking for them among other things but uh sandhill herping is uh it's feast or famine and it's usually a lot of famine a lot of days you don't get anything but i'd rather find something in the sandhills and then at night on on hard roads where i'm just finding water snakes and stuff so i'm hiking today in a sand hill area um that i've seen simon's tracks before and i know cyanus are here southern hog no snakes [Music] it's got a lot of sandy areas so i can see tracks or actually see one because they're so hard to detect on any kind of vegetation or leaves or pine needles so i try to go through the sand hills where it's really sandy and that way i can see a track or even see a small one because looking for a four and a half inch tiny snake is not easy looking for the sandhill species is really cool something that's that's a real challenge and uh they're really cool and it's just my favorite so i try to make those videos the most i mean it's definitely the snake i've studied for most of my uh herping days here and uh it started big time in 2013 when i did the rare snake study for fwc i was studying southern hog no snake short tail snakes and pine snakes so once that ended i got hooked and i just keep looking for him all the time now so anyways let's see what i can find it's not going to be easy but it's uh it's really cool out here i like looking around and hiking around here for a while right here you see this little hole here been dug out a lot of people say snake did or this is a florida mouse burrow a little small mouse really cool looking thing but anyway it's a florida mouse hole and pine snakes and other snakes like to eat them so anyway so if you ever see these in the sand hills looks like a a miniature gopher tortoise burrow maybe but that's what it is [Music] yeah i was like come on eastern hog no snake [Music] these guys spread their neck little hits also but they spread their neck a lot wider than a southern hog nose than siamese [Music] well i'm in the uh upland sand hills today and i the morning has started out pretty bad i've already seen a dead coral snake a dead baby pine snake and a dead pygmy rattler and i've seen nothing alive i've got a little teeny tiny pygmy here this guy's tiny here's as i can show you he is tiny [Music] i don't want to bite my hand but there's my hand oh there's my hand this guy's really tight [Music] getting off the road little tiny pigment [Music] so i'm uh i'm in the ham golf hammock now uh it's time to quit the sand hills and here i've got a another pygmy right here [Music] get outside and take a look at it real quick get it off the road [Music] now this pygmy's a lot bigger [Music] there's my stick you can see it's a lot bigger it's pretty cool [Music] pygmies are so common that most herpes in florida don't really care about them but they're really pretty cool they were less common people would uh appreciate it more and right look for them anything is not common is what people want to look for let's get them off the road move on", "w6fWQ6fgJZ8": "hello everyone and welcome to a another tutorial thursday my name is swiss and for this week we're going to be going over zenae nikita i'm actually surprised i never made a video of this but someone tagged me in the snake discord and i forgot who did but whoever did thank you and so we'll be making this video about zenae nikita so if you guys like the content like and subscribe other than that let's go ahead let's dive right in and let's get it [Music] it's showtime so the zenae nikita is basically exactly what it sounds like and it's going to be doing a zenaid into a nikita and that's basically it now if you guys don't know how to z nade i have made a video on that so feel free to check that out but for anyone here that maybe does not want to go back and watch the video generally just a quick summary of how to do the z nade what you're doing is you're shielding i mean you're pulling out grenade you're shielding and then you're jumping and pressing the z button and if you do it fast enough then you can pull out you can grab the grenade instantly or you can map a shoulder button mines is l to jump and basically if you press the l and the z button um together as a buffer right when you pull the grenade then you'll instantly have in your hand don't do it too quick or you get a neutral layer as you guys saw right there and that's basically it so after you do the z nade you could then pull out the nikita and then that's just pretty much what the tech is now you can also shield drop the grenade pick it up and then pull out a nikita but um one thing to mention is that most people prefer the z-name method because of the fact that you're getting a grenade in hand as soon as possible and that way you're able to pull out the nikita as soon as possible as well now you can also do like a um you can kind of like do this and that's like another way of doing of doing it in a sense but um yeah this is the most preferable way because if you shield drop it and you jump forward let's say you that grenade is abandoned so you have to like stand stay your stand your ground and do it that way so after you're able to see nade nikita you obviously have options you could go forward with it you could just stay in one spot or you could jump back and do it it's it's really all dependent on the situation so if you want to use it as like an offense let's say to just kind of get get in a little bit closer then you could do that or if you want to play more defensive you can jump back and then do it that's a usual option as well and if let's say i'm back here and i don't want to jump back then obviously you just do it that way so without moving that is so why is this technique or why is this tech good right what does it provide snake well it provides snake a couple of things right and the main thing is it helps cook a grenade while also having a nikita in front of you that um that you're canceling so like if someone needs to run in and hit you or something like that very similar to ryu let's say that's gonna normally stay grounded when they try to come in they have to deal with that nikita in front of them so either they respect that or they run and get hit by the nikita and then at that point you have a cook grenade that you could just throw at them now with the xenae nikita you do want to cancel it basically you want to be ready to cancel it because otherwise if you don't then you're going to get hit by your own grenade and the reason for that happening is obviously because nikita has like a really long and really long end lag so that's why you have to be ready to to pretty much cancel it now um now after after canceling nikita then you just want to throw the grenade obviously and then that's pretty much it i like to use the c stick to throw it or use a smash input to throw it because then the grenade is pretty much cooked and then you're gonna get the grenade uh thrown at them as quickly as possible so as an example um this is a regular throw you can see how it bounces and how long it takes to get to the opponent and then this is a c-stick throw or smash input you can see that it travels faster it doesn't touch the ground at all so basically you're getting the grenade to the opponent as quickly as possible and also away from you as soon as possible in case in any chance that the grenade is about to blow up let's say if you use the c-stick it'll travel faster so that way you risk uh you have less risk of just blowing yourself up so yeah so there's that now the other way the other reason why you would want to do it else is also versus projectiles and so let's say like he's got this hud open right and i could use i could basically use the nikita to block the hadouken and then you throw the you throw the grenade to basically punish them for using the um their projectile of choice now this isn't gonna work on every projectile like it's not going to work on mega man's razor blade or anything like that but it'll help with like belmont's cross uh reuse hadoken or ken's fireballs with mario or luigi it could help against that too you know it's really all dependent on what the projectile is it also helps on samus um but it's not gonna work on something that has high priority like let's say k rules crown so you know it's project it's not for every projectile it just depends on on the projectile itself so definitely lab that to understand you know when you want to use z name nikita now if you want to see this tech used in any sets or like you know be able to analyze sets or anything like that i highly recommend watching shogun and dio now um they they tend to use that option pretty often uh mainly shogun though shogun uses it the most we can we obviously know that from watching shogun's run in congo saga from last year so if you guys want to go back and watch his vods on congo saga or his matches i should say then you'll be able to see how he's using it when he's using it and definitely when you see him use it make sure that you're understanding why is he using it how is he using it and what is he doing after that way you can understand fully how the xenae nikita works but um generally shogun likes to use zenei nikita one for cooking and two to stop the opponent from coming in uh one thing that he mentioned is that it's very helpful against characters that play super rush down like as an example joker like when he has arsene you know they're generally just going to want to run in and try to hit you with aerials dash tack etc so if you have the ability to to do xenae nikita that's just a good defense so you could do this cancel it like immediately and then throw it or if they're a little bit farther you could have it out a little bit longer but not too long obviously or you risk blowing yourself up so so definitely keep that in mind now the more that you play with it in training mode too you'll get used to like how long you can have the nikita out before you actually need to cancel it and then throw it so that's one thing i highly recommend practicing as well um just practicing the z name nikita and then once you're used to doing it then understanding how long do you need to have nikita owl before you have to cancel it and then throw it now you don't have to throw it as well obviously like if i have it out for too long let's say i could still like shield if they're going to be close generally snake players were going to want to throw it but again you don't have to throw it you can still shield and then that way if they get by the nikita let's say they jump at you then you could shield have that grenade as a counter play for them jumping in at you and then going from there it could also be used for edge guarding as well if you would like um but you can't really do too much obviously so as an example um say like i got him off stage i could do xenae nikita do that and then shield that's pretty much like another edge guard setup or you could like cancel nikita above ledge and then you could be at roll distance and shield while the grenade blows up it's it's really all dependent um what you want to look for but uh but that is another option it's not like the best option um from what i've watched and from what i played with i think personally it's just it's mainly good for the neutral mainly the neutral is is where the tech shines in my opinion and you can still like jump in like you could still jump in with the nikita if you would like get this do this do this or something and then you know the rest is history so so you could do something like that if you would want as well obviously there's a lot of options that you have whether it's canceling it throwing it looking for it back here or just hitting them with it running up shielding and then going forward a neutral air or something or um getting in super close or you could like do the nikita z z drop it and so on and so forth so there's obviously a lot of options that he has towards the xena nikita is just something you have to play around with and then obviously like i always say test it in training mode get used to the muscle memory and doing doing the tech understanding how it's used how to cook the grenade how long to keep the the nikita out and then at that point taking into matches uh messing around with it seeing if it works i will also say it's not for every match up it's not going to be for every match up but it is just a good option to have a good option to cook grenades a good option to mix up mix up mix up your neutral game as well and pretty much taking it from there so i hope you guys learned something um as far as the xena nikita goes i hope you guys try it out let me know what you think about the tech in the comment section down below and also other ways that you like to use a zine nikita as well again my name is swiss i have other social media platforms down below twitch twitter patreon etc and thank you for watching the video and i'll see you all on the next one bye you now multiply two everyone copy your pace basketball up in on their face disney fantasy you feel it in you think you brush it off insignificant but you got something we want and your whole life is a taunt cause you would not just comply waking up for your day you", "QKzWrFQQBaY": "please don't poop on my desk okay every day we help people identify snakes and one question we get all the time they'll send us a picture of a water snake and want to know is this a copperhead well we're going to take a close look a really close look at water snakes and copperheads the copperhead that you encounter may not necessarily look like the copperhead you look up on the internet okay so we're gonna look at a few different ones but before we do that i wanted to show you this this was given to me many many years ago and it's it's actually pretty cool and these are real snake heads in here that are i get like taxidermied i'm assuming this is like some formaldehyde or something in here but if you look really close uh now this is not a copperhead on on the left on your left here this is a relative of the copperhead this is the cottonmouth and then this one over to your right this is a non-venomous water snake and it's just showing the differences the head shape and some different differences the markings on these two snakes but one thing i really want you to notice and this is what makes identifying a water snake probably the easiest way to identify a water snake quickly is when you look at the head uh i don't mean a triangular shaped head okay because most snakes can flatten their head out when they get scared into that triangular or diamond shaped head and they do that in order to look bigger and to look dangerous so just because a snake has a diamond or triangular shaped head does not mean it's a venomous snake okay now if you look at this snake here this non-venomous water snake if you look at the scales going along his top lip those are his upper labial scales and the one on the bottom are the lower labial scales but those scales you'll notice have vertical stripes going up and down those scales and cotton mounts copper heads they don't have that so in water snakes it's very very prominent in between each of those scales is that stripe that line so that's a really easy way quickly if you can see his head to identify a water snake even if you can't see his pattern maybe he's underwater and just has his head sticking up and that's kind of all you can see that's a really easy way to identify a water snake versus a copper here alright so i want to get this part over with as quickly as possible it is time to get out the water snake now this is a water snake that i caught it is not friendly it does not like me uh at all so let's get this part over with so this is our nonvenomous water snake and it's already flattening its head out trying to make it look like a triangular shape so it supposed to scare me off maybe look like a venomous snake but um so this snake people have really difficulties identifying snakes like this water snake now this particular snake is known as a northern water snake okay this is a northern water snake if i were to look at the range of the northern water snake and where northern water snakes were supposed to live well if i was basing my identification just on that then this would not be a northern water snake this would be a midland water snake because where this northern water snake was captured was not in the range according to the book of where northern water snakes live it was supposed to be a midland water snake according to the range map but when you look closely at the pattern on the snake and you look closely at the belly of the snake it tells me this is a northern and not a midland so the midland is just a subspecies of a northern water snake but for most people they don't really care about all that now this snake if we look at him he does i'm sorry fella i'm glad that you know i don't care if you bite me but please don't musk on me it's it really stinks it really stinks now i don't want to bite me either water snakes have pretty big teeth as far as snakes go because all these guys really eat are fish and frogs and toes which are all slippery so those big teeth help them to hold on to them and so people that's another reason they mistake these for copper is they kill them they open up the mouth and then they see oh look at the big teeth oh it's fangs no it's not things they just have big teeth the other thing with this snake is when it does bite they have some anticoagulants in their saliva so basically it bleeds a lot their bite is not horrible um i would rather get bit by this water snake as unpleasant as it is than a squirrel or a mouse or a rat or a house cat a house cat's bite is a hundred times worse than the snake okay so um the worst thing about this next bite is boom it happens fast that's the worst thing about the snakes bite okay uh and it scares you so uh it's unpleasant for them to musk on you and it's unpleasant for them to bite you but they are completely harmless now on our website when we identify snakes one thing we do is we send people to our website and there it doesn't just say the heading northern water snake or midland water snake it simply says common water snake and the reason for that is unless you really know what you're looking for it can be difficult for most people to tell the difference in a northern or a midland water snake the differences are are basically this do you see these dark bands across this snake's back so on this northern water snake the dark part of the bands up top is wider than the lighter part of the bands on a midland water snake the lighter part of the bands up top is wider than the dark bands are you confused yet okay and then there are some differences with the pattern on the belly scales but other than that there's and then you know how many of these bands are on this snake versus the midland water snake so usually those three things are kind of what we have to look at and the range which obviously in this case is not very important but those things are what we look at to determine do we have a northern water snake versus a midland water snake so um you know the range maps are great to have and there's been a lot of study and a lot of dedication put into those to make those range maps but they're not foolproof and me catching this snake outside of its range according to the map proves that now when you're looking at the side of this snake's head those stripes along his lips his labial scales are not very prominent on this one a lot of water snakes you can see it a lot better than on this snake you can see it some but it may not be the one thing that really stands out to you if you were to encounter this northern water snake now one thing about this water snake i want you to notice it does have bands that go across his body okay and those bands are narrow on the bottom and the bands are wide on the top with copper heads it's opposite also these bands they don't go all the way down the body once you get about right here just about halfway or so those bands break up and become blotches so they're not bands that go around the whole body of the snake but a copperhead for the most part usually his bands or his markings are go from the back of his head all the way down to his tail so let's take a look right now at a copperhead now i have a lot of copper heads but this particular one is my favorite this copperhead does have a name i don't name all my snakes but i did name this snake and this next name is andrew okay yes his andrew the copperhead but you see he's got bands all the way down his body and his bands don't break up here they kind of continue all the way down to his tail down here and like i was showing you on the water snake the bands on the water snake are wide at the top and narrow at the bottom but the bands on the copper head are narrow at the top and wide on the bottom so that's one thing and a lot of people will tell you it looks like hershey kisses little shapes it looks just like hershey kiss chocolate candy and once you see that you kind of can never look at a copperhead the same way again okay but here's the thing not every copperhead has that that is for snakes here in the southeast you know your broad banded copperheads which don't live here in the southeast uh they don't really have the hershey kiss shapes they have bands but those bands don't look like hershey kisses when viewed from the side but if you're in the southeast you don't have to worry about that because those snakes those copperheads don't live here see this snake can look different from another copperhead that you see in your yard so just because that's how this copperhead looks doesn't mean the other one looks the same way some copperheads have been born with no hershey kisses they've actually got stripes that run down their body and there have been some copperheads have been found with no pattern at all no stripes no hershey kisses and then there's been a few others that have been found with spots okay no hershey kisses no stripes but spots but those are really rare so for the most part when you see a copperhead usually it's gonna have hershey kisses and somewhere on his body okay but usually all over just like this one does but this is a really really beautiful beautiful snake i mean i just how can you whether you like snakes or not that is a pretty snake now you notice i'm using a hook i've had this snake for a long time uh it is not aggressive it's it you know acts like just a normal copperhead but i'm not going to take any chances with them free handling this thing because uh 35 years i've never been bit i want to keep it that way okay so we're going to put this copperhead up and i want to show you another copperhead that's going to look a little bit different than this one so here is another copperhead now this copperhead looks pretty similar to the other copperhead but one difference in this one is if you look he's got the hershey kiss pattern but in between there he's got these spots all the way down his body in between each hershey kiss he's got a spot and i've seen this a lot in copperheads some some of them haven't some of them don't so copperheads can be variable in color and just like people some of our skin tones are darker or lighter that's the same thing with snakes there can be a darker color maybe a little bit lighter color and have different shades and tents so not every snake is going to look exactly like the one that you look up on the internet they can all look a little bit different so you don't need to look at just one thing you want to look at the overall snake you know the the shape of the head that misleads a lot of people like i said because a lot of harmless snakes can have a triangular shaped head now the pupils everybody talks about the pupils of a snake and how they have those elliptical cat like pupils for the venomous snakes the problem with that is in lower light those elliptical cat-like pupils can dilate and become round so they can see better so even a copperhead sometimes you can find with round pupils now another difference with copper heads and you kind of have to be pretty close to see this one is right there in front of his eye see the hole that's his pit they have pits that's what we call pit vipers and in front of the pit is his nose his nostril nonvenous water snakes have the nostrils but not the pits now one more very important thing about copperheads and water snakes do copperheads swim yes all snakes are excellent swimmers including copperheads but copperheads are not water snakes that doesn't mean that you can't find the copperhead in or near the water it just means that if you're finding a copperhead that's living next to a creek in the rocks or in the water all the time that's probably not a copper yet these are not water snakes they'll go to water they'll cross water from time to time but living along the edges and the banks and going in and out of the water that is not the snake's behavior so a lot of people see non-venomous water snakes and they mistake them for copperheads now if we're going to talk about the differences with copperheads and harmless water snakes we have to mention rattlesnakes what do i mean check this out when this snake gets scared the copperhead it shakes its tail really really fast kind of like a rattlesnake of course it doesn't have rattle but if it's hiding in some dry leaves or even grass it's shaking it's so fast and it makes a sound and people mistake them for rattlesnakes and then you know shaking their tail that's just something rattlesnakes copperheads cottonmouth king snakes rats snakes black racers coach whips and a lot more snakes they do that when they're scared except for water snakes water snakes are one of the snakes that when they're nervous they don't shake their tail like copperheads and other snakes do before i go i want to give a shout out to daryl millwood in south carolina he ordered a t-shirt and liked it so much and what we do he decided to send us a very generous donation daryl we greatly appreciate that that helps us continue all the work we're doing here uh one more thing i want to show you i'm going to sit you right here you crawl over there let me see this here's one of the shirts that we have these are our snakes rs tv shirts and the logo southeastern reptile rescues on the back and right now we just added youth sizes so we have everything from youth small medium large all the way up to adult 3x so these are twenty dollars with free shipping and a lot of that goes to support the work we're doing here at southeastern reptile rescue guys thank you very much for watching and please make sure you subscribe [Music] you", "HpxmfK6SkyE": "[Music] wow [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "2HrmB2fjUdk": "all right what's up guys so today we're gonna be going over how to recover with snake options for recovery and what it is like what to do what not to do and depending on certain you know opponents or characters that you play against you know that could change but this is general information on what you should be doing as far as recovering goes so this is obviously snakes upbeat it goes up pretty high especially on double jump it's all the way at the top of the screen there the thing with snake is that you always want to recover high you don't wanna you don't necessarily want to be down here to recover you don't want to recover low as they would say you kind of wanted to stick up stick up high and then kind of go from there now from staying from the top you could do a back here to kind of cover yourself it's the best offensive option as far as an aerial goes dare could be okay as well but most people are gonna use their you could do you could hold a grenade and holding a grenade is good on the way down if the if your opponent is pretty juggle heavy so if they keep hitting you then they're gonna hit the grenade as well so both you guys will get hit but it's a lot better to go that route then to continue getting juggled in my opinion so I recommend doing that a lot be reversing is another big thing so you know if I just drop regular we're gonna lay it like right here we're captive talking is but then I could switch the momentum with the B reverse and now I'm over here so it'll fake your opponent out think that you're coming over here but you're actually gonna be over here because the B reverse and that's why it's very important to always practice your be reverses now you can also do two if you want most people just do one but hell I mean you can do too if you want I mean it's not a big deal whatever you're feeling you know but you could also do a beer verse and then air dodge okay so you can do a beer reverse air dodge you can do two of them you do it backwards I've been haven't done it done two in a while so it's kind of hard for me but um another thing people like to do now this is a brawl move but you would like to do c4 as well so that could also cover them I haven't seen it used yet in this game there goes the - let me see it been using this game yeah so I don't think it's pretty effective I mean you could do that and then just cover yourself there especially when you had like enough distance you could like be reversing and whatnot and there's that but there's so many options I mean especially because you can do a directional air dodge now so you can kind of also do another another fate there so that's good you do like that and then just land safely another thing is if you hold the B button holding grenade in the air and then you hold R at the same time while in the air right when snake hits the ground a shoe will come out right when he hit the ground shoe will come out so that's another good thing as well it comes out immediately so it is safe the only bad thing in those that does leave you in the air so you could get hit while you're you know just coming down it is kind of free in a way but if they don't hit you about time you hit the ground is all you have you're holding that shield button you'll be good to go now at times depending on the character again you might have to recover a low and it could be dependent on you know like if if it's like Simon or Richter like they have an up aerial that has a lot of range especially coming up so it can probably catch you a lot if you're recovering high a lot especially if you're on a playing on battlefield or something like this probably not follow destination but more than likely with like battlefield or you know anything with platforms really so at that point what we want to do is recover low and if you could use your air dodges to kind of get back on you don't have to just commit to just see pouring all the way up because if your opponent is good enough he could like read it out and then punish you from there like he could like let's say if he's used to you just coming up just regular like this but you just keep coming up like this he could be ready to just to fall and hit you with the back here and then it and then you could hit on get hit on the stage possibly get stage spike something like that so you know doing an air dodge is good good it is good you even if you're right here you could air dodge you're back on you don't have to always recover hi it's just recommending I mean that's what I recommend personally it's what I normally do as well it's my most I I get the most comfortable just coming from above because most characters you know they can't get all the way up there like I said some will be able to that's gonna be your decision at that point if you want to keep recovering high and and hopefully don't get hit or if you just want to be able to start recovering low another good thing is snakes c4 so this is his most popular way of getting back getting it getting back on the stage so let's say we're at I don't know let's say a hundred percent and we're not gonna make it let's say we're like down here and we're not gonna make it you can use the c4 blow yourself up and they get get back up if you're on a percentage like this you could get hit but you can hit your c4 by pushing down B and then you know and then blowing it up again and then you would push your shield button to tech the stage and as long as the timing is right which the timing is not even strict in this game anymore which is great you'll be able to take the stage easy until you hit annum a certain percentage I think around this percentage you can't take it anymore yeah you can't take it anymore at a certain percentage the snake will die so um at that point if you're at like 140 like how I just was you're not gonna be able to take it you just you're pretty much dead you're not gonna have anything else you could really do except probably air dodge up and then grab that the ledge that way but that's that's primarily it I mean if somebody hits you like let's say I say this cat that bucket hits me and on that I don't know let's just say like I don't know if he's strong enough let's say is that like 50% and then he does a smash attack no yeah yeah it's much tag okay so I fall down I could just air dodge Shawn you know again if you're not that far you get this air dodge back on what I would do is jump up beat and then come down what happens if you're like if you didn't di correctly I would try to recover low yep you di correctly and you're up and if you guys need a refresher on di did do a video of that as well so you can always check that out um that's that's really it okay so just recover hi all we want to do is recover hi what we can and if the opponent is reading you and there be and they're hitting you in the air just change it up and recover low and if it gets too much to where you know like you don't want to be consistent as well you still want to kind of mix up the way you're getting back on stage like if if I keep coming up like this like if I keep coming up in my and I'm angling it that way like towards the stage my opponent and my opponent keeps hitting me they're gonna be ready to keep hitting me from that angle so what nothing I'll do just go straight up and then go for the ledge instead instead of trying to get back on the stage itself you could also just go up and then air dodge you could have a grenade out when they hit you both you guys would get hit with the grenade you can air dodge back on and you have to be ready in these moments to trade with grenades it's gonna happen you have to be ready for as a snake player you just you just have to be used to hitting yourself and some people aren't used to that but it is it is snakes play style you know you get hit by your own stuff and it's gonna happen so it's a good defensive maneuver and it's a good good way to to reset and keep the opponent away from you rather than it's good to get hit with one grenade that get hit with like three or four uh pairs or neutral errors by like a Mennonite or something anyways I appreciate you guys watching this video

for watching you guys have a great rest today", "PucTjAcx-tA": "we're gonna everybody as promised I've got a really cool what I thought was a really cool topic today and I have a beautiful assistant with me this is Angela and today we are going to talk about how to introduce a snake to a non snake person we all have the retakes we all have the desire to show off our snakes and introduce people to snakes but are we doing it the right way so today we're going to talk about how to do that properly first and foremost let's cover the first thing everybody makes a mistake ladders you pick a snake and you put it around a person's shoulders someone who's not used to snakes what happens is that snake it's a little nervous or it doesn't feel secure you know state start tightening up and it makes the person a little uneasy so let's go over the best way to introduce a snake to a non snake person now fortunately this one is being converted to a snake person so it's going to be a lot easier so what you want to do is you want to tell the person put your hands out flat like that and you're basically just going to take the non Queeny end in place in their hands now what you do is you tell them you don't grab you just let them do what they want to do they get the feel the snake they get to experience what that snake will do and if it does tighten up it's just on the wrist and it doesn't freak too many people out as much as it would be around the neck so you have the pointy end on the opposite end and you're just going to keep the head away from that person because that's what makes them nervous when they have a head come up to him trust me this one knows she had a head come up to her and she got a little nervous which is perfectly normal but as you can see the tail wraps around the wrist there's no harm done they're getting an introduction to the snake without the least amount of anxiety as possible and then when you go to take the snake you just kind of lift them you let them know that you don't grab the snake you don't put you're on it because that's what makes the snake have a little bit of anxiety so we don't want that so we take the tail then you go around and pull them up now after that person gets more comfortable with it you can start painting them the opposite end again making sure that the head doesn't go close to them at which point you let them they'll just let the snake do what it wants and just use an opposite hand to redirect and eventually you can let that person take the whole snake and they feel completely comfortable but you always want to make sure you keep the head away from their face you don't let them go up and wrap around the neck or god sakes don't take the snake and put it on their shoulders right off the bat that's gonna cause anxiety for them it's gonna cause anxiety for the snake and that's when bad things happen so that was the super cool idea I had for a video let me know what you guys think this is going to be a short video so I just wanted to cover the basics of introducing your snake to a non snake person if you do it this way that person's chances of actually enjoying their experience are going to be tenfold so you don't have any kind of anxiety for them or the snake the snakes well behaved and everything goes as planned no bites no nervousness so everything is just good to go great assistant did a great job and I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions drop them in the comments below be sure to hit subscribe and we'll see you on the next video thank you", "cXkGGeO09ug": "hey what's up welcome to a new video and today we'll return to the fascinating world of the animal kingdom on planet earth a topic that never ceases to amaze me every time I start to investigate and this time there will be a very special twist because it's going to be a beauty contest in the wild so between the camera lens well and prepare to be dazzled because today and tasted hits we'll take a look at the seven most beautiful snakes that you won't believe exists the coral snake this masterpiece of Mother Nature can be found all over the Americas from Argentina to Canada as you hear it Brazil Colombia Mexico there's no hiding from these deadly beauties and boy are they deadly if you're unlucky enough as to be bitten by a coral snake you must seek medical attention immediately there will be no calmly googling for information we are talking about getting into a car and stepping on the accelerator until reaching the nearest hospital because the coral snakes venom will cause a respiratory failure that will end your life in one to three hours after the bite depending on the age of the snake your age and your weight so we should definitely admire its beauty from a safe distance the caliber constrictor foxy or blue racer this snake can be found in multiple places in the United States and Canada and it's characterized by its fairly glamorous color pattern blue racers are a variation of the species known as the Eastern racer and tend to have light and creamy bellies with light blue - deep blue side scales and dorsal scales ranging from dark blue to dark gray the resulting color pattern makes them look as if they were covered in blue silk as if they were wearing a very expensive evening dress and although not all the specimens of the species boast such intense colors some have been photographed looking like they're spray painted the Aqsa Belize full Geddes or Asian vine snake this curious little animal has an incredibly stylish and elegant appearance not only because of its thin sharp body and spear head head but also because of a beautiful pattern of black and white spots that covers its entire body and looks like a perfectly cut computer made vector texture the black and white rectangles run through the entire length of the snake's body and depending on its state of mind it can contract its muscles to partially or completely hide these patterns this results in a visual effect that can take your breath away and that the snake uses to perfectly camouflage itself in the jungles of Southeast Asia by pretending to be a vine the iridescent shield tail snake if you're familiar with the Pokemon franchise you sure know what I mean when I say that this is a shiny pokemon in real life this snake is an extremely rare variation of the Milano fede embel an idiom they normally have this appearance but absolutely extraordinary specimens have been found with a variation in the color of their skin that will leave any magic collectors speechless the skin of the snake shines in a metallic fashion when light bumps on it as if it were a special-edition snake and truth be told it is since only three specimens have been found with this type of scales and they've been named iridescent shield tail snakes let's hope there are many thousands of them even but that humans can never find them because well you know how humans are with all of that animal trafficking stuff [Music] the Achille enos formas honest or for motion odd scaled snake in this case I honestly don't know which name is more complicated to say this non-poisonous snake can be found on the island of Taiwan and is also known as the Taiwanese burrow snake since it has the habit of digging small burrows in the ground to sleep and relax on the other hand just like the incredible iridescent shield tail snake it also shines with the power of the rainbow however it's not as special because all the specimens of this species shine the same it's like saying that a white line is incredible because there are an anomaly but a polar bear being white isn't anything special because they're all white something like that [Music] and speaking of all polar bears being white well rainbow Boas are iridescent - the epic renascent ria or Brazilian rainbow boa for those of us who don't like Latin is absolutely shocking it's beautiful shades of copper and gold are covered by one of nature's most intense iridescent effects and although all rainbow Boas have this characteristic anyway like the four motion snake the combination of colors is still something that looks like it comes from a legend the Brazilian rainbow boa became seriously endangered because all over the world there are very wealthy and very selfish collectors who are willing to pay a lot of money and caused the death of many specimens in order to add a rainbow boa to their serpentarium fortunately today the traffic of these animals is about to be eradicated completely and the species is slowly recovering the thorn osis sirtalis tetra taenia the san francisco garter snake or the california red-sided garter snake call them whatever you will to me this is the absolute queen of this beauty contest some may think otherwise but just look at those colors intense turquoise vibrant orange ultramarine obsidian black the combination of colors makes it looks like a hallucination to travelers who find it in the wild and unfortunately it's increasingly rare that this happens because the poor California red-sided garter snake is in serious danger of extinction today it's estimated that there are only 1,000 to 2,000 adult specimens left in the wild and the number just keeps dropping due to the immense interest of reptile collectors so the best thing we can do is help educate people so that they know that the only way to ensure that animals like these continue to exist on earth is to respect them in their ecosystem and simply let them live in peace and well a new video comes to an end and now I wonder what other beauty contests in the wild we may have in the future let me know in the comments which of these snakes was your favorite and remember to leave a like share the video subscribe to the

we're kind of doing a whole group of filming in here today uh but we are in our zoo currently we're showing off one of our newer zoo animals now these came to us by way of a gentleman our lady i don't remember which now was a gentleman wasn't it i think so we think so and they sold off a chunk of a collection more or less and this was part of that collection so these are two a pair of asian vine snakes now asian vine snakes a few things about them is they're a little bit difficult to keep in the sense that they are lizard eaters typically so that's kind of what they like but you can see where their name comes from they're extremely long for their body size and they are venomous so yes we are free handling a venomous snake right now but let me put a little bit more context on that there they're venomous but not dangerous and you may be saying what but they're a rear fang snake and they have a very very mild toxin likely could not even get the rear fangs into you if they did bite you and if they did it's going to be like ow stop that it's not going to be anything deadly and dangerous you're not going to go to the hospital you're not going to lose an arm nothing like that it'll be really really uh mild super super mild so there is no fear in free handling these at all caleb's not taking any risk if he gets bit it's not going to do anything they do tend to like to bite in the face so i said he could be the one to do that because who the hell likes being bit in the face not this guy by anything even you really can't do much damage but yeah you're looking i see you give me the side eye so they have a really cool body shape that's where the name comes from they look like a vine you can see the head has got some width to it for getting that little lizard body down but they're mostly just this really long beautiful green snake they're pretty common in the pet trade but if you do want to get into them you do need to check we actually cannot sell these in the city limits we can possess them because of our pet shop license but technically we can't sell them because they are a rear fanged venomous species so some of your local laws may say no ours do now if you live in different states it's going to be different and even each municipality for example living out in the country if i wanted to keep these at my house i likely would be okay living in the city i cannot do it uh some folks will tell you that all rear fang venomous snakes are not deadly that is not true these guys aren't deadly your hog knows that you're technically a rear fang venomous snake are not deadly they're really common in the pet trade garter snakes another one are not deadly boom slangs are another one they'll kill you uh don't with boom slangs just because rear fang does not always mean not deadly but in this case it most certainly does and then you want to talk about these asian vines probably my favorite thing is there's three different species of asian vines um and each species has their own diet okay so this species here is a lizard and fish eater and they're mainly going to be on your lizards um and then there's another species that are strictly fish that's all they'll eat you can't even get them to eat a nose like you can these guys and there's another species that eats both those and bird eggs well some of them are easier than the other they all suck honestly though this one is the species that you want um because they eat a knolls and fish which are your two most readily available but what if i have bird eggs i mean i would not feed one from the wild just because you don't i mean you don't know what parasites but presley a lot of people will get like uh little quail eggs feed them those yup now is this one of the snakes i know there's a specific snake that does its name escapes me now we'll eat the egg and it's got little spikes inside like it's a pops it pops the egg so then they go not this their actually common name is bur uh egg eater that's their name um the other cool thing about these guys is like there's the way they move like they are just there will be times in there that i'm like oh shoot i'm missing one but it's really just they're so long and viney that they just blend right in so well it's a great camouflage the other thing is their metabolism is much different than other snakes most your snakes you feed once a week this one can eat two to three times a week and now part of that's due to being arboreal yes typically your snakes that are bored will have a much higher metallic they're moving a lot more yes and so like you can kind of look at it like this so let's look and take one extreme let's take our blood pythons right our blood pythons they pretty much sit they don't do they hang out and you don't have to feed them a whole lot as a matter of fact you want to not feed them all the time correct right they're fun we had to slow ourselves down because they're fun but you need to put them on a different feed schedule when they're adults babies and adults but you don't want to do your pythons well pythons are kind of that middle snake they're going to hide in their height a lot they may come out and do some cruising at night get a little exercise they can eat about once a week be good to go it's about perfect for them plus it's hard to get to feed every week anyway but when they're going that's not going to be a problem it's really hard i think to get a ball python truly obese yeah i haven't really seen it and then these guys being arboreal they move constantly these your green tree python dremel tree boas anything that's up in the trees all the time can probably eat a little more frequently and they also tend to not always eat huge meals exactly because that big chunk's going to slow them down so they prefer to eat some smaller meals more frequent than big meals every so often unlike your blood but you can give it a big meal and say bye i'll see you in a month and it's going to be content exactly so most your snakes like you're saying you go off you know you want there to be slightly bulger or whatever these guys you don't even go off by the width of their belly you go by the size of their head you want the the prey item you're eating to be a little bit smaller than their head if you look the head is not real big on these guys at all i can lift that up for the camera there it's pretty tiny uh so you know you're thinking about it in the nola the knoll is not a really big snake so it's kind of kind of cool i always love their head shape too and in some ways it's not exactly right but it almost reminds me mambas because they got that coffin shaped head yep you know these have a little bit different snout yeah but kind of that coffin head shape you know a really only thing a mom is also greens especially our boarder their eyes are very unique too yeah it's almost like a slit that's going the wrong way mm-hmm and i wonder i don't know a whole lot on their eyesight but i wonder if it has to do with just being able to see a knolls in in their in their camouflage and if we look at their belly really quick someone want to share just turn your hand right here so on their belly too if you look there's white lines it's going to wrap around the camera go through the belly on both sides so it's solid green except for those white lines right there which i think is really kind of neat it has just a splash of contrast and color in that green and then the belly green is actually a lighter green see the darker green i'll like a lime green there on the belly i can get that to show without pissing this thing off and then uh we got the white also pre-installed tail so you can see it's searching for purchase it's holding on they use that tail for a lot kind of like your carpet pythons you want to be careful like i'm wearing a watch so i had to kind of watch that you don't want their tail to get pinched in there because they'll try to find a little crevice and stick that to hold on and you don't want to hurt them but speaking of your of their tail that's how you sex them you don't pop these guys you can probe them you can't pop them the long tail like this this is a female the longer that tail is it is a female really quick put in the comments if you know where a tail on a snake starts i do caleb does and we are going to reveal it here in a second but there is a a spot where a tail on a snake actually begins people the think no the whole snake is on a tail we'll save that for our stupid snake stuff people say the whole thing is one big tool no no it's actually not uh we gave you enough time to comment that was just some cheesy crap to get you to write stuff to help us in the logarithm but the snake's tail actually starts at this butthole as we say in the trade of the cloaca so clicking back would be the actual tail forward of that is his body and here you can actually see it because i don't have to look at the clicker you can see right about there i bet i'm touching this butthole yeah but let's see you can kind of get a peek here where is your cloak a little one well maybe right there yeah there it is and there's a green the white line break and you can see it put my thumb there pull back that's where the cloak is and that's where the tail begins so there is a body part of a tail a body ahead and all that they are more than just a tube and actually in some of your snakes your your pythons and your boas i believe you will actually have a hip bone in there uh right there by the cloaca where they think the legs and evolution used to be some of the thought processes so cool stuff yeah started shuttle factory they also want to share about these asian vine snakes uh just one other thing is i mean you're gonna see a lot of you're probably gonna see it probably picks up better on the camera there's probably a few bumps and bruises on these guys that is because 99.99 of your asian vine snakes are wild caught and none of them come in as babies they always come in as adults and so that means they've taken a beating of surviving in the wild so we're gonna see that stuff as normal that's how these two came to us but what we're gonna show off on patreon actually if you remember is these two came in and then they had personality for about six months we think right then we purchased their collection more or less for the shop and kept what we wanted and sold off but we didn't uh i'm sorry this car reflects a big old snake moving and i went squirrel uh but with that they actually were grafted so we actually have what we would consider to be captive hatched or their live birth so captive born babies they weren't bred in captivity these have not been bred in captivity very successfully i'm sure it's happened but it's not something anybody's great success seven times seven documented times i'm sure there's some random backwards guys every week no uh but so we do have some captive born babies which is still pretty rare but they have a really long time that they're grabbing it's like nine months isn't it yeah so basically if you breathe these and you knock your wife or girlfriend up you'll have babies at the same time so it's kind of a cool clock uh don't try that kurt did you breathe some asian vine snakes no but she did put a bun in the oven right so everybody say congratulations card he's gonna have a baby boy correct okay he's so excited be excited can you be excited yeah all right uh so that's all i really got was she wanted anything current no okay what else you want to add nope let's go see those babies on patreon you", "EchceNUaWNI": "nothing good thing any money but they want to remember my name is Giovanni Stefan Ciro Moretti I am now the new zoo manager and then we are going to change the zoo into the interactive one meaning everybody could have a experience and have a chance to hold or pet some of the animals here including this has snake massage as we just newly introduced then at the snake massage as what everybody thought is dangerous really trained the snake they could become with the snake the snake is untied so no problem at all and it's very tame you could feel the grip you could feel the snake itself and we'll try to educate you all about the importance of nature and then why we need to protect them so welcome here to our zoo and come and try it I love snakes it's never better had a pet snake my never had a snake this large before there you go it's actually not that heavy I'm not done yet not done yet what autism of Isabella albino oh hello Connie Kathy goodness I feel this is actually a good massage actually they're actually massaging my core and it's not too heavy except for the snake trying to constrict my neck it's actually quite comfortable good there you go where are the names of these snakes again [ __ ] maybe you could like roll me over on my back is my back roll over so no mobos yeah oh wow that's actually good put more more and more more pressure unit oh that's good a little lower Michelle Oh Lord who's this one this one right I think this one likes me and that's easy yeah this is AJ hey J how you doing whoa oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] as a snake seller go to Russia in the name of people on your head I massage that's so neat the nose did add a little bit a mold and you know where he's gotten on the glue in Manali it feels good it's nice very relaxing he's not a very passionate kiss or is he Oh oh yes the whole head do that I'll just need to send it down there lay a [ __ ] get the muffin yeah", "kBu2G1-upTU": "okay so if they were making hash bricks have two bowls 47 grams of Bruce Banner keep two bowls of 45 grams gold and ice aluminum brick and a couple of these parchment pieces brick is presses a brick of hash perfectly take a spoon take our key oh my cause on us so very pretty stuff press it down press it into the corners to the edges gently this is a fluffy Keith takes up a lot more space than it usually does and every strain is different can you grab me a business card kind of just flatten it out on the top roll around the edges this is because you want to be able to tuck your parchment into these edges nice type of cover battle machine in search ii parchment drop the top of the brick very carefully say you know ship the parchment around we lost about a third of a gram right there but such as like things happen give it a good squeeze we're gonna wrap it a couple of sheets of paper towel and we were going through our vise Jimmy because it will not fit into our press unless we clamp it with everybody so I'll be back in just a minute one all right so we're starting with our brick this thick and we are going to squeeze it down until it is about half as thick squeeze it hand tighten the vise at room temp flip it over just so this is even as we can make it and then it's back to the heat press it's now that thick so we have our heat press heated up to 105 degrees ours only presses on the bottom so we have to keep it sealed to get heat to transfer to the top and because it only heats on the bottom we're gonna take the thick chunk of our plate and put that on the bottom that's where most of the heat needs to penetrate this top plate is much thinner and much easier for heat to just pass right through so it'll go on the top side which is warm but doesn't have the doesn't have the extra power that the bottom side has this will lose its heat very quickly we only have it up to 105 degrees because we don't want to squeeze our our hash out through the sides this will want to retain a nice brick form we wanted to only really hash over on the outer layers and have the inside remained remain as a pristine as possible so before I run and I want to show you what it looks like well I guess I can't this papers aren't your type it was very tan yeah it's a very blonde and yellow when we put it in open the press fixing it on the bottom Center it in the press lever shut I always forget yeah to make sure it's nothing it's not squeezing too far give about 15 seconds and then you're gonna pull it out and it should be a darker color with a really nice gummy consistency something kind of like oh I don't know yeah something like that now these little blocks often get stuck if they do you can use where's my little rubber string use one of these little things to get up in there kind of force the park I didn't take a lot did it down to parchment one does two fingers push it down a little bit the other side two fingers in the corner and fold it up okay very clean you get a look closely camera yeah not a lot of residue at all it's good brick has been sufficiently cooked trim up the edges a little should you do that with a knife but don't want to cut your little papers cuz these things take forever to make and there you go oh wow yeah break a hash and a consistency go a little lower with your hands there you go oh yeah what kind of smell would you just go coming off that very high and carry off lean carry a filing tomato tomahto very high in Mersin kinda like cheesy mm-hmm grandma's Bistro mouth mm-hmm yes that's how we make a hash brick awesome and then for chopping so plate clean this is for chopping we just have it Oh first we should weigh it we going wreck it this brick weighs 47 grams pretty much every brick weighs 47 I'm sure those chocolate we I set it long ways yeah something like that tell is epic and then yeah it's chopped but we want to do that here at here as well yeah thanks a lot elbow grease doesn't it oh yeah whole lot of love goes into this product if you are a consumer and we're unaware takes me a whole lot of blood sweat and tears to make your tasty hash there's no real blood here but yeah hopefully no sweat yeah making some nice tootsie rolls huh yeah this stuff stuff is quite gummy it's very easy sometimes it's kind of powdery doesn't want to cut up very easy every stream behaves differently and also ending on how old it is how cold it is ki prefers to be cooled and also just the different temperatures at which you press this break out if you use no heat it will not really form up into this gummy consistency a more powdery want to fall right apart to use too much heat it'll turn black nasty and might squeeze up out the sides of your press all sorts of problems this looks like chocolate doesn't so yeah break me off a piece of that fat hash bar seriously oh yeah a little farther down there yeah beautimous ha and yeah that's how we make it that's how we make it guys and won't you tell the folks who you are I'm Josh I'm the processor here tops off campus for a little while longer this is my keys my process hey guys I'm Mike thanks for watching if you like to see please like share

and defend themselves with more subtle but no less effective weapons for many animals survival depends on a powerful discharge of venom the poisons of certain marine species are among the most lethal found in nature the sting of a box jellyfish or stone fish can inflict excruciating pain and even kill a human in an ironic twist these potent toxins are now sources of new wonder drugs deadly cone snails have helped researchers discover innovative ways to treat severe pain and a host of other human ailments for these seemingly defenseless animals life hinges on their lethal arsenals of venom [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in a coral garden animals of every shape and description we've a living tapestry this is the enchanting realm of the tropical reef in this undersea city the struggle to survive as the driving force behind the lives of all creatures many animals are both predators and prey and one of the most effective tools for survival is venom some species use conspicuous even flamboyant displays to advertise their toxins while others rely on more subtle needs to eat or not to be eaten of the many creatures which utilize venom only a handful are deadly to humans [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] of all undersea animals sea snakes have one of the most potent toxins their Venom's are far more powerful than those of most terrestrial snakes just a few drops are enough to kill a human many divers and swimmers have had the unnerving experience of a curious sea snake approaching or even touching them [Music] for humans there's really very little danger unless the snake feels threatened they're a wonderful animal to work with under the water because they're not threatened by us and so we can handle them as long as you're as long as you're gentle and they don't feel stressed then they're really a very easy animal to work with [Music] dr. Glenn burns is one of the world's foremost sea snake specialists over the past two decades he has captured and studied hundreds of the animals his research has helped to dispel many of the myths surrounding these intriguing creatures the danger to humans from sea snakes has been greatly exaggerated they are far less likely to bite us than virtually any venomous snake and unlike other deadly species they can be safely handled the inquisitive reptiles look at divers as just another piece of reef to explore in a search for their favorite foods we are clearly a greater threat to them than they are to us let's take her out of bag measuring and we'll check him for a tag that she kept this one's a mile the mouse actually don't grow as big as the females but this is this is a big mile right so anymore - which will pop him up here on the on the bench and if I hold the body and I'll get you to handle the rest of the body and we'll just stubble measuring nice because see snakes have little fear of man and are relatively easy to capture they are often killed for their meat and skins motor boats and fishing trawlers also take a heavy toll trapped in Nets the air-breathing snakes easily drown in a number of areas of the indo-pacific sea snake numbers are declining dramatically right off of the vent day oh she's cranky I want to get a snap went what made you like so if I hold the type of beer yeah can you just read it off under there yeah it's a 1.25 it's been she's wriggling okay so that's 1.25 snap vent all right now see when she starts to twist like this and it's better to put her down because I don't want to damage her because some actually the vertebrae in here are really delicate right so if I actually hold her and she starts to twist if I hold her too hard Aleksey dislocate the vertebrae in her neck so it's better to lay her down back away let her calm down and then start again people who are usually bitten by snakes are handling them either on deck the way we have been or fishermen trying to get them out of nets for example when someone is bitten by a sea snake the rabid use of anti-venom is crucial in helping the victims survive potentially fatal symptoms burns milks the snakes of their poison which is then sent back to serum labs to be developed into antivenoms okay so she gave most of a venom then just in one bite you can see it here in the bottom of the glass and that's a lethal dose that's enough to kill us both if she bit me now she's still potentially capable of delivering a lethal dose of venom even though we've just milked him when she bites you you don't really know how much venom but she's pumped into you it may be a dry bite I was bitten once before and and it was a dry bite I wasn't I was bitten but not envenomated and you don't know you don't know whether you have any better menu until you start to show symptoms if you if you can take ahead I'll just stop right there to distinguish individual snakes burns utilizes an electronic microchip called a pit tag with a minor surgical procedure he inserts the tiny device directly into the animal's body there guys there [Music] with a database of hundreds of snakes burns can track their migrations along the Australian coast and help identify animals killed in fishing nets or by boats [Music] very nice [Music] with much of seesnake behavior and biology a mystery there still remains a lot to learn about the enigmatic reptiles one of the reasons that we know so little about sea snakes is the fact that they are so venomous people tend to shy away from a potentially dangerous animal like that doesn't really lend itself to close observation I've been working with sea snakes for 20 years now and and I'll continue to work with sea snakes I still find them fascinating [Music] there's so much we don't know about them I mean so far we've been able to track some individuals but we've only been able to do it with like one species and there are so many more species to work with so you know I'll continue to work with sea snakes absolutely [Music] oh very craggy shake the venom of this marine animal is also one of the strongest toxins on earth but it's deadly poison is also giving new hope to patients suffering from acute pain [Music] Australia's Great Barrier Reef stretching for over 1,200 miles along the country's eastern coast the reef is the largest community of living organisms on earth to study one of the oceans most poisonous animals researchers from the University of Queensland traveled from the port city of Gladstone to remote Heron Island located at the extreme southern tip of the Great Barrier Reef Heron Island is a renowned bird sanctuary is also a staging point and research centre for scientists from around the globe [Music] this particular mission to collect deadly cold snails and extract their lethal toxins on a milligram per milligram basis the venom of this tiny marine mollusk is one of the strongest poisons found in nature [Music] coveted for their beautiful shells many collectors divers and beach walkers had discovered that the attractive snails pack a powerful punch they've been the cause of hundreds of serious injuries and several documented deaths their venom is strong enough to paralyze or kill a human in the envenomations process most individuals feel sharp pain they have a feeling of loss of control of body function and blood pressure can either go up or down they have trouble moving over breathing the neurotoxins of certain cone snails are so powerful that they can cause the human respiratory system to shut down while fully conscious and aware many victims lose the ability to breathe or the heart simply stops beating dr. Paul Elwood is a professor at the University of Queensland and a founding member of the xeno project Z Nome is a pioneering leader in the research and development of new medicines derived from the venom of toxic animals and a venom of the cone snail is likely the world's richest treasure trove of new drugs with over 50,000 different toxic proteins or peptides the cone snail family promises the most important pharmacology of any animal species with the right dosage and combination of peptide molecules these poisons appear to be highly given the treatment of a number of human ailments each kind of toxin impacts upon a different nerve system through humans some of these relate to pain others to blood pressure others to mood and others to muscle control so there are a huge source of potential drugs australia is home to 100 of the world's nearly 600 species of cone snails erin island with its immense surrounding reef is an ideal collection site okay straight out there I think it's gonna be another half an hour yeah I think so it'll be half an hour to get out to there in any case so okay well the tides still fair way to go get out there let's let's stop and have a look Lera gang where's that point during extremely low tides Elwood and his colleagues fan out across the shallow reef to search for cone snails let's do it Oh beautiful nice one guys over here Pepa talents he lives on top of the rocks and perceived by the growths on the shell with underneath it's all nice and shiny shiny living under the rock mm-hmm straight under that okay the researchers need only gather one or two snails of any given species their toxins can then the analyzed sequenced and replicated in a lab the collection of a small number of animals has a negligible impact on mollusk populations Sibelius or a brightest good absolutely just a young snapper there's nothing there certainly the unglamorous pivot and honey after dark the animals are more active as they leave their coral hideaways to feed at 2:00 a.m. the crew returns to the reef to search for the nocturnal hunters lock they're cruising around in the evening principle it's they should all be awakened and out practice it's pretty hard to see them in any case cone snails prey on worms other mollusks and fish and it's the species that hunt fish that are most deadly to humans as we are also vertebrates like fish these toxins unfortunately target our physiology the mollusks can smell their quarry from a considerable distance their mantle is drawn out and forms a siphon through which water enters providing respiration but also alerting them to the presence of their prey at a night most fish are asleep closing in on a goby the slow-moving snail readies its deadly harpoon in seconds the fish is immobilized and the mollusk waste no time in ingesting the huge meal the goby will satisfy the snails hunger for several days at the research station scientists extract tiny venom glands of various cone snails it's a laborious process and difficult work powerful microscopes reveal a closer look at the snails barbed weapons the mollusks Arsenal includes dozens of tiny harpoons the barbs are tethered to their body and packed with enough venom to paralyze or kill their prey cone snails are indeed one of nature's most brilliant and deadly designs [Music] in Queensland's largest city Z Nome utilizes cutting-edge technology to extract and synthesize the Venom's of cone snails and other highly poisonous animals one of australia's deadly killers the funnel-web spider is also a potential source of new drugs it's poison can be milked by gently stimulating the animal clearing up and exposing its large fangs the spider discharges a lethal venom principal scientists at Zeno combine skills in genomics chemistry and pharmacology in the pursuit of medicines based on animal toxins the researchers have a particular interest in cone snails the poisons of these beautiful mollusks are becoming the holy grail of new drugs the toxic molecules or peptides of cone snails work by disrupting communications between different cell groups by blocking these transmissions co\u00f1o toxins can effectively treat a wide variety of ailments they've got many hundreds of different peptides and what we do is take out one or two and isolate them look at their activity synthesize them chemically and then we can test them in people Venom's research has a very bright future we believe because it's got the potential to treat diseases that are presently untreatable you can really now start to get very excited about the potential leads to treat much wider range of disease depression epilepsy autoimmune diseases and acute pain are only a few of the areas in which cone snail Venom's appear to hold great promise scientists at Zeno have isolated peptides from the venom of nearly a hundred species of cone snails remarkably their toxins are far more potent and effective than morphine and other opiates and best of all they're non addictive [Music] the future of this research is pretty exciting the main reason I do this work is to discover new things as a traditional chemist we used to design new drugs from scratch every time we work with a venom we discover potent new molecule with potential procures it's fantastic to find many of the ocean's deadliest animals you have to travel to some remote places one of the most remote is propylene again [Music] there is no better place in the world to find the Seas most venomous creatures than Papua New Guinea boy is near the Earth's epicenter of coral reef biodiversity the region is harmed to a staggering variety of poisonous animals this nearly invisible invertebrate is the most toxic species of them all the box jellyfish they are responsible for more fatalities and serious injuries to humans than all other creatures in the sea combined including sharks box jellyfish are a deadly presence in the tropical Pacific the box jellyfish is of all the different venomous marine creatures it is the most venomous marine creature the poisonous part of the animal is going to be a set of tentacles and these tentacles contain specialized cells called new meta sites it's these new meta sites that actually cause the sting and cause the envenomations the toxin produced by the box jellyfish is a neurotoxin their acts on the transmission of nerve impulses from the nerve to the muscle victims that are stung by the jellyfish will have difficulty breathing and can go into respiratory arrest the poison can also affect the heart and go into cardiac arrest dr. Gary Rene is an expert on highly toxic marine animals his search for species like the cone snail and box jellyfish frequently bring him to places like Papua New Guinea oh this is a nice one this venom is is a scalding neurotoxin it actually blocks the transmission of the nerve impulse and the nerf to the muscle so effectively it paralyzes the muscle and so that fact in some cases the poison is so powerful that the person's transfer it to a hospital they have to put on a on a breathing machine a ventilator whether it's an extremely powerful poisons very interesting poison to the waters of Papua New Guinea the indo-pacific area as the greatest biodiversity marine life in the whole world and the greatest number of species are concentrated in very small areas this biodiversity offers the diver tremendous opportunity at sea most beautiful creatures in the world many of these are venomous and potentially dangerous but they all play a role in the ecosystem many fish in the sea utilize venom but most do so for defensive purposes only these harmless looking creatures are marine catfish they school together in a tightly packed group appearing almost as a single animal but they also have a hidden defense mechanism they are highly venomous dorsal and pectoral spines are packed with a lethal cocktail believe it or not these tiny fish have caused human fatalities this strange animal is a demon stinger beauty may be in the eye of the beholder but there are likely few who would find this creature attractive it is still sometimes referred to appropriately as a ghoul or devil fish everything about it is odd it can swim but its preferred method of travel is walking with foot like appendages it shuffles along the bottom [Music] [Music] [Music] the demon stinger is part of a very large extended family named scorp in a day or commonly known as scorpion fish [Music] distributed worldwide and virtually all seas scorpionfish come in a dazzling variety of shapes sizes and potency [Music] their venom lady spines are very effective defensive tools but to eat scorpion fish rely mostly on camouflage and lightning quick speed [Music] [Music] some species are highly territorial there is no room on this reef for 2 male scorpion fish after a prolonged match of nose to nose posturing the two adversaries prime themselves for a fight [Music] after locking on his foe both animals rest but after a few minutes the jousting continues [Music] this contest can last for hours [Music] not all scorpion fish are drab or ugly several members of this family are very striking animals their finery has inspired many names such as turkey lion or zebrafish like most scorpion fish their dorsal and pectoral fins are loaded with poison venom sacs at the base of their spines discharge a potent toxin at the slightest touch favorites in the global aquarium trade many hobbyists have learned firsthand that this is one beautiful fish that you do not want to handle this gruesome fellow is a stone fish the most venomous fish in the sea an envenomations from a Stein facial any of a collided fish any of the Scorpion fishes at all is extremely painful a colleague of mine was envenomated worse than fish so when we had to race him off the first date and get medical attention so I know firsthand just how much pain a person experience from stone fish almost to the point where you lose any rational thinking the way of stone fish envenomate cyou is the physical pressure of stepping on the spines ruptures the skin and then the pressure of your foot pushing down upon the spine compresses the venom sacs and the venom gets into you this colleague of mine who was in venom aided by stone fish and the intense pain I can imagine with someone who didn't have the same strength of character as he did may well have wanted to end their life rather than continue experience in the pan at the Australian Institute of Marine Science dr. Linden Llewellyn studies marine toxins and the animals that produce them Australia with a much larger population than New Guinea bears the brunt of serious envenomations in the tropical Pacific if you're interested in venomous animals Australia is a paradise yet some of the most venomous mosques in the world the most venomous jellyfish in the world people shouldn't get the wrong impression that getting out of bed in the morning and going for a swim is a dangerous thing to do envenomations and fatalities and poisonings from marine animals a red will be rarer than characters many jellyfish are poisonous but on a tiny island in the South Pacific this species evolved to survive in freshwater and lost its venom [Music] [Music] in the western Pacific lies a vast region known as Micronesia it is not a singular country or island but rather an immense oceanic Territory that contains over 2200 islands collectively they span an area greater than the landmass of the continental United States [Music] the tiny country of Palau is located on the far western fringe of Micronesia like emerald jewels in a turquoise sea its massive Lagoon is sprinkled with picturesque islands one of the most compelling underwater ecosystems here is not part of the ocean in the thick jungle of one of pals rock islands exists a strange aquatic phenomenon seismic upheaval caused a small portion of the lagoon to become trapped in the center of the island this eventually isolated a lake from the surrounding ocean jellyfish Lake is a brackish lagoon that is home to over a hundred thousand non stinging jellyfish a few species of fish and two types of jellyfish adapted to the decreasing salinity evolving certain unique characteristics most importantly the invertebrates lost their venom [Music] over the millennia the jellyfish developed a symbiotic relationship with algae algae is sustained by the energy of the Sun the plants live in the body of the jellyfish and provide sustenance to their mobile hosts the jellyfish carry the algae around the lake following the sun's rays to maximize production of new plants it's an unusual yet productive alliance of two very different species unlike the marine counterparts these animals have no use for venom they initially had no predators and didn't need to sting their food so evolution eventually we leave them other weapons they are perfectly safe to touch but another marine predator followed them into the lake it's unclear how or when they arrived but unlike the jellyfish these anemones did not lose their ability to sting ironically the jellyfish are now pray to the venomous and enemies [Music] to feed and especially to avoid being eaten most animals rely on some form of weapon or specialized behavior most mollusks hide behind thick shells of armor [Music] [Applause] other animals like this pygmy seahorse utilize camouflage to conceal themselves [Music] pipefish a close relative of seahorses mimics sea fans or corals some creatures take shelter in deep burrows while a few even bury themselves completely in the sand a number of species also work together to fend off attackers in this dangerous realm many animals form surprising alliances certain crustaceans are protected by sea cucumbers jellyfish or slugs they catch rides with their larger mobile hosts who also stir up the bottom to reveal tasty morsels of food in addition to meals and transportation these shrimp have another deterrent to avoid predation neuter breaks are poisonous if it weren't for their small size and inconspicuous habits these sea slugs would be star attractions of the reef unlike their cousins snails and bivalves neuter banks lack a protective shell they don't need one any creature foolish enough to ingest a neuter break would probably do so only once sea slugs are highly distasteful or even poisonous bright colors and markings serve notice that their flesh is extremely noxious but they are not naturally toxic they actually steal their weapons many neuter blanks are immune to the venom of stinging hydroids and an enemy's their favorite foods the venomous cells of their prey are transferred to fleshy appendages on their backs called Sarada when attacked by a predator the stolen toxins are used to repel the attacker [Music] this is a rare example of the use of an offensive weapon of one animal by another thievery and Venom's seem to work for these sea slugs they have very few predators sea urchins utilise needles sharp spines to dissuade predators but their defenses pack an extra punch tissue surrounding their spines is highly toxic fire urgent's are appropriately named contact with their spines can inflict pain worse than a third-degree burn damselfish crabs and shrimp find refuge in the stinging tentacles of an enemies although deadly to many fish and enemies provide shelter to a select group of tenants these vividly colored clown and enemy fish make their homes in the stinging tentacles of their fish eating hosts they acquire an immunity by continually covering themselves with mucus secreted by the anenome this in turn stimulates the anenome not to fire its stinging Barb's curiously an enemy fish are all born as males when the need arises a male will change sexes if a dominant female dies the largest male changes sex and takes her place and the largest of the remaining males becomes its partner [Music] there are countless ways to earn a living and protect oneself in this undersea community and the use of venom remains one of the most effective tools for survival tropical reefs and mangroves where sea snakes and other venomous marine animals live are being destroyed at an alarming rate [Music] coastal development overfishing global warming and disease are all taking their toll the collection of cone snails for the shell trade is also increasing millions are sold annually for as little as a few cents each to date there are no countries which monitor the collection and trade in ornamental shells other venomous animals like jellyfish and many species of scorpion fish are also declining in numbers we can only speculate on the lost opportunities for new medicines should more species become endangered or extinct and as most of these animals are predators it is difficult to gauge the impact on the marine ecosystem should they continue to disappear they may be key pillars in the undersea food chain see creatures produce some of the deadliest Venom's in nature and although they do injure and occasionally kill humans they hold enormous potential in the development of powerful new medicines [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "2No3i1MLuI8": "I found a big ol Copperhead back there last year when I was I don't know I'd get high every day and I was always hunting for the

weeks so it smells like he's under that rock I won't be able to the mouth man makes me matter and I bear pooping in the woods no rabbit to wipe with when me and big Cody go snake hunting I hope we find the snake because it helps keep his mind off his past and on church oh god wish I'd find something I hate you come out with you're not finding that you gonna walk out here on me yeah holler if

order today at rainbow mealworms dotnet hey what's up Rattlers I'm on one of the islands right now in New Caledonia and you actually need permission from the Tribal Council to be on this island not only did we get that permission the chief himself brought us here in his own boat for us to see some of the most amazing reptiles that New Caledonia has to offer and one of those is extremely common on this island it's a snake and the only snake native to canoe Caledonia they live in the ocean but they're not sea snakes so what are they well come with me and I'm gonna show you exactly what they are I'm Dave Kaufman and I am obsessed with reptiles and I have been since I was 9 years old 25 years later I made a trilogy of award-winning movies about them now my life is all about touring the world in search of them in wild places and checking out some of the most awesome breeding facilities and reptile Expos while I'm at it so come with me and join my reptile adventures [Music] so this is not a sea snake this is a crate this is a crate who just took a dump on me I seem to have gotten some secret sauce on me so this is not really a sea snake these are crates this is a sea Krait this is a New Caledonian sea Krait it is the only species of snake native to New Caledonia but there are a lot of similarities between this and sea snakes but there's also a ton of differences unlike sea snakes these guys have wide ventral scales typical of a terrestrial snake but like sea snakes they've evolved a paddle tail so unlike sea snakes these guys frequently come up on the land and there's a couple of reasons for that one these waters are infested with sharks and these guys are a perfect snack for a hungry shark second unlike sea snakes these guys are egg layers and they have to come up on the land in order to lay their eggs in the soft sandy beaches here where are sea snakes are live bearers and they give live birth out in the ocean so this is not a sea snake this is a sea Krait and I'm gonna go show this to the other guys right now because let's face it friends don't keep secrets from each other this is an extremely venomous snake but as you can see they are totally Placid they are totally docile he doesn't want any ill-will towards me as long as I handle him gently and carefully and show him that I'm no threat his venom is extremely potent and extremely fast-acting and the reason for that is these guys aren't the fastest swimmers so when it goes hunting in the ocean and it bites a fish that fish has to die immediately or this snake is going to lose its prey so the interesting thing about this snake is that they've never been observed eating on land they do all their hunting in the ocean where they eat mostly fish but they also take down crabs and eels and squid and with that potent venom one bite and their prey item doesn't go very far so besides the paddle tail secrets have another adaptation for life in the ocean their lungs run the entire length of their body so they can stay submerged for a really long time with one breath so along these reefs behind me I can see them surfacing so I'm gonna grab my snorkeling gear and I'm gonna get out there and I'm gonna see if I can see that paddle action in action [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] as you can see even if they ocean as well as on the land guys are just docile as could be all right little guy gonna head back to the ocean come on let's go whoa [Music] so you're probably wondering by now if these snakes are so extremely venomous and that venom is so fast-acting why am i free handling them not showing off just for the video I'm doing that to illustrate a point and that point is is that even though a snake is venomous they're not necessarily dangerous and when we give that

"hey guys this is Emily with snake discovery and today we'll be discussing one of many controversial subjects in the reptile community we'll be going over the pros and cons of each side and then discussing what we have found to work best with our own animals this is one of those subjects that a lot of reptile keepers and breeders have strong opinions about and as a result we will be keeping an eye on the comments section below constructive comments are more than welcome however if things kind of get out of hand basically harassment will not be tolerated so those comments will be removed and if it gets too bad we will have to disable comments for this video so please remember to play nice in the comments section below anyway I hope this video helps you out when it comes to taking care of your own reptiles and enjoy today we'll be talking about whether it's best to use paper towels or newspaper for bedding or an actual substrate but first of course this is my Western Fox neck Vulpix she will hopefully be a breeder snake of ours this year it all depends on if our male figures out what to do let's start with paper towels and a lot of these discussion points apply to newspaper too but I'm just gonna say paper towels but you can assume that I also mean newspaper paper towels are cheap and they are easy to clean when an animal goes to the bathroom you simply remove the soiled paper towel and replace it with a clean one and that helps you keep a clean sterile environment for your animal they also allow you to monitor your animals droppings easier you can see if there's any blood in their stool or you can see if you're treating for like parasites if there's any worms in their stool so for that reason we do recommend using paper towels as a substrate when you are quarantine any animal or treating them for any parasites or other illnesses for example with snake mites if you're treating a snake with mites paper towels allow you to see the effects of the treatments by visually seeing dead mites on top of the paper towels after the treatment so it's a really good way to monitor treatment processes to the Const using paper towels is that they don't look very natural they don't replicate a nice natural environment to an animal but the animal doesn't necessarily care as long as their temperature and humidity requirements are met so that's really something that's up to you as the owner and what you want the environment to look like yourself another by using paper towels is that snakes may accidentally ingest them while they're eating their food we've heard plenty of stories of snakes eating their mouths of their rat and then that rodent sticks to the paper towel so the snake being not a very smart animal will admit it will eat the paper towel too and that can cause impaction issues or it can lead to regurgitation or it could even lead to death in some cases however in our opinion the biggest drawback to using paper towels is that they do not offer any digging opportunities for species that like to burrow there are plenty of species of snakes and lizards like uromastyx I like to dig in the wild and by using paper towels they have nothing to dig in on the other hand if you offer a substrate to an animal especially a species that likes to burrow naturally in the wild they have plenty of opportunities to do so using a substrate it offers a lot of enrichment opportunities for them as well using a substrate also makes the environment look more natural to the snake which again is based on your opinion on what you'd like the environment to look like but there's also a wide variety of substrates to choose from for your reptiles if you have more of a desert eat I prep tile you can use a drier substrate or if you have a snake that likes well-drained soils like hognose snakes you can give them Aspen fibers so that they can burrow but those Aspen fibers stay dry whereas if you have a more tropical species of snake like say a false water Cobra you can use something like Cypress bedding to retain humidity levels for them of course we've kind of touched on it earlier but if you use the substrate the snake if it ingest some of that substrate it's only going to ingest a small amount so you know a small amount that sticks to the rodent you still want to reduce the amount of substrate they ingest as much as you can but at least using a substrate make sure that they don't eat all of the substrate in their enclosure like they would if they had a paper towel I got stuck to there rodents another pro to using substrate is that you can easily spot clean different sections in the enclosure so say for our snakes we feed them on Sunday nights mostly and we're used to them pooping on Wednesday or Thursday so on those days we go into the enclosure and we just clean out the small spots that are soiled in the bedding whereas if you used paper towels when a snake poops it goes everywhere and it gets soaked up by all the paper towels so you pretty much have to remove all of their decorations their water dish remove all the paper towels and then replace them with clean ones so when comes to spot cleaning using an actual substrate makes it a little bit easier but when you have to do a thorough cleaning of the enclosure and you use the substrate then it takes a little bit more work than paper towels do you have to remove all the decor the water dish you have to dump out all of the bedding and if you use like a glass tank you can't necessarily pick up the tank and dump it out you have to scoop it out manually so it does take a little bit more work to do a deep cleaning of a tank that uses substrate another con do using substrate is that it's usually a little bit more expensive than using just paper towels but if you know where to go like we buy our Aspen fibers for five dollars for a huge bail at Fleet Farm if you know where to go it's very similarly priced to paper towels however one more con of using the substrate is that you cannot monitor your animals droppings as easily because after a snake goes to the bathroom they may bury their stool with the bedding which may soak up maybe blood or anything else you want to monitor in their dropping whereas a paper towel you'd see it all sitting there both paper towels and a substrate can be tweaked and tailored to control humidity levels in the enclosure with paper towels you just keep them damp and then that increases humidity and with substrate you just use a humidity retaining soil like Cyprus or topsoil or like eco earth and those will retain humidity levels as well a happy meeting but a lot of people with lizards use for substrate would be tiles or linoleum the nice thing about tiles especially is that you can buy tiles that have kind of a rough coating on them so when the lizard runs across the tile it grinds down their nails at the same time there's nothing for the lizard to ingest when you use tiles because there's nothing for the food to stick to and cleaning is just a matter of sweeping to clean up little spots here and there or if you have to do a deep cleaning you can actually remove those tiles and just hose them down in the sink obviously you wouldn't want to use tiles on a tropical species of lizard because they don't hold in humidity at all but rather you would use them for desert dwelling species like leopard geckos or bearded dragons and on that subject I do want to quickly touch on the use of sands in a terrarium it's nowadays pretty much frowned upon to use stay underground walnut shells in an enclosure because of the impaction risk if you feed a lizard on a sand substrate they very well could that insect and grab some sand with it and eat that too and too much sand will collect in their gut and it doesn't pass through and that causes major impaction issues which sometimes leads to death there is a specific case that I would like to share with you but it's kind of a graphic image so I'm going to put a link to it in the description below and it's of a leopard gecko that ingested too much sand which caused a major blockage internally and led to his death you may think that leopard geckos live on sand in the wild right their need of to Pakistan it's a very hot dry climate that you're living on sand and they eat insects on sand too but that is not necessarily true these sands they live on in the wild is very compacted and it's really more of a rocky environment instead of the loose sands that people may provide them in captivity so it's not a natural environment to give them just loose sand in their terrarium something that may seem very similar to sand but it is in fact different would be using a seed mixture for the substrate for uromastyx lizards breeders and pet stores will often use a seed base because the uromastyx will actually eat and they crunch down seeds in the wild so if they accidentally eat their substrate since it's seeds it doesn't hurt them at all so you really have to know the natural history of your animal before deciding on what substrate to give it finally what do we do with our animals well with our sub-adults Burmese python and reticulated pythons we give them a newspaper bedding because when they go to the bathroom it goes everywhere and we would have to change health they're petting regardless even if it was a substrate we'd have to swap it all out so just for ease of care and to make sure everything stays as clean as possible we give them the newspaper bedding however with almost all of our other animals all of our other snakes we give them Aspen fibers because they retain the shape of tunnels pretty well and that's especially useful for our hognose snakes they love to burrow in those tunnels and they're pretty much hidden throughout the day but with our more tropical species of snakes like our false water cobras and our tricolor hognose snakes we use a combination of Cypress bedding and eco earth mixed together because that mixture maintains a nice high humidity level for those species we feel that providing a type of substrate that allows for burrowing opportunities gives them a source of enrichment throughout the day the snakes especially like our bowls bull snakes don't burrow themselves in the wild but they will go down into mole or Volta NAL's to find their food so in our house or in captivity they just make their own tunnels with the softer slightly looser substrate of Aspen fibers that we provide them they love to burrow around and we find them digging all over their enclosures and they just love it so based on how we see their behavior when using a substrate we do like to give them that source of enrichment this is again just one of those subjects that you have to make a decision on on your own after doing your own research if you have a type of snake that is adamant on burrowing in the wild then I would highly recommend giving them some sort of substrate to allow them to do that in captivity however if you have a snake like a ball python that doesn't necessarily burrow in the wild and you want to give them newspapers or paper towels you can do so and the snake should be just fine by the way if you use newspaper as a substrate Europe and the United States and we're pretty sure some other places do too but we weren't able to confirm it use soy based ink for further newspaper which is safe for the reptiles so using newspapers is a safe substrate to use at least in those areas and again don't forget to keep doing your own research to determine what's going to work best for not only you but for your setup and for most importantly your animal in the end thanks for watching today's video I hope it kind of cleared some things up on both sides and we'll see you next time [Music]", "lq8N3SSeT_U": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] so hey everyone we're here with karl schlum the senior herpetologist at the shaka sea world we've just after releasing the yellow uh sea snake that was washed up on changa beach more than a month ago carl can i just ask about the general um health of the snake and how it recovered while in your care okay so when it did come in it was pretty weak it was just very lethargic you could basically pick it up it wouldn't there was no aggression whatsoever um from then um we basically had our veterinarian checked it out and we kept it in an exhibit we did originally force feed it or assist feed it should i say um and it just grew from strength to strength you know and it actually just it was very dehydrated too one thing with these sea snakes is that they do drink fresh water a lot of people don't think they drink fresh water so they drink from rain that rains on the surface of of of the of the ocean and they drink from that so we we rehydrated the animal and it just took a a turn and it started eating pretty much on its own and um yeah it's just grew from strength to strength and um and it must be an amazing feeling of being involved in the release as well today i mean uh the snake swam off it seemed to smell fine you were in the water with this leg um how did you find the release how did the release go rather sorry but they're a bit rough out there today so it was pretty difficult to stay with him what we did is we took some palm fronds and we used it as flotsam for him out there so you could have something to to to hug around and and feed off and what they do is they that's how they basically survive they will they will find flotsam and then eat the fish that hang on that flotsam and so we gave him a start he didn't seem to hang around it when we left him but let's hope he stays with it and finds some food for himself awesome thank you so much for your time", "w636UNx4zr4": "On this episode of 60 Second Snakes we will\nbe talking about three similar looking snakes, the eastern garter snake, Butler\u2019s garter\nsnake and the northern ribbon snake. Here\u2019s what to look for\u2026 First, for all three of these black, brown\nor olive colored snakes, you will notice a distinct yellow stripe down the back. Some individual\u2019s stripe may be a more vibrant\nyellow while others may be pale yellow to white. Eastern garter snakes may even have a reddish\ntint to their yellow stripe. Next, examine the size. The eastern garter snake, the most common\nMichigan species, ranges from 2 to 4 feet in length, whereas the Butler\u2019s garter snake\nand northern ribbon snake are slightly smaller ranging 1 to 3 feet in length. Finally, note a few differences such as the\nnorthern ribbon snake\u2019s white check patches or the eastern garter snake's tongue, which\nis red with a black tip! There is no need to fear any these harmless\nsnakes who eat smaller critters like earth worms and frogs. You may encounter one of these important Michigan\nresidents in your back yard. This has been 60-second snakes. Visit Michigan.gov/wildlife to learn more.", "5xaxh6qehzE": "Welcome to Wild Strike these are top 10 most venomous snakes in the World. These toxic highly poisonous snake species are filled loads of venom in each snake bite. You won't believe how poisonous number one is! Number 10 : The Rattlesnake. At number 10 we have The Rattlesnake. Rattlesnakes are best known for, and most easily recognized by their rattle. The Rattlesnake babies are born with what is called a pre button. The baby snake loses this piece when it sheds its skin for the first time. With the shedding a new button appears with every shedding after that another button or rattle will be added. These buttons are made up of a material called keratin. Which is what the scales and your fingernails are made of. The Rattles are empty so what makes the noise? The noise comes from each segment knocking together. So until a rattlesnake has two or more pieces it isn't going to make a sound. But when it does you will hear it and you will run! Rattlesnakes are found in the Southern parts of the United States, from the deserts to the mountains and grow between three and four feet or nine to 1.2 meters long. There are 16 different types of rattlers. Such as The Eastern Diamondback, Western Diamondback, Sidewinder and the Speckled. Just to name a few. Rattlesnakes feed on rodents, squirrels rabbits and other small critters. They hibernate through the winter and come out in the spring to eat and then mate. Rattlesnake eggs will stay inside their mother until they hatch. Most of the time there are eight to ten babies born at once and are about 10 inches long. Babies are born venomous but cannot rattle and are often more aggressive than the adults. Rattlesnake bites are a medical emergency. Rattlesnakes are venomous, if you're bitten by one it can be dangerous. The first and most important thing to do is get away from the snake as they can strike again if they feel threatened. Don't waste time trying to catch the snake but try to remember its size and color. This may help your medical team identify which species it was that bit you and locate the correct anti-venin. Seek medical assistance as soon as possible. Call for an ambulance if you're able to. Number 9 :  Acanthopis Antarcticus or The Death Adder. At Number 9 we have The Death Adder. Native to Australia and New Guinea, The Death Adder actually hunts and eats other snakes. Its venom has a median dose of 0.4 milligrams per kilogram. One single bite from the  Antarcticus injects between 40 to 100 milligrams of venom into your system, which is capable of ending you in just six hours. The venom is very energetically expensive to produce and is not always injected with a bite. Dry bites are regularly reported with Death Adders with snake bite victims not showing any symptoms nor requiring any anti-venom. This illustrates the point that these bites are warning bites and that venom injection is a voluntary action chosen by the snake depending on the perceived level of threat. Within Australia, Death Adders are an outlier among all other venomous snakes. Whereas other venomous snakes in Australia are active foragers, Death Adders are a sit and wait ambush predator. Their reluctance to retreat has even led to their alternative name of \"Deaf Adder\" based on the misled belief they cannot hear approaching humans. As we know, no snakes have external ears but they do pick up on ground vibrations. Number 8 : Viper. The Viper daw or vipers are a family of venomous snakes found in most parts of the world. With the exception of Antarctica, Australia, Hawaii, Madagascar. Various other isolated islands and north of the arctic circle. All have relatively long hinged fangs that permit deep penetration and injection of snake venom. Four sub-families are currently recognized. They are also known as viperids. The name Viper is derived from the latin word vipera. They eat small animals and hunt by striking and envenomating their prey. Vipers are characterized by a pair of long hollow venom injecting fangs attached to movable bones of the upper jaw, the maxillaries that are folded back in the mouth when not in use. Their eyes have vertical pupils and their scales are keeled. Vipers range in length from less than 25 centimeters or 10 inches. In the Namaqua, Dwarf Viper (Bitis Schneideri) of Southern Africa to more than three meters or 10 feet in the Bushmaster (Lachesis Muta) of the Amazon basin and Central America. They're extremely fast snakes. A Viper bite can cause you pain for up to a month. They can also cause you to end two weeks after being bit through septicemia cardiac failure or respiratory failure. Number 7 : The Philippine Cobra. The Philippine Cobra (Naja Philippinensis) also called Northern Philippine Cobra is a stocky, highly venomous species of spitting cobra native to the northern regions of the Philippines. The Philippine Cobra is called a Ulupong in Tagalog. The venom of the Philippine Cobra is a potent postsynaptic neurotoxin which affects respiratory function and can cause neurotoxicity and respiratory paralysis, as the neurotoxins interrupt the transmission of nerve signals by binding to the neuromuscular junctions near the muscles. Research has shown its venom is purely a neurotoxin with no apparent necrotizing components and no cardiotoxins. These Snakes are capable of accurately spitting their venom at a target up to three meters or 9.8 feet away. The symptoms of a bite might include headache nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dizziness and difficulty breathing. Bites by The Philippine Cobra produce prominent neurotoxicity with minimal to no local signs. Its venom makes it drop or drop one of the worst of all cobra species. While their bite only causes minimal tissue damage to your system, its venom can lead to respiratory paralysis and neurotoxicity within just 30 minutes. Number 6 : Tiger Snake. Tiger Snake is a genus of large venomous snakes in the family Elapidae restricted to subtropical and temperate regions of Australia. Tiger Snakes are a large group of distinct populations, which may be isolated or overlapping, with extreme variance in size and color. Individuals also show seasonal variation in color. The total length is typically about 1.2 meters. The patterning is darker bands, strongly contrasting or indistinct, which are pale to very dark in color. Coloration is composed of olive, yellow, orange brown, or jet black, and the underside of the snake is light yellow or orange. The Tiger Snake uses venom to dispatch its prey, and made bite an aggressor, they are potentially fatal to humans. tolerant of low temperatures, the snake may be active on warmer nights. When threatened, they flatten their bodies and raise their heads above the ground in a classic pre-strike stance. This Australia's Tiger Snake delivers an extremely potent neurotoxin that can end you within 30 minutes. Its strike is extremely accurate and has a non-survival rate of about 60 to 70 percent. The Tiger Snake's bite causes you to pass by delivering localized pain, tingling, and numbness followed by a rapid onset of breathing difficulties and finally paralysis. Number 5 : Black Mamba. Number 5 is The Black Mamba. The Black Mamba inhabits a wide range in sub-saharan Africa. Its range includes Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of The Congo, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Mozambique, Swaziland, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, South Africa, Namibia and Angola. The species is both terrestrial ground living and arboreal tree living ; it inhabits savannah, woodland, rocky slopes and in some regions, dense forest. It is diurnal and is known to prey on birds and small mammals. Reaching speeds of up to 20 kilometers per hour or 12.4 miles per hour, The Black Mamba is known as the fastest land snake in the world. It's capable of striking up to 12 times in a row, with each bite delivering an average of 100 to 120 milligrams of venom in each bite. Black Mamba bites that are left untreated have an ending rate of almost 100 percent. In a threat display, The Black Mamba usually opens its inky black mouth, spreads its narrow neck flap and sometimes hisses. It is capable of striking at considerable range and may deliver a series of bites in rapid succession. Its venom is primarily composed of neurotoxins that often induce symptoms within 10 minutes, and is frequently fatal unless antivenom is administered. Despite its reputation as a formidable and highly aggressive species, The Black Mamba attacks humans only if it is threatened or cornered. It is rated as a least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's - Red List of threatened species. Number 4 : The Taipan. Taipans are snakes of the genus Oxy- uranus in the elapid family. They are large, fast moving, highly venomous, and endemic to Australia. There are currently three recognized species, one of which The Coastal Taipan, has two subspecies. Taipans are considered some of the deadliest known snakes. Species of this genus possess highly neurotoxic venom with some other toxic constituents that have multiple effects on victims. The venom is known to paralyze the victim's nervous system and clot the blood, which then blocks blood vessels and uses up clotting factors. In 1950 Kevin Budden, an amateur HHerpetologist, was one of the first people to capture a Taipan alive, although he was bitten in the process and died the next day. The snake which ended up dying a few weeks later, was milked by Melbourne zoologist : David Fleay and its venom used to develop an anti-venom, which became available in 1955. Two antibiotics are available : CSL Polyvalent antivenom and CSL Taipan antivenom, both from CSL limited in Australia. The Taipan's venom is potent enough to make 12 000 guinea pigs pass. Its venom is neurotoxic and causes blockage in your arteries or veins. It can end you within an hour and before the invention of antivenom, there were no known survivors of a Taipan bite. Number 3 : Blue Krait. Number 3 is The Blue Krait. Bungarus Candidus, commonly known as the Mlayan Krait or Blue Krait, is a highly venomous species of snake. The Blue Krait is a member of the family Elapidae. The Malayan Krait may attain a total length of 108 centimeters or 43 inches, with a tail 16 centimeters or 6.3 inches long. Dorsally it has a pattern of 27 to 34 dark brown, black or bluish black cross bands on the body and tail which are narrowed and rounded on the sides. The first cross band is continuous with the dark color of the head. The dark crossbands are separated by broad yellowish white interspaces, which may be spotted with black. Ventrally, it is uniformly white. Blue Krait are found throughout Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia (Java, Sumatra, Bali, Sulawesi) Malaysia (Malaya) Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Blue Krait are deliver a neurotoxin 16 times more powerful than that of a cobra. Its venom causes muscle paralysis within 6 to 12 hours of being bit. But even if you do get treated for a blue christ bite and manage to survive, you can still suffer from permanent coma or even brain damage due to hypoxia. Number 2 : Eastern Brown Snake At number 2 we have The Eastern Brown Snake. Found along the major population centers of Australia, the eastern brown snake is known to chase its aggressors and strike them repeatedly. Just one slash 14 000 of an ounce of The Eastern Brown Snake's venom is sufficient enough to make adult human pass, through the use of both neurotoxins and blood coagulants. The adult Eastern Brown Snake is up to two meters or seven feet long with a slender build. Its variable upper parts can be several shades of brown, ranging from pale brown to almost black, while its underside is pale cream yellow, often with orange or gray splotches. The Eastern Brown Snake is found in most habitats except dense forests. It has become more common in farmland and on the outskirts of urban areas benefiting from agriculture due to the increased numbers of its main prey : the introduced house mouse. The species is oviparous. The snake is considered to be a least concerned species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), though its status in New Guinea is unclear. The Eastern Brown Snake is responsible for about 60 percent of snake by deaths in Australia.

Number 1 : And at number one is The Inland Taipan. The Inland Taipan (Oxyuranus Microlepidotus) also commonly known as The Western Taipan, the small-scaled snake or the Fierce Snake, is a species of extremely venomous snake in the family Elapidae. The species is endemic to semi-arid regions of Central East Australia. Aboriginal Australians living in those regions name the snake Dandarabilla. It was first described by Frederick Mccoy in 1879 and then by William John Macleay in 1882, but for the next 90 years, it was a mystery to the scientific community ; no further specimens were found and virtually nothing was added to the knowledge of this species until its rediscovery in 1972. The Inland Taipan is a specialist hunter of mammals. So its venom is specially adapted to kill warm blooded species. It is estimated that one bite possesses enough lethality to kill at least 100 fully grown humans. It is an extremely fast and agile snake that can strike instantly with extreme accuracy, often striking multiple times in the same attack, and it envenomates in almost every case. This native to Australia snake's venom is neurotoxic and causes blockage in your arteries or veins. It can end you within an hour and before the invention of antivenin there were no known survivors of a Taipan bite. Although extremely venomous and a capable striker, in contrast to the rather defensive Coastal Taipan, The Inland Taipan is usually quite a shy and reclusive snake, with a placid disposition and prefers to escape from trouble. However, it will defend itself and strike if provoked, mishandled or prevented from escaping. Because it lives in such remote locations, The Inland Taipan seldom comes in contact with people. Therefore it is not onsidered the deadliest snake in the world overall, Especially in terms of disposition and human deaths per year. The word \"fierce\" from its alternative name describes its venom, not its temperament. Hey, Thanks for Watching!! If you like the video, don't forget to click the subscribe button and the bell icon.

snake in the world this may can actually bite you with its mouth shot not only that it possesses a venom that can melt bone so let's go ahead and take a closer look hey YouTube how's it going Ben a man 20 here today and before I get started on what I have on the table let me go ahead and mention that I am uploading on different days now I will be uploading every Monday and Thursday night so hopefully you'll still be able to get around and see my videos I want to try to keep that going as long as that humanly can anyway I have a planet on the table trying to hide this guy because he's freaking out a little bit these are burrowers and it can't burrow so it feels a little stressed this is a snake unlike any other snake in the world let's go ahead and show him to you hopefully don't flail tiny doesn't look at those too dangerous but he very much is this is a snake from the family of abstract aspen extract acid a hard word to say this is the Stiletto snake burrowing ask for the mobile Viper it's not an actual Viper it'll kind of instead of classification all of their home very interesting they actually have a toxin that the no other snake to my knowledge possesses quite this same toxin it's a sarasu toxin which actually drops the blood pressure it also is known to eat through bone I was trying to get some images for you guys and then you could actually see how it liquefies the bone because it's grotesque it's very gross but uh what that means I just I couldn't get them I couldn't get permission to use them as of this video so if you don't want Google you can look up stiletto snakebite and it'll show you everything you want to see um but with that being said these guys are not typically biters I mean they're not bad you know they live underground they bite as a defense if they have to but they don't go out of their way to bite hey guys I got tiny little eyes they don't see real well to the best of my knowledge he's fast and very okay and she's getting ready to shed it's a little male there's quite a few different types of still snakes only I do believe two times have ever caused human fatalities but these guys do not strike straight out and grab a hold of you like a Viper toss their fangs are weaker kind of like a Viper they go straight back in the mouth and they'll come up alongside their prey go pass it and come back and stab into it so this snake to pin it is impossible you can't pin this snake a lot of people tried and a lot of people have been bit everybody oh I can do it and then yeah that doesn't work out too well so these also have a tendency to flail um if you know much about working with venomous snakes a snake the flails is the hardest snake in the world will work with I have worked with some models of flail and forest Cobra spoil and Taipans can flail a common Brown snakes where all the really hard snakes to work with flail these guys are no exception to actually touch a snake is a very very risky and hard maneuver to do I've tailed them but only with the assistance of a hook and only because he's very calm today he's okay can't see very well it's a different story these guys also have a very cytotoxic venom so it literally melts the flesh very interesting like I said they live underground they eat little little fuzzy mice hey guy I'm definitely going to try to get a feeding video over this guy because I think that would be absolutely awesome to see him actually stab backwards they just come out of side of the mouth they don't even have to open up their very cool that's the Stiletto snake for the first time it just been feeling very salt very cool will come quick will pink tone these guys do not get very big there they stayed relatively small like this is a okay size individual to get a little bit bigger than this but uh for the most part there is just very tiny little snakes you stay out of everybody's way but whenever it rains real heavy they're from Africa if I didn't mention that whenever it rains real heavy don't of course come out of their burrows because they're trending that's when people will run across them and have issues because it doesn't have any significant markings I mean to look at it it just um just a black snake and this thing is jet-black when he gets done shedding just as black as is humanly possible I mean it's so iridescent splash is beautiful beautiful animal I will post some pictures whenever and shoot another video whenever he's out of shed that'll probably the feeding video okay he's pretty cute honey very calm especially for as much as I've been working with them trying to get this video out but uh anyway I hoped you enjoyed seeing this guy I hope you learned a little bit about a snake there's very few people know anything about um so yeah they're still doing research on the toxin in their venom because needless to say extracting venom from the snake is very tough and very dangerous and not a lot of people want to do it and like I said this the bike can be medically significant but I'm not a large number people are dying actually I think only two on record ever so with that being said it's not something that they're looking to creating anti-venom for what are you doing hmm you can't see right here this one I like how sometimes when he gets mad he'll platanus head down straight down it'll puff up his neck do your reverse of Cobra Cobra comes up he goes straight down the top but before I stress this guy out I will go ahead and put them back number let's go back I'll reveal them thank you thank you so much for checking out this video make sure

they're absolutely amazing creatures you have a wonderful night", "AORyULfIRe0": "yo yo yo what's good youtube welcome to another live stream i'm going to raise you up just a bit sweet so gopro updated and um my new wi-fi router is in we're showing signal strength here for the stream decent it didn't show that before so now that's pretty good to see anyways let me go ahead and share the link out to instagram and we're going to go ahead and get started uh all right cool well glad we got that up and running let me go ahead and uh get this stream up on my computer oh you're right let's see i'm sure you guys want to see some of this stuff that i have here before we even get started right let me show you what we got going on first of all we weighed everything out earlier we uh pulled it out of the freeze dryer fresh this morning fat fat nineteen point four percent yield killed it one thousand one hundred and thirty grams of nug went in 220 grams of full spectrum hash came out as well as 19 grams of 25 and 160 micron so this is our test press that we use for edibles and then we'll go ahead and press out the rest of these full spectrum pucks i loaded them by hand into the bags and then after putting them in the bags i pressed them down in a rosin evolution pre-press to make sure that they stayed nice and tight and they are evenly distributed went up from uh the small little four ounce jars and uh upgraded to the six ounce jars i got tired of filling those little small ones to the brim and i said it's time to upgrade baby so we got the jar all weighed out we'll be able to weigh this when we're done tonight and see what our final yield was on this run now i'm a big fan of doing my presses a little bit warmer than what most people would i'm using my stool for you guys today so i'm gonna do this but um yeah you guys that watch me often know i will press anywhere from 200 to 225 depending on the cultivar depending on the hash um not all hash comes out the same um for example we talked about trichome density before right we talked about just because it looks like a lot of hash it may not be a lot of hash because um the oil inside may not be full you know what i'm saying the trichome may just be partially full in that case it's fluffy hash where it looks like a lot but it doesn't weigh a lot that's why this 25 micron and this 160 micron it looks like a large puck but it only weighs 19 grams compared to this puck which is smaller in comparison by about a centimeter right and it's not as fat but it weighs more probably about five to six grams more and that's because this is the full spectrum 45 through the 159 which contains higher density trichomes that are full of milk oil compared to the 25 and 160. so just a little throw that in there for you interior genetics what's going on asteroid farms if you guys aren't following asteroid farms on instagram go follow so old homie of mine platinum grove colorado who used to have a really pimp-ass girl room the nasa lab right um one of the inspirations for me initially stepping up my garden well now it's his turn to come back and he just got a brand new house with a nice ass basement and guess what it's time for a brand new build out so we're gonna help each other out take some ideas off of each other and i'm basically gonna have him record the whole thing and um show you guys how he does his build out you know and he'll give you guys pointers along the way and uh you know show you how to build a grow room so by the time you know he's done with that uh build out i'll be done uploading my video on how when i built out my grow room and uh his will be pretty much part two of a series that i'm going to be doing where it's going to be either build-outs brand new or remodels or upgrades and you guys will be able to pay for each episode um individually and absorb all the information that went into that whole build or remodel so it was actually his idea and we're gonna do his build out as episode two so it's gonna be awesome it's gonna have amazing information in there and it's gonna be great for you guys because instead of just seeing my room all the time and you're like oh that's great but not everybody has your room like yours or not everybody has a layout like yours you'll get to see different layouts different places different um climates right you're gonna get to see it all and you're gonna get to see the different thought process that goes into building these so it's gonna be really cool but anyways go check out his instagram because he's already started posting updates on it and it's not often that you get to jump on board and watch it build out brand new from the start most of the time you hop in and it's like uh the person's halfway done they've already done a bunch of [ __ ] you kind of like feel like the new guy you know what i'm saying in a crowd of old guys that been around for a long time now's your chance to get in on the bottom floor be one of those old guys he's been there forever by the time he gets done finishing you could be like i was there when you were still drawing the blueprints yo whippersnapper some of this blue icy and then i'm going to glove up the press is set to 175. we're going to do a low temp press on our test bag it's not going to be a clear indication of how the full spectrum is going to respond but it's going to give me a good enough idea to know whether or not 175 is going to provide the flow i'm looking for or if i'm going to need to go up to my 204 temperature 202 maybe i will put a link up right now i'm not sure that you guys can do it that's what's up jinder mah what's up dude i haven't seen you in forever holy moly so yeah check out asteroid farms what's going on viper what's up slug upstate what's going on we're just giving everybody a minute to trickle on in taking dabs we're enjoying life i haven't even taken a dab with you guys yet have i ah let's take a dab i'm gonna go in on some of this blue icy first oh let's get in there who wants to get in those guts with me we've got 31 left on this battery oh let's get in there the gopro doesn't focus well close up so you guys are gonna take what you get and be happy all right first time catching a live stream viper you caught a very good live stream for your first live stream this whole live stream i've already prepped all my parchment i prepped all my bags normally i'm not this prepped normally i still have full parchment and [ __ ] i wiped down the plates i'm ready to go baby it's waiting on you guys i mean what do you think we're about to press a half pound of hash a half pound cheers at 413 on the email okay ah that blue icy i swear on the exhale it tastes just like a blue icy it is so crazy every time it never fails what's up easy labs green ranger nashville how you doing freshly pressed what's up annie oh gee what's up hidden creek we got the whole [ __ ] family here i think i'm gonna do a live stream prank and start a live stream pressing hash with the hair straightener so we can get a million people asking oh no what happened did the press break fantastic so huh all righty all righty all righty let's swap out the battery you already know we got it we gotta swap out the battery we don't want it to die it'll be another short live stream i had to find it i couldn't forget i couldn't remember where the [ __ ] i put it down now i can't remember which batteries are charged now let's see lucky number nothing they'd be lying sometimes you got to pull them out and pop them back in they're not lying tonight [ __ ] [ __ ] well one of you's got to be higher than 25 [ __ ] percent let's find out i i don't feel comfortable knowing i've got 25 percent left on the battery i just took a fat ass dab and i'm about to start pressing i'm gonna get excited forget and this is gonna die by the way if the stream does go down unexpectedly please stay tuned because i will bring it right back up this is a non-stop party tonight that battery was at 100 you [ __ ] lying ass charger all right all right so for those of you that are new here i do a [ __ ] ton in a very small space so this is where i'm going to be collecting at when i'm all done here okay we're gonna move some [ __ ] out of the way shout out to roz and inc i want you guys to look at something real close here custom product for who that is who has bags like that who has bags like that do you want to know why he carries these two and a half by four and a half bags hey cuz of me baby who wants some bags i know some of you press and some of you need some bags all right anyways we've got parchment laid out we've got our bags ready to go okay and here you guys are going to go you're going to go right here look at that just for you how's that view yeah you could just chill set you down now is a good time if you got to use the restroom you got to go grab a drink you know what i'm saying whatever you got to do go handle that let me figure out this lighting i don't want it to be too bright for you guys oh [ __ ] that's too bright all right i feel good about this you guys are ordering from rosin inc make sure you guys use my coupon codes they're on my site solventlessbnb.com let's get ready get up there get up there just a little love from my homie right there you know all right remember you guys we're gonna be doing the 160 micron and the 25 micron mixed together as a test press before we move on to the full spectrum presses here we have the uh [ __ ] puck come on turn on screen doesn't recognize my gloves oh well anyways i hope that you guys were able to see that now this uh this is just some uh edibles mix of some uh the last strain that i pressed out which is the grape cosby little dark but it is [ __ ] chirpy and delicious and it will do amazing for edibles because the flavor that it will add is not too over the top but it's definitely like you notice it notice it so we're going to drip this into that edibles jar this is probably not going to flow crazy this is a test press a low temp test press at 175 all right i honestly feel like i should go up a little so so so so oh that looks like it's gonna be good well i think i found the temperature i'm gonna try for the first full spectrum maybe it'll flow a little bit more i'll take it for edibles siezer um don't worry that was just a plate on top of the press jumping around my cold plate up there good extraction well the flow was okay wasn't quite what i want it's kind of a weird flow so all right well not quite what i'm looking for believe it or not 185 that's gonna give me that awkward drip i'm gonna hold pull my audience to see what you guys think the temperature is that i'm gonna go with i already know what i'm going with i'm gonna go with uh my usual all right well we're gonna go ahead and do the first full uh spec press now all the same size that one was at 175. small bag we'll do this one first oh jesus 224 no too high 202 202 202 that's that's where i'm feeling 202 today i can feel it in my huevos rancheros pressing some cool spectrum once cash baby all right the room temperature is 74 degrees i do not believe in running a cold room during the pressing stage now bear with me you guys this is going to be a tad bit awkward as i have to deal with not only the um press this new jar which is larger and doesn't sit on the edge so i have to hold it like this in fact i don't even know what your viewpoint is now does that make sense right there where it's at for you guys i mean all right here we go we're at 191.1 191.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 six that's how slow my press heats up i love it i don't care what anybody says it doesn't overshoot temperatures during pressing because it sleeps it heats up slowly it doesn't like jump up all crazy because it has some overpowered 150 to 200 watt heaters it just has two 100 watt heaters nicely spaced out let's take a dab again next time tomorrow it sounds delicious this [ __ ] is like caramel taffy uh oh uh oh ah excuse me i felt like my nose was gonna run all over camera i didn't want that oh yeah what's up mommy my [ __ ] that'll do good that'll do oh that gets the job done i'll tell you what how you guys feeling about this prize we're at 199.7 199.7.8.9 200. 201 i'm not there and dad just [ __ ] knock me on my ass about let's get ready to remove look at that still plenty of paper towel left to clean bangers with throw that away save that puffing my man it's a good night when my boy puffin comes to visit you're pressing yourself right now huh hell yeah get it dog we are warmed up to 202 degrees let's go this is gonna be a second test press slightly lower than my normal but for some reason i'm feeling this temperature why i saw gonza say 204 and i'm like yeah yeah that's my normal i feel it but then all of a sudden my balls rumbled and spoke to me from deep within and they said no 202 now they're all right [ __ ] it the balls haven't lied yet oh what would you look at that there already me gusta come here come to daddy a little [ __ ] go what i say i knew it i felt it i felt it in my huevos rancheros oh yeah let's get messy somebody's got to make a meme out of the next big bag that squirts all over this jar so i'm feeling good about that that's a fish grab that and we're gonna move this over here i'll turn you right now 202 my [ __ ] i want to know did i get it all did i oh man that was a beautiful extraction 202 good job balls sometimes it's in your brains sometimes it's in your balls tonight it was in my balls oh check your insta i just saw you let me see let's let's see what am i checking your story i don't know maybe i jumped in at the wrong part of that conversation oh elevated uh nah there wasn't a lot on the parchment there was barely anything in here really maybe like two to three grams that was a small piece of uh that was small and that was 19 grams in there and uh [ __ ] dude not a lot left in there it's all over the [ __ ] sides of this jar is where it's at you guys want to see a big squirt huh all right let's get it gotta get off this cyber dream stuff though um all right let's get it big old fatty this one feels like a 27-30-ish somewhere in there all right let's go i don't want to listen to trap sorry i gotta get i gotta get the right music on first this is bothering me put on some good old tj hotto all right let's go i'm gonna fold this one down the center i just pinch it crease it down the center diagonal the other diagonals and that gives you kind of like a good flow right there already and then you just pinch the sides together and it's like let me check my battery here 85 percent go dude i'm all smoking one squeeze okay shout out to my man mysticalgo my official artist on sbnb records back down oh yep bomb extraction on that one let's go cross mountain ranges split cells of tomorrow it flowed so well there's like not even that much on the paper let us go yes uh let's keep this party [ __ ] going good over here peace i think i put some information in the description maybe i didn't add that i guess but 25 micron double bag from rosin inc for the uh for the bags my bad y'all i tried to put some information in there and i left out that one yo if you guys can't catch the live streams sign up for my patreon i upload them there so come to daddy um is i'm the master of my own fate i determine my own yield i grew the flowers this is the source of the single i am my own god excuse you uh is that's why i keep the ends of these parchment pieces wrap them over the parchment paper i wish i could slow this down listen listen did you [ __ ] catch it though my man [ __ ] threw it in putting him on game yo understand he let y'all know i'm putting y'all on game for free i'm gonna i'm gonna take it back one time is it too loud uh um let's go ladies and gentlemen it's time to flow i'm gonna bring you guys back some i feel like i'm not bad hold on you guys don't really need that flashlight i don't think anyways let me take it off and passed wrench squad hold it down here's a pro tip on really fat pucks make sure you leave a little extra space behind the puck so that you don't get a blowout but i can mute it that's fine didn't need that light but i'm not liking how that's lining up on the [ __ ] plates i'm gonna move it over just a tad real quick like uh is i go go go go go real big extraction what is it [ __ ] this one's really done i'm calling it now it's gonna be a dumper is nobody [ __ ] with you you know what as a kid i actually did like origami and [ __ ] you know what was better than origami paper [ __ ] planes god damn it paper planes with a [ __ ] i could fold all types of paper planes you guys when i was a kid not now you know why i can't do it now because i lost the book i didn't look that [ __ ] up read that [ __ ] in the book you know what i mean books are cool as [ __ ] you can learn how to make paper airplanes and [ __ ] who would have thought mm-hmm starting to get good at this [ __ ] so um okay well brown is foreign i until you quit this next one's gonna squirt like a [ __ ] so um okay i have that camera ready i'm gonna record this one on my phone i'm not sure how i'ma do it watch me money money all the time hey money please no worries it's only 200 degrees touch it with your [ __ ] hands that sense sorry i'm trying to align this a little bit differently here safety reasons there it is my press has a ram that can adjust positions so um it's a little bit different than most the ram isn't stationary which means that it can come out of alignment sometimes if i move it or whatever but it's all we're helping to make good taking care of your summer projects is a breeze bam summer savings on all your favorite brands make things even easier so freshen up the deck and fire up the grill summer's here and it's as close as your home yard get more done let's get it i've used this prosper [ __ ] ever you're biking like five years now i just let go of the [ __ ] bar my bad you guys the camera is on a very unsteady amount kinda i don't have the tripod leg spread out very well all right is to the place whoa the puck slit in the plates when i was adjusting it apparently almost popped out of the front no blow out though but i gotta pull it out real quick and readjust it i'm so glad that didn't blow out but somehow that slipped out that's a trip i'm so happy that i didn't blow out that's crazy what the [ __ ] i've never had that happened that's a trip that's a trip son experience saved for real he wouldn't would he he [ __ ] would let's go back on the plates you go you son of a [ __ ] that was a trippy trip trippy trip trip this thing is about i was like why is it not going like it should be leaking way more and then all of a sudden the handle slipped and i was like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] what happened put that back on the plate for a second up a let that so hmm who's your daddy who's your daddy what a safe uh is before oh yeah good extraction i'll take it oh yeah let's power through it two more to go parchment gets added to the jar everything i want everything together mixed together equal even steven the stuff that sticks to the parchment might be different terpenes might be different different [ __ ] you know you don't want to leave it out shop from the comfort of your home at sprint.com that's not a lot of work bro i know i'm saying it's already time to upgrade the jar again i just got this damn jar i'm upset it's not fun i thought for sure it was going to be good enough we knew get a bigger drawer uh bertha it's time to go squirtle what the [ __ ] it did it again something's going on here is it sliding something's happening here there's no blowout but it's sliding off pressure's not being applied evenly to the plates somehow or they're too tight or i pre-packed them at an angle never had this happen okay i know what i'm about to do fix this i'm going to have to increase the pressure even slower every problem there is a solution hmm leaned on him to apply pressure for the pre-press by doing it evenly i had to have been time to upgrade and put my bigger plates on i guess for these bigger presses right inside there i hope you guys are watching this if you guys aren't [ __ ] paying attention i don't know what you're doing right now when i mess up that's when you guys need to pay attention because i don't mess up very often not to sound cocky whatsoever but i don't so if i make a mistake that's resulting in some type of mess up it would benefit everybody around me to pay attention and realize what i'm doing wrong so i got my light that's fine before i make sure i got the jar underneath there i didn't think it was going to squirt like that still this parchment is heavy from the [ __ ] first part of the press but it's still flowing good that's all that matters and no blowout fan dumb strong on the top setting don't you get a damn hum my curl is my rocker maybe i choose you and i don't even have i don't even have um i have a couple theories for what it is lots of adjusts right now it's increasing pressure too fast and also i have the press at a a pretty good angle right now leaning towards the front and i think that the hash is melting and making the puck inside uneven and then it blows out the front like that so i think i'm just going to go ahead oops just hit the table i'm going to go ahead and flatten out the press a little bit more risky with this puck anymore how would i do on the save [ __ ] crazy giving her incredible so okay my battery at 34 okay um check the alignment of the plates one more me come on gloves don't stupid i know it's not that cold in here but then mm-hmm little 74 degrees in here oh missiles contemplating life changes foreign foreign let me grab some parchment hold on i got an idea not so much as an idea that i just want to do something for this press just insurance actually all okay searching for savings on descriptions is so complex it's like getting a documentary unfortunately you just savings period not all patients eligible savings so um me yes i haven't even hit one ton of pressure you guys think i'm kidding look so just hit two and a half oh figured it out right pressure was increasing too fast and the angle probably didn't know so so well aren't you guys glad i got the internet connections really good attraction well wow please so um batteries are charged let's get a battery swap in before we do anything else we'll go from there sound good oh think so okay all right so good job bertha good job baby we're gonna take a dab and then after this dab i'm going to um go ahead and collect what's on the parchment and get it added to the jar while it's still warm man that's heavy that's heavy i mean yield wise i'm thinking it's got to be it's got to be upwards of 80 it has to be you know there's it is no [ __ ] way it's not it's a little harsh didn't it that's okay i'll turn it down i knew there was a little [ __ ] nap thingy in here a little [ __ ] flew right on me else we know there's never a good time to run out of fresh luckily our delivery and free pickup excuse me so whether it's a few extra guns from the back all right i mean you can't help it i got lights on in here when i come in through the garage little [ __ ] just came in with me i guess oh boy oh what

reserve dot com all righty i got the drugs already got a little bit of runs on here i'm gonna grab some more though on the outside of one of these parchments but i smeared i know there's like a bunch on the outside i could take so i don't have to dip into the jar or anything i'm i'm weird right now you're like call that fresh press man i wish i'll give you a melt so like wood that's runs wow wow

grenade trumping this was found by beast themselves so shouts of beasts if you're watching this and thank you for sharing the tech with me so we're gonna dive into it you know go over its uses benefits etc etc and actually how to do it of course and one more thing I do want to thank you guys would being patient with me Thanksgiving came around so obviously I was busy with family and I'm sick currently and been trying to get over that but anyways let's dive right into it and let's go over everything so if you guys don't know what grenade trumping is I'll explain it to you by showing the clip real quick from beast himself so here's the clip so even though the tech may look a little bit difficult it's actually easier than it seems to be honest and we'll split it up into two parts of how to actually do this now the first part you need to know how to actually auto grab ledge and if you don't know how to do that basically what you're doing is in this case let's say we're facing left so you're gonna shoot left on your analog stick to run off the stage like so and as soon as you run off the stage you're gonna do a half circle backwards shouts aah cry and that's basically how you do it now the half circle you have to do it pretty quick or you're not gonna grab the ledge once you get it done that's what's gonna happen here and that's step one of how to actually do this part so step two of this part is actually going to be grenade placement so you want to make sure that you're right on the ledge so that way when you she'll drop the grenade it's gonna fall through the stage so what you're gonna do is you're gonna she'll drop the grenade then you want to do the instant ledge grab and before you grab the ledge you want to press the Z button and if you do it fast enough that's what its gonna look like if you did it too fast you're gonna do that pivot grab which I just did on the first try but that's how you instantly grab the ledge with the grenade in hand so in case you didn't catch it on regular speed I'm gonna do it on one for speed just to kind of break it down real quick so you're gonna grenade shield left half circle bagsy and then grab it so again you're gonna she'll drop grenade left half circle back and then press the Z button before you grab the ledge and that's pretty much it so now that we've gone over how to do the tech let's actually explain its benefits so if you guys play the game you guys would know that when you lose a stock when you come back you have invincibility so that's called pretty much stock invincibility now if you've watched any other pro snake players on youtube or whatever normally they'll do this so the two grenades cover them and then they can air dodge towards the ledge and then no legend its ability as well so that way they can prolong the invincibility when your opponent comes back that's basically it so when they do that when your air dodging towards the ledge you're open to being too framed and what to framed is is before your character grabs the ledge they have two frames of vulnerability so they can get hit by certain moves before they grab the ledge so basically what that means if your opponent comes down they have invincibility and they don't respect the grenades here they can still hit you before you grab the ledge from air dodging now this tech basically helps make that number small probability smaller of actually getting hit before you grab the ledge so if you can do it then you know you don't have to risk getting hit so that's pretty much what this tech is all about and why it's gonna be good so I've compiled some clips for my Twitter post if you didn't see that I'll show you guys right now on these clips that you can use for some general movement as well so here you go now you could use this as an edge guarding tactic if you would like as well and I'll do the favor of showing the clip of beasts himself showing one way if you could actually use this as a edge guard so I hope you guys play around with this and of course you know fine ideas is obviously a lot of things you can do with this so you know feel free to comment down below if you find any other uses or anything else that might be cool to actually use this tech for another thing to go over as well is that if this is too hard there is another option of doing this and this would be what Z nating this is a Z name so you can instantly grab the grenade so you can just do this and then go towards the ledge so you could like do this and then air dodged towards ledge or you could just do it and then drop to ledge so you know that might be an easier route of doing it if that might be better for you but as long as you do it fast enough it's the same timing the grenades gonna end up being the same timing as doing it the way I was showing you guys before if you guys don't know how does enade the way to do it is you want to hold grenade shield jump and then press the Z button so instantly you'll have a grenade in hand when you jump you can also do it with the Z and jump button if you buffer it so if you don't want to like have to press the shield button you can actually do it with just the Z and jump button which I have jump map to L so I can just do ZL and he'll grab it so yeah that's pretty much how you would how you could do that but I hope you guys enjoyed the video again my name is Swiss and again thank you all for being patient with me and for watching my videos and subscribing to the channel I have other social media platforms down below you can check those out now that you have a great rest of your day bye now you then I stopped get you fresh out of high topics at night thinks we ever gonna stop the chief right hold on each and I hate you we need more

"YSqErHoFa1Q": "happy Sunday thought I'd share what I'm doing here today I'm making some fresh frozen bubble hash there's two containers of fresh frozen grade-a bud bunch of the tops from mostly one with some of a second blue dream this is a bubble bag dude bubble hash machine I think originally it was for clothes probably got a 15 minute timer on it very basic there's the timer for the soap is done so the material that's in there isn't a work bag with two bags of ice layered like a cake with demineralized water it just soaked for 15 minutes and now I'm gonna do my first wash first wash I'm gonna do is five minutes you don't want to do the first wash for very long because that's where your primo stuff is first and second wash mostly so I got to put my bubble bags in the bucket here so I can drain what comes out of that washing machine into or through the bubble bags so I'm gonna start this anyways and then I have to properly layer the bubble bags you want to start with the best smallest micron which in my case is 25 and put that in the bucket first then 73 then I think it's 120 or 160 and etc [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause]", "apauT0_ovWA": "yo what's up YouTube alright guys today we're gonna present some rosin I already started this is a second run a bubble how should I made it was a little darker so it came out a little bit darker it smells [ __ ] fire though I'm using the Dooley Tech [ __ ] bags I just left over from when I purchased them to be honest Dooley Tech [ __ ] sucks they're at least their bags do I don't know how the rest of the products do but they're [ __ ] bags they suck [ __ ] ass I had a blowout on that one there and I was the 3 grams or 2 grams two and a half grams of bubble hash I was running at a high temp so I dropped the temperature down this is what I'm gonna run at seven grams of some full melt bubble hash this [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire guys it's sticky sticky one it's really really really sticky really fire you could just see how sticky that [ __ ] is it smells [ __ ] amazing this is all of my strings together so it's pretty much a hybrids indica it's actually Kryptonite gelato and gorilla glue you can just look at the quality of this [ __ ] hash it's [ __ ] fire but yeah we're gonna go ahead and pack this up in the bad guys and give me one second so I can get this set up so you guys can get a little bit of a better look get some parchment paper cut out [Music] so what are you guys up to today you guys having any time for Tuesday I don't go into work until tonight so I'm pretty much free all day long until the evening falling so by MIDI mid mid day and then I go to work but until then I meet this hash yesterday oh it came out pretty good I ended up getting about oh I want to say I want to say I got about 10 grams I guess of bubble hash and that was - how many how many ran it watched it twice I didn't do it any more than that the second wash I did I was doing a little bit aggressive and came out a little darker it was an amber like this first one here it was still sticky it just came out a little bit darker actually came out a lot doctor that's the bow hash like that's the rosin I just showed you guys in the and the other one I went ahead and flipped the bag inside out there's and that's the actual hash but yeah I went ahead and flipped the bag inside out and I'm gonna go ahead and load it up in the bag now what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna slide it in there as best as I can without hopefully it doesn't stick too much to the bag all right it went right in so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna fold it over on itself guys got a nice little puck in there I'm not gonna cut this bag I cut the last one little Desai's just uh hope you nothing bad would happen but I don't know I might even double bag this guy's cuz I had a blowout on the last one I don't want to have a blowout on this one but maybe I just want press as hard maybe I'll just go a little softer you know I think that's probably what he's gonna do so let's go ahead and head over to the press guys this is my press face it's a 12-ton press and I'm running got pressed as far as the heat plates I did drop the temp a little bit but I think I'm gonna drop that even more guys and I'm gonna do a real real slow press on this so I'm gonna go ahead and set these temps a little lower I'll go to 175 I was running at 200 earlier and I dropped it down to 180 but it wasn't all the way down to 180 when I pressed it was like at 190 I want to say so I'm gonna run that in a lower temp 175 I'm gonna bet that go ahead and drop for a minute until then I'm just gonna go ahead and get set up here I'm running 3x3 dad pressed plates these [ __ ] plates are [ __ ] pretty good guys I haven't had any issues with this press or this plate these plates for since I bought it actually is still pretty new I've only used though I've used the hell out of it I've pressed a lot of [ __ ] flowers as you can see I pressed there's some rosin chips right here this when people refer to rosin chips this is what they're talking about guys this is the leftovers of your actual presses and they're still resin in those guys you can save those and you can use them for butter I'll go ahead and show you exactly what I'm talking about guys let's up here see that stuff right there that's coconut oil it's a little mouthy because I have it on the top cabinet and I have the heat on now but usually it's pretty solid it's just like a butter it's coconut oil pretty much you just boil it in coconut oil and sift it all out and there's your edibles and you can make whatever you want I actually made some cookies the other day and some brownies and they came out [ __ ] amazing guys matter of fact I still got some right here I used about half - half ratio we took my cookie between the butter and the coconut oil but I like my [ __ ] strong guys and I put actually about a half a pound over those rods and chips I want to say not a half pound maybe about 7 ounces 6 ounces of these rosin chips into about 3 cups of that coconut oil and that [ __ ] came hush 204 guys literally came out strong with some good [ __ ] but yeah the temps are starting to drop two hours you could see the right side drop in faster than the left side is that's just the top and bottom plates but it'll match up real soon here guys but yeah at least this [ __ ] rosin press is [ __ ] kicking ass guys I really like pressing but I used to do a lot of BA chose but be honest that's just it costed me a lot of money than butane and my time and it was dangerous [ __ ] this is way more easier it's safer and not to mention your terpenes man this [ __ ] [ __ ] you preserve all your terpenes on all your flavor of all you of all your Rosen's you put your Preston guys she just comes out [ __ ] fire but yeah man I ever since I've gotten my press and and started running it I actually love it it's it doesn't get any better than this I should say because like I said it's just the terpene profile itself if you're doing a really low dab really low press as far as the heat you [ __ ] flavor profile of the buds it's [ __ ] amazing especially if they're fresh buds and there they were within three or four weeks of being picked or harvested man you're gonna have amazing amazing [ __ ] rosin I've actually had a almost clear rosin come out I bet you that's what this is gonna end up doing it's gonna come out really really amber really clear it's not gonna be dark at all especially if you're running on a low temp you're gonna get some [ __ ] amazing I used to press this windows breath and I'm not even lying dude it was stink my whole house up it's not like like fruity pebbles it was amazing I I was amazed the first time I pressed that stuff I was like [ __ ] and just the way it smelled my pressed is the way it tasted and it was amazing it was good stuff just the act rosin is the way to go especially if you're doing it yourself and you got that you can do it with your own product it's just so much fresher taste so much better you'll never want to go back to being chose again be a chose or thing of the past as far as I I think I'm gonna have a pretty good little run off with this at this amount of hash but I'm not sure we'll see it's only about it's actually not even a full quarter it's about six six point four six point five and then there's my six and a half grams but it's still a pretty good amount of rosin so I mean of hash so we're gonna go ahead and press it out and see what we get I'm not really worried about my turn I'm more worried about the bag blowing out his [ __ ] bags and I'm not easily tech bags they suck man I haven't had one good experience and and I've tried different microphones actually when I purchased these I bought them for zoo they were cheaper and I figured well [ __ ] maybe it's just uh it's I mean it's got to be the same micron regardless so I figured I don't know there's ditch quality or whatever but these bags I've had blowout so I'm pretty much every single bag that I ran even in flowers flowers a little bit easier to contain and then the oils as far as hatched when you're when you're pressing so I'm gonna take it real slow on this one I'm not gonna force it I'm just gonna let it melt its way down through the people bed I'm gonna take it slow and easy on this one I'm not gonna force it I got it right on the edge because uh it's not gonna be pushing anything out it's not gonna be expanding too much so we're just gonna go ahead and paint it down so about right there I'm not pushing it too much we're just gonna let it start melting and you can see immediately it starts it starts shooting out rosin so I'm just gonna let it go ahead and mount melt it through the bag and let it do it low and slow those times I might even drop the temp a little bit more to 165 which I think I'm gonna do right now so that way by the end of my press it should be cooler than it was when it started over water 167 that should be good yeah they do that gold and honey okay I'm just painting it down as on just taking it very easy I don't want to blow through this bag and [ __ ] this batch of hat or bras it up even if I have to press it halfway through and then take it out and redo it again I will I don't wanna blow through this bag and you can just look at that color guys and you know what I'm gonna give me one second alright guys sorry about that [ __ ] bag blew through if I have to go clean it up repack it [ __ ] put another bed over it Pam [ __ ] ass I wasn't even putting that much pressure on it these [ __ ] bags guys if you ever buying Dooley Tech to be honest they're [ __ ] shits garbage stay away from it from what I can tell they're a [ __ ] rosin presses are half decent I wouldn't say they're the best but they'll get the job done like I say get what you pay for pretty much so I'm gonna go ahead and pause this video guys I'm gonna keep a good eye on this that way I don't [ __ ] it up and I'll start the video up as soon as the rosin starts coming out alright guys we're getting some rosin off the side I'm trying not to push it too hard I don't wanna blow through the bag and [ __ ] up my [ __ ] so I'm just taking it really really slow that's why sorry I bought the video being so long guys looks like it's starting to come out on this side as well I would when it came off on the last batch I cleaned out around where blew out on this corner you could tell the change in the color looked like the raw slick the rosin like the hash I'm sorry so I went ahead and just cleaned up what was cleaning on the other I tell it from the other parchment paper in the kitchen guys but yeah I got it on a really low temp it's I 165 166 it's jumping up and down between the 67 or 66 we'll see how the the end product looks I'm just applying light pressure I don't know why these Dooley tech bags do that [ __ ] man they're [ __ ] garbage every [ __ ] one I've used even for flowers it's just garbage I guess if you're on a budget but even if you're in a budget it's not worth it because you're gonna [ __ ] get you're gonna get plant matter in your in your rosin or you're gonna get hashing your rods depending on how you're pressing just almost better just to press the but by itself and use their [ __ ] so I got my hand on the handle as I'm just pulling it down slightly as I as I see the rosin coming out and it's coming out of all sides days looking pretty good so it's Laos [ __ ] amazing just to know what I can smell it looks nice color nice and amber and I know this videos longer I started about the length of it I should have maybe I'll edit it and I really don't have a lot of pressure on it now guys I'm barely putting pressure on it I don't have a gauge on this to tell me how many tons I'm putting on it but from [ __ ] that I pressed in the past I'm not putting very much weight on it at all just with the way to my hand on here I can pull the lever down that's how much that's I mean that just goes to show you how hard I'm pushing on it I'm not really pulling on here at all wait until it all melts goes through the screen and then I'm gonna try to press out at the end maybe I'll hold off and just let it let the pressure push out what's there and then I'll clean it off and then I'll press it again afterwards but I'm gonna go ahead and cut this video guys it's really heading on 20 minutes 17 minutes I don't want to make it too long he does have a good day be careful darkness", "o6uFZyj9pUU":

matter how big today's video may be shocking to you especially when you realize that this actually happened in reality and not fake news at all snakes are invincible creatures indeed and our videos protagonist is a snake which ate something really big that left people speechless and numbed their thoughts keep watching the video to know what was that huge creature eaten by the snake be sure to subscribe to did you know and hit the bell so you never miss an upload from us also leave a like right now we all know that snakes are not to be messed with but this time in our video a snake got defeated by perhaps a weaker creature but it had some really great strong weapons in case of some other creature took its different shape and size for granted are you afraid of snakes think carefully before continuing to watch this video because it is about to unravel a big surprise On June 14th 2015 a cyclist was on a mountain bike trail at the lake Eiland Game Reserve which lies in kwazulu-natal South Africa the cyclist came across a living snake that looked abnormal according to the normal size of snakes to be honest anyone who sees a snake should run for their lives and escape and that is what this bicyclist did yet he informed the officials about the whole situation for them to investigate and examine the snake the park rangers believed that the snake had eaten something large perhaps a warthog or a baby Impala however after a week of observation the snake died on June 20th the officials wanted to know what happened to the snake so they decided to cut it open to figure out what was inside guess what a 30 pound porcupine a snake swallowed a porcupine what kind of a horror story is that is it something horrible to imagine or even think about do you feel sorry for the porcupine think about it carefully especially after you know the consequences of eating the creature and what it did to the snake a Python does not normally go swallowing porcupines and that is the main reason behind people's confusion because it is really dangerous for snakes to eat such creatures this is because a porcupines quills are so sharp and could absolutely tear the snake's body entirely moreover it is said that snakes that live in the lake Eiland Game Reserve have been witnessed eating things way larger than a 30 pound porcupine what is more the owner of the lake Eiland Game Reserve Eric Dunston was said to have noticed a pylon that had attacked and eaten an adult or abhi antelope a large hole one and normally our abhi bucks can weigh up to 50 pounds that is white 30 pounds is not the main cause behind killing the snake even though it seems like a lot of food for the snake what killed the snake is quite controversial and has been raising many question marks the snake was found at the bottom of a rocky ledge which may reveal that it had fallen so the officials came to the conclusion that the snake ate a porcupine then ended up falling off the ledge which made the porcupines quills cut through the pylons body and this led to the snakes immediate death the Rangers went on stripping off the pylon skin to take out the porcupine from the snake's digestive system to their surprise the snake was twelve point eight feet long genuinely the snake could open its mouth very wide and swallow the porcupine due to the fact that the snake's jaws moved independently from one another what a tragic fate for both creatures that they certainly weren't oblivious to it's such a terrible idea for a snake to have a porcupine for lunch on that day it must have been a very tough battle for both of them that neither were the fittest to survive and they both failed by ending up getting killed the person who took the photos must be a really daring person who is not afraid of snakes and porcupines normally people would freak out from the whole scene it is not something you would enjoy watching indeed but the photographer seemed to have been very concerned and interested in the whole matter thanks to him we would not have been able to imagine how a porcupine could fit into a snake's digestive system or would have even thought the news to be fake and authentic that incident no matter how scary it may seem or may keep people from visiting South Africa it still could also be a major tourist attraction site a lot of people would love to go to explore the area and look for the snakes that live there to trace their movements not only that but snake specialists as well could find that incident a very attractive area for research to do further experimentations on snakes and the wildlife after watching that video tell us in the comment section below what you think about the whole thing have you ever heard of a similar story had you been in the cyclists shoes what would you have done when all is said and done one could confirm that karma played a really huge role in that story after all what goes around comes around that is the circle of life anyway even when it comes to animals so who do you feel sorry for now you", "WjL2XPSm8tg": "[Music] singing [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so [Music] [Music] oh you", "30ufFiDcALU": "[Music] one thing you know I talked about besides you catching up with a few other growers this morning the law were talking about winterization and fresh frozen so how much I mean you don't have to tell us exactly how many pounds you're pushing yeah but even just a percentage if that's something you're getting into and and how much of it are you allocating to essentially for lack of better term diversify your portfolio totally so I mean we have 50,000 square feet of outdoor I would say this is the kind of the first year that I'm actually allocating a good amount of a to fresh frozen just kind of seeing where the markets evolved on the scale of production where we're at limitations on where we can dry it so getting into that fresh frozen which means we just take the plant fresh bucket down clean it up a little bit and freeze it right away straight to the fre straight to the freezer and that's where the extract artists these days are that's where they get the most high-end product that's Tyson to live rosin rosin indoor live resins you have the live rosin which is the organic kind of bubble hash extraction and then pressing it and I'll get you the live rosin and then the other side of it is the live resin which guys are pushing the fresh frozen material through BHO gotcha and then and then just creates a different product yeah well together right totally different cuz I actually this year just as an experiment gave the same crop same thing you know same everything same greenhouse to a BHO live resin just manufacture and a live rosin and the product is so different if I didn't know they were grown even the same strain really it's just such a difference in the way it comes out and we might even see that amongst extractors as well because the different techniques so that's kind of fun and cool it's just to see the differences of like your raw material because when you drive the flower it's gonna be the dried flower the extract brings this whole other element to come to our party so I think a Frenchie cannoli I know he's really come up on the scene lately and there's there's individuals like him around the world but it really is an art that's one thing you know as crazy as Frenchie can be I love that he really puts that emphasis that it is in art when he's doing bubble hash yeah you know and it is a totally different experience for them and that's the only thing it takes different infrastructure so you gotta have freezer rooms ways to transport that and then what if a freezer goes down and you know 200 pounds of material in there you gotta have a backup in place like so there's a lot of things it's a lot of lot to think about a lot of moving parts I probably prefer I wish I could just dry at all traditionally and and do that but it's fun to evolve with the market and see new products come out and be a part of all that so just got to adapt and do a little bit everything so overall I'd say probably you know we focused on trying to keep the tops of the plants for a flower the best stuff of the best and then focus on the lower and it also helps with the harvest time because we can get all those tops that are more susceptible to mold or botrytis get them hanging and dry in gives us some more time to deal with like the lower but still good quality yeah you know as a grower I always smoke the smalls I don't the biggest artichokes aren't always the most flavorful it's funny how that transcends so many things or even like yeah lobsters shrimp and there are so many things it's your point quality over quantity right so it allows us to to time out she says big hands you know you're the one I'm like is that from a song yeah so it allows us to time out the harvest a little bit yeah and so I'd say we're doing about 25% fresh frozen this year pretty fair amount for a 50,000 square foot canopy yeah that's that's why I got 420 square feet of freezer space this week there are there are supposedly some companies coming up that are that are manufacturing companies that rely on that fresh frozen material I haven't personally run into a company that's sending troops up to do that work for us I am working with one of the the biggest brands and in the space right now in the industry and they're about to launch if they haven't launched it yet a live rosin brand and I can guess who that is I think they're based out of justjust not too far from here actually based in here in Humboldt yeah and so we're gonna be one of their their main three producers for their fresh frozen line nice I mean I think it's probably open now is they have an Instagram up so I think that's all good but pop in Barkley's is introducing a live one brand brand so it's gonna be Papas Papas select [Music]", "KyicBky9fPg": "what's up YouTube welcome back Steven

sizes and so I actually went to Dollar Tree today and I have found I think I might have found the solution so I was walking around and I found these pit bulls they're club pit bulls here on the label right there says pet bull and they were where the like dog and cat supplies are at and I was like oh this looks like a really good size actually where they wouldn't be able to tip it over so I bought three of them just to give it a try on some of the snakes that alright notorious for tipping over there water bulls anything that I put over in there they'll tip that over easily so I bought three of them and I'm about to go put these three inside of some of the tubs here and I'm going to be updating you guys if you guys are having similar problems then I think this might be the solution right here so I'm gonna go in to rinse these out sanitize them and then I'm gonna fill it up with some clean water and then put them up in to put them inside the tub and then I'm gonna show you guys how that we are here stink area first of all what I'm gonna do is remove this label here who knows alright now I'm gonna let it sit for a good 5 10 minutes and then we'll be right back I'm gonna have to do it for all these writers and here it is so we are going to flip the bowl right into the tub you can see and one thing I really like about the bowl is the fact that you know it feels really sturdy like this is a very very strong plastic and it just feels like you know this can last a lifetime so that's one thing that I really love about it is my girl ms my albino girl that's pregnant she's a hopefully she's to delay in a coming week so all right guys all right guys so be sure you guys subscribe so you guys can stay updated on this kind of experiment that I have going on with the water with the water bowls I'll let you guys know if they end up tipping them over still or you know they're they're solid like I said I'm putting the water bowls in with the females that tip over there water bowls all the time I have like five of them so I'll keep you guys updated be sure you guys subscribe let me know what you guys think all right guys take care peace", "CMR-JgxmIXU": "unexpectedly coming face to face with a snake can be a scary experience but how can you tell if it's venomous here's number one look at its head one of the most obvious signs of a poisonous snake is its triangular head although not all venomous snakes have it their necks are usually distinctly skinnier than their heads non-venomous snakes on the other hand tend to have round heads that are more continuous with the rest of their body number two pay attention to its pupils like you're going to get that close hang with me here most venomous snakes have elliptical and vertical pupils while non-venomous snakes have round ones however there are still some exceptions to this rule you should know about non-venomous snakes can easily change the shape of their pupils in dangerous situations to look more powerful and frightening to their opponent plus there are some extremely venomous snakes with round pupils like the famous black mamba or cobra so don't rely on this factor alone when trying to identify the type of snake you're dealing with no kidding number three note its color and behavior poisonous snakes are often more vibrant both in their coloring and behavior if you see a beautiful bright colored snake chances are that it is in fact venomous there are some exceptions here as well like scarlet king snakes and milk snakes they're very colorful reptiles but they're not poisonous at all as for their behavior venomous snakes are known to hiss rattle and be quite aggressive right off the bat", "oVtDqis_vp0": "[Music] [Music] i'm not a patient i cannot sit around waiting all of the [ __ ] that

"hello and welcome to today's webinar solvent list extraction explained profiting from rosin my name is Eric sandy and the digital editor of cannabis business times in this exclusive webinar pure pressures director of marketing Eric glass key will give you the tools strategies and key information on how to capitalize on the quickly growing solvent extraction segments of the cannabis market focus on actionable insights this webinar will cover solvent list concentrates across every aspect Eric will explain exactly what saltless concentrates are which eske use are the most popular how to cultivate or source material that yields well for Robins and how to attract customers to your brand just a few quick housekeeping notes before we begin you'll notice on your screening questions box please do feel free to type in your questions as the presentation is going on and I will relay them to Eric at the end and also know that if you have to leave any time we will be recording this presentation both the audio and video and emailing the full archive link to all registrants in a few days here so you will have access to to the whole presentation with that I'm very pleased to welcome today's presenter Eric Blackie thank you Eric appreciate the time in the intro and I also appreciate everyone who's tuned in right now this presentation was designed with you guys in mind and it's going to be really focused on educating everyone about what solvent list is and how you can incorporate it into your business profitably so to get started just going to do a quick intro here and go over what our agenda is so everyone gets an idea of what the cadence just like Eric just said my name also Eric I'm the director of marketing and now business development with peer pressure I joined in 2016 and I'm also the marketing and brand strategist for peer Cannell abs which is our sister consulting agency I've been working in the cannabis industry for just about there is now big passion for what's going on it's awesome to see the growth in the industry so today's agenda first I'm going to be talking about what is solvent list we're going to be going through kind of the layman's overview of solving Wisconsin traits and all concentrates just as they fit into the market in general so the point of this is we're going to be talking both to total beginners intermediate as well as people who have quite a bit of experience here so I believe that anyone who's tuning in no matter how much knowledge you have about concentrates or cannabis in general you'll be able to take some great insights away from this presentation then we're going to start talking about solvent with skews and some of the products that can be made solvent lessly as well as market data that supports where the market fit is what kinds of products these are as well as giving you guys some ideas about who are purchasing these products although some of that information is a little bit more anecdotal then we're going to be talking about material identification this is one of the biggest topics in solvent lists you know how do I get the right starting material to yield well to work well to make those super high-end concentrates then I'm going to wrap it all up with you know really the top key tips and ways to frame your thinking about how to be successful with solvent lists you know high-level points that you can take and implement immediately and then we're going to leave about 15 or 20 minutes at the end for Q&A so that I can make sure that I can get through as many of your guys questions as possible so with that being said the focus of this webinar is going to be on the THC side of cannabis in solvent lists I will be touching on CBD as well but just so everyone knows going into it CBD is going to be a little bit more of a footnote for this presentation so let's get started so what is solvent list there's a lot of terms out there but a solvent was cannabis concentrate is one that is made without any solvents so it's butane co2 or ethanol this extraction method is also known as mechanical separation now there's no governing body dictating which words people are using in the cannabis industry now it's still a bit of a Wild West situation and we're hoping that in the near future there will be a little bit more clarity around this but some people say that water for example is a solvent I would argue that it's not water in the solvent was processed for bubble hash or ice water hash which we'll get to soon you're separating the trichomes from the plant material and trying to keep them intact whereas if you're performing light hydro carbon co2 or other solvent based methods it's actually a process of dissolution so that's an important distinction here that solvent lists for the most part is getting a mechanical separation and then rosin which we're going to get into in a lot of detail here shortly is expressing and filtering those isolated trichome heads so solvent list fits in to the market as the craft beer of the concentrate world it is the high-end artisan level concentrate that the huge brand builder for any business that's processing or manufacturing cannabis products you want to think about this as the same kind of consumer that's interested in organic fruits and foods that's also going to be the type of person that's interested in solvent list because well to give it full credit with butane co2 and other methods you can purge the vast majority of those residual solvents you really can almost get to actual zero percent solvent or having a product that has never touched them in the first place the only way you can do that is with solvent list now another question that we get a lot is what does solvent 3 mean versus solvent list solvent free means that it doesn't contain any solvents when it reaches the customer but that it did contain solvents or solvents were used in the production of it so there's a whole subset of customers that will only buy solvents products and if you are not making a solvent list product of one variety whether it's a dab mobile concentrate an edible or a topical you're not even in their consideration set so that's why it's important to recognize that having us almost concentrate is an important part of any processing or manufacturing business plan so to move on to the next section some people who have been in the industry a long time are going to know all this already but for everyone who's tuning in who's a little bit new to the concentrate world or is really just getting their feet under them about what kinds of concentrates are out there I figured that it would be helpful to throw in this a fairly busy chart about where current concentrates in the cannabis industry fall so on the left side of the chart here you can see what we've got are the solvent list and of concentrates dry sift sometimes also known as Keith bubble hash also known as ice water hash and Robin and those three products of course are going to be what the vast majority of our focus is spent on today but it's also important to know what the solvent based concentrates are and to clear up something about distillate so that distillate can actually be made with solvents or without you can do terpene separations with steam that wouldn't constitute as using solvent and then you can also see at the bottom here all of the different textures and types of oils that these various extraction methods can make now this is the current state of these extraction methods but whatever one should keep in mind is that things are evolving very rapidly across the space innovation is happening as quickly as anyone can keep up with core solvent lists and solvent based so one thing that's not in this graph that people might be wondering is what about flour rosin that's a product I've heard about I've tried I've seen it that is not a separate process necessarily we just lump that into the general category of rosin so one thing that might stand out to people that aren't as familiar with the rosin process or maybe even familiar with the hydrocarbon process is that there is a significant amount of textures and different products which we'll get into a lot of detail on with making rosin you know a lot of people coming into this think well you know I I would like to make a dabble concentrate product it has a high price per gram I've heard you know there's a lot of brands out there that really made a name for themselves with this but what can I really do with rosin and the answer is with minimal post-processing you can come out with an enormous variety of different oil textures and resulting products so live rosin coming from fresh frozen material straight separated terpenes which can be used for all kinds of things a very popular product category right now diamonds also known as diamonds and sauce sauce meaning separated terpenes kind of the street word or the colloquial sense of that you can even make shatter wax butter sugar oil there's all kinds of different textures that can be made now there is some variability in your starting material so that's why we've got dry sift and bubble hash there on the left and that you typically have the most versatility with all of the different kinds of robins that you can make when you are starting with bubble hash and bubble hash really consist of just pure isolated trichome heads and the same goes for dry Civ again really going back just briefly to what mechanical separation means we're trying to isolate trichome heads get rid of the plant debris and plant material that we're capturing the pure essence of the plant the resin which is contained in those trichomes and then that gives you a lot of a lot more flexibility to create all kinds of other products now you'll see one product on here that hydrocarbon can make that rosin can't is crumble which is a popular texture but for the most part rosin is capable of creating just about every texture of oil Under the Sun both in high end a beable concentrate form as well as food grade form four topicals edibles and all kinds of things and then well co2 and ethanol are both extremely popular concentrate and processing methods the actual end resulting products are a little bit more limited now those can be used in all kinds of things as well but the whole point here is to just give everyone a sense of how much variety and how many different textures can be made and that textures are not confined to one processing method or another in virtually all cases so moving along this is going to be for a full disclaimer the only time in this entire presentation that you're going to see anything about the products that we sell or what we do peer pressure is an equipment manufacturer in the solvent with space and this is an overview of the general equipment that's needed to make these kinds of products so not doing sales we're not doing plugs but just wanted to give everyone that disclaimer while I explain the slide this is about the only time you're going to encounter this so for dry sift how it's made is with a sifting machine I've got an example here the green bros alchemist 420 that's got stainless steel screens that trim or flower is put in it's graded against those screens which shears the trichome heads off which are then collected and can be used for a variety of different purposes just like we were talking about all kinds of different boy close in like we'll get into different SKUs and product themselves now there's a little note there plus static cleanup typically if you're trying to make a very high-end dry sip product the keys coming out of your grinder isn't going to fit the bill you're going to need to do some additional static cleanup to be able to get as much of the debris out as possible so that you can have better isolated trichome heads now bubble hash this is the extraction method that we'll spend a little bit more talking time talking about today excuse me because of the versatility that I was mentioning in the last slide and it comes with a little bit more equipment to execute on properly you have to wash it you need a drain vessel that the ice water is being used to go in it's being filtered and then it's ultimately freeze-dried so whereas dry sip is a dry process with dry cured material either trim or flour or popcorn bubble hash or ice water hash is done with ice and water which the cold temperatures and the water and agitation help detach those trichome heads which are then filtered graded and dried and then at the end of all of this unless you're selling just a straight bubble hash product of which there's a couple varieties or a dry security product which again there's different grades and varieties it's all pressed on a Robin press so all of the textures that we were just talking about in the last slide that large kaleidoscope of different products that can come out of solvent list those are all made on one piece of equipment and that is a rousing press so or we get into some data and start talking about them skews I wanted to go over a couple of solvent list facts and myths these are some important points that we get asked about constantly and I'm sure people in the audience right now are already thinking about this or we're potentially already planning to ask these questions so is solvent list less potent than BHO or perhaps other concentrates and the testing answer is no it's not depending on the product coming out the other end with rosin you can get potency ranges anywhere from sixty to ninety nine percent and on that super high end that's a THCA isolate so you can actually isolate thb a with mechanical separation a little bit of a long word there chain of words but the potency is absolutely comparable depending on what the starting material is second thing does CBD play nice with solvent list short answer is sometimes we're not going to spend a lot of time talking about this but for all the people in the audience who are either hemp farmers or are using hemp and are interested in how solvent lists will work with your CBD product it absolutely can it really comes down to the starting quality of your CBD so if you've got field hemp to be perfectly honest with everyone here that tends to not work so well with salt processes if you've got boutique high-end grown CBD it tends to work a lot better the solvent less offer comparable yield this is another one of the biggest myths that we're constantly combating you know with high quality material and we'll talk in depth about this you're going to find that yields are extremely comparable or right up just on top of other popular processing methods such as hydro carbon co2 ethanol things like that now yield is a little bit of a tricky question because it depends so much on what your starting material is what you're trying to get out the other end and really what you're trying to accomplish and that where we've learned a lot over the last couple years in the solvent of space is that with a solvent was product you need to think about it by making your high-end if that's what you're shooting four and then multiple washes or multiple presses to get all of the remaining oil out so that you can have what is more considered a full yield so that you're getting you know using all parts of the Buffalo as it were and then lastly is solvent less expensive to produce so very short answer is no it's not solvent list tends to be significantly less expensive in terms of equipment regulatory needs than hydrocarbon co2 and other extraction methods not only is the equipment quite a bit cheaper objectively you're also going to find that you don't need a C one D one room in your state if that's required for hydrocarbon regulators tend to look a lot more favorably on solvent lists and are more likely to grant it in your lab because the safety aspect of it is not in question due to high pressure or flammable solvents so it tends to be if not the least expensive extraction method to get started with so now none of this would be complete without going through some important market data so first we're going to start with a bunch of data that we've pulled from the MJ biz 2019 Factbook I plug MJ business back book every seminar that I ever do we are not affiliated with MJ biz in any way but they have some of the best data in the entire industry now there's going to be slides throughout this presentation that reference data from headset and other places but for everyone who's tuned in the webinar now if you are interested in really really getting into the nitty-gritty with market data product data every kind of cannabis data that you could imagine the MJ biz back book is probably the best place to find it so again we received zero financial incentives plugging them we just really liked their data and for everyone who's here trying to learn things highly suggest checking them out it's a great source to learn so most of this data I believe was pulled before everything happened with Co vid 19 but with that being said we're still seeing many of these signs happening now and that it seems that people are extremely optimistic in the processing market and we're hearing that for many of our other industry partners as well so cannabis processors in the next 12 months their outlook is saying 92 percent are expecting a better outlook that's a lot that is a major majority and if you even include the 4 percent that's the same you're looking at a vast majority of cannabis processors expecting to encounter better conditions in the next 12 months now that's a little bit open-ended they didn't explain exactly what better means necessarily but that means that a lot of cannabis processors who are already in the space and doing this are optimistic about what's going to happen over the next year now processors that are planning to expand into new markets over the next 12 months 81 percent of them are so that is a pretty telling number that another key figure here is that the vast majority of cannabis processors are planning to expand their operation I struggle to think of any other industry where this kind of thing is happening processors are expanding they are feeling that things are looking good and then this last data point here on the slide it stands out a little bit because it doesn't seem to fit in with the others but wholesale cultivators are indicating that high quality is 40 excuse me 46 percent of wholesale cultivators are going for high-quality as the key differentiating factor for the products that they're selling now that's extremely important because high quality material is one of the key aspects to ensuring that you can create some of the high-end solvent 'less products that we spoke about earlier so it means that access to high-quality material is likely increasing for businesses either entering the space or for businesses that are not fully vertically integrated and have to source material from wholesale cultivators so organic at 23% is also great because organic material tends to be very very good with solvent list and then you see below that low cost grown sustainably terpene content value and other those are pretty minor you know high quality material and organic material seems to be what more wholesale cultivators are focusing on meaning that processors are going to have access to more material and better material hopefully now the next slide and this is the number two executive summary take away in the MJ biz 2019 fact book this is a little bit to take in so a lot of numbers a lot of words I'm going to try and walk everyone through this so that you can really take this nugget of wisdom away so gray unprofitable blue break-even green profitable pretty easy to understand that now this graph is telling us that the number of SKUs produced has a dramatic effect on reported profitability from the businesses that participate pated and answered the survey that mjp is put out to gather this data so that red box at the bottom what you're going to see is a massive increase in reported profitability for businesses that are having 11 to 15 different skews compared to 1 to 3 so if you're a processor and you're only making a handful of different products reported profitability is absolutely tiny whereas businesses that are producing multiple SKUs and again it seems at this time like the perfect range is around 11 to 15 83% of them are reporting profitability again it's hard to overstate how dramatic of a difference that actually is and even you're seeing businesses that produce 7 to 10 different unique products are reporting three three times as many of those businesses are reporting profitable or profitability over businesses that are doing 4 to 6 and then it's 16 plus you start seeing a little bit of a drop-off although it's still a strong increase over the businesses that are only producing tenfold and then at the top of this graph it's really showing that processors that offer products across multiple categories meaning hydrocarbon solvent lists ethanol different areas of extraction almost half of them report profitability so when you combine offering multiple products in different categories with different types of SKUs that's really where you hit the sweet spot of being able to come up with a balanced product line that addresses as many consumers needs in a dispensary as possible there's always going to be consumers that are looking for the cheapest gram of flour they can buy just like there's always concentrate customers that are only going to be looking for the highest end solvent list that's on the Shelf it's important for any business to produce multiple SKUs and to have SKUs across different categories so tying all of these thoughts together with the data that we just reviewed adding solvent list concentrate is one of if not the least expensive ways to add additional SKUs to your product lineup and is one and a set of SKUs that are highly sought after by connoisseurs and influencers so make sure that you are offering enough SKUs to really help give you the best shot at increasing your profitability and becoming profitable and hitting that break-even point if you have not already cool so now to spend some time shifting gears pretty completely going away from market data and giving some more explanations about what kind of popular solvent with SKUs are out there so there's a lot of text on this slide and on the next one I'm not going to read every single one word for word I would highly encourage anyone to go back to the recording and dig through this a little bit more if there are some parts of these SKUs that you're interested in learning a bit more about or simply asking the question here in the webinar and I'll answer those at the end the number one SKU that we're seeing sold in the market right now is ice hash water rosin this has a very high price per gram it's the top sold rosin product and it's a connoisseur grade concentrate that build brands and loyal buyers okay I read off the first one I can do that for all them the big thing about having solvent with products of virtually any variety is that they can win over influencers and brand builders that are going to talk about your products a lot more than some of the more entry-level less expensive products and we've got clients who where perhaps the vast majority of the revenue they generate is off of some of the more entry or budget-friendly concentrates or products but that they really have built their brand on the backs of their ice water hash rods in their bubble hash robin and directly to that hash robin based cartridges becoming extremely popular now takes quite a bit of an RD but these are the most expensive the most sought-after and at this current time a fairly rare product we're seeing those go from anywhere from fifty to eighty dollars a half gram and it really is the ultimate cannabis product for multiple consumers talking about sift there's of course dry sift rosin tends to retail for less than ice water - rosin but it has a lot of versatility with a lot of different grades and quality now solve them with edibles are another area that's really seeing tremendous growth right now and another opportunity that multiple businesses should be thinking about if they're not already the number three edibles in California according to headsets state by state sales database data is a solvable settable in the past it was the number one edible and that's a key book product so these edibles tend to retail for 20% more than standard edibles or more depending on the market and you can use a lower grade starting material to get a food grade oil to make it work additionally there's a couple more SKUs that we're going to talk about here solvent was topicals and bombs the number one through five topicals or bombs in california are made solvent lessly and they're all Papa and Barclays products they're 50 milliliter tincture that goes for about sixty six dollars I believe their products range from you know fifteen dollars but they do command a premium and they are a true full-spectrum quality product made with again solvent list food grade oil that's put into premium topicals now you've also got full melt ice water hash which is something that a lot of people who've been around the industry for a while will be familiar with and this is the ultimate product for connoisseurs this is pure isolated trichome heads that melt without leaving any residue now the actual sales volume for full melt ice water hash isn't terribly high but if you have high enough quality material to create it this is what wins over connoisseurs like no other the bottom left we've got flour rosin this is an entry level robin product more popular in certain markets and others typically less mature or less developed markets because it's such an easy way to get started you can literally just take a dried cured flour put it in a Robin press squish it out and you've got flour rosin it does tend to retail for less than hash and stiff problem however and then finally we've got hash you use pre rolls this is the number five pre roll in Colorado it's been as high as number one in the past I updated all of these numbers this morning just to make sure that I was providing accurate data for everyone but they also command a pretty hefty premium on how much they sell for typically these are pre rolls that are infused with bubble hash sometimes with sift or key to but as you everyone can see there is a lot of variety here in terms of what kinds of different SKUs that someone can make in order to be successful with solvent list so through these this is kind of scratching the surface because underneath topicals and bombs and edibles especially there are so many different varieties from tinker's bone gummies brownies I mean you name it if there's a product that you're particularly interested in that you love that your market loves can be made with solvent list that product can command a premium and that you can do it without having to throw down hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment purchasing okay now we're going to move on to some of the most important parts of this presentation and why I think a lot of people are tuning in in the first place which is to really understand how they can be successful with solvent lists and what they need to be looking for in the first place to do this so one thing before we jump into genetic selection that I just wanted to show everyone real fast as a EndNote on the versatility of rosin is that these eight products were all made from a single bubble hash string one of our consultants that we work with and since Alden was on instagram whoever is on Instagram I'd highly encourage you to follow him he does some of the best work in the industry he took one strain of bubble hash and set out to figure out how many different SKUs how many different products can I just make with bubble hash that are dabble concentrate this says nothing about cartridges or edibles or topicals you can see just a loan this is eight different textures that are being produced from one single strain of bubble hash all at very different you know levels of interest depending on the consumer so just really driving home the point that there's a lot more versatility with solvent list than a lot of people realize you so now how do I take solvent list and make it successful for my business and the most important thing to start with when you're going down this road and really trying to figure this out is how to understand trichome structure you can't just put any strain in with solvent list and have it be successful and the reason for that is because of the trichomes and the resin content because we're not dissolving the resin out of the plant material with the solvent and we're detaching it mechanically the actual size and shape of the trichome that the plant produces are absolutely critical to getting a yield that's going to be profitable for your business and for making a product that consumers are going to be excited about the one that's sitting on the shelf so in this slide and there's going to be two slides talking about trichomes here we see ABC those are all mid-range or below so AC e and F these are tiny you can see that you know 20 microns 50 microns 20 micron 10 10 these are very very very small try trichomes and when you're doing an ice-water hash filter process or a sip process typically the microns below 45 tend to be food grade and they're still very useful but they don't get captured nearly as well as the example D which is the capitate stock trichome that has a large glandular head full of resin a fairly large stock this is a very resinous trichome at the large size it's pretty much the ideal shape and type to process ultimately whether you're making bubble hash flour Robin stick rather than whatever it is so the cheapest way that you can figure this out without spending a ton of money on a microscope or another product is just to get a jeweler's loupe it's not going to have a micron rating on it but it will give you a much better idea of what type of trichomes you're dealing with I mean you could literally buy a cheap one for 10 or 15 dollars on eBay so really getting into your plant or your plant or the strain that you want to put through your solvents process and looking at it at the nearly microscopic level that is what's going to help you first determine if that strain is going to be viable for solvents or not additionally and I just came across this earlier this week and I've got to give credit where it's absolutely do which is to farm house to do genetics they're based in the northwest and this strange sugar coat which is pictured here with bred specifically super saltless now something that you're going to start hearing a lot more about is trichome detach ability because again saying is over and over we're talking about mechanical separation how well do your trichome neatly detach from the plant material so that they could be captured isolated and then processed so the perfect hash trichome has a thin neck a medium length stock and a large glandular head now I think farmhouse coined this term because I haven't heard anywhere else before this is the week next trichome which provides optimal detachment so if you see where the arrow is pointing look at how thin and narrow that little bridge is between the stock and the head that means with even very very gentle agitation that should detach easily and be able to be captured so there's a lot of genetic companies out there that are now breeding strains specifically for saltless which is often to see making it that much more viable and that much more profitable at the same time again it really comes down to understanding what your plants can do before you commit to large runs whereas with a solvent based extraction method you kind of just throw it in and run it and go from there with solvent lists you need to pay a lot more attention not only to the quality of your material but the types of trichomes that your material is actually making so you're probably asking okay this all looks good these trichome examples are really cool but what kinds of strains are we talking about here so I've got good news for you if you want to screenshot this please go ahead again this will be available in the recap that will be sent to everyone but I've come up with a nice healthy list of different strains that people can take advantage of and their own grows and start feeling hunting for now what's important to also understand is just because you go pick up a Ken dog off of one of many seed websites or from a friend that does not guarantee that that strain of Ken dog is going to have that trichome structure or the resin content by raw potency that's going to be a winner with solvent list these are strains however that we see our clients running constantly that we see mentioned on Instagram constantly and are a great place to start for anyone that's either struggling a little bit to get some strains that are really producing well for saltless or if they're before they're even getting started and you're vertically-integrated going to grow your own material these are ones that you can actually look into getting seeds getting cuts talking to people and starting with these you're you're going to see many of the best hash makers across the world are washing drying and pressing many of these strains crosses of these strains these are some of the most popular lineages in the entire cannabis space for solvent was processing now with that being said things are changing all the time there's always new genetics that are coming out and for those of you who are tuning in who are not vertically integrated meaning you're not cultivating your own product you don't have quite as much control over the supply chain of the cannabis that you happen to be processing it's really important to ask the wholesaler that you're buying your cannabis from that you intend to process has this material been washed do you have other customers who have watched this material is this going to be a strain that's going to play nice with solvents we never advise customers or people who are looking to get into solvent list to blindly go out by tens of pounds of fresh frozen hundreds and start washing it and hope for the best you really need to talk to whoever you're buying your cannabis from or whoever your grower is that's responsible for growing strength having a much better understanding of will this strain provides right trichome structure and have the right resin content so that I can be profitable with my solvent with processing methods so really doing a little bit more digging putting a bit more of the onus on the cultivator of the provider to help provide you with some strains and material and some solutions that will be successful for solvent processing so my favorite of all of this list right now is the Tropicana cookies by Oni Seco there are too many genetic companies to name that are excellent but there's so many good profiles and these are some of the top shelf screens just for flour in general that are now being refined into you know what are considered to be the best concentrates perhaps in the entire world and that sugar-coat strain that we were just showing with the weconnect trichome farmhouse genetics farmhouse studios you know excuse me told me that that strain and those seeds will be available pretty soon so I would definitely make sure to follow them on Instagram and get an idea of when those are dropping because we expect that those will sell out very quickly but hard to go wrong with starting with any of these ok so we're going to get into the end here and really wrap this all up for everyone now before we do the full wrap-up it's really important to understand what kind of space you're going to be operating in and for a lot of businesses and the question that we get constantly is how much space do I need to do all this this sounds great I want to make these products this equipment sounds good I've got good material or I know someone because how do I get my space going less than a thousand square feet is very common for saltless operations or divisions you would be surprised to see that some of the best concentrates in the solvent list world and in the world in general are being made in what almost look like closets and very small areas so that a lot of square footage is definitely not necessary unless you're trying to really scale up your operation and do very high volume now the scalability of solvent list is something that has changed a lot recently there's a lot of innovation happening and that this can scale well above that and you've got operations that are saying thousand square feet you know I've got 50,000 square feet to work with how can you help me there short answer is you don't need a lot to get started but as you scale of course you'll need a little bit more space to produce more proper force and ceiling height planning is also important you know getting started with this and this is something that we offer as a service as well is helping with floor plans but that really understanding how all of the pieces of equipment that you need to produce the products that you're trying to bring to market how do they fit into your lab how many of them do you need where do they go these are all very critical things to think about before you put pen to paper and because most regulators demand this information before you're even allowed to open up shop or make any changes anyway and then again wrapping that up developing a predetermined processing space flow will save you time and money and it can always be modified as you grow as you change as you make different products you're not set in stone on these things but just making a point that having some adequate planning ahead of time will really save a lot of headache and increase your profitability long dress now take everything that we just talked about here are the top four ways that your business can succeed with solemn list and the number one way is know your market and what it wants you know people on the west coast in California Colorado very mature market their appetite for 60 to $80 or more grams of hash rosin is a lot higher than it is on the East Coast at least in the illicit markets now what you're going to find is that every market in its stage of maturity or development is going to grow from extreme interest in just raw flour to more concentrates more products more flavor profiles so it's really important to understand you know what are dispensaries that you're trying to work with or already working with what are they saying what are they selling so before you go all-in on trying to get the holy grail of making a robin cartridge there are some steps along the way that you need to make and you want to make sure that your market is ready for that product and that you're going to be successful with it the second is the source or cultivate premium quality material for dabble products only that's the key here is that if you're trying to make a dabble concentrate the quality of your material is tantamount to success or failure out the other end for what you're trying to do make sure to test that material before you commit to a full batch processing you know just like we're talking about jeweler's loupe look at the trichome really understand what you're doing now if you're making a topical or an edible I'm not saying that you can use lower quality material you can you don't have to but that more of a food grade oil a trim anything along those lines can absolutely fit the bill for edibles assuming that of course it passes contamination testing because the solvent 'less process does not offer any sort of remediation the same way that your tain does for example so premium quality material for dab mobile products is absolutely critical additionally environmental controls really are the difference maker for true top-shelf solvents concentrates you know having a cold room when you're making bubble hash ensuring that your room is clean that you have a good process down these are all things that we've got numerous videos and blogs about that you can dig into the details on but environmental control is extremely important to really make those ultra high-end concentrates and then my last big piece of advice for everyone who's taken the time with me so far to get all the way here a be mindful of creating multiple products with your source material don't just make a bubble hash and then sell a full spectrum bubble hash make and pull so make and sell a full spectrum bubble hash and a food-grade you know topical or edible or take the extra leftovers and put it in a pre-roll there's so many different options to get your full yield and to make more money from your solvent products than just coming out with one thing or two things you've got a lot more options at your fingertips so check in see what people in your market are interested in what they're buying and then work from there so that wraps up the presentation I really appreciate everyone coming pretty much right on the dot 15 minutes for QA Eric if you want to start shooting some questions my way I'd be happy to start answering sounds great well thank you so much Eric that was really fantastic and very nicely detailed we do have a number of questions that have come in and I'll just remind it or when you'll see a questions box on your screen so please do type in your questions we've got about 15 minutes here Eric we've got a number of questions about about yield and trichome detach ability I'm going to try to sort of bake them into one question however however they'll probably a couple questions here really but how do you measure yield and how do you in terms of sourcing genetics how do you know what you're getting before taking out the jeweler's loupe and looking closely I guess some what should what should folks be looking for when trying to measure trichomes and trying to plan for yield yeah great question what it comes down to is this selection process that experienced processors have really refined over time you know coming into it as a newcomer where you don't have that ability it's almost a sixth sense where you can look at a bud or fresh frozen plan or a plan even before it's been cut down and say wow this is a very resinous strain it smells really good the blood structure is not super dense or super lar fee you know very light so you know for everyone who's tuned in that doesn't have the sixth sense of the master processor it's really important to know you know has this strain been grown before by this cultivator and what's it testing at if you've got more juice to squeeze you're gonna have a better shot at having a salt most product you know whereas if it's a very low potency strain there's just not as much resin there to expel to extract so that's the first component of it too and then having an honest conversation with your grower with the cultivator whoever is involved and just asking them questions you know do you have any experience excuse me with doing the solvent lessly either with your own business if they're legally allowed to process or do they have they talked to anyone else who's familiar with the strain that process it solvent what it's really a combination of you know using your spidey sense to say is this plant got enough resin to work with and does the person who's producing it have details about whether or not it's been processed solemnly before or do they think that it will process well solvent lessly and then I'm sure you've got a lot of questions about yield so should I just go directly into that or do you have one specifically that I should answer yeah one one question maybe just a frame the conversation about yield here is how can folks know that the yield is deriving from this extraction process is the greatest potential yield meaning how can they know they're not missing or missing out on the program the catch ability we're talking about yep another or another really important question and it's it's really hard to drill down and say that strain X I will get and reclaim 98 percent of the available trichome mass because of the budge structure versus strain Z which I can only expect to get 95 percent total reclamation or something like that but what it really comes down to is taking an experimentation process so if you're washing bubble hash you will wash two or three times until all you're getting anymore is basically just plant material and debris and then you said okay my trichomes are spent or if you're pressing hash or flower essence if Robin you know pressing those first couple bags multiple times to understand like where does where is the road end with this material one can I not get any more out of it and then backing into your math about what are your yields what was your cost to produce it or acquire it and then you know getting into your spreadsheet and trying to figure out did this strain make money for me or before committing to processing a whole bunch of it you know moving on to a different one we have a little story we're talking with a client of ours and they washed at Angie strain that they grew put it all out there boss program to produce that strain was about 135 dollars that was just their production cost and they said whoa you know I can't you know I'm not going to make any money on this so they only did a small test batch figured out the yield wasn't too good and now they just sell that strain either through hydrocarbon processing or is just whole flour it's very successful whereas for some of their other hash strains I think it might have been Tropicana cookies Alain but I was talking about you know their cost per gram to produce that was closer to eight to ten dollars or a little bit more of hash rousing because it made so much hash it had such a good yield that their production cost went way way down and that's one of the winners that they wash and produce and sell constantly so you know you have to take a little bit of a holistic approach but really trying to get as much out of whatever you're doing if possible and then working into the numbers to see if it makes sense yeah we have a couple questions here about just the different factors that go into these products and obviously we've talked a lot about source product and that the genetics that are going into solvent list products but what other factors can kind of folks influence whether that's temperature or pressure what other factors might go into this process and what are some quick tips to really improve those yeah so all along the solvent list processing chain you're going to have all kinds of variables assuming you know if you're either growing the material yourself starting there you know how is the material being grown is it indoor/outdoor there's almost too many variables to mention on the cultivation side of things so I'm going to focus my answer on attraction side which is where I know significantly more about and that's having high variable control is extremely important to be able to come out with a consistent product so that's something that we at peer-pressure really really focus on is having the most precise and replicatable you know variable control with the equipment that we make and sell so that being able to create a consistent product by controlling your time your temperature your pressure how hot or cold the room that you're working in is there's all these different data points that someone is going to want to understand so that they can compare one strain against another in the most scientific way possible in order to better understand you know is this a product that consumers want it's a product that we're producing consistently and is the end result something that we feel that we can replicate consistently so with the extraction process it really comes down to time pressure temperature for rosin and then with ice water hash its water temperature environmental temperature sift a little bit less variable control a little bit more post-processing cleanup so because we don't have a ton of time left here I would again encourage anyone who's interested in getting tips and tricks on pressing rods in on making ice water hatch I'm making sift anything in between our YouTube channel go peer pressure our blog which is on our website go peer pressure com we've got in-depth articles on all of these topics so I would highly encourage everyone to go check those out and do some reading some watching excellent yeah a few folks were asking about additional resources that's great um there could you speak to the impact of freezing the material before say a bubble hash process and whether that might yield better results yeah absolutely and this is a webinar that I gave trying to reach a very broad audience in the future I will give a webinar that's more intermediate and advanced solvent lists we didn't really touch on fresh frozen very much in this now fresh frozen is when you take cannabis and you D fan it take all families off and then you immediately freeze it now doing a fresh frozen product is what can create what's called a live product so you I'm sure you've heard of waif resin made with hydrocarbon or live rosin which is the ice water hash process that's then taking a material that's never been dried or cured so when you don't dry or cure your flour you d pan it and freeze it that tends to give a flavor profile and a terpene profile as well as changes in the cannabinoids because it hasn't been dried or cured that many consumers prefer over a dried and cured starting material for the concentrate now there's a lot of debate about this but for a business owner having fresh frozen material as your starter for bubble hash specifically is one of the smartest moves you can make because not only are you creating a product that the majority of dabble concentrate consumers are looking for anyway but also you don't need the infrastructure or the time to go ahead and dry and carefully cure your material which as many growers and people who have grown who tuned in understand is one of if not the most difficult parts of the entire cultivation process drying and curing your flower perfectly is and more than it is a science and that that can be very difficult to do so by having freezers and freezing your material to make a fresh frozen you are skipping that headache entirely you of course need freezers to store your material in but that the cold temperatures also actually increase trichome detach ability because they are more brittle so for multiple reasons both from a consumer standpoint a business ROI standpoint an equipment standpoint a space standpoint doing fresh frozen makes sense for most businesses excellent we have a question here if without access to specific screens at the moment could you talk about the idea of practicing or optimizing the process using lower quality strains that may have less optimal trichome structure and whether that will whether that practice will will really help the grower or whether that I'd be leading them down maybe an unhelpful ya know that that's a really good question um typically when someone or a business or a group of people are trying to get familiar with the solvent list process using material that they don't necessarily expect to process and then ride all the way home to the bank is a great way to really get your chops under you because you've got a lot more margin for error and you could really get the techniques down a lot better if the stakes aren't quite so high so I would say that you know lower quality starting material mid mid grade and below is actually a very important tool in the solvent was processors arsenal because it can a teach the team teacher extractors how to do all of this very well before your top shelf top cola buds are on the line to be processed perfectly and also a lot of the mid grade and below material is the perfect material to use for food grade oil there's definitely businesses out there that use their top shelf for their food grade as well but if you're not super confident that the material that you've got or that you're working with is going to make a light golden kind of blonde hash robin it's great idea to just turn it into a food grade oil and then put that in a topical or edible excellent we've got a few a few cost questions here and I realize we're bumping up against the hour but any we can end with this one in general terms can you describe the difference in say overhead costs associated with starting with dried or cured product versus fresh frozen product all the equipment that might go into that and how it grow or how a how a manufacturer might keep keep those costs in mind yeah absolutely so it's just tough one to answer because every business has many businesses very different objectives about what their weekly throughput should be what kinds of SKUs and products they're trying to make out the other end um what you're going to find is that with fresh frozen you don't need as much space to do the drying and tearing and you don't need quite as much environmental control in that specific area of your lab because you're filling freezers full but what that does mean is that you have to understand you know what is the electricity requirements for you know drying and curing your material versus running a bunch of freezers you know every business is different and electricity prices are different all over the country some places are off the grid and they're full solar and it's not really much of an issue for them but most businesses don't fall into that category so overhead wise it's hard for me and I'm hesitant to say that well if you do fresh fruit when it's going to be a lot cheaper for you I promise I know that I cannot make that promise because it depends on your area but the vast majority of our customers and we work with labs all across the world many of the biggest solvus processors across North America who make literally be best concentrates in the entire world mmm the vast majority of them are doing fresh frozen and turning that into bubble hash and then making a variety of products as you know maybe their flagship solvent let's concentrate so I apologize for whoever was asking that if that was an exactly to your answer you're looking for but please contact us we would love to help you better understand what this equipment would look like in your operation we take a very hands-on each customer is different approach we'd be happy to run you through an equipment list and show you what things look like that's no cost no obligation we'd be happy to talk you through your needs excellent well yes I would echo that and recommend everyone jot down the contact information here and I'll also remind everyone that a link to this presentation will be hitting your email inboxes very soon here and Eric and everyone at pure pressure I will not thank you for the presentation today this has been really fantastic and really insightful okay hey thank you for having us I really appreciate it and great job moderating thank you so much and once again everyone for attending thank you

if you're not please don't watch this [Music] oh [Music] [Music] my last harvest was just over a month ago and it was a pretty good bounty [Music] i had all the jars full of some big chunkers but i was also left with a bunch of small buds and shake [Music] now i'm not into eating edibles i'm more of a joint or dab kind of guy and i don't mess around with chemicals so that means bh no thank you i keep things solventless not just for health reasons but honestly it's it's for the terp reasons i do it for the terps sullivanless is is the bee's knees now that does leave me with two options nice water hash extraction aka good old-fashioned bubble hash or that's a good one using gravity in these dry sift screens aka dry sifting [Music] [Applause] so in the past i've had my share of bubble runs okay the bubble wrap itself always goes smooth especially since i always work with fresh material that wasn't too old for harvest [Music] the yields and the color was it was on point all good signs of some decent quality bubble hash but when it came time to the drying process that's where i noticed a lot of that nice color being lost i was drawing the bubble hash in these boxes and leaving them by an ac unit and dehumidifier [Music] just like that grind it down microplane it i even started to microplane the bubble first just to see if that would help the process but i still noticed the hash go from amazing top shelf color to looking like well looking like some dark moroccan ash once it was all dried and i noticed this happening on every run i would pull great color but dry the hash into dark chocolate and if i press that bubble into rosin i would just end up with some bad color hash rosin ultimately it wasn't working but i didn't know where the kink was and it was the drying phase [Music] i was told i needed a dry freezer so you know i went online to see what that was all about and uh it was all about five thousand dollars for one which is very expensive piece of equipment and i'm not sure i have the balls to commit to a purchase like that at this point i would almost want to have an entire room dedicated to hash for that to be viable and i simply don't have the room and i'm certainly not sacrificing my gym space [Music] despite my lack of quality when it came to drying bubble i did have another option these dry sift screens [Music] this method uses gravity and agitation and since i was working with material that was already dry i didn't have to sacrifice any loss when it came to quality [Music] and of course this quality would spew out on the rosin press i'm happy oh look at the color that's fresh off the press color bro yeah that's really nice now on all my hash videos i always get a few comments from someone who like doesn't really dab and and they will comment why press the dry sift into rosin seems like a big waste i just smoke it in bowls and joints that's completely fine makes sense if you're not into dabbing but the reason why i like to press it into hash rosin is because it creates a more concentrated version of hash after all i am starting with trim which isn't very strong [Music] just for the heck of it let's just say between 10 i don't know maybe 20 in thc and then of course when we break that down through the dry sift screens we are left with obviously less weight but also a stronger product that could be i don't know once again just for example 50 [Music] thc and if we grab that tricep and press it into rosin we are once again creating a more concentrated version upwards of 70 thc for example once again i'm making these numbers up but this is kind of how it goes [Music] and since i do keep things solving this right from the beginning the hash horizon not only packs an incredible punch but it also has a starburst of terps when it comes to the taste and by the way that does not mean i'm not going to keep some of the dry sift for supercharging joints so i'm about to start my first run aka the quick bounce method i'm just using the one screen the 110 mesh count aka 149 micron i'm pretty sure honestly the conversions can sometimes get confusing but i'm pretty sure that's right now to make this entire process as efficient as can be i'm grabbing my dry material directly from the freezer and quickly dropping it onto the screen the material needs to be bone dry and frozen two key factors in increasing the dry sift yields this first run is supposed to be quick with minimum agitation i don't want to overwork the material break it down too much causing contaminants to go through creating a less melty first run dry sift quick clean and i'm removing all the material off the screen before i place more down now i do want to mention that this is in no way advice on how to dry sift guys i'm simply just showing you what i do with my leftovers from harvest take from it what you will if you really want to do a deep dive into the dry sifting world there is a lot more to learn from static dry sifting to different karting tech i'm honestly just showing what i do in honestly the least technical way possible i guess this is just how i quickly clean and collect some heads from my trim if you're one of those crazy [ __ ] that want to know more about dry sifting just check out channels like mark the bubble man or even john berfello there's a few of them out there that go pretty deep into all the different styles of dry sifting a lot more deeper into what i'm doing the first run is always a rewarding one the fact that i can spend as short as 10 minutes dropping shake onto screens and have such a pretty pile of some first run almost full melt sift it's pretty [ __ ] a-okay with me so today i am doing a second run now for this second run i haven't always used the four screens sometimes i just use the one screen only the 110 mesh and i just work the material longer however there is a nice little extra filtering effect when rocking all four dry sift screens the very top screen is called the working screen and it's 60 mesh count aka 250 micron the second screen is 90 mesh count which is 190 micron the third screen is 110 mesh count which is 149 micron in the bottom yellow screen is 200 mesh cal which is 74 micron so on the second run i will work the material on the top screen for anywhere between one and three minutes before discarding into my trim bin now this is something i wish i could say i thought of myself but it was a friend actually he came over one night and was like dude pull the bin out this is another way to catch some additional heads which other words would be lost if you know i discard it into a bin like i used to i've ran all my material through the top working screen and now i'm down to the 90 mesh count aka 190 micron [Music] into the naked eye this big pile of dry sift looks pretty clean but looks can be deceiving after a few minutes of lightly carting back and forth a lot of the heads fall through to the bottom screen and was left on top of the 190 micron screen is dirty [Music] contaminants [Music] and finally getting down to the bottom 200 mesh count aka 74 micron screen where i have myself a pretty darn clean pile of heads [Applause] drop a like if you uh if you like rick and morty hopefully there's a billion likes on this video because of that for this second dry sift run um i spent 30 to 40 minutes probably in totality working the material and what was left on the very bottom 74 micron screen aka 200 mesh count for anyone who's keeping track uh was a pile of dry sift that totaled 30 something grams roughly like 31 grams and i would call this dry sift half melt status this is not full melty melt amazing dry sift this is just amazing dry sift that's half melt that was a bad analogy you can take that polish and implement other cleaning strategies like static dry sifting and or the carting tech you can use those two as options to clean up a dirty palace sift so if you are like me and you do want to press some of the dry sift that you managed to collect into rosin well cool over the years i've done double begging tech where i would grab the 25 micron bag from rosin evolution and stuff that inside a 160 micron bag and the only reason why i was doing double bagging tech was just to avoid or reduce my chances of actually having a blowout honestly it freaking sucks when you have a blowout when you're pressing your hash it's like it's not really something you can salvage if you have a blowout the hash will literally spew out of the rosin press like it's taking a [ __ ] gnarly [ __ ] and it's just unfortunate because it's like ruined and it was something that happened a lot when i was uh rosin pressing earlier on that's why i used to use a double banking tech and it would reduce the chances kind of of having a blow up but what i also noticed was i was still having blowouts bro because i was just coming down too quick too fast when i take so much time off and then come back to pressing rosin you kind of have to like relearn the the nuances of everything so as of recently i have just been using the 125 micron bag for pressing my hash and when i do get it into the press i just take i don't want to say take my sweet time coming down with the pressure because the longer it's in the press the more degraded the hash can end up so there is like a sweet spot when it comes to pressing the hash super low time too no blowout i'm happy oh look at the color that's fresh off the press color bruh that's right what i've noticed is i come down too quick and i end up with a blowout so that's kind of why i take my sweet time uh increasing the pressure it's just to avoid the huge hiccup of having that [ __ ] blowout man [Music] now on instagram i've seen a few people like they are yielding like 80 return off the bubble they are pressing into rosin and i've never been close to 80 returns i've done 50 and 60 returns but never more [Music] and i've done this a few times i've never had anything spew 80 percent return something something was in my mouth that was weird i just had a bunch of chickens jesus christ swear to god my [ __ ] tits are getting too big for this shirt one thing i do regret about the sif screens that i purchased is the overall size these are 12 by 24 inches and honestly when i bought them i thought this was the right decision i'm just a home gardener i'm not some commercial op but that was a mistake it honestly was a mistake i should have opted for at least the one size up if not just should have got just shoulda woulda but coulda but didn't i should have got the two by three feet size screens which are [ __ ] mammoth but honestly worth it should have done it didn't you can um still make work of the larger screens even in a smaller scale operation that's what i'm trying to get at took me an entire [ __ ] paragraph to okay episode two of the closet series will be coming out next i'm going to basically start working on the video the second this one's done i am sorry for the massive delays i have not just one grow up i have actually multiple grows right now all going which are all being documented heavily from seed to harvest and i've been trying to keep them under wrap however i'm not doing a good job at that because i'm telling you guys about them right now oh my rick and morty poster fell down perfect so we are at the

"[Music] hello everyone i'm the helping kid and welcome to our journey where we explore snakes their relatives and the world's growing passion for these magnificent creatures again apologies for the background for the next few videos until about january 11th uh this will be the background apologies for that however after that we will be going back to our normal background hopefully um and yeah it's just sort of rainy before we start i would like to say besides that that we will be only filming or posting one video per week until the 11th of january 2021 b reason being is that i'm going on holiday until then and we will then be going back to the regular monday and friday posting schedule we will be posting every monday as opposed to friday don't ask me why that's just how i thought of it um yeah but today we will be profiling the vibrance stiletto snake this snake is quite special um but yeah let's get into the identification they grow up to about 70 centimeters i almost said meters goodness 70 centimeters long they're generally brown to a very dark dark brown uh in color and they have a whitish underbelly they also have comically small eyes uh not as small as the vibrant blind snake but pretty small in terms of distribution they are found in the free state limpopo uh northwest and kwazulu-natal yeah their habitats are underground simple as that they live underground it's not necessarily in a specific habitat underground but they just live underground in terms of diet what they eat they eat small lizards young rodents and often other snakes now these don't always drop into their underground burrows but when they do they make an opportunity of it speaking of they only really surface at rainy nights or really damp cold nights to hunt they don't really surface in any other time of year or day so activity they are nocturnal as i said before they only really surface at night but we can just hop straight into their venom they have a pretty potent cytotoxin and honestly it's pretty bad if people get bitten majority of cases end in an amputation or at least the fish fasciae fasciotomy um which is a decompressive surgery if you have a lot of swelling and stuff not necessarily only in snake bites but often found in puff adder gaboon adder or other adder bites um typically that's the minimum that you'll get away with is um an amputation or fasciotomy which can be pretty bad um so these aren't things you want to mess with but something that makes these guys especially special is that they have rotating fangs meaning there's no safe way to handle them unless you've got really dense gloves or gloves made specifically for snakes you can't always trust these i promise you if you trust them with something like a king cobra they may well penetrate through so just be careful but with them they have proportionately large fangs but relatively small because it's only large in comparison to their body length um but the rotating means that if you grab it behind the head it can just poke it out of the side and what they got you so it's pretty dangerous to handle these guys yeah and they can be misidentified for a few different snakes so be

we're going to be pressing one ounce of fresh frozen full plan ice water hash we get big yields using the directional flow method as well as show you how I butter the rosin after being pressed [Music] let's go over the items we're going to be using during this week's episode we're going to need parchment paper any brand will do I always go with the unbleached version pressing bags I ordered these online in a custom size to fit my pressing plates perfectly allowing me to maximize the amount that can be pressed at a single time as for micron science I go with the 37 micron because I mainly deal with ice water hash or teeth if you're going to be pressing flour but with ninety micron and I always remember to double bag your product a couple Dobb tools and a set of tweezers lastly obviously the material I'll be pressing you already know from the title we're going to be doing a single press of one ounce the material I'll be pressing is fresh frozen ice water hash this was from one of my previous grows it's a blend of green crack barber bud and Harley Quinn bx4 this is also material that's been freeze-dried I'll be doing a video shortly covering how I made the ice water hash and using my freeze dryer so be sure to hit that subscribe button you can notified when that gets posted as you can see the material is getting pretty sticky once it comes out of the fridge making it very difficult to talk the pressing baked properly [Music] using one of my job tools I packed though ice-water house down into the bag as evenly as possible my hand I give it a good pre-press evening out the material as best as I can at this point the ice water hash has already become warm and it's very sticky not allowing it to be moved around much in the bag [Music] for today's press we're going to be utilizing the directional flow method a benefit of using it is that it allows you to watch the flow during the press you can see the flow from start to finish allowing you to adjust the variables accordingly this becomes very helpful at all stages as you're about to see I forgot to double bag my material which resulted in my bag being unfolded squishing out the ice water hash out the one end this became noticeable immediately allowing me to stop the press right away unfortunately I forgot to record me collecting the material and just putting a second bag over the other [Music] [Music] I stopped the first pressed short not noticing the flow of the rosin still happening [Music] I then folded the pressing bag in half and did a second press giving additional amount of yield [Music] letting the freshly pressed live hash rasa sit for a few minutes allow it to cool carving the rosin eyelet cooler temperature helps with a collection of it using a long-handled dab tool makes the collection of the rosin very easy since the second press was very short I'm going to collect all the rosin together after collecting it all into one patty I like to put it into a glass jar it's process butters the rosin to texture I find more appealing [Music] I simply put the glass shard in between the two plates with the lid tightly screwed on and let it sit for about one hour at 150 degrees Fahrenheit then I open the jar stir the rose and whip it around mix it up place it back in between the plates I had a hundred degrees Fahrenheit for ten hours after the ten hours I collect the

welcome to canada basics today we're going to learn how to make bubble hash [Music] bubble hash is one of the oldest and purest methods of making concentrated cannabis and uses only ice and water as a solvent it's easy to do but requires time patience and some elbow grease so let's get started here's what you need to make bubble hash when it comes to making bubble hash you are going to need some bubble bags and these are usually vinyl bags that are designed to fit inside of one gallon or five gallon buckets and they have a silk or micron screen bottoms and those that vary in different sizes 25 to 220 microns and you're going to need three to five different sizes of those you can find links to those kinds of bags on amazon in the description you're also going to need a wooden dowel to agitate the cannabis you're going to need some ice about 10 15 pounds of ice you're also going to need some cannabis you can use any grain of cannabis that you want for here we're going to use about three or four ounces of outdoor grown cannabis if you're using outdoor grown cannabis or any kind of cannabis you're going to go ahead and manicure it down to its buds so go ahead and pull off the major portion of the leaves until you get down to the pods unless you're actually using shake and trim which you can also make bubble hash out of shake and trim but we're using the buds and we're going to go ahead and manicure that down the next thing you're going to do is to layer your bags inside of the bucket we're using a five gallon bucket you may use a one gallon bucket also depending on the bags that you have but the thing that you want to do is you want to layer your screens inside of the bucket starting with the smaller screen first so in this case we've put our 25 micron screen in then we put our 73 micron screen in now we're putting our 160 micron screen in and then lastly we'll be putting our 220 micron screen back in and micron screens and that a micron is the measurement of microns with 220 microns means that 220 microns will fit through each hole in that screen and then so the smaller the number the smaller the size of the holes so and now that we've added our screens and layered them up and now we've added our cannabis into our 220 micron screen we've added about three or four ounces of cannabis and then now we're adding in ice now the ice is being used in this case to lower the temperature so that it freezes the trichomes and so that the stems of the trichomes are brittle and the trichome heads break off into the water so you want to use as much ice as possible so we're putting as much ice in we're covering up our cannabis and we're coming about six inches from the bottom of our pocket and now we're also going to add water and you want to add water so that it covers up into barely covers the cannabis which is in the the bottom of our top bag so you can tilt the screens or tilt the bucket to find out if see if you estimate if you have enough cannabis enough water to cover your cannabis but that's the idea is that you want to have enough water to cover your cannabis as well as up into the eyes and what we're doing is we're freezing the the trichomes so that the stems become brittle and the trichomes heads fall off and the idea is that to break and agitate the cannabis so now we're agitating turning and using our wooden dowels to actually literally just agitate and mix the cannabis being sure not to poke holes into our micron screens we're going to keep agitating as much as possible you can do this for several minutes 15-20 minutes or so and then after you do that you're going to let it settle and we've uh what we've done is we've broken frozen those trichrome heads and we've letting them uh fall into the water and then they've fallen through those micron screens and this larger micron screen we're now taking that out it's been several minutes after it's been agitated and it's been sitting for about 45 minutes and now we're taking out the the top screen the 220 micron and setting it aside and now we're going to pull up our first green which will have trapped some of the uh larger pieces of cannabis and our thc and trichomes and also some plant material so this first layer of screens that we're pulling out is going to be our least pure it's going to have our most plant material it's our biggest micron screen and most of the thc has actually fallen through this screen so but you can see there we've pulled out a little bit of bubble hash there and it's a darker color hash and then now we're pulling out our second screen and in order to uh save the cannabis that was left on the screen that we didn't wash off we're inverting it carefully and then dipping it back into the next green down into the water that's in that screen and that is to wash the trichomes off into that next screen so now we're removing the second screen out i believe this would be our uh 73 micron screen and we're we're letting the water fall out of that we're not going to squeeze it we're gonna let it fall out and then you can see now that the trichomes that are left there a little lighter color than the first set and there's also more of them and there's a lot less plant material here as you can see compared to the previous hash that came out it's a lot lighter color but again we're rinsing the remaining hashtag we didn't scrape off into the next batch or into the last screen so we make sure our screen is nice and clean and then we've come to our last screen and this is our 25 micron screen and we'll see this is the finest screen and this is going to make sure that pretty much anything left on here that's any thc is going to get trapped in this screen here and as we scrape that up you can see it's pretty easy to collect the cannabis or the thc that's collected there or the hash and it's a nice uh lighter a little more blonde color than the previous two a little bit more pure and you can see that's why those screens are used so that you can get different grades of hash and the next step now a lot of people would use a micro on screen here we didn't have a micron screen we're just using some cheese cloth or a muslin cotton muslin bag here and we're squeezing out the water it's just being pressed out gently with some palm pressure there to press out the water and what's going to be remaining is bubble hash and what we've got here is three different grades of bubble hash depending on the three different screens that we used and and in the end we're actually going to combine all of our hash altogether so i'm just showing you the different screens there for demonstration purposes but if you're only going to use one grade of hash in the end uh there's really no need to have multiple screens you might just use one or two screens in that case but for demonstration purposes we're using multiple screens to show how you'd get different grades of hash and now that we've uh we've gone one run of our canvas you can do this two or three different times or even up to five or more times with each batch of cannabis so this is the second run with the same batch of cannabis just with another run of the water and ice this one actually sat overnight this second run we got a pretty good yield off of it even better than the first and then we even decided to go ahead and run a third run off of the same batch of cannabis and so even after collecting two pretty good batches of bubble hash with it we went ahead and decided to go the third one and even after the third running we're still getting some more hash out of it you can see after the third time the cannabis is getting it looks like a lot like seaweed it's very foamy it get agitates a lot easier and it also gets foams up a lot easier as the last two or three batches were gone but once they pressed out the the phone goes away and you can see that there are three different batches of bubble hash there at different stages of drying out and you can see that the uh the newer batch is much muddier looking uh the batch in the center there is the first batch we did is dried out from overnight this episode of cannabis

versus fresh frozen material and freshly made versus age / melt civility is not one of them without doing the fire test you never know what you're dealing with I recently dabbed ninety micron bubble

own but we can make our own because we deserve to give ourselves the best [Music]", "DwfFsR_AE8s": "[Music] okay so today is tremors bonus day I'm going to be taking a bunch of trim and lar from a recent harvest and I'm going to be showing you how I go about making some simple safe solving this crisis if hash [Music] there's many different ways that go about taking care of your trim in life and this is simply just one of them and by no means of mine expert I'm just going to show you what I do in terms of sifting my trim and life to further extract the cannabinoids just to get as much as I can out of the plant with that being said I'm going to leave a link down below to a video with bubbleman and D for 20k going over the dry sipping process and in that one particular video they really do go over a lot of key points so I do recommend watching that video as well after you watch this video of course guys come on now when it comes to dry sipping trim lar for actual flowers dries in the name so make sure the material you're using is dry enough otherwise the trichomes they won't fall off the plant matter as easily now I'm using trim and lar from a recent harvest and after hang-drying the flowers for 10 old days I trimmed the flowers up and place them into jars for curing and I left all the trim and larf from the harvest on these screens to further dry I had it on the screens for over a week before placing into a freezer bag and storing the trim in the freezer for future use now on top of making sure the material is dry enough to dry sift also ensure your material is as cold as you can get it during the process of sifting the cold temperatures causes the trichomes to become brittle and more liable to break off the plant so it's best to store your material in the freezer right before getting ready to sift it try to set up your work area for sifting in a cold environment I'm using my basement and I live in Canada where it's currently minus 12 outside and my basement is sitting around twelve degrees Celsius or about 55 Fahrenheit if you happen to have a garage or perhaps a spot outside that is blocked off from the wind you may want to put on a jacket and take your sift area outside this way you can achieve the best yields from your trim [Music] now let's talk zip screens so each zip screen has a different mesh count which allows different size materials to pass through your top screens are classified as you're working screens and the top screen I'm using is the ninety lines per inch this is the main screen you're gonna be working all the material over it the trichomes will be breaking off and falling through to the next screen which is the hundred and ten lines per inch this screen is an important one because it's going to continue to allow the trichome heads to pass through while catching most contaminants which are going to be your decapitated stocks and pistol hairs the trichomes will fall on the screen or roll around until dropping through the screen while the contaminants toxin hairs land flat and gets stuck on top of the screen now this leaves us with the very bottom screen which is the 200 lines per inch this screen catches all of your trichomes it has a few purposes from being the final catch system of your trichome heads but is also used as a cleaning tool to further clean and purify your drive shaft heads of contaminants this is where you can take some farmers grade hash or Keith and further clean it down into pure heads there's multiple techniques to go about cleaning your dry state further from the carding technique to static dry sifting I'm gonna leave a link down below to a couple detailed videos on how to further clean your farmers great hasher Keith [Music] so the way I sent my tram in large is I like to do it in three separate runs the main difference between each run is going to be the time and the amount of agitation the material goes through the first run is going to be quick and it's going to produce the cleanest heads while the second and third runs are going to produce the most amount of heads but they will be dirtier and not as pure the first run through the screens very quick the material is simply being dropped onto the working screens and then picked back up off the screen and set aside for run to the main point of the first run is to collect the nicest and cleanest heads the longer the material is worked over the screens the more containers will fall through into your pile of clean ash so for the first run it's important to be quick and diligent and avoid being too rough and leaving the materials on the screen for too long [Music] now as I drop the material on the top screen the trichomes are going to be falling off and passing through and hitting the second screen and then rolling around until the finds will hold a pass through to the bottom screen so what I like to do is collect what's on the bottom screen already because it will be the cleanest pile of hash with minimum contaminants I will set this aside on a parchment and then bring back the second screen and I will just give the top of the screen a flick to cause the material to bounce this allows majority of there are many trichome heads to roll down to the bottom screen these are still very clean heads but because I'm flicking the screen more contaminants are gonna pass through which is why I like to collect them in separate piles keep in mind this is just what I do you very well could flick the second screen right away and just collect it all out ones and label all of that your first one the reason why I do with this waste because that first collection with the least amount of agitation is always going to be the most meltia sand cleanest heads that you can do and in the quickest form [Music] to prepare for the second run I just make sure the screens are clean because any condemned is left on those screens will block the trichomes from rolling down through the screens to the bottom so after every single run I will brush the screens down I also like to put the material back into the freezer too brittle up the trichomes usually a wait about a half-hour before starting the second run [Music] the second run is where I start to get rougher with the material on the working screens I will start to move around the material with my hands for about 10 to 15 seconds and typically for speed I move the material to the side of the screen and then grab another handful and drop it on the screen to repeat after a couple handfuls I will remove the material and place it into a bin for its third run and then continue on until the rest is finished [Music] now there's plenty of ways to go about dry sifting your material and you don't need to do a first second and third run personally I don't like to clean the hash so by doing a quick first in second run it allows me to collect a lot of trichome heads that require less cleaning the third run is where I spend the most time working the material and will end up with more farmer's grade hash that requires to be cleaned to further purify it from contaminants that's where the carding technique and things like static dry sifting come in handy they help further clean dirty hash from removing pistols and decapitated stocks [Music] oh that's good piping hot though last night I only ended up doing two runs just ran out of time it's gonna take way too long to do the third run and it was getting pretty damn late I am gonna do a third run probably like next week sometime I placed all the trim enlarged back into the freezer what we ended up with is like three point four grams of second run sift on the first run the quick run we ended up getting like the Eagles a gram so what I'm gonna do now is actually I want to press some of this the second run hash out into some rosin this is gonna be maybe my third time overall ever pressing hash out into some rosin I'm gonna do all of this wish me luck this is the very very first run and then this is also from the first run but that's after I added the screen a bit so probably a little bit more dirty than this stuff so we're gonna go ahead and take a dab of this and will it melt it probably will I mean I've good suspicion it will never timer Londa we're at a minute at a minute so this right here is a point four and probably gonna end up doing all of it let's go oh yeah she bubbled oh yeah that was super low ten in WoW is that tasty oh yeah you can see it evens these little dirty in there whoo that was nice okay guys well let's get set up the press some hash [Music] [Music] okay so first up we got a bag the hash now I've seen on Pedro's grow room he double bags his hash frozen I've seen him use a few variations I've seen him use 237 micron bags and I've seen him use a 25 micron bag with a 160 micron bag so no reason why I'm gonna go with this variation of double bagging so well let's get this stuff so I put the three point four grams of sift the second run sift into the 25 micron bag you know what I'm gonna do I think I'm gonna just pack this down a bit with my body weight and then so the 160 micron bag I don't know if I should have packed that down before or after look at that so there we go we got 3.4 grams of dry sift inside a 25 micron bag which is also double bagged inside a 160 micron bag these are from rosin evolution and I do have a coupon code down below along with a coupon code for the low temperature and press what you're about to see in two seconds so I think I need a pair of scissors just to trim this up and the way we go give me a second so that way we could just fold it a bit and get ready to press cool so the way I'm going to be pressing out this sift is using a directional flow method now it's very simple and what it just does is it presses all of the rosin of the front and it keeps it from going out the sides of that so you're going to basically cut this parchment to the correct size and there's a simple s just like that and then you fold in each side this is the way I do it very simple takes no time to set up and then you're good to go yeah because I'm pressing out some dry sift I turned down the low temp press down to 71 degree Celsius which I believe is about 160 degrees Fahrenheit and yeah anyways she's ready to go so let's press some rosin [Music] I'm at one minute right now [Music] I really don't know how much pressure to add I don't want to blow anything l things just gonna wait two minutes it's about now and I think we're good oh wow this looks four-way go and suck your blood that alone so that alone is 1.75 grams 1.77 grams and still got all this stuff on it and this looks definitely worthy of press pressing twice so okay guys that's this week's video I really hope you enjoyed it don't forget I'm not an expert when it comes to dry sifting you can actually grab farmer's hash and clean it down and there's multiple ways to do that so a few videos on that will be down below I'm also gonna link Pedro's grow rooms Instagram profile and YouTube channel down below as well as he presses a lot of hash rasen so if you guys are interested in learning more about that that's where I learned this double bag technique my phone just made a noise guys I'm not gonna redo it we're keeping it also don't forget that links to everything you see in this video there down below included the coupon code so if you're intrigued by anything check those out you want to help me out please just leave a like if you got a question or a comment just drop those down those helped so much and that's than that we're gonna see you next week for a video and I know I'm gonna go take me a dab of this hash resin peace out guys [Music]", "uIG-mBThhV0": "hey guys epicenter Brian here hey today I'm going to start a sequence of some tips for you guys now some of these tips are gonna be for new users some of them are going to be for everybody this one happens to be for everybody and we're going to be talking about the drain tube and that's where the water comes out when you do your defrosting of the chamber okay and most people use a bucket like this to catch the the water and the big thing is you want to make sure you get in the habit of emptying that bucket every time you defrost okay because if it builds up you also run the risk of having this one catastrophic thing happen to you and every single one of us have done this once and that is if the drain hose is actually sitting in the water when you open the valve then it really causes problems and I'm going to show you exactly what happens okay then I'm going to show you a little device that we're going to put in line with that that is gonna help prevent that in the event that you mess up I've taken the the rack out and the wire is just sitting in there we've got a camera here that's gonna catch that and we have a pump running over here and right now I'm just gonna go ahead and turn that pump off and we have a good vacuum doesn't really matter what the value is but this is what happens okay so normally you'd come over here to open your your valve and I'm gonna just kind of angle this a little bit so you can see what happens in this hose and here we go oh you hear that we just had water shooting on into our chamber that's probably enough let me just close that but you can see what a disaster this has just caused now that water has sprayed and gotten on all of your dried food in there which means you have to rerun the bat but it gets even worse if you don't clean this bucket periodically then that could be some nasty water and it means you're probably gonna have to throw out all the food that you just did okay like I said this has happened to everybody once and you know that the only thing you could do is is open that Valve slowly and and look to see if something's coming up that hose but the easiest thing to do is just get in that habit and go ahead also and install something like this it's super cheap insurance and I'll show you what's involved alright we've installed a couple of these fittings let me show you what it looks like so with two of them you see that the hose remain straight of course it's in the bucket of water right now and I like the way this particular part works out you know you can get something like this in plastic at any auto parts store but it's gonna be a y-you know it'll be shaped like that and you really need two of these installed to get enough air flow so that so that the vacuum can't pull up the column of water up that pipe okay so the cheapest way of course are with the plastic ones but anyway I decided to go with these I like the way the the hose lays and you know it remains straight and everything they're not cheap they're stainless they're about twenty bucks for a pair anyway if you can't find something that you like and you like this idea I could probably sell you a pair just get it get in touch with me you know you can go to our website and send an email and I can arrange to do that for you so anyway we're all set up we're gonna do this again let me just turn off the pump real quick okay now over here we're gonna open this valve up and here we go okay and like I said you do absolutely have to have two of these or it doesn't provide enough air to keep the water from sucking up the pipe okay so that's about it you see that that works very very well and really prevented any kind of problems so hope you guys liked that tip and that's about it for today for the epicenter comm i'm epicentre bryan signing out", "jL2d3Ib6pZ4": "hello there snake people I'm grant Smith from kept snake conservation and I've been thinking a lot recently about what type of content I can produce that's going to be beneficial for you guys as viewers I haven't been creating that many videos recently but it really is a format that I like to work on it's a I enjoy creating content and I like making videos and so I've been thinking a lot more about what it is that I can create that's going to really be beneficial with CSC Facebook page recently I started a group I linked a group to that which is a group called Western Cape snakes and as part of that group there's a little short question there's just two questions and ask people why they here and what it is that they want to learn and most of the phone calls that I get and most of the whatsapp messages that are received and many of the answers on that group were about snake identification a lot of people want to learn how to be able to spot what it is they want to be able to look at the snake and immediately assess is this dangerous is this not do I need to be concerned so that really got me thinking of what well you know we've got so many snakes it seems to be a real common question so I thought to myself well that sounds like maybe a really good Avenue to take so I think in the beginning I'm going to focus on snakes that you're most likely to find in your kind of everyday home or recreational life so when you are walking the dog or in your garden you know what are the snakes that you might find in those situations and one of the main distinguishing features that you would need to look at in order to identify it with some confidence and so with that being said the snake subject of today's first video and that is the harmless and cute and just generally all-around good guy snake the snake eater [Music] right guys so let's get started here are five steps to help you idea slug eater number one size more often than not if somebody phones me and tells me that they've got a baby snake in their pool or in the garden then my immediate response or reaction is that I think that it could very well be a slug eater slug eaters are really small guys they don't get much bigger than about thirty centimeters then max arted around forty three centimeters but that's quite uncommon so there really are small little snakes that's you know the size of a ruler based on that alone you can't identify the snake obviously because you might have a smaller cape cobra you might have another species that's only just hatched that looks really small but with a little bit of practice when you start recognizing the snake and recognizing that this is actually a full-grown snake for that size then that is something that you could use so especially if you find a group of these snakes together because sometimes because of their small size they will be they are able to live in habitats close to each other so if you've got a number of these small snakes together in the same area then you're starting to think hmm maybe that's not something else maybe it's a slug eater but of course you have to add that feature sigh to the other features number two to tone we're talking about the coloration on the side of the body coloration is definitely never ever hot and fast way to ID a snake they can be incredibly variable and it's something that you've got to be very careful of you don't want to convince yourself I look I can see those colors I know what it is and then it's something venomous when you think of something non-venomous but with a slug eater this is a really nice feature that I personally use especially in the beginning to distinguish the snake and something that the more that I look at it the more that I realize that it's then it's quite a distinctive feature of the slug eater so if you look at the side of the body it's not always the same color the coloration on top can be quite different in different individuals but there's there's a shade there's almost like a 2-tone shade along the side that extends all the way down to the bottom of the body so there's actually more than two colors there but on the side you've got this to turn kind of coloration that adds to your slugging ID number three the underbelly now this is distinctive of the slug eater but of course you're not always going to see it in many cases people tell me that they've caught a little baby snake and it's in a glass jar and a Tupperware and immediately I can ask them to send me a picture of the underbelly because that that yellow stripe underneath the snake is incredibly distinctive so that's something that you can look out for but I don't recommend that you pick a snake up trying to see the yellow underbelly because it could not have a yellow underbelly and then you could be a little bit of trouble number four to barcarole icky so this like it is of a consummate a buck roll icky so there's a terrible accident the the way that it draws up into a little spiral like that that is not unique to the slug eat only there are other snakes to do it but it has been commonly thought to be a diagnostic feature of the slug either but to be honest it really doesn't happen that often in all of my time I think I've only ever seen two slug eaters actually doing it so it's really not something that you can rely on to tell you if it is like it or not and there are also other snakes that will do it like some of the whip snakes for example I will also roll up like that but of course if you've got the snake is showing that kind of behavior along with some of the other features then you can really start to tick those boxes and think hmm this could be a slug eater number five location this again is not hot and fast but slug eaters tend to like places like compost heaps and Ivy hedges places with dark and damp humic soils probably because in those habitats you have an abundance of food sources which are smells and slugs but also because you get that kind of latent heat that is being emitted by the degrading humic matter that I think makes a really nice place for a slug e to regulate its body temperature from again this happens regular basis but I'll get a phone call in the corner tells me that they've got a whole bunch of baby snakes that they're just found in their hedge in their Ivy hedger against the wall or something and immediately that tells me that that is most likely going to be a Slater I don't tell them that's the slightly is over the phone without having seen a picture because you never know and you don't ever want to assume something when you've got a potentially venomous animal on your hands but over time and with experience I've started to put these things together and started realizing that in general finding lots of baby snakes in the ivy that it's most likely it's like either just because of the location because of that of their habitat if we recap and we look at the five things that we've said that can be used to identify a slug either if you if you come across a small snake that's in a compost heap or that's in some ivy or something like that and you notice that it's got a yellow stripe running down the belly or if you maybe take a picture and you can see a little bit of close-up that the snakes got this to turn coloration any combination of these factors the snakes quite small as well but it looks like an adult snake then you can start putting two and two plus one which is five together and making your deductions that this could very much be a slightly - it's not the end of the story because without practice you won't necessarily have the database that has all of these features ready for you to access so in time you want to be able to actually eliminate what it's not and if you can look at the animal and eliminate that it's not a cat Cober you can limonade that it's not a puff adder then you could also go quite a long way in making sure for yourself that what you're seeing is actually a slug eater or it is actually the snake that you think it is that you are doing right guys and those would be the five key features that I would say is a good start for you to look at if you're wanting to learn how to adios like either just as a side notes like it is really are one of the most harmless snakes that we get they eat snails they eat slugs they suck them down hole they don't have any teeth really that we have to be concerned about you can virtually you said that they have no teeth even if it's like eater does try and bite you it's not going to hurt at all instead they will go into defensive mode and there are the wrap themselves up or what they'll do is they'll actually regular around really quickly and they will start to mask on your hand which is really stinky it's really an it's a brilliant defense mechanism because it works and your hand or stink for quite a while afterwards so just be aware of that but there really are awesome gentle calm snakes and they're really fantastic to have in your god and because they they do serve an important ecological role in eliminating some of the pests or at least controlling the population numbers of animals like slugs and snails in your garden right guys and that is the slug eater I hope you guys enjoyed this it's like I said it's something new that I'm trying if you did enjoy it please like this video if you'd like to see more snake idea videos like this then please subscribe as well comment down below and let me know which snakes you would like me to help you identify the most thanks again for watching I will leave you with some clips of this little guy", "qXkLhOZOIQA": "thank you and so I just will start by saying how glad I am to present some of my work over the last 10 years on see specs up an exhausting and today I'm going to start by very briefly talking about the evolutionary history of sea snakes mostly focusing then on the diversity of sea snakes in Australia and endemism and particularly focusing on why west australia is so important for 4c state biodiversity both on an australian scale and on a global scale then I'm going to talk a bit more about they're just there species-specific distributions the fact that they're incredibly patchy and that there's genetic and direct evidence of very restricted dispersal that might account for these patchy distributions and more importantly what that means for conservation particularly in the light of evidence of population declines on some West Australian reefs which I'm going to talk about at the end so if you don't understand this tree it doesn't matter this is a molecular dating phylogeny all you really need to know from it is that it's been dated with fossil calibrations oh press the on button and the true sea snakes are at PMI just go back the true sea snakes are up here this is all other advanced snakes terrestrial and basically there are very young derived radiation and when you look at that more closely the most recent common ancestor of the truth true sea snakes probably lived about five million years ago which is young from on an evolutionary perspective true sea snakes have two distinct evolutionary lineages are much larger lineage butts mostly in tarifa mostly occurs in Southeast Asia its most recent common ancestor probably evolved around three million years ago and then but then the other main group which is mostly reef associated in which I'm going to be talking and focusing on okay focusing on today the most recent common ancestor of that probably lived about two million years ago it's a much smaller group is owned two genera nine species and all of them occur in Australia and a lot of them are endemic to Australia so focusing on this group this little tree here is a mitochondrial phylogeny basically describes the relationships among species and all the branches in this phylogeny have really strong support so it's a well resolved phylogeny for the moment I'm just going to show the distribution of different species in this group so there's two really widespread species they occur all around Australia also in New Caledonia and possibly also in your guinea there's the two basal species in the group also occur around Australia and also in Southeast Asia and then as I said there's five species endemic to Australia and they're endemic to West Australia focusing on the olive sea snake so the olive sea snake is the most common abundant sea snake it's the one where people go scuba diving on the younger on the Great Barrier Reef this is the sea snake that you see its distribution was previously thought to occur from Shark Bay to the southern Great Barrier Reef in Australia that's the most commonly described distribution but when you look at the phylogeny and you get samples from Broome and you do the genetic data the samples from Broome actually form a sister species to the olive sea snake and then when you look more closely at the morphology it turns out that this snake is actually quite different from the true olive sea snake when you go to the historical record in the russian journal of marine biology there were someone who described off broom this other species apis yours tenuous and up until and when people go scuba diving off room they say they see that of sea snake but actually it's this other species its previously only been known from forward snake sitting in jars in formalin somewhere in Russia when you go to Shark Bay and you get samples from there and you put them into the phylogeny go back it turns out that it is actually a really different species people call it the olive sea snake but it's actually a species that was also described from Shark Bay but commonly not recognised of the species and it's not even the sister species to the olive sea snake so the point is that a long West Australian coast where people talk about olive sea snakes basically what you're seeing a really distinct species that are evolutionary quite distinct from the olive sea snake that occurs around the rest of Australia and they're also olive sea snakes apparently described from other places like Coral Bay along the coast I've never been able to get samples from them but hopefully one day we'll and it makes the question of what species are actually occurring there so focus in a bit more on the olive sea snake just on interspecific intraspecific genetic diversity this is a haplotype network basically a haplotype is just a unique genetic signature that individuals have and it shows the relationship amongst individuals and all you really need to get out of this is that the Timor Sea reefs which are in purple here have much higher genetic diversity than the Gulf of Carpentaria or the Great Barrier Reef and the pot there's really strong population genetics structure so very little gene flow but I'm this right large regional scale and this is also true for nuclear microsatellites so now looking at other different species but I will worry about that and looking at different species the turtle headed sea snake which is also the basal species in this group it's a known distribution up until recently was basically just on T more serious the southern Great Barrier Reef and New Caledonia when you look at a a tree of haplotypes basically you get the same pattern as for the olive sea snake so basically highest genetic diversity on Team war series independent dependent of sample sizes Africa water and lower genetic diversity on the southern Great Barrier Reef and in New Caledonian the same strong genetic structure and microsatellite show the same pattern so what I'm trying to emphasize here is how much greater the genetic diversity is on Western Australia reefs compared to the rest of Australia then in the last few years I've got samples from what it looks like the turtle headed sea snake from Broome and the first thing you notice is that the broom haplotype is really divergent from all the rest of the team or see reefs and New Caledonia samples there's more than two percent sequence divergence between the broom sample and the rest of the Australian samples and two percent sequence divergence is kind of like a gold standard it's not a diagnostic feature but it's a gold standard that might distinguish two different species when you look at the snake it looks like the turtle headed sea snake I haven't actually seen it in the flesh I only got a tissue sample from this poor little beach beast that washed up on cable beach and similarly from Shark Bay where their samples at the West Australian Museum it also is really genetically divergent from all the other Australian samples so the emphasis here is the really strong genetic divergence along the West Australian coast which i think is completely unappreciated until now so now I'm just going to focus in on a little study that's relevant to the west australian story but it's actually taking place in New Caledonia which I've done in collaboration with Rick shine from the University of Sydney so basically he takes annual holidays in New Caledonia sometimes he goes there twice a year he goes snorkeling on this speech outside his hotel and on this other Beach just across in the other Bay and he's caught in pitts tagged over 700 in these two study sites in these boxes and he goes back annually and recaptures them and he's had 1500 recaptures and no 1500 captures 713 recaptures and out of those 713 recaptures only on two occasions were the snakes in different Bay's than where they were originally tagged so in all the other times snakes I have strong filer petry two bays and this is just like just over a kilometer apart and there is continuous reef connecting those two study sites and this is got males and females and it's true in summer and winter so it's seasonal and across both sexes this strong site fidelity so I've done some genetic work on the snakes that he's been capturing and I screen microsatellites 470 snakes from each Bay there is significant differences in allele frequencies at microsatellites between these two so-called populations and when you put them in a bayesian clustering analysis you get the multi loans locust genotypes from one bay are significantly different from the other bay and so basically snakes within each of these study sites and more closely related to each other than they are between study sites so the file up a tree is actually resulting in a genetic signature of restricted dispersal so this restricted dispersal the larger scale studies that I showed you previously also show restricted dispersal but I've never had samples on is such a fine spatial scale and this obviously leads to potential implications if a local population goes extinct and this restricted spurt dispersal is true at other parts of these snakes ranges is this popular our population is likely to be replenished by dispersal over ecological timeframes and I should point out that in case you don't know sea snake Tracy snakes or give birth to live young they don't have larval dispersal so basically snakes swim to their new location so now I'm just going to talk well a tiny bit about Ashmore reef to finish to finish up so a Schmo reef was pre or has been described as a sea snake capital of the world and the reasons for this is that over the years there's been records of seventeen different species of sea snakes from Ashmore if and surrounding waters the the most the earliest historical record was from 1926 which is just one of those natural history records where the author says there's more than 100 snakes from at least six species were caught with relative ease in 1972 there was a dedicated survey for 14 days at Ashmore reef and they caught 367 snakes from 11 species in that 14 days and apparently saw many more which they didn't capture and between 1994 1998 McGeeney estimated that there was a standing stock of for 40,000 snakes at any one time at Ashmore Eve so in 2002 I did my first trip to Ashmore if and I was there for 10 days and I just dedicated searching and I caught 125 snakes from five species and critically two of the three species endemic to asthma reef I didn't find despite intensive search intensive searching then 2006 McGeeney he's been doing continuous surveys there he was there for 15 days he only caught 28 say snakes from three species and then in 2009 Zoey Richards and some collaborators where they're doing other surveys but also recording sea snakes and they caught three or four three snakes just from one species in four days in addition to this there's been a lot of evidence or anecdotal information about sea snakes disappearing from Ashmore reef so last year I went to Ashmore reef on the air on national guard industry and customs vessel and did dedicated surveys so I did 50 kilometers of mounted towing all around nashville reef more than 15 hours in the water as well as scuba surveys and sites where they were sea snakes were previously known to be highly abundant and boats surveys across the reef flat and basically I just I saw 46 or port 46 snakes from just one species the olive sea snake which is the most common and abundant species on reefs in Australia and these snakes were all captured in this one part of a shmore reef so there were no sea snakes anywhere else on Ashmore reef so to put this in a context oh so the next thing to say is I'm not going to be able to tell you why sea snakes have disappeared from a small reef I have absolutely no idea but I'm going to put it in a broader context of the Timor Sea reefs which we saw pictures of which we see better pictures off earlier today and basically so Ashmore reef is an emergent reef there's neighboring riffs karti hai burner and Scott the three species endemic to this region two of them had only have only ever really been recorded from Cartier from Ashmore and hibernia reefs and they haven't been seen since 1998 so there's a small caveat to that which I'll get to in a second and the third species also occurs at Scott reef and party Arif and I did see that in 2002 and it has actually been recorded in 2007 but there's no documented records of that since then but I'm not saying it hasn't been seen them just because not many people go and servos those reefs for sea snakes in 2009 or sea snakes were assist on the iucn our criteria and the team will see snakes these two are now listed as critically endangered and this species is listed as endangered and this is also under Australia's epbc but just to make things interesting the other day I went to the I've been equipped when it went to the west australian museum and last year someone deposited one of these two critically endangered species apis yours folio suami in to the our west australian museum collections and this particular individual came up in a trawl it's not clear from the records whether it was a fishing trawler or whether it was a research tool from somewhere near Barrow Island where it's never been previously recorded so I think it just highlights how little we know about what's going on with sea snakes on the west australian coastline and whether this is whether it is just a vagrant individual whether there's a whole a huge population there somewhere and I don't know and the other thing to say about this is that so there have been these incredible declines on Ashmore reef and anecdotal evidence that sea snakes might have declined at car to your Island but interestingly as far as you can tell based without rigorous surveys this is less the case from Hibernia and Scott reefs and what's potentially interesting about that is that Ashmore and Cartier have been marine protected areas since 1980 but Scott and hibernia heaven and a sleek Luke pointed out this morning Scott reef was really heavily damaged by bleaching in 98 but these roofs and Ashmore apparently far less so so and the other the other final part of this story is that most of these sea snakes have very similar life histories habitat preferences to the turtle head of sea snake that I was talking about in new caledonia so this would at the possibility exists that they also exhibit this extremely limited dispersal particularly given the strong population genetic structure that we see over largest spatial scales around Australia so don't speak the big the question what sorry what where that Ashmore reef will be recolonized by sea snakes any kind of time scale relevant to conservation so basically just to sum up sea snakes they were very young radiation this group I've been talking about is less than two million years old those Australian endemics probably evolved in the last million year in six you on Ash Maurice West Australia is very important for sea snake biodiversity I think we don't appreciate its importance and there's direct and genetic evidence for restricted dispersal that potentially influences the ability for population to recover and what we don't know is pretty much everything else detailed species specific habitat distributions and abundances dietary requirements habitat preferences the thermal tolerances of adults and juveniles detailed reproductive ecology to what extent coral reef degradation effects reef associated species what kind of protection would actually protect species from going and from declining for example we have no historical detailed historical habitat data from Asheville reef to compare current data to and we don't know why these sea snakes have disappeared from asthma reef so I just want to thank the many many many organizations people who sent me samples over the years and people who funded me and questions you", "sPmYbM5yAIk": "[Music] okay so it seems like it's working I have your copy we've just been chipping away at fine [Music] even French you do your part of that actually put it on post this [ __ ] Frenchie let's say [ __ ] he's the quasar ambassador alright so tell me what tell me what's currently in here okay in here we currently have lava cake derivative a wedding cake Afghani I mean they're all empty now but and then double sour OG super Sour Diesel and purple cookies okay all together takes a second but I think once this thing gets pumped in yeah I should have brought more I didn't realize that you really need to put my 20 grams in there 20 grams I think because I brought about 15 so I don't think there's enough instructions for the quasar be like fYI I really feel that it might know is the chirps I guess I know some of the raw line is very chirpy because we don't oxidize it we don't care it traditionally yeah I think that's what everyone's smelling no out of the Terps yeah yeah so you're getting a lot of super Sour Diesel and palms again Lego jump in yeah it gets gets that gets my teardrop yeah yeah yeah that's awesome I love it me too I love this machine I like what you're saying the 2j like bringing the about the this will give me back to the different types of rosin oh yeah this is take taking away from the the newer yeah okay I'm so when we when we do the with the cold water hash especially when it's not fresh rose and it's that our traditional a flavor it most of the time it comes out pretty stable I've been very stable yeah super stable but but that's laughs but that's cool guys yeah so this is your hash rosin then huh it is but it's not what we make for Kelly hash so Kelly hash for hash rosin is made from live material fresh frozen live material we're pressing what we stuck in here I wish I'd showed it to you but it's our raw line so we have two lines that Kelly has we have a press line in a raw line so our raw line is just we don't cure it traditionally we cure it in a vacuum freezer so it never oxidizes so what that does is it preserves the tur profile and that's the whole point of our raw line is for people to enjoy the terpenes whereas our press lines are people to enjoy the CBN and they Ridge and the hashing profile in the hash she entertained so that's where they're different and so what are you pressing it on we press on wood boards and we use and oh actually we literally press on what words will we put plastic in between so your using like a prep no no we do a little bit of an old squee do the friend she was with glass bottles that was hated water yeah no I mean this is what we do is it's a lot of is artisinal and I mean some of the labs that I work with get annoyed at me because they want to you know mechanize the process more and use presses like that so when I see what you do they're like dude we could totally you know you do 50 grams at a time that's it no we could do 500 a time no no it's MIT and it does destroy it the end is I mean the the fact that it's artisanal and the fact that it's so idiosyncratic to each different strain specific and different size trichomes you really have to treat it like a little baby you know I have to baby the but if you want it to be the perfect representation of it you have to really treat it right every step of the way I taste it really good but I definitely taste that the hash the how a machine chirping machine I taste a little like kind of blueberry dream okay I'm still a dream that's awesome but so what what's specifically happening when you when you take that what look like dry sift right yep and you press it is it creating a better flavor is it create like what makes it in what ways is it better and why not well so look I mean why is rosin better you know it's preference i it is preference someone say it's a look when you're dealing with even the most premium hash and we haven't talked about 710 labs but we have to if we're gonna talk about hash so 710 labs based out of Colorado originally now in three or four states including Callie one of my top companies I have listed as you know that I want to I can take my hat off to put it that way they're doing an amazing job and they've done an amazing job from the beginning coming in from the solvent world - right no they were solving this from the beginning yeah I mean they do so they drew butane now as well but their their hope I think in the beginning you might be correct way off my knowledge only goes back three years with them so honestly my only knowledge is like - yeah yeah I heard from Colorado when they were starting to make waves and but but yeah they're they're they're premium product that's made with fresh frozen material it's testing on average between 80 and 90 percent total cannabinoids which is incredible but that product is uh it's selling for one hundred and fifty dollars a gram yeah so it's just a different thing but that product I implore you not to smoke it in a quasar is smoking in something like that you know and and that is the difference you know and and again going back to the differences a little bit between rosin and cold water and why and why and what it comes down to plant material so within hash traditional hash and and and in cold water hash you have retained some of the plant material in traditional Moroccan dry Civ taged it's around seventy sixty percent in cold water house currently it's between forty and thirty now with live product like seven ten what they do and want some of the higher-end it's just seven ten right now really where they're making premium level cold water hash and they're getting a single source single source eighty five percent and above they're using fresh frozen material and again they're getting eighty five all indoor - and it's and that only has what ten percent plant material and that plant material is like strictly like a little bit of lipids and not much so you know the point is that at every different level you can consume the product differently like we have perfect examples in front of us you wouldn't want to put 20 grams of rosin and a quasar it just just just wouldn't rip me and it could but it lends itself to smoking with a little bit of plant material which is so it's a better smoke with little plant material yeah and this is a good example but the best example is you know where hair isn't a puff guy you wouldn't want any plan that's here none no in fact it's a ya know one you wouldn't know you would never smoke hood you can but you're gonna have to clean yeah but um yeah so for dabbing and that's the whole idea behind dabbing is your your accessing or behind rosin and hash crosses your you're accessing the dabby market you're getting your product to ninety percent total cannabinoids and no plant material really just lipids and fats and so on a daily basis what are you doing um I don't smoke so much anymore okay I'm uh got in my pocket here I'm a t-shirt man now so yeah and I'm Dre I hate to admit it but I'm doing anyone between 1,000 and 2,000 milligrams a day so I'm doing a lot of tincture but but yeah tincture anybody's welcome to it just popping just drop it in on yeah I'd say a whole drawerful is about a hundred milligram fifty milligrams just like that just like that mcg only Hashem only and where do we have a line coming out of this as well different company than Kalahari tastes like a plan now of course it's very strong you see an effect more of a body high it's like an edible but I've actually found it to be better than a lot of edibles cuz you metabolize you metabolize a brownie in a cookie one way but you metabolize an oil slightly differently it's slightly quicker you know MCT oil person specifically and specifically is very bioavailable so you actually absorb it very quickly so I have that's kind of where I've come to the conclusion on the difference where I feel between an edible and a tincture they're similar so when people ask me like is it like it takes time like yes it's like a tincture but I found that even you know edibles will get me a little bit more mom down tincture gives me energy I don't get a lot of couch lock and edibles you can't really time it that much no yeah good good hash of the ball I don't care who you are though let's put you on your ass happen before they did something you metabolize it so slowly and yeah back when they were on the market like the edibles I grew up they got 500 milligram or a thousand milligrams entry into the into cannabis right so you have people who are like what seriousness is usually pretty heavy its legal like let me eat a cookie and that person just like whole white-knuckling holding on yeah but it is relative in person a person with edibles than it is smoking like I have friends they can smoke as much as I can but they eat 30 milligrams in there hi I need five six hundred milligrams to be satisfied I need a thousand plus to actually use don't so it's everyone's body breaks like that differently so when you're ingesting it's far different but but I find an interesting so you're saying you don't smoke almost at all anymore like you don't like the ritual to taste the flavor I smoke my children let's be clear I still smoke still addicted I'm a Spaniard smoking since I was like eight yeah it's so bad but it really is true no so we're really were smoking quite young so anyway I still am addicted to the act of smoking I truly do enjoy it but I just smoke a chill oh I smoked the little chill I'm not that biggest why do you smoke that chill I'm all day long no literally I'll smoke maybe a half a gram on a big day but usually a quarter of a gram a hash so it's probably 20 hits in total over the course of a whole day and what about you like what what are you like are you using the clock I mean it's a sense it depends what I'm doing and where I am let's say you're at work if I'm at if I'm at work I'll take dabs because it's a little quicker so I'll dab the hash yeah yeah and but I mean I also I like smoking the hash with flour a lot I also smoke by I mean Spanish are you doing tobacco I do once in a while but I can't smoke tobacco anymore you know my lung flower done all makes I can't smoke a joint without hash like I have to always mix my hash in my flour in fact Cali hash is releasing in three weeks a complete line of pre rolls that are infused all strain specific on the hash and the weed side and we're gonna have a lot of fun with that and we've signed on with some I can't name who it is and all these people we sign we potentially have some new new some involvement with some really active NFL players in the space and some of our new investors are musicians so yeah so we're gonna be doing some launch parties and some stuff with them and hopefully using their Instagram and social medias to really push the product yeah exactly yeah they're all I hear a lot of they are and some of them have been in it for a minute I mean the NFL players are very much involved I mean were ya know I did an event where I had kissed em Osgood who was a wide receiver it was basically opiates cannabis and like sports leagues so I had my friend Kenny Florian who was in the MMA talk about like what him and all the other MMA fighters went through with like being handed pills and stuff and then kasym was the same thing with NFL where like the doctor is just there like here's the bottle of pills slap on the ass like go home when you're like addicted like Brett Favre and the fact that you can't smoke weed the hypocrisy of that you're basically creating addicts it's like sanctioned high level addiction like people who will need the most pain meds during their career and then those things are super addictive and this is where tincture because you can't viably say to someone that smoking is healthy and do it for wellness because you know it's smoking its carcinogenic so what I would that's where I'm very passionate maybe you disagree I do okay yeah all right so there was this guy Donald tashkin or is he's a pulmonary expert at UCLA and he was fun his research was funded by NIDA which was basically NIDA is UCLA but night as sole mission is to prove that like drought-like drugs in this case cannabis are bad okay and his research proved the opposite and this study was basically people who smoke joints regularly and his control group was people who smoked three joints a day which is like a lot of weed carcinogens like these aren't people who smoke like one joint or one Bowl hitted right so that's his study group and then what he concluded was that statistically those people have less likelihood of getting lung cancer than someone like who smokes nothing cigarettes cannabis so whatever is bad and carcinogenic is you know in the wall that is offset by the soul there's a net positive interesting and it came out UCLA I'm yeah I'm inclined to believe it all right all right I'm gonna go back to smoking no I think that's that's one part of it but like what I found with the tinctures is that it's just more efficient like we're smoking right now 15 grams of hash no we're good it's like hash gluttony it's roughly 10,000 milligrams of kind of fatty pork and drinking exactly teachers get to you quick though it's just more visual yeah I are tinctures are bioavailable because of the MCT and stuff in about 20 minutes so you feel it in about 20 minutes especially if you put it sublingual I definitely want to start experimenting with teachers okay great yeah well get you some all right so you're giving props to the 7:10 guys and I totally forget what you were saying about them so because you so this is an example of someone you respect so they're not only doing they're not doing ice water hash from my level on a cure level they're only doing live ice water hash so it's not directly competing with my company at the moment but at some point I will be doing what they're doing and and I just I disrespect what they're doing it's inspired me my hat's off to them I hope they welcome me in the market who are the guys there who are focused on the solvent list their main team is out of Colorado I do not know them there right now training their team up in Oakland but the Oakland team apparently it's creating really good stuff already so yeah I just I'm more familiar with their products and not their management but um but I but they're coming yeah they're they're doing amazing work yeah that's why I think it'd be cool to go be like hey hey - I'll come apprentice with you for a couple months yeah yeah his facilities in Oakland it's always that I he's in Maywood I didn't even solve unless steps out of me would seem him better for him does he live down here yeah yeah yeah I've always a lot of respect for burner and everything he's done I met him you know I think twice cookies is a great example of someone understanding what was going on way before everybody else and executing on it impeccably my hat off to him a hundred percent when I head off for hiring the do to run the solve unless that was a good choice yeah you know it takes passion making hash is passion it's art so you have to have passion okay I love that I'm gonna go pick Jim up and like 45 minutes an hour your daughter yeah her preschools literally my works it's a lot of hard work to do it because I mean if you do it I like to do it by hand you know washing my hands Wow you know that's the best way you argued the best quality I feel like it isn't you know but thinking a scale you know hard people have these avanti washers you know so once you would like to try one of those to compare it how big are those I think they make a few different sizes but like I would you know make a few different size it's a 3 cubic foot I seen as one of them before I've gallons yeah something I've seen them pretty big too I'd never had one in person up you know yeah but I see them being used a lot of washing up currently we're using bolt bag washers 20-gallon washers nothing special I use a twenty gallon bags as well yeah bags we use just we basically set up our whole lab get twelve of them but they're all done in tandem so there's six stations yeah and we think we've done it so one person can run six days oh that's awesome man I would love to see that scale yeah that's crazy some photos we're sending it all up right now so it's an app we started this company in California City but we learned really quickly was that California cities in the middle of nowhere and no one wants to work there so like even I didn't want to work there so like we couldn't find anyone to run that literally so that's funny right now we're downtown is that literally in the desert you know Palmdale well I went to the Mojave yeah yeah like the town of Mojave in the desert like it's like it's 30 more miles like up in the desert like a copy see no it's I think it's a population of 10,000 and you know this is hopefully not offending people from there but I mean it's literally like it's the only thing going on there is meth and you know I think it's where like I think the Crips or something and they hide people you know it's like we're gangs people so yeah it's the local police force I met them it's one guy that you could pay off really easily I'm sure in math but it's trying hard I mean you know they're really build our environment - yeah most importantly for us we need a controlled environment and and fighting that fighting that that dry heat was terrible yeah if you're gonna see like hash labs popping up in deserts ya know the drier environments in terms of types of hash it's it's better for life like you're dabbing hashes it's better for life so like four hours for crumbles four other oils and so forth it's you're trying to pull out all that moisture but with a traditional hash while you are trying to pull out moisture you're not trying to like completely decimate it of all you know you it's like like a good flower do you want your flower to be dust no think about this all the hash traditionally in the world where was it made rif mountains Lebanese mountains Nepalese mountains Afghanistan mountains shit's always grown in the mountains and it partly and made in the mountains and partly it's because weed grows better at altitude you get much better weed growing at three four thousand feet from from from surface from from sea level but the other side of it is when you have humidity in the air you're allowed to retain more humidity in the tricone they don't dry out as fast and that's our game like my game making traditional house because you want to cure the game is trying to cure it but not too much so the whole game is trying to get it right at that perfect moment and that's the art form if you can get to get it there what is a perfect cure for me usually it's five days after it's been harvested trimming around that time and then giving given I have that materials right that in there yeah not long because like if I get a product that isn't supremely oxidized when it's come out you'll naturally oxidize it in the pressing process yeah but I do have clients or does Adam in that they want their stuff to be black you know and if it's a little brown there's a market for that yeah so they want it fully oxidized because you know the blackness or the brown is like he was saying earlier it has nothing to do with the strain or any of that very much very little has entirely to do with trichome size and then oxidation oxidization but so what are what do they like with something that's oxidized that much I think because it's traditional and there's more CBN in it yeah yeah so that's like anymore how she proved for 150 yeah it's also like yeah wines great but like do you remember do you remember cannabis oils from like early 2000s and before there weren't a lot of like color can of oils a lot of a lot of the lighter color was a real marketing ploy you know and it's just it's an it's an older trichome for the most part and you know if they created this thing where people just naturally believed like when I say people I'm usually the market at large younger demographic know the market at large there's definitely a concept especially in America absolutely that any product that is not oxidized is better and that's kind of part of what we're trying to dispel the reality is not that the reality is even in some cases they're harvesting the plants prematurely so the trichomes not even oxidizing the plan at all I mean forget milky everything and then you're getting something that that doesn't have any of the cannabinoids you want it will give you some really pretty high that's like right in the head and they kind of give me a headache and yeah I mean you want CBG I'm happy cuz we wanted to develop because most of you can always start a CBG and you want them to develop into their constituents I mean you want it to be th CV you want it to be THC you want it to be CBD you want it to be CBN and it doesn't get to have that it doesn't get there without oxidization the products are high CBG they are okay and high and that's giving you the code flaw or the very and yes that's not good sorry that's the app that's giving you like a cerebral it's almost like a ton of caffeine or something in a way but it's more like it's me I don't like it at all personally I mean I have CBD isolates you want to try it yeah it gives you like a rush right in the head I don't like it you guys would though you want to try try this terrible thing like no I'm good but again like I'm just scratching the surface as we all are I mean even Frenchie would admit you know we all are and now we're able to apply real science spectrometers and things like that that's something that I'm so excited and they and then and really do testing you know in blind studies and really figure out what each kind of morning is doing if there's upwards of a hundred unique molecules and cannabis called cannabinoids well we need to figure out which each one is doing how many cannaboids are there is plus 100 plus and yeah what do you what they do that's the effective embody I read about one that I've never heard about recently that they're studying in some university where they actually put it directly on a cancer cell and they saw some you know a negative effect to the cancer cells so yeah there's been anecdotal entity evidence for a long to the THC variant it was but it was one I had never heard of it was like THC v6 to I have a friend who did cancer research at UCLA and it was stem cell cancer and basically that they they looked at all you know you do your testing through a library of 30-plus thousand chemicals and of those 30-plus thousand like the couple that showed promise one was cannabis and he wanted to do more research because they were using synthetic cannabis and it had bad side effects and he was like if I could just get my hands on the real thing was you'd eliminate the bad side effects but keep the benefit in using sativex or Marinol it's either of those two it wouldn't have been anything else we can get him on speakerphone right now yeah and that's another thing you just kind of segue into which is the full spectrum entourage effective very important you know yes and we're full believers in that in the hash world and in my tincture products you know we advocate for everyone to be true believers in the full spectrum because that's what you lose with the isolate and that's what you know a lot of people don't realize what's going on with like the CBD I systems are going around in all those isolates and they don't most we don't even realize that most CBD product they get is hemp derived and more often not not even Hampton the state most of those hemp products that are even being grown not a BCC farm so they're not going through the same strict testing that the real cannabis industry is going through you know so it's a completely even ballpark and then not only that but most of these people aren't being told anything okay so they think an isolated and they're in a lot of these people too that take a CBD some of them they're afraid of getting stoned but they don't realize that if they take a ratio that outweighs the psychoactive the THC yeah what the CBD they're not gonna get stoned they you know but they're still gonna be able to benefit from that entourage effect you need the uncharged effects so what are your thoughts as you look at solvent extraction like all the trends and innovations like one of the things we're just talking about was like making product clearer right yeah I mean III internally there's something that I just don't like about taking something that is crude and full of carbon and dirty and made in a violent manner and then ultra processing it and a purification procedure to make it look something that it's not you're not selling I'm not passionate I have no opinion about this whatsoever but yeah I mean I really think that the entire you know solvent world is just selling something I personally never consumed never would would consume and I've never sold it I have not I've been in this industry in 15 plus years I've never sold a solvent product he used to sell them for me but technically it wasn't me no I don't believe you just throw you under the bus no he doesn't either in a big way I mean we we did our things back in the day to make money but the reality is I truly don't I don't I've never consumed wax in any of its forms I never would it doesn't taste good it's made really in a bad way it's always dirty there's always stuff in there and back of your head like you just know like okay and then when I did the molecule thing looking under the microscope that's what brought it home total II different yeah it does not look like a trike or my hat on my plan I want to believe it all right yeah a lot people that like they want that just quickly before I forget for the pin the whole panel here you get none one or two thumbs up for the quasar starting all the way down on the left thumbs up okay [ __ ] two thumbs Hey oh and he's up his mr. negative so he'll tell you right away if he doesn't think something's nice yeah I mean it's nice well honestly one thumb all right new it no I mean it takes too much there's it's not practical for the average person it's a sesh device you know and to be fair I don't think we got it going in its best yeah good I think you got to get more charcoal on top yeah and and for your average consumer not only not practical because the amount but your average consumer I mean like when we have stuff in store for you only have grams in store cuz that's that's a market that's not really yeah and even even if that dispensary were to start taking off you know their margin for them it's still not in order to great for it go well have this as your sesh device for those rare for your like smoking community with a totally like it knowing that scenario gets you from Cali I was like an everyday yes yeah you hit on that for what Frenchie does with it for Cali house purposes 100% a tool but it's a party tool it's 20 people you literally need cuz I'm even I'm even overwhelmed on my lungs are closing up you need like 20 people to enjoy it properly which is what friend she does so tastes good though yeah once it gets going nice is nice I mean compared to this this guy you get a two thumbs it also needs a little more coal than normally I mean it's the first time we're using this thing like normally with the tobacco and to be clear he wouldn't give two thumbs up to anything in his life so like you know it's pretty much good I think it's great yeah you definitely needed multiple people you can't be doing this virus I mean in case you could like maybe so anxious you gotta help out maybe someone just plugs it like some money flew in from downstairs I can't walk down the street with it well I guess I could see someone plug in it once a month or something at their house I mean that just smokes hash and every time they come home and they just put a few coals on and get her going again all day Sunday yeah you can easily stop watching football matches and this is an airtight as well I don't know I can safely say I'm stolen now guys I think so what I don't even remember who I was talking to but it was like doing this and having to work all the cameras and like set everything up you're not working like watching you on Monday night I was like how's he doing it cuz yeah yeah they really beyond a point there okay and then I get super high any time I ever do it so I'd like to hand it's like a to what he's like I make hash but with two hands behind my back cuz he does oh he has a partner right what he does the dry and wood trim yeah so you want using flour currently he can get his hand right of the trim for R&D but everyone else was like and the shitty mix is still amazing so like the fact that he's making another just trim yeah more respect right for sure I mean I I get some pretty decent trim and I do have people are taking out the fan leaves so you got people that are being a little cheap audio and throw out a bunch of families in there I just watched some families that was holding on to and yield it pretty good if you're honest man as like two pounds of families but you'll did okay but I don't know that's my beats in the freezer if some food grid yeah yeah it's obvious we're gonna practice just the craft party yeah of course that's guys quarters that's all I can really do it I tried the best I can with what I have well we're building out the lab right now if you want to join the team well I I do honestly really mean for sure yeah Monday yeah for Gavin looking for Allison money on the job fair on Monday okay and yeah man let's set up an appointment and I think I told Peter like I just recently quit my job to chase this yeah we're literally signing the contract next week to confirm the lab we have a thousand square feet plenty of space we have all the equipment already know to talk more you know yeah let's get together next week and talk about it absolutely I'll be open now I'll get your email and your big you need hash makers it's good have a little muscle I can shoot up down like 40 pounds right now though well it's actually with this labor so you might gain it back oh yeah I got a muscle there you go I'll put football back in the day yeah yeah like yeah that's why I like it I like the hash making part and yeah does this stuff start like that's awesome white mustache Hey yogurt keep acting it's my go sell him on the yogurt but not have you sold us on solvent and small-batch handmade yogurt hands stranger gravity gravity strained it's a personal sugar my company from the old old techniques that they learn strands in it Wow I like even like because it's so good that's awesome a lot of your free kitchen space and you want to get spits on easily right now I mean people are Spain to get in there for them torii gate yeah wow that's cool man wow that's great I love that that's happenin it I need like a 12-pack yeah I love that it's happening and then all these food industries everyone's going back to the artisanal craft doing craft beers taking a big chunk out of market for sure it should be about then you find out that like I'm a free market person if someone wants to capitulate and you know so they're brand you know retire or maybe start a new brand why are you talking to the give that thing a world they're like two to five million dollar you know markets and stuff like that it's just too small for them to throw their R&D on so they go to the craft fairs and they're like we love your product we see it on the shelves and that you know small geo-located area and it's like instead of having our own in-house Rd working on a chocolate or whatever we're just gonna buy this company of this company of this company is an interesting model on their part like why but the thing is though too is you know in some sense if you have good management you can somewhat throw money at things but throwing money at things doesn't always work so a lot of these brands that get taken over on one hand I think a lot of them are gonna fail out but on the other hand it's like do they really care but they fail out they're just gonna buy another portfolio of brands you mean the people who bought it I think the people who started roaring or like that's someone that built it they know how to build you killed my baby yeah back back to the radio mic like a yahoo buying a tumbler and it's basically like we're just buying them for the software development challenge yeah don't really care about I think there's less of that with consumer product you know because to them as long as they're meeting their bottom line and they're taking that brand because to them brand means more than quality a lot of the times so I don't think it really necessarily works that anything to a craft is like a lot of craft people tend to want to pay attention to the sourcing of the product and so I feel like some of them they find out so-and-so got bought out by so-and-so it turns them off a little bit of that product really what kind of what what flavors of the yogurt also drives a big seller sour cherry came mulberry a walnut honey than their seasonal flavors so the seasonal flavor right now it's summer peach which is harvest over the summer quince is coming out in about a month we just actually turned thousand plus pounds and to preserve so that will go out and in a few weeks there's their savory yogurt so shallot [Music] Oh so my question before was something like this can you like does it keep it all or yeah yeah if you take the heat off I feel like three days from now I could light that bad yeah yeah that's what I was saying you could totally just sit on it now yeah with like a rosin product yeah but granted the cool off period that you're not smoking when it is cooling off you will be wasting a little bit cuz you're not smoking and some of it has to burn away to cool off but other than that you could totally just chill on it you know come back to it when you want to come back to it even like I would even mix it up a little bit before you go back at it right yeah yeah I mean I guess your kid is great since you can come back to and chill on you don't necessarily have to have 20 people so so that coals are still going right yeah they're in there yeah is this meant for you can use and we're just using if they either dying down it works Ferb yeah I've seen paddle tobacco's like the only time yeah for traditional like all their marketing videos traditional yeah oh just works great for what we wanted for yeah so in the average one this is the normal go ahead is that clay thing yeah like I see people trying to torch the glass yeah I think this is the yeah this is the second generation okay you could you just know someone would try to yeah I'm sure but I'm also sure they have they probably have a design patent okay job they have a mechanical patent around it that's that's the idea yeah if you could heat it from below just with a padded email sort of the situation you plug just get the bottom stuff yeah and then it would just be get bigger hits yeah yeah cuz right now the problem that's happening is you're just it's hard to get the heat going through all of the hash cuz you're just getting the top cuz you're the only way that he gets there is by sucking so this is work to work a lot we're lazy this set of time we're too lucky email though good too much work no though actually an e-version of this is would be very smart well that's what I'm talking I'm assuming yeah you are talking to them no I I'm I want to design one yeah you should yeah and can do your own brand yeah genius too fast all you have to do is use a normal coil but do it at the diameter right I mean you can then it be hyper portable practical like people like think of people like okay like charkh like coal which like drops on the floor and sets my house on fire and to be honest what you would want to do is you'd want to make it so it's one of those motor Universal hookups it's like a it's like a camera type hookup I thought that I forgot the name but Pelican nails come with it a lot of those big nails coming with it so that way yeah sure you could do your box and sell that too but if you make it more Universal and people already own that and buy your product yeah yeah no I I hate when companies do stuff where it's like super proprietary right so even you know I when i go into dispensaries I talked to the bud tenders about like the pods because you have different look but here's the thing about the pods versus the pods can only for the most part use something that's very liquidy so the super high quality oils yeah that's the standard thread yeah yeah but the thing about these these are actually better than the pods because you can get a thicker liquid in there and not only that can't sleep estimate for price so the benefit is to make you buy their stuff because people are inherently I don't want to say cheap but frugal right and so they if someone already gets sold by about tender on a battery and they go to a dispensary and they say I have this battery I need I need a cartridge they're gonna be like oh here you go and if they go well what about these and they're talking about the seven tens and the five tens then it's like oh no those won't fit your battery you got to buy new batteries well how much is a new battery and then all of a sudden they're buying this person's it's all about cornering your customer and forcing the like in their opinion you know that's what it's about that's at least my perspective and the outside looking in on that's what I think they're thinking they want to force the situation they totally do but but they're selling likening it's not I thought the whole reason for pry up because of my head I'm like who would ever be like we'd love for you to controller proprietary pod and for us to be on it versus like why would we want that when we can just stay on the open source so originally they tried to do a proprietary thing pax was trying to do it first and they tried doing exclusives with companies that didn't work out because all they really had was design time it was a Chinese product and there are other pod companies that were there are also cartridge manufacturers that were making variants of it and then it came out into the market and that's why eventually you saw no real exclusivity in terms of brand you started seeing people had nothing to do with pax at all you know like what's their names dizzy right but so now you have to but I don't think it's true but it's not truly proprietary it's it's reprise to the point of most other companies aren't doing it and you know this and so you're setting up a situation where well I guess dizzy pod won't fit in a pack correct correct yeah but you're setting up is right so you're setting up a situation where you already owned the battery so now you're you're you're in the crossroads of do i buy another battery to get something else if i really want on yeah right pretty yeah yeah I thought it was based on the fact that those bonds are better than eze we're saying they're not and then it's kind of like why the hell would anyone never know I mean I'm sure I'm sure like I'm sure somebody could get the manufacturer to customize this a little more to what you can customize these two but they've gone so far in terms of how to customize these because if you pay attention to like how the so what's in here is that this is a robbery so they're like oh I see you do hit solvent of solvent Lissa's yeah products you know you're not as know but I use this for when prices that I can't really it's not something I smoke every day like this is probably three or four weeks right some people but you might like what do you like about live res the taste of it yeah but this is made with the sauce and cannabis terminals and it's actually the cannabis drippings are liquefied with thank word I think we're stoned enough yeah I'm super high I have to go move some food to take Gemma and you do you have a daughter apparently yeah every time I do that it's it like can I pick yeah so this is the products he's made so we're gonna interview him next week and sit down with them and talk about interviews that formal work it's not the right word we're gonna get high together and get high together and see yeah exactly see we appreciate converts oh my god thank Peter for connecting us yeah that was the point man I wish I had brought more hash I can leave you with some but we literally put all of it in there every come back yeah and I came back on my head I was so so one of the things I want to do and what I did here is we have events here with like music industry people and stuff and we basically smoke them all up done I'd love to be part of those and so it's like just private events with like like last time me and my friend Jody from Fiddler's greens we're sitting here the passing Fiddler's greens loved it gold you know joints around the room there was a bond going around the room and all these people were like this stuff's amazing so yeah let me know when the next one is and we'll keep doing it yeah I love it the Hat we got to come with a cool name the hash sash or the sash yeah I had am totally blank it gets the solvent lists our with Peter like I'm the only every shown the only honest it's the salt in this hour that you're sorry I'm like oh my god I'm so high and then it's like and we're back with like the flower hour and it's like meet your host like the same dude who likes tumbles from the last stage to the next one super hide I'm like oh my god I have like eight more shows to go and that's just Monday that's just Monday I have a retailer and in Woodland Hills so you're a part owner of that retail trust and which one is it the shop it's called the shop the very magical we're so so imagining I'm not involved with that brand sister so is that near the refinery you know if Ryder is our dear friend Greg yeah oh you know Greg very well weird really different yeah we I work with him still we're actually doing a collab with his with his special weed that he's doing right now so we're building up a really good core team to [ __ ] take on the world you know I love it yeah I mean look to give you an idea this markets 1.2 percent of the general market pre-rolls or 35 percent and growing exponentially is insane on a month look at VDS analytics so tell you everything you need to know about what the markets doing so you know we're very excited to take Kelly Ashe to those markets because the hope that's right you're adding pre-rolls which is a super I gotta go so the whole idea was to go into a low competitive I mean living the passions that I have for making hash you know the financial economic side for me was always strategy and there was very low competition I had one competitor in NASA because Frenchy wasn't even in the market and so I said [ __ ] I've always been doing her so why wouldn't I just and that's how I've wedged my foot in the door I'm now in 55 retailers done that very easily I've just signed with three large distributors that are completely statewide and they're gonna put us in the last 350 that we're not in so you know and we've done it with very little resistance because it's only national and they have a very limited distribution and there's not many other people out there doing this level of hash you know it's like at that price point in everything so um so that was a whole ideas get your foot in the door that way and then off the back of that you launch other brands and once you have a brand that people like other brands or other other categories other categories when I say mature would be a product exactly and it's its pre-roll and it is full spectrum hash make sure that one's actually a different brand but but that's the only one the rosin the premium and the pre-rolls will all be Cali ash products and all our current retailers and the ones coming will all take it so that's you know that was that was the business strategy behind it if you will and that's how I convinced everybody involved to this point you mentioned 710 but who else do you respect and it doesn't just have to be hash like who else was my yeah well for any mark absolutely good question I mean a legal market a legal market alien labs a lien labs my hat off to them I know them they're really amazing people beard brothers farms has done an amazing job in the legal space yeah yeah I'm like you guys doesn't even begin to cover it like and they're really to the roots I mean there are true true true industry people yeah exactly they've been in this the game forever in California and their their advocacy is what I'm most impressed with their they truly do push the mark and and and and everybody here that everybody industry uses them so to get the real information and and not only that their product is good as well so them try men's game cream yeah they're pros yeah yeah I mean look it's hard though I mean I love cookies you know when I can get some sure bin skis is always you know good yeah the legal markets interesting no Wonder Bread obviously I think yeah I've seen some good genetics from a called Kings farm I ran across them like a month ago they're out of the desert flower company I have some really good cuts I'm never getting some I have been a dispensary a long time but like he's to go to strain and get like and faith for the names but like Hydra boys they had some stuff you know I concentrate they had actually the person I had like the sauce like they have this one cut called a seeded grapes that's really good you keep talking about yeah it's like amazing and it's it's acidic yeah and they're really on point was it you smart flour oh yeah yeah and do you prefer indoor or outdoor indoor okay he's a love 11 I love outdoor lab we know but I mean I like I like I like indoor like profile 3d robotics up so that's still natural stuff yeah but I mean I know I also personally know people that do really good but the reason I prefer indoor is you can just control it better you're at the women nature and an outdoor you know yeah drink wine this but here's the thing you know what that interesting expression actually really is more so than the outdoor environment giving it that most outdoor growers they're growing by seed everything most of them aren't doing it by club and so a lot of them are getting slight variance of Aries strange it's like one of the biggest things that people misconstrue with with cannabis is the difference between strain and phenotype they think just because something has the genetics that it's going to taste like that it's going to smell like that it's gonna look like that but the easiest way for people that don't understand that your swing phenotype to understand things is you have a child is your child 100% exactly like you know your child's of bearing if your child might be better than you your child might be worse than you your child might be slightly different than you but almost the same as you but it's never gonna be hundred-percent you to be you I got a clone you know so that's really a lot of the same that's a lot of the variance that you're seeing with outdoor which is I like and it's attractive but I just overall prefer indoor cannabis yeah and you well you don't really smoke flower I do I do i still enjoy like joint with friends no I'll smoke with him actually guys what I consider outdoor I consider a real greenhouse indoor though okay but if I'm in NorCal which I spent like the first five years of my career in California I was living in Healdsburg and I preferred the outdoor you know the fresh good greenhouse and does there's something to be said for the full spectrum of the Sun you know and and even the high HPS is and even your best dual traditional ballast system does not get the full spectrum but some greenhouses it's like there's such a huge variance in greenhouse quality like it's like some greenhouse you're pretty much outdoor it's not really a like a structured building per se it's like barely that the PVC pipes with the - yeah it's that that's why I like and then there you have your greenhouse a real foundation it's essentially like it's essentially an indoor building except for the fact that it has a glass or plastic roof and that is it so I consider that really pretty much indoor you know I know there's argument to that whatever that's semantics but at the end of the day I prefer something that's within a controlled environment or something that's just for you and I still gotta pick my daughter up all right now we have to rather yeah all right strong work team thank you guys", "LBd3nmFBEoU": "so of everybody has a so mash strawberry-banana bubble - that's the first run also had was a two and half ounces of uh smalls left so I'm running it twice since that's the last bit that I have and see how much I can get anyways got poured it back in the bag okay it's like a frosty or icy so people if you don't know what's going on with this you pretty much throw your weed in these bags put a bunch of ice and water in about half and half stir it up or spin it up with the drill whatever whatever you do and it knocks all the THC crystals off of the weed because the ice it freezes the trichrome heads and they break off and they filter through the bags and you get all the different different sized crystals and just all the good stuff comes through and all the UH all the plant material stays in the filter so yeah that's uh", "hSPbOSRLfb0": "okay so here we are here in a home in your mind II in a kitchen of all places we've got ourselves a little bandy bandy which is one of my favourite snakes so another name that you may have heard of them is a hoop snake so bandy bandy they go call because the black and white bones all up and down their body or hoop sake because you see the behavior is displaying right now that's like kind of a way of showing me or displaying a defensive sort of thing so yeah these guys are one of my favorite tanks that they're so cool they are mildly very mildly venomous but they're considered to be mostly harmless to us because of the size of their mouths but they're one of my absolute favorite snakes often these guys will display crypsis which is basically their play dead so snakes do maybe 3 3 behaviors fight flight or with these guys they do crypsis but he's pretty cool just to be playing around on my hand at the moment but yeah these guys are one of the coolest things so they're are nocturnal snakes so here it's obviously nighttime at the moment and they mostly exclusively live on eating blind snakes which also live under the ground as well so the cool little hierarchy then all these little underground nocturnal snakes have but there you are we've got ourselves one little bandy bandy inside the kitchen so I want to take you out into the bush now and you can go and have a happy life out there and we're all done have a good night", "rc6jM6zp9fY": "yeah what's up guys Luke we're coming to you from my home here in Southern California I just got back from a trip to Bali where I found a ton of snakes I'll share that complete video later but I want to share this experience right away I don't know how well this is gonna turn out but we're right on the shore here this is the ocean right there and we're gonna walk this rocky area and hopefully find some crates in between the rocks they're gonna be careful cuz there's a video like this it's a little bit difficult to walk and see where I'm going but anyway I'm gonna try and share the experience with you guys so you can see what it's like hopefully my lens doesn't get too you know covered in mist and stuff I'll clean it occasionally but I don't if you can see in the video there's quite a bit of sea spray and salt in the air how big as these things get they get about a metre and a half or a metre thick and 1.8 really 1.8 huh yeah okay you got one got one already we've been here what five minutes oh yes look at dad no he's moving over here yeah awesome is that so these things are pretty docile check this out the fight yeah so extremely venomous snake here but again very hesitant to bite they just don't want to bite people and it's like a lot of snakes you know basically you leave them alone they're gonna leave you alone but this one here you really have to you know step on it or really I'm gonna do something I don't do very often guys you don't see me handle venomous things very often but again these guys are super gentle and super Placid so I'm just gonna pick him up gently you can see here he's not aggressive I'm just gonna move them back a little bit so I can get more video but look at that huh look at that you can see the tail here what a great snake this guy won't really sit still it just sort of wants to go back towards the rocks I'm gonna help him out here and gently pick him up and I'm gonna move him back towards the rocks there we go deadly secret uh you know if you got big but they just don't want to bite you so again leave them alone they'll leave you alone all right again I don't like taking video like this but I got to share the moment that was awesome having a go right but my foot actually went across my foot super cool again these snakes you know they're deadly but you know only if you step on one and saying that I won't be able to see for a while here I'm gonna sit here until my eyes readjust and then I'm gonna go look for more well I just finished video and then as I'm sitting here I was gonna put my hand down so I get up and there's one right here you know that's one of those things you know make sure you look wait before you place your hands somewhere but a little ways gonna put my hand down right here right next to me and one just went by me as I was taking that so as I was taking that video with the light in my face one little he came right up the beach and you know went right by me crazy", "6j7OeSoYJEA": "hey you there welcome back everybody this time we're gonna be doing another hard press demo doing more hash as opposed to the other video I think was more flour probably all flour our member yeah I'm gonna go out to the sit room to write have the hard press setup and then I'm gonna show you a couple of things that I do maybe differently than the next guy and yeah I'll just take you through step by step it might not be quite as long as the other video that I ended up losing but it should still hit pretty much all the points I think so let's go check it out alright so I'm gonna do a hash run obviously two yellow bags like I said before we flip them inside out or there's a little funnel hmm forgive that on camera here so that's how I just pour some hash in there the bags are flipped inside out you know I didn't get this thing on fast enough to see it starting with about 40 grams of hash and they think I'm gonna put it all in about ten bags and then so we're gonna press about eight grams at a time yeah we're gonna fold these over to you can watch them fill in these okay I actually if I'm pressing with the hair iron I do prefer to make like a little patty first mm-hmm and like a pre squish flatten it out and then put it in the bags I think that works a little bit better for the hair iron but it's just a little bit faster because we're doing you know more than one press shut this thing heating up I don't think it's all ready yet still got a couple degrees to go you know you can just just press them do the fantasy this is what I've been doing so I don't like that bag open so we just give it a quick heat it kind of seals the bag up just like so so that it stays flat when we put it in there ten of them will get a squish wrong for you how I squish this thing's a little bit warm that's what he's able to squish them it's not really even that hot yeah is it it just turned this thing on it's obviously still got about 70 degrees to go I can still put my hand on here so it's not even 120 degrees yeah still working though this couch is really good though so if we let me show you what I do because I know people have been talking about blowouts happening with these bigger you know five and 2010 presses if you don't you know kind of ease into the pressure I know if you got like a hydraulic or pneumatic press it's a little bit easier to kind of punch it in there but this is like a little bit of a learning curve I imagine and we're back I'll tell them of the envelope so that this flap isn't gonna open up on me and like I said you can probably fit a lot more in here too if you gave it that pre squish you know I usually take like a piece of parchment paper and then all you know flatten it out with the hair iron and just get it into like a brick form just just warm enough like if I was smoking it not really too getting we'll just to press it up you'll fit more in here and I feel like yeah it's a nice like no blow out feature too if you're having blowout problems I feel like that having it all together is a good start to have with this thing it's got two plugs I know they have a one plug version now but I I mean I can go back and probably get them to do a one plug for me but I kind of like it because I plug in the heat element first and then I can just leave that on while it ones up takes about 15 minutes I'm just sayin it's about 15 minutes and it looks like we're still about 30 degrees shy so we'll be back when that warms up all right yeah so I got them centered in there again it's about eight grams with the other plates I think we can get up to like 12 or more grams with the single plate on there this thing keeps on bobbing up and down I'm just gonna go I think the temperature that we got it's about 161 I'd like to go about 180 but you know it'll be 180 in a minute we'll see what the difference is again this thing takes about 15 minutes to warm up I just turned it on not too long ago yeah so the problem people are having with hash is that it's blowing out because the hash can be a little bit too good I mean if you have anything really over three stars with your pressing four and five six star even it's going to end up squirting out the seams in the screen you know before it gets the adequate amount of pressure to keep the bad stuff in and the good stuff out so you've got a kind to ease it in and with the hard press there's just you know two buttons so you've got to stop it by yourself and that's like a double tap so I'll go in to where the pressure just barely gets on it like I'm not hearing any of the sounds of the press actually happened I'm just getting it there and I'll let it sit there for like ten or fifteen seconds and then I'll go in for another 15 seconds with all of the pressure so it does it is a kind of a learning curve you kind of gotta hit it at the right time so after a couple tries we'll figure it out it's not that hard but let me show you what I'm talking about [Applause] like that and as you can see nothing's really terribly sweating out yeah a little bit starting to go now we're gonna go in with the rest of the wait and see what she knows and that's what we get looks like no bull outs that was five stars is like between four and five star smells really nice I know if you're getting that yeah it's really stinky for sure thank the pineapple was amazing yeah so again that was four or five star if I would have just went straight in on it it was definitely one of like pressed out these little scenes on the side of there and if you're not flipping these bags inside out that's going to be it's going to happen a lot more easily too so we'll put that off to the side make sure it's centered getting that it's definitely getting hot now my house again we're gonna do the same thing see it's fairly starting to come out it's like the juiciest part of it just kind of want to get it to separate so that the harder stuff kind of coagulates together makes it hard to press out the big screen there we go you can tell these are kind of I mean when they're done you can see they don't look slick sticky or glossy you can see the screen kind of separates from it instead of it being kind of gooey like this in the middle so I mean you can always come through and press these a second time and I promise you you'll get on what what I would do is even double them up so like you come through the second time we just put two of them on top of each other like that and then just stick it through the machine I'll show you another way that we can get even after doing that we'll get even more out of them on a different day it's kind of you know if you're trying to get your bend most bang for your buck I'll show you how to do that too it's a different time if that looks like a really fat squeeze in the middle there and we're gonna finish these up and we'll be back for the collection I'll show you guys how I do that all right all right and we're back you got all these pressed out here see just that distinct and we're gonna collect it up and I'll show you how I collect them up I just let it sit here for a minute it's about sixty degrees in here so it's not super warm not super cold but you know just not super warm is important and after letting sit see pretty much just all comes off to the one cage and I mean this is and that is definitely the thickness that I would have this being it's a nice color but as this gets is gonna be really thick this big yield and that's gonna end up darkening up as we get you know more on there now there's a little bit left over on this one Karofsky put it on over here put a little bit of hand heat yeah you really don't need any of those expensive rosin collector glass presses or whatnot this is pretty much how I always do it works really well it was really fast [Applause] it's usually the edges even a point one but this is nice and sugary it's gonna look like flip that one over good handy and again this was a pineapple express bubble hash it was kind of I guess full-spectrum mush obviously the 70 and 90 wasn't in there there was a little bit of five-star 120 in there but mostly it was a four-star like the 37 you and the 25 you like I said thicker this thing good next one goes this is a by far like one of my favorite Rogers right now she really holds the flavor I mean the the parable expressed with some generals of Terps of just bananas I mean former concentrate you make actually haven't done dry sift of it yet but I'm willing to bet that it would jump or the church would even asked flippy-flippy it so importantly at the edges I guess you want to make sure to get it all in one pool and you don't want it too cold like I said about sixty degrees seems to be really nice 65 even if it's too cold it'll be too shattering and if it's too warm you know it'll just melt a little place and stick all over the place and I feel like people would other things people use their like a cold stone so you could take you got like a cold cutting board that's made out of stone he and put that in the freezer for a little while and set these on top but again I feel like that gets it way too cold and I also feel like any kind of freezing like sticking stuff in the freezer is is just it's freezing it then when you take it out all the condensation that's in the room is gonna stick to your rosin or go in it just like you like when you get out of the shower so if you're gonna use any kind of like cold things to make your rods and hardware I would use like the UH fridge for sure seems really dry in there and it's not cold enough to cause condensation usually unless it's just a you know unless you're doing rosin in the bathroom after you take your shower all right I'm gonna go through these really quick looks like this about it sat on it and so we're left with this giant like torpedo here it's like almost a mask look up in the sky it's Rosen man yeah sorry yeah so oh my god that's off camera so I just folded the sides in again whoa when I you know when I if I end up breaking this down will you know I'll make grams will repress them so there's nice and thin and you get that nice gold color I can manipulate this right now and you know and essence start whipping it up and in turn like just the nice gold metallic color it's weird how that happens to it looks like almost like metal but I just want to get weight on this it's a nice little slobby nice little slab or nasty it's always exciting to smoke definitely Rosen episode hold on alright so it looks like 25 grams it's not gonna let me oh well well yeah it's about 25 grams least if I could figure out another way to get the skill on that I don't know what that is as far as percentage its end up being you know 55 between 55 and 60 percent I'm guessing we're gonna go in for another press - that is definitely not all we'll get out of it I bet I'll get another final 5 grams or so out of the second press and then but then coconut caps or caramels or pretty much anything you would put in Jenny had a bowl or anything you would do with oil that wasn't gradient sticking all right well I hope that helps you and your rosin experimenting I will probably go back inside and smoke on this here I'll take a little piece right here let me show you what I was talking about like if I sit and I pull it like Laffy Taffy it's better with the big little piece but I want to keep this stuff kind of shattering and I think this is gonna this is a butter Apple smoke this right now another piece just like right now but it tried it you know it's Laffy Taffy it up real gold got that gold gold look I mean it really looks like metallic gold to focus flash it's kind of making it should make it clean I wish it would focus when I do that ere we go I'll stay focused right there like those gonna focus right maybe it up but if you can do a big glob of it I swear it just looks super reflective and nice I'm gonna go poof on that that smells amazing be back in a second all right let's try this again is a pineapple slab alright alright 25 something Lance the dabs we took all right I just wanted to thank don't make it right now okay so we're back inside and let's see I weighed that stuff for you and I'm sure I put that in on the way out just to make sure that you guys saw and this is I just took a small portion of that and you know check it out for myself I'd end up falling off my desk - shattered a bunch but that's all right flash really is yeah stuff is really really really white life is really making it the dark of it as you can see once it's pressed out it's pretty pretty nice it's a little bit warmer in here now so at least it'll be work better to work with we'll take a hit off of that I ended up doing the math too and we got about 64% on that first press I was pressing a really really low temperature if you saw so I probably could have got a teeny bit more but I'm always going to go through and I'm going to do my little trick to get I don't know probably get between 5 and 10 grams more off of all of that stuff and then we'll have that either the coconut capsules or or some caramels or something cool like that but other than that I hope that really helps some of you guys out that are maybe having problems with blowouts with your hard press I really tried to cover that well like I said it's it's kind of a learning curve but once you get it it's really easy I would definitely look for them to maybe implement something like that maybe not I guess that's fine the way it is yeah I wanted to make me take a Bangor hit too [Music] Oh then we'll put it on there that way it will end up knocking it all off again I could with this way looks like a decent dub I'm gonna bust out the nerd glass in cycler bang your hip banger still looks pretty good let's see this thing uh takes like I mean I'm still had about a minute of this poor old banger if I want a nice really chirpy hit I don't know that's kind of a big one Wilson definitely want to taste a really good one that if you guys want more milk make sure to check out a couple of the other videos on the channel always Melton ups a good hat probably about it and if you have any questions feel free to leave them below down in the comments or you can check out the information or playlists it's where I put the most frequently asked questions and terminology that we use you in community so we'll wait a minute for that I was thinking about making a new playlist to kind of one just for the hard-pressed it seems like it's a pretty popular subject so I want to make sure that I can direct people to that playlist so I'm gonna maybe take a look at that right now I'll probably still leave the other videos up in that playlist but maybe better like that and we still got about 15 seconds all right pineapple express rosin made from bubble hash Cheers oh yeah nice and smooth oh god that nailed us routines crazy crazy retention on that thing we've always had and get in here while this thing's still kind of hot just wait back here whoo yeah that was a brain clear forgot what I was doing for a second definitely nice smooth smooth flavor on that definitely got the pineapple coming through I could have probably taken a a bigger one than that but that's still really rocked oh my brain I'm definitely happy to see that rosin has come around full circle it's it's it's part of people's cannabis experience now and that's awesome I think it's a great alternative it's safe for everybody to do and it can be amazing if done right so that's about all I had to talk about I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll catch you next time", "4Jwgy80QvrE": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

good chance he'll have tried astronaut ice cream astronaut ice cream is like regular ice cream makes it completely dry it's made using a process called lyophilization but most people just call it freeze drying freeze dryers are great because they let you dehydrate things while letting them maintain their shape best of all because no keet is used to dry the items there's no caramelization so foods retain all of their flavor while astronaut ice cream is fun there's lots of other uses for freeze dryers you've probably heard of aerogel but if you heard of cryo gel it's the same concept but uses a freeze dryer to make it a materials first turned into a gel and then frozen and freeze-dried the ultralight foams this produces are useful and everything from cell culture to super capacitors rocket engines solar cells and more for scientific use freeze dryers are a great way to preserve samples and things like proteins that can't be stored wet but also can't be heated to dry I needed a freeze dryer for my research so I thought that this was a great opportunity to show how these cool devices work and how to build one I tried to make this as easy as possible so I went with materials that were easy to get on Amazon or at a local hardware store and can be assembled with minimal tools a freezer only has two pieces the drying chamber and the water trap as water leaves the drying items the water crap condenses it so it doesn't go into the vacuum pump that runs the system I chose stainless steel and acrylic vacuum chambers for this as their convenient size for small samples and will be easy to control their temperature I'll be using a 1/4 is the drying chamber and a 1 gallon chamber is my water trap in hindsight I wish I'd just gotten 2 of the 1 quart chambers or reversed which ones I used for which part of the machine I think the 1 gallon was a bit big so keeping it completely cool was difficult and I worried that there's too much air space so some of the water won't get trapped either way the water trap needs to be deep cooled and to do that we'll be suspending it in some DIY cryo fluid which we'll be using this two gallon pot to hold to insulate everything I've got some styrofoam sheets the Chamber's come with almost all the plumbing we need which is one of the reasons I chose them but to make them fully functional we'll need a 1/4 inch Union a 5/8 inch splice or barbed ends some 5/8 inch tubing with braided reinforcements finally we'll need a rotary two-stage vacuum pump I have a rather nice pump but some of the roben air models can get to the correct pressure the thing to keep in mind is that you need a really deep vacuum for this to work properly the chamber pressure needs to get well below 300 millet or ideally around 100 millet or the reason for this is the physics that makes this machine work when you look at the phase diagram for water you can see how at different temperatures and pressures it's in different phases in this lower part you can see that if we decrease the pressure and temperature in the chamber water can go directly from a solid to a gas in a process called sublimation this is why freeze-dried items retain their shape the water is a solid and acts like a scaffold holding everything in place while the item dries by the time the water sublimates away the materials dry enough to support itself so when choosing a vacuum pump be sure to get a pump that can go down to at least 100 Millett or you probably won't get that far because of gas in the chamber from all the sublimating water but it'll get you far enough for the effect to happen properly okay let's get to building and we'll start with the water crop the first job is to insulate the pot as best as possible to keep everything cold after measuring the two gallon pot and spacing it out so that it'll have the same amount of insulation on all sides I cut out the first piece of styrofoam I use this as a template to cut out more pieces until I had a stack then went up to the handles of the pot then I cut three more to act as the bottom with the stack prepared I carefully centered the pot on the first piece of styrofoam and traced around it before cutting out circle after checking the fit on the pot I repeated this for the rest of my stack checking the fit periodically to make sure the pot fits easily remember not to cut the bottom three pieces as those are going to be used as our bottom now all the pieces can be glued together to make this permanent I just used white glue for this because it's what I had on hand spray adhesive would have made this a lot easier I cleaned up any glue leaks and then check the fit of the pot while I was drying I cut out another piece of styrofoam to act as sort of a lid over the pot I measured the diameter of the large vacuum chamber and the inner diameter of the pot and marked them out on the styrofoam before cutting it out I also cut a small area out of the ring so I can drop dry ice into the liquid that will be in here the actual drying chamber requires very little work straight out of the box all we need to do is upgrade the gauge the little gauge that comes with it or cheap and Max out quickly so we need a proper digital vacuum gauge to see what if we're actually getting down to pressure to be able to attach it I added a 1/4 inch union I didn't film it but be sure to use high-grade on tape to make sure the seal is good otherwise it'll leak and screw up your pressure the gauge you'll be using is a field piece SVG three it's the same model I used in the last vacuum video for those of you wondering attaching it doesn't require teflon tape because of a built-in oring and so it can just be tightened on with pipe wrench the water trap chamber requires a bit more effort but it's still really easy to assemble first the vacuum gauge that comes with the chamber is removed then if I faint inch spade bit is used to widen the hole to fit our barbed splicer clean up any burrs and then mix up some jb weld and yes it really does need to be JP weld it's one of the few epoxies that's readily available and rated for vacuum work apply the Jaypee will do the splicer and then press it into place I'm using JB quick because I'm lazy and impatient but regular JB wild is preferred when the JB walled is dry the five-eighths inch tubing can be attached to this chamber and the vacuum pump with some hose clamps I ended up having to come back to these and add more jb weld inside the tubing to help get a good seal because it was leaking slightly vacuum grease would have been much better for this but I didn't have any on hand for those worried the vacuum pump side barbed is removable which is why I did this I'd never just epoxy a tube directly to a vacuum pump some last changes that I made later were to add a styrofoam box around the small chamber to help keep it cold so that freeze-drying items don't fall too quickly I would also throw a little bit of dry ice in there to keep things cold as things dry out it's okay if they warm up a bit so you don't need to top this up too often the last change was to add some weight inside of the cold trap and to use a little bit of string to tie it to the two gallon pot to hold it unfortunately it's extremely buoyant so without some sort of weight it tends to just float and not get completely covered by the cryo fluid okay let's give this thing a test drive first off a quick safety warning we're dealing with deep vacuums and cryogenic temperatures be very careful and wear appropriate safety equipment don't handle dry ice with your bare hands or you will get burned having had that happen myself I can say it's not fun just wear gloves you don't need much of a barrier but that little bit of insulation makes the difference between cold hands and burnt ones before we can fire this up we're gonna need something to freeze dry I'm going with a classic and started with some strawberries I got some fresh berries and then slice them up this is to help expose as much surface area as possible is feet up drying the sliced berries are then placed in a bag and sandwiched carefully between two blocks of dry ice allow for about an hour for these to freeze fully as those are freezing let's get the system ready first up we need to get the water trapped cold fill the two gallon pot with a large amount of denatured alcohol and then slowly start adding dry ice it'll boil vigorously at the beginning but eventually it'll slow down after a while things will get cold enough to maintain their temperature for a little bit to make sure the system requires less frequent tending I actually lifted the pot up and put a whole block of dry ice underneath this work to keep everything cold for many hours I was even able to leave this overnight without tending it either way it's best to tend the system for the first while just to make sure that everything is working top up the dry ice before leaving it alone for a while if you don't put the block underneath you're going to need to tend it and top it up at least every hour a quick note if you're lazy or in a rush and want your items frozen faster just put the bag in the cryo fluid for a minute or two everything will be flash frozen and ready for use very quickly when the strawberries were frozen I transferred them to a silicon mat that came with the chamber and then place them into the drying chamber close everything up turn the valve so outside air can't get in but gases can flow between the chambers and then fire up the pump everything should get down to pressure really quickly if your digital gauge isn't doing anything it's because the pressure is too high and you probably have a leak luckily these chambers are well made so the only real potential leak spots are the tubing we added and where the gauge is attached with everything running all we have to do is wait keep the water trapped as cold as possible over the next six to fourteen hours while the items dry if everything goes according to plan this is what you should end up with some perfectly dried strawberries that still have most of the shape since no heat we use to dry these they still maintain all of their flavor compounds in a more or less pristine state so there's no caramel flavor and everything is light and fluffy not chewy or bendy here's a comparison of strawberries dried in the dehydrator with heat at a freeze dryer the difference is really obvious an important note is how critical the pressure is if the pressure isn't low enough all you'll end up with is some strawberry mush as I found out on my first run when I still had a bit of a leak you'll be seeing a lot more of this machine in the near future and we'll be looking at all sorts of cryo gels and their amazing properties as cellular scaffolds cryo gel can be perfect for all sorts of cell culture techniques at some point I'll be using the freeze dryer and then the kiln to make some extremely light carbon phones so be sure to check back every Monday for all of that okay guys that's all I've got for this video if you enjoyed be sure to leave a rating and if you want to see more content like this be sure

here and the white cbg strained from alive and kicking still in this jar and to make things a little spicy i'm not even spicy just a little spicy i oh yeah spice it up i got well not just these you know we're smoking obviously out of the hemp wraps mango haze and uh brought this out you know a little i got some rosin left in here so why not coat the entire blunt with it on the inside so i'm gonna go get that started up and uh yeah see you guys at the blind [Music] [Music] cheers [Music] so [Music] so [Music] camera's pretty low on battery y'all so um if this does switch angles and uh quality you all know what happened the blunt outlasted the rest of the camera battery man once again guys this is doc's og rosin in there from honey butter use all the rest of it for this one and we got cbg flour in here the white cbg strain and some silent pressure that is an uh i believe yeah that was an indoor cup um you know once again not really my usual kind of cop but it was still pretty quality you know i definitely prefer much louder indoor but yeah we're getting big-ass clouds off this bruh and it's really smooth with the cb cbg flower in there this is about uh maybe like a two three gram blend oh [ __ ] y'all see me fooling just drop the [ __ ] cherry like a [ __ ] noob smh bruh would y'all like it on your uh you know infused rolls you know you like keep on there wax shatter whatever it may be let me know down below about a grinder there's the shelby keep on here but um like i said in previous videos when it comes to uh bless i like to hand grind my roll and uh yeah that's probably this probably number one reason why i don't have a grinder right now i don't really like pack bowls for myself as much you know also you're smoking flour or dabbing oh [ __ ] five percent left on the battery [ __ ] oh yeah this cuts out you already know what happens but man this [ __ ] tastes really good i'm not gonna lie the doxo g rosin wasn't really the tastiest rosin i've had but this it's going real well with the cvg flower and um you know the silent pressure damn me dropping that cherry made it canoe hella bad and we're back sorry y'all missed a little bit of the blimp but you still got most of it left here to go so so far guys i'm not really like feeling hella different with the cbg in there you know right now all i'm feeling is dumb ass lit the rosin and the silent pressure if i show some pressure this [ __ ] is really really nice um yeah once again i think honestly i feel like i could recommend cbt flyer at this point uh this is my third time having it and um i know i said i don't really feel much of a difference yet but i do like i notice it in my smoke this stuff is going down way smoother than it should be you know as smooth as you know my my weed is the silent pressure was already a really smooth strain i still expect to cough you know what i mean i'm still expecting to choke a little bit and i haven't even done that just yet you know but i'm taking huge drags out this hoe it's burning real nice and smooth man what are you guys favorite pairings with your morning smoke so right now i'm having a nice little waking big session and uh normally i like to keep a glass of oj out here with me i'm [ __ ] up a lot today guys you're probably not gonna see in the video but i'll drop this phone a lot but the camera died a lot of shit's been happening oh man that's a problem sometimes with smoking outdoors i'm like looking for a place to ash it and i already know like i could just ash it anywhere i've gone to the habit of like feeling bad with about whenever my ass drops because i'm so used to smoking flour and [ __ ] like indoors um and like i'm used to like being that guy being like bro you drop the ash on my carpet but not really like that no more no thoughts hit empty that's how it is normally for me in the morning i don't know about you guys my my brain doesn't really race at a mile a minute right when i wake up but it's normally ready to go like 15 minutes after we're pretty i'm pretty fast started when it comes to mornings especially if i can get myself up as soon as i'm up it's it's good but if i'm laying down it's bad doesn't matter if i'm awake i'm laying down it's bad i'm not going to get up world's not trying to cooperate with your boy this morning but it's all good oh my god i'm just thinking about how great of an idea that rosin was i was looking for a way to use all this you know it's not like i wanted to get rid of it but i do have a lot of things to dab on and it's just it's just like you know this this was definitely one of the [ __ ] purchases so why not say [ __ ] it and throw it down on the point too yeah i put all the rest of my flour in this plant except for this last little bit of the cbg flour here i honestly could fit this too but um i wanted to have a much bigger ratio of my thc stuff if i look on the side right there i can show you all at the camera so far but my catalina is just like waiting at the glass door just watching me finish up my smoke because she knows it's almost time for it it's not quite time but almost my cat has a thing about wanting to eat like as soon as she wakes up it's like i wake up at five ish every day guys so she's normally up around that time or earlier and she is meowing for food even though i feed her at 9 00 a.m every single day since she was a little bugging baby kid in this size you know that's just how cats are pretty sure i'm pretty sure dogs are like that too man my friends dogs were like really uh the begging kind for food but for those of you who are curious i'm actually more of a dog person i i prefer dogs more than cats i mean maybe now that kind of has changed but for the most part i still think i prefer dogs more than cash is that for my situation back at the time when i was getting athena it was easier to have a cat and even now is the easier situation to have cat we're getting close to the end of this plant here guys thank you all for joining me it's just been a nice cool man i've been pumping out the smoke man i hope it's not making that too much smell in the neighborhood but you know before the video ends do you want to take some time real quick to appreciate all our generous viewers and supporters here on the channel man thank you guys for making everything happen and i hope we can continue to keep on going man it's nice stuff man i can't wait to get this more flower like i said before guys i don't really buy flowers as much as before and right now it's actually kind of like a drought season in cali and then when i say drought doesn't mean it's all gone you know there's still some uh good flour out there but it's a lot more expensive a little bit harder to find that's why it's a drop because you know a lot of packs were stolen a lot of packs were burned out from the [Music] a little fires snack got in there yikes but um no a lot of [ __ ] has been happening with you know cali bud so it's just kind of you know it's just kind of crazy to me how different the prices are [Music] and that's why i'm not really paying them i'm only getting stuff that are that looks and will probably smoke exactly like i was i was smoking before at the same price so [Music] there's been a will it wasn't about flour who really likes variety and strains and well i wouldn't say i'm hella picky but when it comes to my own personal flower i am very picky with what it is if i'm going to share with other people not so much yeah personal flyer for me is personal flower don't bust it out for anyone else but me this right here is sheer flower so sadly i'm smoking sheriff flower for the personal flower that's all good all right probably gonna be the last few posts on this one here i want to thank you all for joining me and uh you know once again appreciate y'all i know to really talk about too much there's random [ __ ] dude but you know [ __ ] it sometimes i don't know what to do for these awake and make videos i ain't gonna lie to you and especially when you're this freaking faded if you don't have an agenda before you make these then that's all it is because i was gonna try to talk about the difference dealing with you know with cbg in it but at this point inside if i could not tell you boys in my honest op and you know in honest right being honest totally honest right now i was about to say honest opinion it's not an opinion right now but yeah total 100 honest being candid you know i'm saying there it is that rosin and sound pressure is kicking my ass there's about a half grab a rosin in here making this [ __ ] burn real slow all right it's gonna be the last hit here guys thanks for joining me please don't forget to like comment and subscribe all that good [ __ ] see on the next one p2 out you", "H_SQSgnugJE": "what's up everyone can can grow here with another bro Journal update so much to talk about today I'm going to apologize in advance if I'm jumping back and forth or ramble on I haven't had a chance really to gather all my thoughts but I didn't want to put this off because there's definitely a a a bunch of things going on in the garden before I get into that I just want to say once again I'm really excited about a bunch of the new subscribers welcome to the channel thank you for supporting the channel it really has motivated me to do more episodes and share more information both to entertain you and hopefully and more importantly help you as you pursue growing and on that note if you're watching this channel I'm almost certain you've watched many other awesome videos from different channels across YouTube and probably other platforms and I always encourage that I think it's great I've learned a ton myself particularly early on from so many awesome growers out there sharing their knowledge and it's one of the things that got me excited to do the same and if you are doing that and you're growing well you know good Anya and I hope everything is going well if you are watching our learning and would like to grow but they're just kind of stalling or you know not starting for whatever reason there's absolutely nothing wrong with that but I just wanted to take a second and tell you that the best thing to do is to just get started I think a lot of people maybe try and be as prepared as humanly possible and there's nothing wrong with that but at some point you can only be so prepared sometimes you just got to take the plunge and roll with whatever happens most if not everyone is not going to get it perfect first time out their first few times but the experience is what you can't replace and the only way you're going to gather that is to you know just take those first few seeds germinate them and and get going so I really want to encourage you if you're watching and you haven't started but are really itching to just do it and I'm hoping that between this channel and all the other channels out there we can help you avoid a lot of the challenges and pitfalls and help you be more successful sooner so today I wanted to talk about the you know the big reason why fino hunting is so important and as I was thinking about what I might talk about that another issue came up so let's start with the issue I guess bad news first we're looking here at my gorilla glue tent so to this point these girls have been doing great or so I thought and unfortunately today we've hit a bit of a wall and I'm still kind of undecided as to what I'm going to do and that speaks to what I spoke about earlier I don't care how experienced you are problems are gonna arise and the problem I've run into is it seems as though one at the at least one of these girls has her Mead on me and unfortunately it's pollinated some they're not all of the plants so that's a real bummer I say I'm not sure if all of them have been palling because I really haven't been able to go through every single plant but we definitely have an issue with a hermit plant because all of these as you can see are producing buds they're all they were all females but the first thing that tipped me off was I was seeing these these plants are four and a half weeks into flower and I saw a lot of swelling on the colonists which in and of itself isn't a bad thing I started to see some strange growths and and ultimately I've seen have found and all this was today really of it this wasn't overtime found some seeds so I started then to look for what had caused that and I think I've narrowed it down I unfortunately the plant that I feel has her meat on me was producing bananas or Nana's which are more difficult to detect than her meat plant which is basically growing both sets of organs but in separate spots so if you're a little clueless you know if you're not sure what I'm talking about don't feel bad it took a lot of research early on for me to understand you know and this problem this issue and I always kept an eye open for it fortunately it hasn't been anything I've had to deal with till now so let's try and go through this let's start with how I determined that there was some pollination so this bud here I mean when you take a quick look at it it looks like it's just it's growing fine but when you take a closer look look at that this one was really August you can see right at the top there sorry if it's a little shaky and see if I can focus here there you go you can see that is a seed so crazy I'm still a little shell-shocked myself because I had such high hopes for this run of girls I was really looking forward to these genetics fortunately I've taken some actions that may have helped that but I'll talk about that in a second but there you go that is a seed forming and you can see that I said these are four and a half weeks another way you can tell is that you see these pistols have already begun to Amber and that's very early on and generally what that indicates is that the plant has been pollinated and the pistols which is how it gets its pollen have basically done its job so that's why they're already dying off or ambering on you know browning off and start and will curl so when you look at this let me just left this on here so you can actually just pluck that off and there you have it once you take off the outside the bracket I apologize if I'm pronouncing that wrong it probably I just don't have that in front from me but we're not talking about two calendars but the bright bright with the outer shell here obviously once you take it off you can see this seed that has been forming and although it's not all over yet it's the places now that's how we determined I'm not going to go through any more but there are definitely more well maybe it wouldn't hurt to show one more in case you're interested but you can see here see on top here strange growth not exactly but because it is for me I see but you can see here see that is and here again if you're unsure you can just grab let me just show you another one here see these so you can see you just want to take a second to thank you for watching my videos like we you see hit the like button below if you want to support me in the channel please subscribe it's the best thing that you can do because I love watching the subscriber base of the channel grow it really motivates me to put out more videos and bring more great content if you don't want to miss any new videos don't forget to turn on notifications finally I'd love to hear from you use the comment section below let me know what you think if I missed anything or let me know if there's something you want me to a topic you want me to cover or just say what's up anyways enough about that and let's get back to the video [Music] sorry about that sensitive screen if some of the leaves touched it and actually stopped to the video but when you squeeze one of these they will be hard then just pull one of these off sorry I'm angling the butt but this were this so here come on focus for me in trouble here my hands all sticky anyways won't focus but anyway so there is a problem and the culprit who has actually that plant that I just showed you I actually noticed some nanners growing out of this blood and this bud here I actually think that brown growth in the middle was one but let me see I pulled those off just to inspect them and see if I can see some I haven't gone through the entire plant yet I just want to see if I can see any of the heard me growth oh wait a second there this check that out wait a second right there believable and I did not see it I did not catch it soon enough so you can see there so it wasn't just the nanners in the bud now the nanners okay so sorry I meant to explain that so this is what this is a hermit plant where here you have bud growth and here you have pollen sacks so they are growing in two separate areas so when I say that that's one I mean that's when I say that it's easier to tell her me plants when they are growing in two separate spots the other way which is more difficult and this plant seem to have done both is they will they won't grow in two separate spots like that but they will actually grow in the middle of the bud and I can't immediately see any examples of it right now but they actually look like they're yellow and they actually look like bananas they're quite small but they are what is generally what is usually inside the pollen sacks and they literally release pollen immediately so what you've seen those it's already started releasing pollen so they're in really lies you know my huge problem and clearly there are a bunch of these plants that have been pollinated as I can you know see clearly and it just would be in my opinion because I'm not breeding I'm not looking for seeds in my opinion one even if I grew them out it would be really poor quality but just because it would be probably filled with seeds on top of that I'd basically be wasting nutrients when I say wasting again that's for my purposes maybe there are others out there who you know would gladly just continue to keep growing it out for me I'm a little undecided but I am definitely leaning towards kind of just scrap and you know this crop and licking my wounds and just moving forward I don't have to make the decision right now although I am immediately going to get rid of that Hermey plant because I definitely don't want it affecting any of the other plants I have in my garden fortunately I have these kind of contained in separate tents but Paulin can travel and it's why I had the fan off and all the other grow areas grow tents sealed right now but I'm really and I'm a little unsure but I'll be definitely scrapping that that Hermey plant right there so if you have any questions again the purpose of this video was not necessarily to talk about Hermey plants or pollinated buds or those issues I'm bringing it up because it's clearly something I'm going through right now and I thought it might be helpful to at least kind of show you what to look for in case it happens to you and I pray that it doesn't but I haven't put together a ton of details right now so if you have any questions post them in the comment section I'd love to answer them you know and help you out or point you in the direction where you might be able to get the answer ok so that was the first thing the next thing and the main reason I really want to jump on today was to talk about phenyl hunting and why it's so important so forget for a second that we're dealing with this whole her mead and pollinated bud situation all of these plants are from the same package of seeds that I purchased from the same breather and there is such a wide difference in the bud structure even this early like I said we're about four and a half weeks in the flower and this is why you can have such different genetics so let me show you here we have a plant that is growing at least at this point very light and airy how can you tell well look you can see you know you can see the buds are not that they're not dense not very dense at all and all of these plants have gone through the same process right from day one they've gotten the same amount of nutrients same environment and everything and this one's you can see you can even just visually don't know if the camera video do it justice but it's very wispy very very you know when you touch it it almost feels like it's just the stem so low crazy you know and this is actually really this is the most severe case of you know in differences I've seen in genetics so it's not the norm but that's why I thought of doing this particular episode because I really can't believe just you know quarterly this plant is at least growing out so you can see and you know you can see all the airy pockets in the buds and just not dance at all whereas right now what was appearing to be the prized genetics so far in this grow right here so this plant right in the middle here I got these labeled and this is actually gorilla glue the plant in here number three and check out the bud structure on this you know you can you could just tell much thicker and this is still really early in the game I'm sure if it was grown out and I say if because I don't really know what I'm gonna do at this point but rivers growing out I'm sure that that would have just dead stop and just you know and would be a monster so you know same same breather bought at the same place same package that they came in and completely completely different he knows and that's what happens when you gross from seed that will happen and when you're fina wanting so what I've done okay so let's talk about this even though I've gotten this problem with the permit and pollinated plants I took clones of several of these I think about eight of them actually I took multiple clones they were a couple weeks in the flower so I think every two and a half weeks almost three weeks in the flower so I monster crop them but I cut those and they've actually rooted I'll show them to you in a second and I'm gonna be able to grow those out and use those as mothers so I don't even know if I took a clone of this but that clone is basically going to be useless because really it's just gonna go out the same clones are exactly genetic all right you were cut off again by the phone sorry about that looks like there's a limit to the length of the videos on this device but anyway as I was saying so the beach an exact replica this and I would not want to grow that out whereas this at least from what I've seen so far that I would love to grow out it's it's a little shorter so which is fine for me in the indoor environment so it's a little stocky tie there note spacing and the bud structure just really looks awesome to this point and just another example if you like this I mean this is there's nothing wrong with this either look at this so this bud tractor structure needs to be a little bit more kind of stocky and dense where is this one a little more a little pointy or low so just like that that's the same come from same plan unfortunately I don't believe I cloned that one can't tell for sure yeah I don't think I found that one unfortunately just trying to look at the number but you know that's a different blood structure altogether so many of you like me will start by growing from seed but when you do that if you plan on doing a perpetual grow or at least doing future grows and you find genetics that you really really like it could be amazing trichome production could be an awesome terpene profile so the aroma is great a bud structure anyone any or ideally all of those things well you want to keep that as a price for you know and keep those genetics and clone from that so that you have one you get to keep that genetics and literally keep the growing again keep growing it over and over and over again then to your grows will be very predictable because if I was to grow out a mother plant of this and take loans well every single time we'll have same level canopy at the same you know at the same development time because again they are exact clones exact replicas of the mother plant so that's what I want to really talk about today the whole mentality behind why you would want a Fino hunt and just to give you an early glimpse as to what you're kind of looking for and the differences the significant differences that you can find growing plants that are the exact same strain from the exact same breather from the exact same back to seeds just how different the results can be so there it is a lot for me to think on and ponder on and what to do with this with this group of girls and for you a lot of information I think I feel to digest but I hope it was informative I hope it was helpful and well well we'll leave it at that thanks for tuning in for another episode and I look forward to speaking you in the next can can grow signing out take care of Cheers", "65SqchcX9C0": "word of the wise look where you are walking because there is a blue coral snake right here and you can see even with that electric blue color he blends right in unless you're really really watching where you're stepping and there's one right here he's probably about three and a half feet long he goes in through here and his tail is over here here he is look at that look at that that is awesome in the open i might be able to make a move for him i don't really know oh look at that he's kind of puffed up a little that is an awesome snack buddy oh yeah let's not have that", "QAkbtBShyp0": "hey everyone how's it going Eric here with peer pressure we're gonna be showing you our top five tips and tricks for getting the most out of your flower rosin so whether you're pressing at home on a hair straightener or using an industry-leading press like our peg speak rosin press we've got all the tips and tricks so you can get the most out of it tip number one quality in quality out this is the most important thing that you should know when you're making flower rosin or any rosin the better the material you're starting with the better your results are going to be and the fresher it is the better the clarity as material tends to age it's gonna oxidize and you're gonna find that that rosin is gonna come out darker so if you're looking to make the best flower rods and you possibly can get stellar material and press it as soon after its dried and cured as possible tip number two relative humidity makes a huge difference with flower rosin now you can go check out our other video where we did the full in-depth test but what you need to know is that your flower should be at least at 55 to 62% humidity before you press it this makes a massive difference in your yield so just make sure that your material is properly hydrated before you press it tip number three choose your temperature based on your desired results so we encourage a lot of experimentation and you're gonna find that most people are either pressing on the lower temperature range which is about 160 to 190 degrees Fahrenheit or the higher temperature range which is anything from 190 to as high as 250 degrees so depending on what kind of consistency you want to achieve that's where you're gonna set your temperature on the lower range you're gonna be looking at more of a butter on the higher range more of an oil or a shatter so when you have some material that you're playing around with we encourage you to try both ends of the spectrum and see which one you like the most tip number 4 choose the right micron bag type now you can absolutely press flower outside of a bag and get great results but that's usually only a gram or two you're gonna want to press in a 90 or 115 micron bag or at the most 150 we recommend not going any lower than 90 because that's when you're gonna see a huge drop-off in yield so if you're pressing flour in a bag make sure to stick in that range and finally tip number five if you're looking to make the highest quality flour on possible you absolutely don't need to overdo it on the pressure now you can definitely over press your flour rosin by applying way too much force at your bag and in fact we've seen great results not only with yield but of course with quality pressing at the lower end of the pressure range anything from around 550 to 1600 psi at the bag so when you're applying way too much pressure in the many thousands what can often happen is that you're pushing out plant fats lipids you know the waxes as well as all of those undesirable plant materials into the rosin really over pressing it so if you're looking for the highest quality rosin we recommend trying the lower pressure range and seeing your results thanks for watching we hope that you found that was helpful for more tips and tricks make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel and follow us on social media at Goa peer pressure thanks again for watching [Music]", "gTO-bVzkZlo": "so I'm doing this video because there's just not that many places where you can get a pretty summed up decent knowledge about th TV and the strain Durbin poison as well so I recently got some drivin poison and it's a really interesting smell it's much stronger it has been reported to have 1% THC v which is basically like an additional cannabinoid considering how small amounts are found in other strains so it's 1% which isn't really that high but it does change the effects massively it's been called the espresso of weed it's 100% sativa straight from the place of Durban in Africa and just as a sort of experiment really to see if there are any differences you could notice and I think suddenly the race car cannabinoid which is the nickname given to it is quite appropriate it does set in much quicker yeah it's a it's it's a different kind of look as well but it's interesting because th TV it works with THC in a different way so it changes the way the THC binds to the receptor for one I think it prevents it from rebinding continuously so it just binds once does its duties and then disassociate and then it's not allowed to keep keep on stimulating so that changes the way that THC works with THC V itself is a neutral antagonist for the cb1 receptor and that's that's something that pharmacies have not been able to replicate when they try to do what THC V does very well which is prevent the reward from food it seems to do and when pharmacies did that they made Rehman band and that accidentally caused suicidal beliefs and ideologies so they had to very quickly pull it from the market after finding out that it seemed to suppress a lot of the rewards from values in general which made life quite depressing clearly so this is a new potential therapeutic for obesity or and diabetes as well might be good for pain perhaps it's it's of ensuring to a shift to the default mode network which is the resting state when you're not doing any tasks of your EEG activity so it shifts that base activity towards more executive regions like the prefrontal cortex anterior cingulate gyrus as well I think and a few other odd places but mostly the prefrontal areas and that could explain why lots of people when they try Durbin poison they have this feeling to clean their room or tidy their desk Hoover their stairs that kind of thing we did to me tells me that a lot of stoners or people who smoke don't have tidy rooms or perhaps they just really liked hiding in their room especially so I'd like to know what someone might do if they had to tidy room this note don't point we shall find out I I don't have a tidy room unfortunately so maybe I will do it a few days it depends oh good this time so yeah it's it's really interesting hi that's for sure it's quite expensive difficult to get hold off for now but it has been around a long time and it has been given this title but now we can finally see what the cannabinoid profiles are yeah there is there something else about th TV it may could work with terpenes I suppose it has many medicinal properties I so sure but yeah be the neutral antagonist idea is really interesting because there are just not that many of them around I haven't seen it before a new tonight agonist has 0% efficacy at the receptor exactly right what does I mean so yeah I'll find out the details of that at some point but yeah just as an experiment it's a really good string so yeah hopefully this could be a treatment for motivational disorders like depression and things so it could be really nice to see to strain to encourage that sort of high childlike mind state that some people get when perhaps the first smoke and see more of that you know going out and creating something making a ramp but completely  it up that's the kind of thing I'd like to see more instead of the sort of couch lot kind of style to it because it's just be far more funny I think everywhere will just be a pineapple Express movie it all day long cheats and junk so yeah it's now for 24 so I'm just over town anyway thanks for watching", "Wkd2za5_w_E": "all right hey guys this is rich at dog town innovative products okay so today I want to show you how to run the bubble bowls ultimate kit with a vacuum system people have asked me how to run the kit when they're processing high volume and I want to show you that you can do it with the ultimate kit and a vacuum system so what we got going on here is I have just your standard wet/dry vac that you can get from any Home Center and I drilled a port inside the bucket this is these are seven gallon buckets by the way which you can find online so I just drilled that hole the same size as my hose here you don't need any special attachments or fittings or anything like that and then you can just take your kit and set it right on top of the bucket here and so you'll want to make the sure that it's centered and that vacuum is just going to create a vacuum chamber out of this bucket and draw your water straight through so like I said I'm using seven gallon buckets I have a second bucket here ready to go so I've actually done two seven gallon work bag processes and this will demonstrate how to use the vacuum system to keep just running your water through without it backing up so if you can envision once you see the process you'll see how you can adapt this to a twenty gallon trash can and just use your regular hose and gravity feed for every about five and a half or six gallons you'll have to switch over to another bucket or empty the water in your vacuum chamber all right so I'll show you what's going on here I got the ultimate kit which is the 160 micron Bowl I got a 120 micron Bowl got the 90 micron bowl we've got the 68 micron Bowl we've got 53 my bowl and we got the 30 micron Bowl so what we want to do with these before we get going is pressing together get a nice tight seal between the bowls so they kind of want to stick together like that okay again we're going to put that right on the center of that stack so with my work bag process again I use seven gallon buckets and your ultimate kit comes with an all mesh work bag that fits in that seven gallon bucket so I'm going to get going here I have like I said have two seven gallon buckets ready to go and pour through the system it's fresh frozen a whole plant mix normally I'll separate the bud from the leaf but I wanted to get a little more volume so to show you how to do the high-volume processing alright so one important thing is before you get there's some stuff around over here before you get pouring into the bowls you'll want to start your vacuum motor if you port through and let it back up a little bit you can hit the motor and it will clear up right away but you get a pop of air from the underside and that could throw your extracts back up so up into the mesh the low above it so keep that in mind the way to get around that is just to start your motor before you start pouring so that's what we're going to do right now all righty so there you go on to say that this whole stack is cleared there's our 160 there's our 120 there's our 90 there's our 68 there's our 53 and there's our 30 so I'm going to go ahead and just set this bike up side grab this other stack here grab this other bucket right inside the court put the stack back again make sure it's on the center make sure they're pressed together tightly start that motor important all right so there you go we got the whole stack is cleared it's our 160 there's our 120 there's our 90 and that looks like that's where we got most of our catch the stuff in the 120 and the 90 are usually the best stuff sometimes a 62 the 68 looks like we got some good stuff in there 53 more green to it but I didn't overwork this stuff and really not much in the fridge so there you go you see how to clear the system really quickly like I said you could probably get away with one stack with for 120 gallon system if you're using a 30 gallon or 55 gallon you may want to add a second stack a third stack and go modular you don't need one big bowl you can go modular at a second third static all righty there you go that's how to run large volume processes with the bubble bolts thanks", "TM6UNxZ_CPI": "yeah he was playing africa um we took b still i oh", "DUJ3W85ZmMw": "hey what's happening I changed in the tube here the drain hose on the bubble now a hash washing machine figured I'd do a little video all you do is pop this little door off the back with two screws and cut the original hose off this one here with all the ribs it catches all your hash keeps it for itself but you just cut that right off with a knife get a hose three-quarter inch interior diameter and slide that get it warm put it in warm water if you get especially if you get this good sturdy one that I got and I don't know weasel its way right in there and connect right there put the hose clamp on and then I just did a 90 in a cat there so there it is another little tip if you don't want to pay the couple hundred bucks for the bubble now sticker you can get a cost way on Amazon for 60 bucks it's the same machine I got two of them this one that I got the one with the hundred dollar stickers so it's up to you I'm glad I supported bubble man on this one he's taught people a lot and so I'm glad to pay it I guess for one but to cheap to pay it for two so there you go and then put that door back on and get to washing pace", "GYbQtkxx6RI": "Oh [Music] [Music] water hash hacks so our first tank today is going to be how to create a shield this is a picture of a shield just cut the bottom off a bucket then use the shield on the inside of your work bag as seen here this helps keep your bag from drifting to the middle and will help protect it from your drill or your paddle or whatever you're using the mixer batch our next hack for today is going to be using a siphon we have just pulled out our work bag and here we see our hash water in the bucket one of the easiest ways the siphon this water out is to use a 25 micron screen like this it's easier to push the bag down into the water than it is to dump the whole bucket through the bag get a pan or a small bucket to place the hose in you just need something to stop the screen from getting sucked into the hose another way to do this is to let your hash water settle for about 20 minutes and very gently place your pan on the bottom of your hash water bucket then siphon out of your pan to a bucket with your 25 micron screen bag catching all the water if you do that just in case anything good does sneak out on [Music] now that took me about five minutes and you can see all the hash is left in just a small amount of water that's a lot less to deal with and it saves your back and your time another little trick is when you're dealing with multiple runs is you can just mix them together you can do this easily if you're using the siphon method I'll mix my first runs together and my second runs together that's what you see here the mixing of two different runs now let them settle and pour it off later which brings us to our last hack of the day rinsing your hash this trick works especially well when dealing with low quality trim so now just fill the buckets with fresh water and let them sell for 20 minutes before pouring them off if you're in a hurry you can use the bag and the siphon and then you won't have to wait for them to settle [Music] [Music] now I've let those buckets settle for 20 minutes and I'm going to just pour them off slowly you can see this stuff's pretty clean already you'll still see some small debris that gets out once in a while there's still a little bits of stuff in there now with the clearness of the water you can start to see the hash down there at the bottom and now you can see a little hash trail trying to make its way to the rim so we'll stop it about there and now that's all of our hash and just that little bit of water I'm pouring these into a 25 micron Bay to catch anything good that gets out if it looks good enough I will add to my second runs or I will just use it for cooking I like to repeat this process until I can see the hash sitting on the bottom of a bucket full of clear water [Music] I have been dumping buckets in that bag all day most of the time it'll pull straight out with a little or no resistance so it is holding a little more water than usual but still easy to pull and it's draining pretty quick [Music] when i zoom in here you can see there is some stuff stuck to that bag it is a little dirty well happy hashing age [Music] [Music]", "7bEZANtNfIo": "Welcome to Q did you know, where there are hundreds of interesting videos, quickly subscribe to the channel so that you will not miss any\nvideos from us You know, the animal world is diverse, especially snakes. They have more than 3000 types existing all\naround the world. So to list them all out is kinda impossible. However, today, we will list out top 10 snakes\nthat we believe they are very special and strange that maybe, you wouldn\u2019t believe\nthat they really exist Number 10: Long nosed vine snake Long nosed vine snake,Once again native to southeastern Asia, the long nosed vine snake\nis a highly advanced arboreal predator; Its vine-like body hides the snake from both\npredators and prey and its light weight allows it to move quickly through the foliage and\neven reach from one branch to another with half of its body on the air! They feed mostly on lizards and frogs, and\nalthough they are venomous, they pose no serious threat to humans; pain and swelling are usually\nthe only symptoms after being bitten by a vine snake, and the symptoms disappear within\na few days. unlike other snakes, it has excellent binocular\nvision, which allows it to strike at prey with great accuracy. Its eyes are also unusual in having horizontal,\nkeyhole-shaped pupils. Number 9: Tentacled snake This is a quite unique species, the last surviving member of its genus. Its most notable feature are the strange fleshy\ntentacles on its snout. These tentacles are actually highly sensitive\nmechanosensors, which allow the snake to detect movement in the water and strike at any unfortunate\nfish that swims nearby. Another interesting trait is the tentacled\nsnake\u2019s incredible attack speed; it takes only 15 milliseconds for the snake to capture its prey. But fish have incredible reflexes and a fast\nstrike is not enough sometimes, so the tentacled snake uses a clever trick to make fish swim\ntowards danger. When the fish approaches, the snake slightly\nripples its body towards it. The fish immediately darts in the opposite\ndirection\u2026 but this is what the tentacled snake expected, so it angles its head so that\nthe fish swims directly into its waiting jaws. Of all snakes, this is the only one known\nto anticipate the reaction of its prey and act accordingly. Although the tentacled snake is venomous,\nit poses no threat to humans. It is rather small, at only 90 cms long. Just like the Elephant trunk snake, it is\nfully aquatic and can barely move on land. Above you can see the videos of tentacled\nsnakes tricking and feeding on small fish. Number 8: Elephant trunk snake This weird snake is found mostly in Indonesia, although some close relatives are also found\nin Australia. It gets its name from its unusual skin, which\nis wrinkled and baggy, and gives the impression of being several sizes too large for the snake. The scales are also unusual; they are large\nand knobby, hence the snake\u2019s alternate common name, \u201dwarty snake\u201d. They can grow up to 2.5 meters long. Elephant trunk snakes are completely aquatic,\nand are practically helpless on land; they can\u2019t slither because they lack the broad\nscales in the belly that are common to most snakes, and an important aid when moving on\nland. Elephant trunk snakes feed on fish, including\ncatfish and eels; they lack venom, so they use constriction to kill prey; their big knobby\nscales are an adaptation to hold slippery fish and constrict them underwater. Number 7: Horned viper The Horned viper, Found in the deserts of Northern Africa and the Middle East, horned\nvipers are small, usually under 50 cms long. They often have a pair of horns over the eyes,\nbut there are also some individuals that lack them completely, and, therefore, can be easily\nmistaken for other vipers. They are venomous, but their bite is usually\nnon fatal to humans. When threatened they rub their coils together\nto produce a warning sound before they strike. The horned viper was formally named \u201dCerastes\ncerastes\u201d in 1768, by Austrian naturalist Nicolaus Laurenti. Cerastes was a mythical Greek monster, a serpent\nthat hid under the sand in the desert and ambushed any passing creature, using its horns\nas a lure. Ironically, the horned viper itself may have\nbeen the real life inspiration for the mythical Cerastes! Indeed, the horned viper hunts by hiding under\nthe sand and striking at any small animal that comes close. Ancient observers may have exaggerated the\nsnake\u2019s size and dangerousness, giving origin to the Cerastes myth, which Laurenti remembered\nwhen naming the horned viper centuries later. The horned viper\u2019s horns, however, are not\nused as a lure; to date, no one really knows what the horns are used for, or why some horned\nvipers have them and some don\u2019t. Number 6: Burrowing asp I already introduced this snake in the Sabertoothed Creature list. However, no list on Unusual Snakes would be\ncomplete without this one. The Burrowing Asp is a smallish snake from\nAfrica that spends most of its time underground. It feeds on rodents, and has enlarged fangs\nthat function basically as venomous saberteeth, protruding out of the mouth when in use. This means that the Burrowing asp can bite\nwithout even opening its mouth- which is very useful, since it prevents dirt from entering\nthe snake\u2019s mouth during the struggle. The fangs are also flexible and can be moved\nindependently from each other, meaning that the snake can stab its prey sideways with\none fang, and once it has killed its victim, it can use the movable fangs to actively manipulate\nthe prey\u2019s body for easier swallowing. Burrowing asps are venomous and there are\ncases of children dying after a bite; however, in adult humans the venom is usually not lethal. However, due to the cardiotoxic and necrotic\nproperties of the snake\u2019s venom, and its ability to inject it deeper than other snakes,\nharassing or manipulating a Burrowing asp should always be avoided. Number 5: Tiger keelback Also known as yamakagashi, or Japanese water snake, this species is found mostly in Eastern\nAsia. It is small, rarely exceeding one meter in\nlength, and very shy, so much in fact that they were considered to be harmless for a\nlong time, until someone died of a yamakagashi bite in the 80s. Fortunately, due to their docile temperament,\nthese snakes are very unlikely to bite and fatalities remain exceedingly uncommon. Also, since their venomous fangs are located\nin the rear of the jaws, they can\u2019t inject their venom as easily as other snakes. They feed mostly on frogs and toads. Other than their bright colors, Tiger Keelbacks\nlook kind of normal; however, they have a very interesting defense mechanism. Recently, it was discovered that these snakes\nfeed on poisonous toads; not only are they immune to the toad\u2019s poison, but they can\nactually \u201dsequester\u201d this poison and store it in a couple glands they have in the neck. When threatened, the snake releases the toad\u2019s\npoison from its neck glands. This amazing adaptation not only protects\nthe snake from most predators, but also allows it to save its own venom for hunting instead\nof wasting it on something too big to eat! Number 4: Sea snake Sea snakes are easily the most unusual of all snakes. They belong to the same family as cobras and\ncoral snakes, but they have adapted to a completely marine lifestyle; in some species, the adaptations\nare simply incredible. There are 62 species recognized to date, and\nthey are found in the Pacific and Indian Oceans; they are all extremely venomous, with some\nspecies, such as the Beaked Sea Snake, having venom up to ten times more powerful than a\ncobra\u2019s. One sea snake species, the Belcher\u2019s sea\nsnake, is considered by experts to be the most toxic of all snakes, marine or otherwise. Fortunately, sea snakes are usually docile\nand human fatalities are exceedingly rare. Most sea snakes give birth to live young;\nthis means that they don\u2019t have to return to a beach to lay eggs as sea turtles do\nAs a result, they have practically lost the broad scales on their belly, which other snakes\nuse to move on land, and most sea snakes are completely helpless out of the water. Some species are indeed so well adapted to\nthe sea, that they can even absorb oxygen directly from the water, through their skin! They also have special glands on their tongue,\nwhich expel the excess of salt from the snake\u2019s organism every time it flicks its tongue. Number 3: Flying snake Flying snakes are found in the rainforests of India and southeastern Asia, and, despite\ntheir rather alarming name, they can\u2019t actually fly. They are, however, accomplished gliders. When a Flying Snake wants to go from one tree\nto another, it launches itself into the air while flaring out its ribs and sucking in\nits stomach, thus flattening and widening its body and turning into a pseudo-concave\nwing. As amazing as it may sound, Flying Snakes\nare even better gliders than flying squirrels. While squirrels can glide up to 60 meters\nfrom one tree to another, Flying Snakes can glide up to 100 meters or more, and they actually\n\u201dslither\u201d in mid air, which gives them better stability and some degree of control\nover their \u201dflight\u201d. Flying snakes are venomous, but not dangerous to humans. They feed mostly on lizards and other small\nanimals, and spend most of their time up trees. And now, let\u2019s come to the most interesting\npart of our video today - the explanation of the most controversial photo. In the photo is a snake eating a giant spider\nwhich looks like that in our previous video. At a glance, we might mistaken it for a strange\nsnake, but it\u2019s not true. And now, let\u2019s come back with... Number 2: Atheris hispida Atheris hispida ,Found in the rain forests of Central Africa, this small but highly venomous\nviper is noted for its huge eyes and keeled, bristle-like scales which give it an almost\nfeathered appearance Atheris vipers grow up to 75 cm long, with\nmales being longer than females. Like all vipers, Atheris has long, retractable\nfangs in the front of its upper jaw; there is no known antidote to its venom, which causes\nblood clotting difficulties, pain and swelling, and often, death. Fortunately, these vipers usually live far\naway from human settlements, and therefore Atheris bites are exceedingly rare. Number 1: Langaha nasuta This is easily one of the weirdest reptiles in the world. Just like the Asian vine snake, the Langaha\nsnake is adapted to an arboreal lifestyle and feeds mostly on lizards. Its most interesting trait is, of course,\nthe weird \u201dhorn\u201d or projection on its snout. Both genders have this weird ornament, but\nmales and females look very different from each other; males are yellowish and have smooth\nskin and a sharp, pointed \u201dhorn\u201d, while females have rough-looking brown scales and\na flat, leaf-shaped and serrated horn. This is one of the few cases in which a snake\u2019s\ngender can be determined easily at first sight. Langaha nasuta snakes are found only in Madagascar\u2019s\nendangered rain forests. It is venomous and its bite can be extremely\npainful to humans but not life-threatening.

and me in the house and we're about to fresh frozen dude I'm so excited that you came by with the fresh frozen watermelon today yeah no that's a birthday treat for real what kind of friend brings this problem now of course I'm not keeping the resins but just to be able to make it and smoke it with John to me is a perfect most beautiful of birthday gift so I've actually got a rarity here that you haven't seen yet I've got all three of the bunk bed kits that we're selling right now from the original the top grade warrantied for life durable as a mofo except that I have yeah exactly that's the professional house makers kit that's the most expensive fog gallon aid bag kit that comes in at 320 plus dollars number two which still has all the colors right just a slightly lower GSM thread count the bags are still quality right and I use an outside bag to change the color to show people that this is not an original kit so that they shouldn't be paying the original price this bag is about $50 cheaper this kit I basically passed the savings on of the slightly cheaper material for the bags and the cheaper out outer material and basically patch that right on to the customer so that bag comes in at about 270 thanks Canadians hey are you much sorry and then the final ones which unfortunately these look a little smaller than those other two kits because I only had a 1 gallon kit and these were fives but pretend this is a 5 gallon kit now these are the lights and these are the ones where I really went out hard on the savings I changed everything there's no eight colors like I took away the eight colors and put only three colors which was a pretty massive savings for me being able to not have to buy eight rolls of full color which is you know it's everything everything adds up it's very expensive to buy eight separate roll I was able to pass on a huge savings on the eight bag five-gallon kit of the lights at just a hundred fifty bucks that's like half price it's less than a half price for the original so you know what just lots of people always asking for deals and always asking for cheaper set so I like to accommodate we give deals and we have three different sets that can accommodate you for whatever your priced price it's not to sound too much like an infomercial cuz I like the fact that John and ionize videos are more chill and more real but I I never talked about the bags that much and this is a good time to do it and we use these ones already we use the lights and one of our other video exactly and we've used the originals I did the originals with Remo I believe and it's just a matter of one day running but it's your birthday today so what bags you use well for my birthday I'm using the top-of-the-line 100% full lifetime warranty bubble bag originals course you know and man that's soft like if you're going to travel with this bad boy as a hash maker across the [ __ ] plains of Afghanistan sleeping in the mountains you know and I open I think we might actually try and do that I think we will do that after Jamaica which we're gonna do in a couple of weeks we're gonna be in Jamaica in a couple weeks with Tony potentially Chibs Scott from rare dankness and a few other people I've invited down for kind of just a real cool hey let's get together and have an amazing time in Jamaica go hang out with some cool artists and Kingston go to a couple of cool parties meet the Rasmus go into the hills make hash isn't that what it's all about oh that's just like sweet alright so Johnny Cash John is brought over the watermelon today we've got the fret I won't pull it up just yet because we should fill when we fill this we will need the herb better go so we're gonna use the bubble now for our mixing and we're gonna use the barrel shaped bags I know a lot of people love their triangle-shaped bags which I will be bringing to market soon spoke with a few different people recently nicotine being one of them offered him pyramid shaped bags cuz we can of course manufacture any style of bag that people request if there's any professional Hashmi out there that want their own specialty kind of bag you know get in touch with us we'll make you anything you want and one thing you know about bubble bags and fresh Shetty's is that we make quality products that's it's a good offer anyway so we're gonna do the fresh frozen how much did you bring weight out of or hunter grams of wet for 400 grams and that's the watermelon that's the what a memo you showed me at the front door oh god dude you know it smells down here they just go up to the camera and show them this glisten the negative perfection whoa isn't solid it's pretty frozen dude look at that that resin was so sticky I did do a video of it alright layer of ice this is my birthday treat Johnny happy birthday oh it feels like little icy trichome rocks okay more ice now yeah now we're gonna put the chosen make nice little layer of ice and then a layer of or so yeah you can put more ice in excellent you basically want to make it so the ice is covering that layer of herb pretty much completely which it is they're perfectly yep we're going up for the camera okay just barely touch this herb a little bit God is that nice now you can put a bunch of more ice I'm just I just put that back in the ice right there [Music] I've done this before with me and without with in with them this is a perfectly that father was the 400 grams it knocks this bag perfectly yeah I was getting used to it I like my little Rubbermaid bin so once that's all the fresh I know I'm ready good to go and this the 2.5 gallon nine point five liter bin that I'm using good sign John we have five nice pieces of ice here perfect there we go back Sean so today we're gonna use ice in the bubble now machine as well nice just because our water is not necessarily gonna be the coldest coldest coldest you could start turning that water on now actually I will let that water run because it is an outdoor hose in a black hose sitting out in the Sun when it first comes out it can be pretty warm and we're pretty blessed with our water that just fits Oh perfect uh no real it's gonna be nice I can't even tell you how good that TGA strain smells I call it watermelon all the time it is the Astro Boy from TGA and it is a really nice strength there you go but I was gonna put some ice in here to pour in there so we're using the bubble bag originals I'll get rid of the lights and the standards and there's one more little bud I found would you like to put some ice in there so you keep that for photography reasons later nice it's on the gun no stuck to my fingers so good boy one away we will but what we're gonna have to do first to get a little of this mounted because it's such a perfect amount we basically filled this that's the cool thing about the the barrel shaped bag is that it fills the Machine perfectly and just allows you to mix as though the Machine the bag isn't even there you know what I mean that's what I love about this bag that's why I'm so surprised when I hear people say that they prefer the triangle bag and that they're getting a bigger yield and they get it I get my yield I get what is there I never get less you know what I mean if there's 10% that's what I'm gonna get and having a barrel shaped bag certainly isn't going to be it isn't going to make it that I get any less let's get some water on that yeah we'll bring over the hose over here I'm just gonna pass if I'm the camera here I think it'll just reach if we're lucky we're lucky I think we just happen to perfect there we go so we've had the pressure turned down there so we could do this we got lucky there I got it awesome you know I know this is good come you know what I want you to do come around and dab me out a bowl with the D nail I'm gonna be amazed you know that's great about that sliminess I can reach in here with a nice little ball yeah it's awesome all right oh yeah there you go dabbing and filling up the bucketful ice here getting the bubble now going it's just very nice asking beautiful oh that's nice what did we dab up there number two and three [ __ ] oh gee I like that pack indeed it is a very nice play I'm sure I like it a lot it isn't yeah this is filling up beautifully perfect yeah you're just hearing now what's getting up to the top which is great oh not even close it's actually about halfway perfect yeah and luckily it's got quite a bit of distance about an inch and a half all the way around the whole thing that can fill with water excellent yeah you know you don't want to take away all your water the water is definitely a very important component of making water hash water and ice always what you say keep it cold mmm-hmm keep it and I'll have you all know that this hose nozzle was cleaned by myself before I stuck it in here I made sure to get all the particulates or any little pieces that were on it off and I cleaned it up real nice I've been getting a lot of sort of flak lately because I show people how to make a bubble and of course I like to show them how to make it properly but I also like to show people how to do it easily with whatever they have available for where they are not everyone can afford an expensive hash lab with machines and ice makers and AH rows and so for those people it's nice to be able to show them a way to to be able to hand mix and you know how to get your house dry properly and all those things all right now we're getting close to the top okay I'm gonna turn that off so I'm about maybe two inches from the top and the reason I'm leaving that distance this is nice too now the bag will go sideways and upside down so I got it nice and upside-down all tied up we're gonna do about a ten-minute mix today and then we're gonna come back and we're gonna pull some bags for you nice and quickly the bubble now has been filled with water ice and herb john told us we put 400 grams of fresh frozen in there which is probably around 100 grams so if we can pull out anywhere from 10 to 12 grams of hash and return we've done exceptional so let's get her mix in it's my birthday batch it's your birthday so we're gonna continue to smoke hash while this bad boy continues to make cash yeah I hid yourself some Hoss oh you're nuts oh me oh well alrighty then stoked kind of let's make a hash in her birthday it's your birthday and always hitting it nice and all someone was saying though we take big bong rips I think no I think it's the quality of house that we're smoking you think we're taking a big one but it's so smooth it was pretty big okay let's bigger than normal what is your how can you not do a big birthday trip who's delicious that sauce that's nice too the more water and the more ice more ice [Applause] more ice merrier yeah you're gonna get a great extraction ratio [Applause] John's got the parchment paper here we've got pizza boxes four of them spread out which will be more than enough for 10 to 12 grams it's always great to use less hash for large area the more surface area the better and we've got the parchment paper unbleached for putting overtop of the cardboard I get so much flak for people a harsh and on me for cardboard I show you the cardboard because it's available to most people of course if you can have parchment paper and you've gone to your store and got some that's great just make sure in high humid areas that it's not stopping the wicking I do worry about the wax paper esque miss of the material but here we got John he's just gonna fold up the edges and we're folding up the edges on the parchment paper to just make like a little protected area so the bubble doesn't you know fall or get knocked off the parchment and we're gonna continue we're gonna tape the parchment as well onto cardboard thank you sir you're very welcome always nice to give a friend hand especially when it's you know about birthday hash patches there you go all right so that's pretty quick just picking the four together like huh yeah once it stays up nice nice little box that's perfect for keeping the bubble hash safe all right well let's go see if if it's time for us to pull the bank's tape down the corners a little bit looks yellow and smell it [Applause] it's almost like a beige yellow I'm totally excited to go how cool that is I can feel it when I opened it it nice and we're gonna get these bad boys working real soon [Applause] [Applause] all right we're back and our bubble now has just stopped mixing we did about a ten-minute err sample 10 minutes and water is pretty trippy it's almost like now that is funky I don't even know how to describe it it's got this light light green but the green is like a good it's golden oh I want to say smell my fingers but I'm not smelling a finger it's so yeah feel free to have a sip I always like to taste my rather a problem there's definitely resin you can see it floating right on the top in that right yeah it's nice hey yes I like it so we are gonna put the bags in the bucket real quick this doesn't have to take a long time and I'll just go through the colors and the micron sizes you start with the purple the 25 micron it's the smallest screen make sure our bag is nice our bucket is nice and clean because I do remember we got a little few nuggets that fell in there otherwise the only thing that's ever gone in this bucket is hash so not bad alright so 25 micron going into a clean bubble bubble bucket yeah we don't even have to turn it over but you can it's definitely not as necessary takes a lot longer if you want to do all the bags but it does help keep the screen nice open 45 micron the white this is our second bag and it's definitely a bag that produces no shortage of resin that comes out of the 45 micron bag really regardless ADA stream it's what I be pumping lately I mean that smoke is I'm 45 my little pony 73 micron that means he's out of 90 73 120 but it still goes to show you that it's worth puffing I'm actually doing a little bit of watermelon on top of that excellent so this was 73 yellow I'm not sure if I mentioned that I might have I might not have we've been dabbing bowls so there's 73 yellow used to be the gold bag until the black bag came along and stole its thunder yes the black bag is my favorite bag and it is the 90 micron today on this day of 90 micron I wear all black and honor of my friend Xavier from medical seats rocking the medical seat shirt that's job is there awesome oh great time with those guys just good dudes they can't wait til they come here we can show them you know our style we got beeping and bangin and beacon and dancer number 120 micron orange so that night it was a pretty a pretty good ad in from the 122 the 73 everything between the 120 and the 73 is delicious and awesome and you loved it but there were still thoughts that if we separated it it might even be more different and of course it was very glad to have my 1970 separated red 160 micron this is the contaminant bag but can also be a quality bag you know there has been resin that comes out of this bag that is melty I'm huffing on some also 160 no right now really yeah my little pony no I'm also 190 Green sorry to interrupt go ahead oh I'm just saying how tasty that 160 is because I have some good wow this is nice so um you can always try you 169 your 45 you have to be quite pleased if you're a good organic grower you'd be amazed at what you can get but they'll definitely know it's when it's special you'll see right away if you like waiting so this is the 220 now and we're still gonna use it even though that the bag in here the bubble now barrel shaped bag is at 220 I still like to use my 220 bag and just in case filter out any other contaminants that are a large particulate separate out from those smaller screens passion this looks like this bags been mixed once they pulled what was good to keep your bags clean it's good to check the bottoms of your screen sometimes before you shove them into a bucket it's a good idea you can have debris and dirt on the bottom of your screen and now there's some dirt that's right into your good hash and now you don't know how it got there but I'm sitting on the bottom of the 73 or the bottom of the 120 and you pushed it down and when the water and everything went through that little particulate fell right into your hash and it's just one thing to pay attention to so we've got all these now we're going to do the draining a quick little drain just over slightly all right and we'll just do the green on this boom that's exciting yeah that's fun I love this part make it hash they don't what boom you know what it's it's the most exciting part yeah so because this is fresh frozen watermelon and it's a fairly warm day thank God the Sun went a little bit behind the tree there we are in for some quick pulling of bags because when we pull in fact what I would suggest John is the 190 and the 160 no problem but when we get to the 120 I think we should I need to dab you up wick right away all right that there pass me your Tupperware container always make the key for a second one oh absolutely that was that nut so we can whip up a second run so fast to yourself when using fresh frozen of such quality nugget you got to do a second run I just touched it my fingers are sticky well that water was coming out nice and clear adding that extra gallon or two was worked out in our favor you're just gonna unplug this get the bubble now out of the way we go right and we almost killed me actually this will be a table there we go excellent all right so we've got our little area set up here with our bags I'm using a small bucket to flip the bags over and then we've got a spray bucket over here so that we're gonna be able to utilize it spin it in the ice for the whole time so it's excellent all right so even right off the bat there's spring to be done on this bag they do this is great so happy can't wait to see the night on that one bad boy there we go I'm gonna flip it up and you can do some spraying if you like yeah so this is mostly pistol at Harris stigmas big large contaminant if it was bubble it'd be moving a lot faster so this this part will be a little bit slow when you're spraying John's got it about half way cleans now yeah it's definitely I'm sticking really as you can see right now he can you can but it's it's just all right so let's just give it a quick little scoop what we can find we've got the screen nice and wet just give that a little scoop and drop that right there to 20 micron flip this take this here John we'll give it the clean-out over there just like right here it's really convenient that's nice to have that hose you're off camera but what John's doing is he's leaning over the deck right now and he's just cleaning the bag with the hose here I'll give you a little a little visual cleaning the bags with a beautiful ocean view in the background good Johnny no this is nice this is darn nice all right well let's get back to pulling our bags we definitely don't need to spend any wasted time leaving the water in the resin in the water so quick 10-minute rip on the bubble mouth and then pull those bags that was very little in that bag almost nothing see that every day although there is stuff it's kind of spread out on the screen it's invisible because of the orange screen in the sunlight I almost couldn't see it this is more resonance now it's already moving much easier than that other stuff was just pile it into a little spot very small little 190 keep that on and just clean it like that with the easier to clean when it's stretched I often clean my buckets my bag stretched over a bucket like that it's it's held in place it's easier there's no mob eases there's no creases that hold the bag shot in in weird ways and it's just like super quick alright a real small amount of 160 probably because it's just so damn good there's very little contaminants this herb that's something to come very small little piles but also not important piles alright now we're getting more into an important a bag that you want to see some resin in generally is your 120 it's a nice bag to see a little piling never a bad thing yeah a little pile of some some niceness show the camera here little pile of someone 20 goodness this teamwork there you go we're making bubble boom melt on our Gmail what snails by puking be skillet tools for me bubble hash galore alright looks good pick that up oopah so this is the bag that we put in the next bag to come yeah exactly you don't want to lose this resin that's a good point to be remembered by even this little bit of hash that stuck to the spoon right into the 90 quality is there no problem you're definitely not contaminating that bag by any means putting a tiny little bit of 120 in and white and then you'll still make sure we give it a good rinse alright 90 bike bum bag one of my favorites always good when it lifts up with a lot of water there's about a gallon and a half gallon and a half of water in there right now which tells me something's covering the screen at least a little pile this is always nice to get your yield in your 90 bag if you can a bad thing give that 90 you tiny little particulates but if I rinse the bubble around we should be able to pick them out which is like too much use the bottle in a second once I get these new guys Irish three or four just tiny little things that we don't want in there and let me tell you this thing does not want to pick up whatever it is all right you got a bug spray this up in just push the bag up put the lip up on the bag and it makes for easy even easier spring and I can just turn it boy there so you can just stay in one spot whatever works best for you looks like a nice pile there's definitely probably threw three grams there I would say where is that last one 20 was maybe half a gram 73 45 still two more good bags that we're gonna pull oh we're gonna how creamy that is oh it's delicious Rick's on the screen remember these ones need to go through the sieve almost immediately we can't leave this out for too long we can't waste all our time filling all these bags anyway we're gonna have to see some I think yeah that is like trim to the Krampus sound so there's that I'm thinking what I'm gonna do now though is potentially strain that 1/2 hour all right so we've got our parchment paper made into a big square here with the edges done up layer down here and I suggest we do that 90 micron and almost immediately let's get that done right now all right well let these guys see what's going on a little closer so I'm just gonna put the screen right here sure I'm gonna go grab that Oh sounds good man just gonna quickly um oh it looks perfect it looks perfect for micro plane itch for receive it for sea Vitch I should say sorry it was mixed the names huh all right so there's the ninety we're gonna gently rub it through the screen and you can see it's got that perfect right now that it's crumbling perfect so what I would suggest John is use the end okay and you you rather than make it awkward on yourself come back around here I'll show you here I can't show you without showing it there you go basically use the bottom of the spoon on the edge of the screen so I'm gonna try and he's gonna come back I'm gonna show this right here there you go now a lot of it right now is stuck on the outside but I give it a couple of whacks and it's quickly coming off oh that's beautiful look at exactly and see how we put the lip on there because as he's tapping away the lip is actually protecting it from jumping off of the lip is working for us very well yeah it does doesn't it Danis quite happy with that oh but you know what he's getting a little bit excited oh you got to get a little excited we're cleaning this hash off we don't want it stand in our seat we want it on that parchment getting dried all right that was 90 perfection right there well that's all you stuff coming off Wow worried about bouncing everywhere was it we just let this dry a tiny little bit this left little remnants that are in here we'll give it a good whack in about two or three minutes and it'll just fall and cover this look at what beautiful coverage we got with that sieve and in the Sun it looks so nice doesn't it job oh yeah it does some nice close-ups here I'll give it back to you there my friend oh dude beautiful right there cuz you already there beautiful beautiful job today is the birthday boy I know it's my birthday I should answer the phone it's birthday everybody's calling him he's making hash if that's what he alright that's awesome all right we'll be back in a second all right that didn't that 90 look unbelievable aren't you glad we received that right away I'm telling you right now if that 73 was still sitting there it'd be a done deal the 120 we could do any time as well but we'll pull these three bags and we'll do them all together we'll be quick though because the 73 is gonna be just much like that it's gonna be creamy deliciousness that 90 bag just made it all yeah right there and the 73 is doing it too just so you know just so you know it's also doing it yeah all right yeah the 73 is looking creamy too a very creamy I can I could smell it all right let's get that in there Oh thought I was gonna pull the Ricky ledee I thought you're almost gonna pull a rookie moves you know we do that even being we do we do we do I mean that's the that's one of the main reasons I don't mess around with chemical solvents but the fact that they're just come on look at this in the Sun look at the color of that that's just amazing you know what that's you know I can see it I wish you guys will bring it to them we're gonna be like this is one from here directly in this I'll let you pull that little chunk out in a second once I get it right there that guy and I think he didn't have a bit of an animal in that there we go a couple more perfect so stinky yeah this is gonna have to go all right want to get the spoon spoons right here oh yeah this is just like that night he was just like that it even wants this just stay on this that last little bit dang keep it the you know what it's almost the same amount with 73 is there it looks beautiful it's even like hardening on the spoon here screen the next screen is coming up the next screen the next screen I should not be the next parchment the next cardboard and parchment we're hitting gabs it's easy for us too alright so take that guy right here we can rinse this guy off ASAP because he's already starting to dry and that's one thing we talked about is don't let your screen one of the things they were doing in Spain that I couldn't wrap my head around that I really was thinking that it's just something they shouldn't be doing and I saw more than one person do it they pulled all their bags out and then they hung them and lean them up against one another put them in a bag and high-quality resin is gonna wick moisture just sitting on top of that screen so much then it'll be very difficult to see if micro planing will be one of your only options at that point and you'll have to of course freeze the resin before you do that because it's a warm environment in Spain especially in Barcelona even it's hard to get to a cool temperature that you can actually you know even just playing some some hash without having it just start melting your fingers all right it's richer bags very very devil there the better yeah no it's good so we're just given the resin and ice the resin is so clean Beth Lee Mort I see you yeah it's like four grams at least I'd say we've got our 10 to 12 grams anyway Joseph just from the like two and a half to the two to three two three four five six yeah we've got about ten anyway we still haven't pulled 225 either though just give this a couple of good squirts to show if there's any contaminants in there no it's beautiful then we'll scoop it all up how's that for not a drop drive would you like that that's cute dude that's a nice pile that's a huge problem that's not even done yet that's thanks thank five times of everything I'd say it's at least five times of everything yeah I think there's about six grams just there that's definitely close to five maybe 456 you know I'm just guesstimating just like you and I'm like you know no no more accurate and my guess we're gonna weigh it and we'll find out what its gonna be like yeah we're definitely let you know I'd say we're gonna get that through the plane real soon if you want to start sieving yeah why don't you come over here and see why like bags all do the cleaning on this bag I'm gonna grab this 73 right off the hop sure man yeah get that going right away it's good looks good hey you blow that off nice and fast tech I can just do that nice work though well easy going easy going so yeah this is a nice easy way to clean bags isn't it yeah isn't that nice haha totally digging it all right excellent excellent so remember the cleaner you you get your bags the better it's you get that resin stuck on there and you're the one that's gonna be dealing with it that is the truth of that never a bad idea to just use a little extra couple extra minutes and make sure you get it real dry well that's looking great John that's the 73 73 all right you could probably afford to card just a small section of this over there real quick you might even be able to do it just with the lightness I wouldn't touch it with your hands but and then we can put the 120 right here I will draw a line and then we've got two more in there that we'll have to make i'd say we're gonna need at least a whole one easy-easy for that 45 right now yeah then I'll pull the 25 bag this is a bag that everyone has a real problem with a simple technique you can see that it's holding at least 3 gallons of water but a simple technique is to lift it very quickly and the water just releases so a bag like this generally when I start doing this little jerk upwards method I can drain it in about 10 seconds fresh frozen John but I still have more that's sitting to be run again like we'll put it in the bubble now again and run another batch so I'm going to grab that we're not going to film our second batch but we will let you know what came of it that will do many push maybe a little couple days down the road notice how I filled the bag with air and slid my hand down the bag to actually get some of that excess water out do not physically grab the hash in the screen and squeeze it that is not a good idea it's just something that definitely is not a good idea and then finally here we've got our 25 oh yeah looking good John the 120 looked beautiful the 25 is one of the unique resins that you can actually gather with a spoon almost as well as you gather with the spray bottle but why that is if it's the size of the heads obviously it is it's the only thing that's really different about it just clean it so well 25 micron the grade that will pay for your bags whether you want to use it in a metal bowl or an ax joint or smoke it in a bone I saw Franco from strain hunters recently going off on you about USF's 25 micron bubble so you know that there's something to it there's some actives in there depending on where it was growing on the strain this color of this 25 is absolutely beautiful yeah awesome I got water spraying in my face this is awesome it's beautiful look at the Sun just just goodness this is totally beautiful totally awesome birthday thanks for coming over John oh you know what I mean you always come over but put a nice guy to bring the fresh frozen and hey plan this like this is a day it was something that I you know it's I'm gonna I'm gonna give me this cut I've rushed this home now about Christmas I brought him here from my friend Ron's yeah we were laughing about it today it came home in my pocket in a plastic bag and I'm gonna go get the second parchment paper so we can get on seething that 25 and that 45 I'll be right back and what I'm gonna do here as we know this side here is the ones one and this side here is the 73 so instead of drawing a line on the paper here I'm just gonna write it on the cardboard gives me an idea I put the 73 and the 9v fills up that whole tray and this 45 is definitely looking so sweet so I'm gonna wait for mark to come out here right now move this whole dollar bags we've seen the 90 the 120 the 73 and what we have left is the 45 and the 25 we're not bothering with the 222 190th 160 it's just schwag Isles I'm gonna pour this water into my garden down below that's terpene rich hey here we go that right there is what we call koala tay 445 I'm gonna smile on your face look at me dude you're 45 below is that Johnny already five is this your 45 over that's the 45 Oh John do you think that III think it's just a beautiful thing what are you my friend it's for you I'll look at that for you I think I think I think listen maybe just a little bit tiny little bit if it's no good you let me know if we need to we'll add a tiny little bit of moisture it could be perfect it could be perfect oh yeah it's coming through nice it's sticking so gently give it a gentle little smack on the edge as you move it as you yeah oh yeah that's perfect John oh this smells amazing it looks unreal II hear ya believe how the smell this is the colour is written this is probably the nicest 45 I've ever seen it's definitely very nice for me that what I've grown so I mean here and there you can also do a light scraping on the outside make sure you move it when you do that or you'll get clumps though move the whole unit around even towards some of the empty spots so this is a real important process the sieving or the micro planing we're doing the sieving technique it's good to keep your tools cool we're doing this in the sunlight so you guys can see it really well obviously it's a better idea to do this in a colder environment not that it's SuperDuper warm right now but it's definitely probably ten degrees well we are so filler up nice little pile right off another piece and just kind of working yeah gently sieve it through the screens you know there did this did have a little bit more moisture removed even though it's sieving perfectly if I left a little bit more moisture in it it would have probably sieve even a little bit more perfect both the to the 90 and the 73 were like that as well but this looks great you're gonna get it all the way through and you'll be able to to cover this parchment paper nice and evenly so wherever you see it to be the least amount is where you kind of want to spend some attention whoo nice yeah I like that I moved the paper open just as you did it all right I was like team I was like team work you're like very receptive to the motions John hi you know what we work well together we do get the job because we're just having a good time but now it's cuz we love what we do we do love what we do and we seem to be very much alike in our in our just in our histories and the vision involved with and we just seem so damn happy to share with the people out there you know what what's what's the best thing you can do is show people this yeah baby it's my birthday hash look look at the bottom of this I'm so excited oh yeah let's look at the bottom of that in the sunlight alright give it a gentle smack rather than brush it with the spoon you can smack all most of that off sometimes I go high like on this on the top part that's good and then of course some more loosening of it up as it dries as we're taking time that bubble will dry out a little bit more and it'll even break off easier sometimes the little bits that get stuck on the outside you can gently brush it off with a spoon or you could use a brush you could also use one of the anti-static brushes to get this bubble off and that's just a nice even amount we'll give that a few more good whacks on the edge of the stainless steel strainer with the spoon real good ones give it a top whack like a nice hard one yeah that's where you see it really start see how I see it bouncing and releasing them yeah excellent beautiful alright well we've got our 45 we're gonna move on to the 25 so we ran out of space on our parchment paper we don't really want to rip out another batch and the 25 micron of all the hashes if you get it into a thin enough patty it seems to be the one that can actually dry in a patty so we're gonna do a little experiment just with the 25 we're gonna leave this little patty as is and we're still gonna get it on to the wicking table here we've got a nice little spot in the corner of our 45 we'll put it on the parchment there and we'll get back to you and let you know how that kind of turned out it's been an unbelievable birthday batch with my amigo Johnny I mean such a good friend comes over with the beautiful mess whips off a batch with me and this in this beautiful area that we live and yeah I mean basically the only thing really left to share which I'll end with is the macro photographs of the resin that we just made you know starting with that 120 micron beautiful heady heads all stuck together in little clumps beautiful color dropping down into the 90 and suddenly it's like whoa that stuff is surreal Dimond like glistening amazingness with the 73 looking almost exactly like the 90 to the naked eye I expect that it'll look pretty beautiful under the macro lens and then down into the 45 and I'll shoot the patty 25 and we'll share all this greatness with you guys so once again Jon thanks for coming out such a [ __ ] pleasure dude always a pleasure hanging with you bro I'm excited you know what dude I'm excited too this was this was a great day and a great birthday so thanks everyone for watching we'll talk to you soon on bubble man's world peace those are my bird friends they're saying John bubble man share that 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 micron we will peace [Music] you", "Qy5uHNV-r5s": "[Music] [Applause] [Music]

language but man we got a we got a goddamn dispenser or not just we got that opening up to in about six months but we got a nutrient store opening back up one of the people that worked in the old one is opening up a new one now it's gonna be hot in there man I was over there the other day checking it out from the outside because it's not open yet it's gonna be cool man it's gonna be hot it's gonna be hot so once again people you don't got to listen to me but this is some organic [ __ ] you see what I'm doing I got one two three four five different strains in here I'm using it on my seedlings I've been using it since they popped a tad bit a tab or a drop in a gallon and here we go you know I'm in next what I do want to put in here while they're still in veg I would I do want to start I want to get a bottle of turpan ater you know I mean I used that before and I have good results better results than when I used it when I didn't use it with the same genetics but wait until you see how he's good wait until you see how frosty these lemons good waiting to see how frosty this exotic blue dream fits I can't tell you about the Larry og or the blue the blue cookies but I'm sure that's

out what these astronauts say and sit out back in the dark where there's not a lot not a lot of light keep your eye on the sky man and ask the sky say look big Biden big something to look up and telepathically ask you to show yourself now show your sound make me a believer and then smoke on something wait about 15 minutes till the half hour while you're smoking it Wilson will keep your eye on the sky and keep in that same area that you're looking at and talking to it telepathically and I promise you he will see some [ __ ] if you're in a dark area Jack so whatever you just do don't get it your ass", "Fv7OfQ7D3Nc": "the Palumbo here with Palumbo's pythons and Boas for another installment of muscled serpents University [Music] today we're gonna talk a little bit about cleaning a lot of people have their own techniques probably a lot of you guys out there you know think that you know how to do it best and and the great thing about cleaning snake tubs is there's no right way to do it we all have our own techniques so I'm gonna show you guys how I do it and you know maybe you guys will give me some critiques in the comments and give me some ideas and maybe you know you guys will get some ideas for me so let's let's pull out a dirty bin what this this is like a v70 been one of my er s racks and this girl is gonna be breeding for me this year and this is a honeybee that's a hypo spider and she's got great color she's a terrific eater she just really started bulking up again she's really putting her way back on she's been killing killing the rats every week and she was on a little bit of a hunger strike earlier in the summer but now she's really good at thinking of the temperatures have died down and when they eat a lot they poop and pee a lot as you can see not too many poops in here but a lot of key piece and this is like almost like every other day she's pushy ping she's I've got her I've already seen her locked with a male she's bred last year I brought her to a coral glow spider at hypo we produce some terrific spider coral glow hypose you know and we they're all sold unfortunately for you guys out there if anyone was looking for him but so she'll probably produce some good stuff this year I don't even know I might I'm thinking about some some breedings and I'm not even able to talk about it because I'm just mulling them over in my head but I'm breeding it to a male right now we'll see so I'm gonna move her out of the tub if you see I have my little utility card here a lot of guys have this cart it's like the janitors car if you remember from elementary school you know the old Shannon used to push the cart around me path rooms and everything that I'd become a janitor essentially when you keep snakes you're a janitor you have to get that boy's supplies on here I have my paper towels I have my water job so I can replace my word I have Mike I clean it now this is this is benzalkonium chloride ID safe for the snakes you dilute it ten to one so you put about a tenth of the bottle in here and you fill the rest up with water and then you just you know you use this for your cleaning you don't want to use Windex or anything like that this is a disinfectant but it's not too strong for these guys once you do that you go into you tub you get actually all your old stuff now a lot of people use Aspen a lot of people use coconut shell I have found that I'm a very clean person and I like to use paper for a number of reasons paper towels especially white paper towels number one will show you if God forbid you ever had a a mite infestation you'd see him right on there the little black specks okay with Aspen and shavings inside like that you might not even know it that's number one number two I like to clean things on a regular basis almost daily I almost do daily cleans I look at all my tubs every single day as long as I'm not traveling and I go through it and if they're bad and clean them immediately because if you clean it right away you never have a problem when it starts building up and you have Aspen it absorbs the urine what happens is you're start getting an odor in your facility why because there's a lot of waste in the tubs a lot of people are not cleaning their tubs enough and quite frankly it's a pain in the X to use ass but I think you just dump me to get to all over the floor it has a smell and so paper towels seem to have worked wonders for me I love it I don't see myself switching anytime soon I spray that the benzalkonium chloride in the water bowl these are obviously deli cups you can replace them I actually clear I know some people just throw them out I clean them unless they're really disgusting from them and then I wipe down the inside of the tub all the poopy streaks on the wall and one of the best one of the best tools this is probably the best thing you can use for cleaning why because your aides stick to the tub and you cannot get them up unless you want to lose your nails get the spoon right out and the swing gets into the corners no problem you scrape up all those ear eats voila your rates are gone that's the best way to get rid of Uri so telling you there's no way you were to be here rates if you don't scrape them off and you use a razor blade you get obviously you're going to damage your tub you don't have to be perfect and you know what actually playing the truth during breeding season I don't clean the tub stoop to particularly because the smells especially the waste smells will stimulate breathing there's a pheromone level in the waist so you don't want to clean your tubs to clean when you're doing it on a daily basis when you're doing during breeding season same thing when I have a female that's breeding I don't clean her tub as much sometimes if she just urinate I'll leave the urine in there because once again that those pheromones attract in the house okay so once I got this all clean out and then take my paper towels you know exactly how many different Elzey needs sit the thing at me to hear [Music] here usually used to select the size family once again most of you can use paper towels you gotta use balancing I don't care what anyone else all the other brands Scott they don't absorb that you're gonna use paper towels use Bounty's those are the only ones that work they're waiting for both you with my bigger tubs obviously down through the desert I'd be using a whole roll paper towel actually clean the tub so I do newspaper for those I can show you those afterwards so we go we dump it will dump this water out will clean it I'm not going to do it here right now and wash out the water ball with a sponge and a little little soapy water like I rinse it thoroughly put fresh water in here if I was just topping it off I'd be popping up like this obviously then we get our snake back nice clean tub and all is said and done all is good in the world now if you do this 150 more times you get all your tubs clean and that could take a long time luckily they all don't go at the same time also this is the season where I'm not feeding Boas because we're breeding them so they're really not going to the bathroom very much that's saving me a lot of times is the bow is a bigger they poop a lot but the whole pythons are pooping a lot because I'm feeding them pretty happily especially the females right now are eating their building follicles and we're getting getting mocks I haven't seen any ovulations yet but you know that's probably due to come by next month so hopefully you guys learned a little something from my cleaning techniques once again they're not to do all be all everyone's got their own things some guys may not like what I do this is simplicity to me it keeps things clean we don't have a smell in here and I like it so would you guys enjoy the video click like below you like the channel subscribe because you know what you won't miss any of my upcoming videos and now that I'm kind of settling

position okay thank you go she's so Placid hey sook I got sick so we just we just got that puff adder pretty healthy fat female she was chillin on the stoop tier and then she saw us hooking it on under that cupboard I had to remove a panel to snag obviously no they don't make the nests they just find splashes like this and then they like use it as their hideout and this is a big attraction to rats and mice and that's a main source of food so they are after the food yeah you got to remove this because this was this this was all underneath there which is a perfect place for a snake to hide

and watch it fall down [Music] hey what's up tgc it's Scottie real hanging out with love for the plant what's up brother hey how's it going it's going really good man it's going really good and we were hanging out love for the plants friends with frosty McNuggets they came up a couple of weeks ago they gave us a little schooling on some solvent lists actually that was just last week wasn't it was last week lizard compliance man time flies when you're having fun man but frosty talked about a solvent hash last time or solvent extracts I should say man I'm dating myself man and I wouldn't love for the plant to talk about solvent lesser or basically what a solvent less water hashes out we're talking yes yes water hash bubble hash is just a form of solvent list okay so and that's what I would you know I'll be focusing on today we could talk for an hour on each kind of solvent list show me that high end you brought a couple high end yeah hashes right you brought like what's it called the six star water hash that I like to make fun of right yep otherwise known as full melt yeah and gooey you can put up a picture of this for us man yeah check it out it's uh it's totally it's like a white powder it's strange Oh I mean and it really it breaks down to being just try cap heads that's what it is just try cokeheads okay so I know that when you're doing your wood dry sift and everything like that you're trying to sift the broken heads from the whole ones and all that right same concept when you're doing water extraction pretty much for the most part yeah except you will come out with if done properly you will come out with a cleaner product been dry shift okay so we were talking before and I remember I went god I think they had like a six bag system bubble bags yeah I don't know if they still make a just bubble bag still a brand man oh yeah yeah they're uh onion brands in fact he has a couple of different tiers of them now excellent yeah they used to have like a three bag system which for somebody like me I was just glad to make something I could smoke out of my [ __ ] leaves trim yeah like right now they have four bag by bag eight bag you know depending on one's needs right will dictate which one you want do you buy them off with calm men no kind of break that down yeah when we're talking about like a 5 or 8 bag system it's having different micron screens so you can have the different grades of trichome heads or treasure talks or just separating your plant material it lets you have different grades of hash and then condoms it's now in it from there do you need six different grades of hash is that how it works so I'll give an example you know just to follow up on what guru said like these bags right here I have a five bag set right not optimal because I go from 120 micron to 73 micron okay there's no ninety in between so qualities are for some cultivars 90 maybe that sweet spot oh wow does a the type of the cultivar the type of cannabis that you're straining makes a difference on the size of the trichome absolutely Oh that'd probably determine yeah in fact even in fact different cultivars even have different shapes of trichome heads Wow and that makes sense why some guys are telling us they're getting crazy big yields off of off of these strains oh yeah the cultivars oh yes there's a huge difference in yield from one cultivar to the next we we've seen yields of over over twenty percent right for like a three ninety eight bubble or there are some others that yield really well and actually so I'll name a few like really girly for obviously that's one that would doesn't surprise them any people that are really well yeah but I'm sour Kush banana Kush those are some little some less known ones that that yield really well really yeah I actually have some Atticus yeah yeah there you go I mean I would put an emphasis on if you're going to watch something lost one that you know I tell you it will produce well in fact we brought we try to bring in like some old or not a little bit like some trendy strains right whenever I was working it at that facility well I'll get into a little bit later when we brought in those Jayne's we were only getting a yield of like three to five percent when we're used to getting like 18 to 22 percent and we did everything the same so that's how much it matters and that's why you often hear some people talk about well I tried bubble has in this case you're sure they may actually be good at making bubble hash and just had the your own cultivar the whole time you know he's they'd be good at making bubble hash it definitely is an art I used to make it I was doing it said I was just psyched to get something smokeable my friend or my hell without one of my growing partners was an artist like a true you know to paint and draw and everything like that we would leave him alone for the night with a six-pack of Budweiser and and a wooden spoon and that's all he would use man but he would grieve would just make the best [ __ ] hash I mean it was like dabble hash in the 90s you know what I'm saying is amazing The Devil's in the details is what you're telling me right yeah absolutely all right so you're gonna hook us up with little details moons are absolutely so all right cool yeah I mean first off just what interrupts I'm sorry if I'm going on Amazon or I'm going online with the [ __ ] do I buy what do I need well so you'll see a wide range in price on the bags right and I that was a mystery that you know I'd always wondered what the real differences between the different qualities of bags different levels of bags right I actually asked one of the more reputable actually the person I respect the most he was probably going through 100 different bags and I was like so tell me break this down for me what what do you what do you not get with the cheaper bags like from you know like a cheap Amazon this is like a bubble man bag yep and he said the screens are pretty comparable actually maybe a slight difference right but what you but what you're going to get with your cheaper bags are little pieces of thread that come off and it gets into your hash and it was funny because that's a big deal yeah so I made something home actually this is one of those cheaper set right and you know I you couldn't see the threads until you put it up in a microscope and you know you're looking at trichome heads if you make really nice bubbly eyes your eyes you're looking at it very closely and we started noticing little bitty tiny like red threads and [ __ ] and when you go for what Bo what who's the bubble man bags right yeah yeah bubble man is okay I'm is what you know that's like you know calling his bags out because that's one of the people I learned from that's what I was gonna say shout-out to that guy because he put so much education out there yup yup that's exactly I'll be back in the old school I mean it's yeah I was watching his videos and Prohibition land just couldn't wait I remember I was in Canada and I saw bubble banks for the first time and I was on vacation with my wife and my girlfriend back then I think I had 200 bucks left on vacation there were $285 I was like empty your wallet I need trust me this'll work but I was so excited to bring those things back for me it was like letting the gold cuz I couldn't figure out what to do with all my trim and 20 lights a trim that's a garbage bag of trim right yeah these were amazing alright so we got the brands now as far as four or five eight you know what do we buy if I'm just its that matter how much of a kind of sir I'm trying to be yeah absolutely okay if you're you know if you're just making bubble hash for Bowl toppers or yep or if you're just going to press it you know if even if you want to press it out into a rosin which we'll get into a little bit later right yeah I mean you can get by with a lot of things it's just a matter of you know as I go through the different things it's just a matter of maybe a 5% difference you know you can still get top-shelf bubble hash by not doing some of these things or you know maybe not having a the best bag system but you're just talking about incremental gains with some of the things we'll be talking about so deal deal all right so it well first off I'm intrigued man big plants big trikes yeah I mean definitely it's the you know when I worked for the oh well just go ahead and say so you know I I have a lot of experience just making bubble hash at home watching all you know watched all the videos read all the forums a lot of trial and error right but shortly thereafter I started working at one of well at the time was the most reputable saw solvent list company and the state of Colorado so yeah you know I kind of took my personal experience in that professional experience right and came up with just a list of tips and tricks you know that I just learned over time and a lot of these tips and tricks you would you won't find in summation all of them and in like a single video how-to video yeah that would be hard-pressed to find you know everything all at once these are these are tips and tricks that I've picked up over time sure they're probably I know there are others that I won't even talk about um but I kind of view these tips and tricks' is like the magic that happens between the main steps okay I'm making about will hash like if you got watch a video on how to make bubble hash right they'll give you those basic steps and you better know those basic steps very well right but there's some magic that happens in between there yeah I mean and there's ways you can screw it up - yeah I beat the hell out of the out of the material before man so yeah so I will get into it man yeah let's get into some of the specifics if we could yeah so take me through the process we got our Bowl bag showed up from bubble man from here you PS man got them what else do I need well first of all you want to work in a cooler environment I prefer like 50 degrees obviously you wouldn't want to work in the freezer we can wrap things are going to start freezing up sure but yeah in in Colorado we're we have very cool weather most of the time so I'm probably just working outside that that's very convenient okay so cool degrees so fun if I'm in Florida or from something you know my buddies in Florida or something like that can you work inside a refrigerator or something do you have yeah think about that no I do not man but that sounds like a decent night yeah okay sounds like something wacky that I would tell my I need to do yeah I need you to work inside the refrigerator okay man yeah trust me it's gonna be dank yeah all right so so we can work outside 50 degree temperatures something like that what do we do with the material now and and what do we mean anything I know you got a couple tricks up your sleeve well the first thing is you know optimally you want to use reverse osmosis water but we all know they draw back first of all RRL water is costly and but and it's also taxing on the environment so you can make a judgment call and whether you want to do that or not but just know that that's what the the top shelf past that you're seeing out on the market right now they're using RL water is that different than distilled water as far as a guru it should be clean right you're just trying to get clean water right in water yeah without minerals in it right with the no minerals in it distills not gonna have that or not gonna have much of that at all okay cool but clean water yeah all right next step what do we do man so you'll just well you harvest your plant yep so we I'm dry it what the [ __ ] is a freeze dryer man why does guru want a freeze dryer do we need one so as we go through this the bubble hash making right the very end the final step well I guess the final step of the bubble hash right would be to put it in there freeze okay sound and you know everyone's talking about that right now because it's a huge investment yeah but okay so we don't need so all we do is we dry our plant normally do we need to cure the plant so so there yes you can do cured flower most of the top shelf bubble hash or rosin that's being made out on the market right now is actually being done with fresh frozen material and that's where most of my experiences fresh frozen so we're trying the work we're not drying the trap so chop the plant you know you can let it set sit for up to two hours people have different opinions on that I like letting some of the moisture out of it right Wow tourette yeah and then put it in the freezer right let it freeze for at least 24 hours yeah and then that's when you can start the extraction process with making bubble hash and now we're not we're not breaking it up or anything we're not using a grinder you don't want to grind it too much but you also don't want too big of colas in there so we are using a grinder no it's just more of a it's just more of a manual manual cut smaller budge honest yeah okay fair enough man all right so come on give me some tips man so how long we soak in this for okay so let's get to get yeah I want the DVC to be at least Bank right off the bat yeah you know yeah so one of the little tips that you know I see out there some whenever I'm just searching around but not everyone and some people have heard it but then they forget it right is too when you put your frozen material into the washer we'll get into washers too but you put your material into the washer you let it soak for 15 minutes okay and that's going to allow your plant material to softened a little bit so it won't become brittle right now you're saying washer hang on a second yeah you're talking about the little bubble later machines man those things are cool I thought I was just being lazy yeah but they came out with them I don't think they're under they used to be under 200 bucks anyhow they're not expensive I thought they were a Chinese washing machines is what I thought they were like for a little tiny apartment to watch like one piece of clothing at a time I don't know anyway their coolest [ __ ] man those things ooh so that's what I call that a bubble later what do they call those things yeah I know there are different names sure but yeah I mean so many people at home will just manually sure maybe with a wooden spoon that works really great especially if you have the really smooth you know really smooth motion and do everything right all right but most of my experience has been using the washer sure and we've done a B test at the at the process at the company that worked out right and it the washer just yields is so much better and it's really the labor - okay I mean it's like start stirring it it's fun at first it's like trimming at first it's hot and then it gets old pretty cool yeah a lot and you could run two or three of those washers man I've went through those washes yeah they were great I mean all the top shelf bubble hash that's coming out they don't have workers in there stirring this no no I'm sure it exists but washers I agree with you man okay so I was just so we got a 15-minute soak yep thirty minutes oh and then we're throwing in in the machine we're turning on the recess for how long how long we running them actually so before we turn on the machine I want to point out that during that so before or after that so good I've seen it done both ways you can actually and what I'm about to say is fairly controversial among solvent less people okay because the moment you say dry ice people want to run because they think in the particulate in the end product right about using it to keep the water cold absolutely right so you you have your you have your 220 micron bag with your fresh frozen material in there right your ice water what you can do is just kind of pepper pepper some small pieces of dry ice and around the outside of the bag okay so we've got an ice water I forgot to explain that we though you've got to fill this bubble later machine yeah I've got to fill it with water with a bunch of ice you know whole trick to do it cold absolutely yep and then you just drop some dry ice in there and you know that what the dry ice does is it'll just take the temperature you know we had one of those infrared and thermometers take the temperature from like maybe 33 34 to to like 31 and since it's always moving it's not freezing so sure you can get it down 30 31 and that matters just getting it down a few more degrees helps in quality absolutely yeah really yeah and since you soak the material you're not going to get much particulate come through and what and what little comes through your catch dude you are [ __ ] detailed now looking at some of your some of your tips here yeah and he says frozen utensils so you're keeping the spoon that you're starting your ass so most people I don't have a sorry about that what you got hook it up you know most people's going to use a spoon similar to this right the easiest tip in the world is just to keep keep it frozen man like you're touching those you're trying to keep everything as cold as possible so you just keep this in the freezer so I'm curious you're and you're like independent research I know you guys have been playing with solvus do you keep your utensils frozen I mean it would makes having thoughts to do that okay see if it definitely makes sense to do that just because you're you're trying to you spent so much time keeping everything riding around 30 degrees then why would you want to touch it with something that's like 50 days in the process yeah so hey so okay so one of your other tips I mean these are kind of sir tips here man they got you really get the ball you know you get like a 2% game from them yeah and you're saying game from that before you know you have like a 10% better product you know I remember my buddy was in the racecars and he was talking about that he was like oh yeah like after 1/2 percent performance increase from that I'm like what a [ __ ] you spend $2,000 on a half percent or whatever but in this case man for if it cost you nothing to freeze the spooning you get a little bit little nudge here in the edge there oh that's how you get that six star man absolutely yeah anyway so one of the other tricks that I never used to do we I used to just take the the sink sprayer spray some water on the sides because what happens when it when the bubbly the bubble air these things bubble up well they used to say if it doesn't bubble it ain't worth the trouble right so it bubbles up and you'll get all sorts of collection.you bubbles all over the side there man so I would spray him with little sink hose but that wasn't very cold water yes what a lot of people are doing now is you get like a pump sprayer like you said like that metal guru would you throw a picture of this metal Chapin sprayer up man it's cool as hell yeah these are always available I would say just use it you can use these things for spraying other things but just use this one for spraying plain water yeah and this is really for kind of spraying and doing like a secondary wash on your homepage you have there to try and like spray through any trichome stalks or anything that might be left over and kind of clean up the trichome heads that are left in there I just thought really cool keeping stuff from sticking to the sides man yeah I know yep and another little tip is don't just use water use ice water all right lady go not throw some ice into that sprayer sure so okay so and now so what do you stack those bags on top of each other yeah yeah you know the the highest micron bag in my case is 220 would be on top right and then you just go down to these smaller bags now the 220 show that one because that's the different bag the 220 is the one that holds all of all the material there's a 220 so actually I'm glad you brought that up so the bag that goes inside the washer two-twenty bag right so that bag is just like you zip it up you know that's Rosa material in it's just a really simple bag that's just nothing but a big screen it's almost like the size of a screen 220 microns is big if the idea is to let it just to let everything wash through there without letting a bunch of plant material go through yep so then you do a second 220 after that again just to make sure that nothing leaked out you know that 220 mine has like a crappy zipper on it so yeah okay so you'll be in the later steps to to go ahead and get some of any any plant matter out yes what we're trying to do there okay so that's our that's our first one now what do we got after that so you know once once you go all the way down you know get you so each bag will have its own collection sure right and you know that's where that sprayer comes into play and then you scoop it out is that yeah yeah yeah how do you prepare that I mean I've done the horrible thing I've actually been like how [ __ ] I want to smoke I squeezed it yeah what do you do and then I've just let it dry before and it comes to kind of comes out is that really kind of strange how do you prepare it you'll scoop it out I mean it's I don't really know what to compare the consistence mud yeah it's a really since we have freeze dryers now you you don't have to get as much moisture out of it as you used to okay back in the day people would put screens on it and like press it with the paper yeah but you're smashing your tractor that's what I always felt like I was doing something wrong but I'm alright yeah so but now you know we can just scoop it out and almost just a very liquid form and just spread it out and then the freeze dryer will we'll pull all the moisture out all right have we gotten to the freeze-dried stage at this point man now is a good time you're talking about right why does guru when a freeze dryer so bad man it's all about turf preservation man yeah every year spending so much time and energy keeping everything cold through this whole process right that why would you want to ruin it ruin it and drying it and not lock in all those terpenes that you've spent so much time to save and collect and the freeze dryer lets you do that because it's just gonna pull out all the water or a frozen temperature so that you I mean so a freeze dryer is basically I dehumidifier inside of a freezer pretty much yeah it's a really simple way of putting it there I mean like the starting just a small at-home one is like three thousand that's what I was gonna say a three thousand dollar these middle fire inside of a freezer mm-hmm that's a hell of an investigator no because goober and frosty are going to create a do-it-yourself I heard something about this man I heard something about this geeking out here I heard the last time they defrost he was here just tell guru not to buy a freeze dryer yeah I talked to him I loved it man alright so as far as the preparations go when we're done what can what can we make out you absolutely yeah so once it comes out of the freeze dryer right so what just get a friend with a freeze dryer find a rich friend and tell him how easy it is to do this [ __ ] yes and let me know when you find there that's why I don't make much myself hey sure freeze-dried lots of other stuff too you don't have to just freeze dry half that's what I've been telling myself lately please try anything in half like food that's good for 20 years just add water so without a freeze dryer we can make basically a basic bubble hash right right so without a freeze dryer you're you are letting it air dry but even with the air dry you're going to have moisture kind of stuck in between those trichome heads that are all in you know I've got a chest yeah so so you know because that moisture is there it almost creates a consistency that you really can't break up those trichomes very well so you know the most common method is the micro planing anyone who's done bubble hashes you're probably done this or at least seen it done on videos yeah just spreading a really clear out so yeah driver you so that freeze dryer not only does it preserve Terps it saves a hell of a lot on labor because there is no micro planing with that I mean you said if you pull it out of the freeze dryer and it just pretty much breaks apart it's right incredible okay so we're getting to the freeze-dried I heard they have easy payment plans gurus have a Facebook targeted you as well yeah you get that in a rosin press from okay oh yeah okay so there's nothing I don't have a freeze dryer can I just take the my bubble hash and press it yeah absolutely so I'm trying to think yes people aren't gonna have access to a freeze dryer I can get I can't wait to get into what we can make if we get our buddy to spend twenty five miles but let's uh so what can we do for five hundred dollar rosin press what can we do with that okay so you can take that bubble hash right and put it in like a thirty six micron screen you can you can do you can do like a 72 micron screen as well cool the place that I work they actually use like a metal it was like a big sheet just huge industrial sheet they just cut pieces off of it okay I really like that metal versus the nylon so yeah you put it in just a really low micron screen right and press it at you know 151 155 and so this is it in terms of like the temperatures with a lot of people press Ross a net this is a pretty cold or low temp press yeah yeah one that's even at 155 just to put it in in perspective sure like I press flower at 185 to 210 you know depending on like quality okay so real so it is that cuz it's the water in it is that what you're doing it for I think it's just because it works better if you don't even mortar P and preservation right okay it's just not pressing at a high temperature just to avoid volatilizing off any of those terpenes that fall into like that temperature range makes sense to me man makes sense to me all right now guess what I got good news brother so I just found somebody with a freeze dryer man oh yeah I roll a brother man yeah oh yeah now what can we make man okay so you know from that point that's where some of the latest product that's on the market with the end product I mean it almost looks like butane extracted live resonator P early in a lot of its will even call it live rosin do we have anything this show see I'm sure I'm sure we can figure something out was all nice okay so there are some techniques in Vault so once you create your rosin you know you press you press that bubble hash out you have this rosin there are some post extraction techniques that even I don't know because I've been out of the game for over a year sure so there have been some new shogi right it's moving fast man yeah so yeah I can't keep up sure and there are some things I don't know yeah I've seen just bits and pieces I know some people are taking the rosin putting it on like 90 degrees I've seen different things but I can't definitively say this is what you do to create I've even seen stuff where people have gotten acid recrystallization solvent Leslie absolutely with rosin that has enough terpenes in it today I was the acid in that reaction where you really get like like diamonds and sauce right but solvent list diamonds and sauce somebody has been reading cannabis anca me I'm telling you man they were there there was like a formula for this in the 70s man there was AD gold made this book cannabis alchemy that was just the most they talked about what the heck was that man recrystallization I remember he had verses acetates he would make man and I was like I remember that [ __ ] that once I bought the gallon of ether I was out man yeah if anyone out if anyone in the DDC knows more about this ok let's talk about it let's start a discussion because it's immunity I think that's one of the benefits of having the DVC you know we can we can share some really good knowledge you know there there are those of us who worked in the industry at times and there are also people who just geeked out at home and focus nothing on nothing but cannabis and the man's an artist yeah yeah we need to pull that knowledge together so some of this post extraction process right if anyone knows a lot about it I know a couple people you know I know a couple of DGC members that do a lot of solvent list extraction and I bet they know quite a bit so let's start it hell yeah but it teach me something man first off is this real are you kidding me man I know what sauce is I know that that exists man sausage I get a little terpene yeah so so what just like with live resin each dispensary is creating a you know trying to create their own brain sir and they're calling a different things you know I see it called Jam sauce like solvent less sauce right you know you have to be like 17 labs here in Denver they're calling there's like a rosin Jam right isn't that what they're calling it yeah I would go to that oh yeah I mean dude so the stuff coming out of 17 labs it's just ridiculous and part of that Falls just to where their garden I mean it's a fear of quality and quality I can get some of these like six-star water hashes in full melt has less you have your garden dialed in to begin with yeah makes it makes so it again I just want to get back to this if I pull my [ __ ] out of the freeze dryer well how can I make what do I mean I can make any of these things I can make sauce I can make jam or you can take that you can take just what comes out of the the freeze dried right you know that we call that you know six star hash is what we've talked about a lot sure it's also just called full melt okay you can you can just drop that full melt right on your dab you know right on your nail and dab it that way and there shouldn't be any right I'm about to do that you know what some of that white stuff yeah me too okay so if I don't want to walk around white powder then man what can I do with it man that gets into the post extraction processing that some of those techniques okay and of course you know I'm talking about after you press it out sure yeah there are many things you can do from there to create different consistencies interesting man interesting all right man I learned something you know I get high yeah you're not a smoke man Stewart let's check out some of these goods survey this is really good appreciate the hell out of it yeah look where you're headed thanks brother yeah look for the plant check them out yeah [Music] [Music] it says to do [Music] true medicine [Music] Oh [Music] today [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "NYlxxpFq-0o": "what's going on everybody and welcome back to a sight for sore eyes in today's episode we're going to do a strain review on chemo I've got some flour and I've got some shatter and we're going to jump in on both and see how it does for us in the end we are going to give our opinion so you at home can make a decision if it's right for you or not so right off the bat chemo is a pure indica there is a date of type of smoke so that's what you like myself personally I smoke a lot of indicas I like that overall body helps it me back and relax I'll wake up in the morning start smoking indica and I go to bed at night smoking indica so that's just me but let's get in and see how it goes the way it's going to work I've got the Sherlock pipe here never been smoked out of so we're going to Chris in it today then I've got the water pipe water bone that we're going to use to get some water filtration see how it takes then and then to finish everything off I've got a DAB yeah it's there I've got a dev and we're going to dab on it see how that feels and then we're going to let it set in and that'll be pretty much that so take this moment right now pack a bowl pack a bomb and get ready to smoke with me I'll show you guys what I'm smoking on and then we'll pack this bowl up and get to smoke but it's the rush when it comes the battle time that I love teddy the million little look like me and when it came down to head up the slope like me tonight never been a guy with not a fan of the secret to ain't lookin God the Divas I played tracking my feet the way about moving sale they be put on my head come up that's the war you drop listen you know me but I bet that they don't know me now hold me dad's for the day don't do it every throw me here till you get lazy just the way that I am I still taste the Playboy bunny like it samity sam head in the mirror i can see your uber bucks to the selfie Sebastian burger at the crossroads money you're well I'm trying to live a little longer fortify health and they'd be glad when you fall in man would you say would you know people say hold me they're yummy looking around like where the head down can't blame me for the way to the end this war may be the way that I am a lot of people sit it hold me down got me looking around with a headache is crazy can't stick in my hand alright welcome back guys so let's start this off I'm gonna start off with smell okay I'm a big smelly guy sometimes you know maybe you can tell a little bit more by the look or whatever but the smell makes a big difference to myself personally so let's go ahead mmm so it's kind of fruity which is almost unexpected very light almost fuelly kind of like a sour kind of fuels some almost like a sour diesel type of smell mmm but it's almost it's kind of bright as well it kind of it kind of makes you want to stick your nose in deeper I like that if I had to rate this mom mmm got a citrus kind of led us to it um mmm that's nice I'm going to give it a seven it's nothing too strong it's not too overwhelming it's not as cushy kind of as I we're kind of like for like the pungency and stuff but it's a nice sweet mild kind of musky type smell and I definitely enjoy it so I would say it's seven so when it comes to the look you guys are able to judge yourselves from the images that I show you or that I've showed you so guys put in the comments what you thought the look look like and what it was ranked but from myself man I like the color the tricks crystally what I really liked about this particular strain though was just this not sure if you guys can hear but oh yeah like that crush man like you know if you're going to pack a bowl like this you don't really need to grind it up in an electric grinder or anything like that little finger bust and you're good to go in my opinion man there's the color there's the light purple going through it it's krista lea i I really enjoy the look on this one I would definitely give that a solid seven as well it's not the most beautiful buds that I've ever seen but the color it's very light green and the Purple's mixed together to give a really nice Hugh so I would definitely give that a solid seven my opinion you let me know what you think alright guys I have done a whole lot of talking so far in this episode and I think it only makes sense that we finally get down to smoking let's practice bad boy up I don't really care about mess yeah see what I mean you can just kind of grind that in your fingers and you're good to go as a fat bowl I think hit all right you guys taste test number one you know what definitely a very smoky flavor Woods woody now I kind of thought I'd have a little bit of a sweetness or something coming through with the color not so much on this let's go back in it's nice all honestly though it's not it's very not harsh it's really not harsh like if I had to smoke this for a bit I wouldn't really mind it so that's pretty smooth that wasn't bad guys so let's jump on to the next one oh oh there it is oh oh there it is okay my body temperature has risen up that was my second kind all right I like that all right let's go in on number two and we'll see how this does this cheers kind of the exact same flavor strange and this is my flavor saver too gross and bro it's so we'll find it yet still the very model campfire woodsy not wrong nothing wrong then again very mild it's an enjoyable smoke hmm try one more um oh wow good good note I was good so far I'm really enjoying this strain they go ahead jump in I know the flavor of the weeds like definitely smoky oh let's go ahead and final round everything off and take this dab and we'll find out what the way the dab tastes I'll compare kind of a middle grade and then we'll let that I'll settle in for this overall high and then I guess that'll be that just want to let you guys know over the weekend we are going away camping for a couple of days so there may be some time where there's no videos I'm not gone again just on him make sure you guys follow us on instagram at a sight for sore eyes if you guys want to stay up to date with what's happening over the weekend so i'm going to go ahead heat this up and we'll get this final judgment on the go and I yeah let's do it all right guys let's give it this taste test and see what his stones like in hindsight would it make more sense not to use flavored water oh but wow with that being said me that shatter oh he got puts a beating oh yeah oh when it comes with the flour I'm not to go for like a five that's a fix for taste it wasn't bad it was really smooth the smoothness of it is what one wins it over for me um the shatter definitely a 74 the taste I have no problem giving it that um and right now guys I feel super Estonian my body temperature has risen up I've got some damn so it's going but the indica hasn't really chilled really mellow feeling right now buys I'm just excited for this drive we have a couple hours on the way out and it's going to be nice man it's gonna be a good weekend so up until then guys I hope you enjoy this video I wanted to do a bit longer a session this time something with me kind of just talking and hanging out with you guys put down in the comments man when you guys started this video what you thought of the look if you think I misjudged it other than that though I think that's basically it guys we rounded everything up it was basically solid sevens except for the taste on the flower was a little bit lower but a solid straight if you're like me you like him because and you like to relax definitely recommend this to anybody so until next time guys that's it for me I'll catch those eyes around away these you", "FXRrvwq62Aw": "what's up YouTube is free lemon 420 just want to come in guys a update on the garden deficiency was going on here everything's looking real good they are really swollen definitely I've actually started flushing all not feeding them anything anymore we are technically in it's let's see here so today we're day 32 today on flower just shy of week 6 but everything is looking beautiful [Music] nice and swollen looks great this big thing here Wow this pen is our impact on a lot of weight so looking real good happy with Lehrer theme that's my idea how big they are so everything is looking really good they are all the hairs are that nice horse yellowish-brown the little white katana here's the starting to suck into suckin now been called in they're definitely in swell hope they're getting real nice and fat and guys I know this camera can't pick it up but they are super crystally [Music] so a lot of resin production going on with them right now [Music] I was just like that pick up the real colors and they're just beautiful completely having just let them hang out not again I'm not doing anything we're getting straight water from now on because like I'm having with with Hari everything of so I just wanted to go ahead and just wipe it up two more weeks and they'll be ready to come down I am cutting him [Music] but yeah everything is looking great if you guys noticed no co2 in this room of taking it out of here and not put it in this on this door my name four of my autos and as we will soon get that seal - and in the form of it's also was blown out with southern they still coming out and one out across these Plains but right now I think the common alleles from us enemy additional growth from them so I'm going to put that co2 [Music] that's what's going on with the girls again Aaron fans looking great I don't know if you could pick it up you can abilities but these leagues are starting starting to plan starting to caramelize off of this cell and all the leads are starting to turn around look like that not so much on this plane here because I can't out we've got four blasts update this one is kind of a little bit behind all the other 40 even though they're being you know you tell the buzz are just huge on it so not behind and system blood production weighted or anything but is it more of them mature to have the widening of it as well as referred to but they're starting to all turning nice yellowish around like restore your feet officer okay I'll use off giving about a gallon and a half every two days that is Sloane and always Bobby over three days and so I can tell they're starting to get towards that final phase it's taking the best prevent us before but everything's looking great just want you guys are updated you see what with the TAC bomb you guys put look at the autos there's the co2 no I got it hooked up to this fan in here [Music] see how big these girls are getting this is much others coming here guys and I sit in this room all the time and I just come in and I sit and I talk to him look at him grow just check things out this is my little meditation room but look how big these are growing so fast and that's why I decided to kind of bring my co2 in here because in the beginning this was just gonna be whatever I get you know I just want to kind of experience a that I've grown some models before but the more I'm the longer I'm with these things the more I'm starting I'm liking them and so I'm trying to put a little bit more into them then I would before I just say oh me from dirt and some give them some water giving the light and just have that it you know do whatever you do you see even this bad boy here the reason is so stunted it's because I had a mishap with it when it was probably and I broke one of them the first primary release leaves off by accident of course but if they catch again and now is catching up this one there's pretty much like a day this one here is like a day and a half behind it's probably behind this one but it seems to be a you can tell that a little quite that height difference there but it's coming along really nice this one is full white hairs all over it's odd notice it's definitely into this maturity there to start doing this thing and this one it's not too far behind but I just want to give you guys a quick update hit you see what's going on like in [Music] our babies m'ladies my dear but this is this point that you guys with the girls looking great because all over [Music] yeah this is one of these um this is start off with a training session than I do get to these back or the girls it's alright I'm looking forward to it being forward to it alright YouTube just want to give you guys a quick update [Music] peace", "tPFSsZXR5WE": "what's up YouTube this is green thumbing 420 I just want to come and give you guys a quick update that just see what's going on with the ladies on my garden today is week five day 35 on the Challenger so today is we find everything is looking like you see it is looking great they are swelling getting bay believe that starting to get yellow blue this one going in that final phase technically I got a little we've been feeding but I think I'm gonna start to flush out I think I'm now babe go ahead and start with lust in the day also flowers so maybe that's why they're starting to yellow it already I don't have efficiency so here well I don't know I'm thinking about a bigger me start blessing this week or they as casualties right there are some samples that I've just I took yesterday the giving zone and the push me back up the evil wrenches was down all the way down there another said [ __ ] they're not getting any like this all just go ahead and cut so I got a few samples there go out a little bit but this is one of the Kennedy here they are dense [Music] or [Music] [Music] so guys with my THC problem everything will be doing doesn't think we are in final phase here [Music] [Music] all day my camera sucks and plus then it's not filtered because of this light but the hairs are starting to turn orange on all of them this this plant is the only one over the ears of the mostly are still all-white lens they are turning brown or yellow orange is and all of the leaves are starting to turn yellow this this one is a little behind in all these demos service a lot of pocket a little bit this one is a little bit behind because these are a lot more yellow on these on these and the there's a lot of the flock Awards here on the on these three as well and the pulse of the Sun I'm gonna give it a sellout Wednesday I think well actually tomorrow because tomorrow should be a warning day for me anyway so I don't see that if I'm going to start flushing or not also they're they're not taking up as much water as they used to because I'm starting to see usually I water every that every so and usually the sorrel is a lot drier the way yeah I mean this is still not and evil this is my blind date or tomorrow may be really fun for today but I'm just starting on until already know that they're starting to take a little bit less more than they use usually do these are kind of getting towards the last page but TVC stream from what our are some fans finishing flowers all they think they can finish anywhere from six to eight weeks solve this I guess he'll arrange that Kristin six weeks I've got my gold it's the students Allah don't take them all the way to eight but I wasn't going to get really dense and I'm looking for a real law the song long as possible so I really want them to to widen develop fair hopefully I'll try though simple new neurons but that's what's going on with the garden everything is looking beautiful can be more could be more happy and let me show you something else too even with my autos because when I was in here last night I did a update last night on this room and I kind of pulled my th5 I forgot to bring it down for this light was kind of all the way up here but even from like these is stretched and it just amazing how quick fastest these Springs will grow so it stretched a little bit trying to get to the light I brought it back down to where I'm comfortable with the what I like it at so but just want to come and show you those that of course that little runt there's not doing anything it's still it's catching on though but they haven't done anything yet alright YouTube piece that just won't account as we go back is so you go back over here to the the garb again this is in you hope you and look at all the way to the guys I think I'm going to I'm going to change this room this I'm going to actually start spotting that's my next project I'm going to actually build one and it's one thing is going to be like fine using this sense of perspective I'm going to probably have money it must go all the way to here looking probably about a five by five like that strong man that's why we come it's not like trying to think but to get different results that results in all the tracks optimized and I've definitely watched a lot of videos of squatting and Devin see the benefits of making sword at each and so especially for this especially it is like they're all just imagine this could just be like just like this imagine if it was right up here so that's my next project as soon as these go down swag that so that when my next grow difficult leaf Superstock on board to squat itself so you guys what that looks like also changing my pots I'm going to smart pots I've been thinking about it and considering the WC I don't know there's that thing that's just a minute my next evolution I'm just a so-called person if I'm a country boy so I like so I don't like dirt so but we'll see but I'm gonna definitely try smarter pocket because I know about optimizing might grow and I know that what dwc your moves can get them to get more oxygen than they can in these plastic glass and even with smallpox but I know a dirty is dirty but we'll see miss this one so I'll see you guys next week which will be new six Anderson's one on one of in peace", "3dT7rK776DE": "hey what's going on YouTube this is Steve Stevenson with Maryland marijuana review how you folks doing today today before we get into this product to get a quick disclaimer all objects in this reviews are definitely in complying with Maryland state law everything I've got here is purchased 100% legally got receipts to prove it and yeah anybody that's under 21 should definitely find something else it's I mean I know that this is entertaining but this just isn't gonna work and I'm already using here in mine this is just me doing my thing it's my own personal opinion I'm not supported or I'm not getting kickbacks from any specific group of people or a dispensary or grow or even so the product we were here to review today is G is a G spot by G leaf um yeah like G leaves buds if you go online and get a look at them they've got some pretty cool looking grass all things considered oh yeah this is a fairly decent but all around it's a well filled in bud but it's not like crazy dense it doesn't have a super amount of denseness to it um a quarter of it actually took up two large containers so in that sense if you're you know yeah that's a good thing the color is a light green with some brown hairs but the brown hairs you can barely see them they're kind of glued down with a layer of crystals so that's pretty cool I'm definitely not complaining they're of the smell is pretty burden it's a robust powerful mint smell with a hint of skunk but definitely more mint than skunk in the inter peens I don't necessarily know what that means I know there's a mint terpene but I don't know about a skunk chirping nothing here nor there so yeah this is G spot by G leaves and I got this from nature's medicine off around 40 this particular product because they have a tier system with their marijuana this was from the top tier stage and I think it was 360 an ounce and they were kind enough to allow me to mix and match and I did just that so let me see if I can track down a lighter here I could've swore I had a lighter in this project somewhere and if y'all want to get your lighters ready with me it would be my absolute pleasure to blaze with you digitally of course and um this is G spot from G Leaf in nature's medicine it's got a little bit of a minty smell to it but it's definitely a smooth bud it hits smooth that you know overall it's got a really good taste almost like a buttery kind of taste but yeah it's mellow on the lungs um definitely not to me it doesn't pack too much of a punch on the lungs and I want to say the THC on this particular product was around 23% the majority of the buds I reviewed there th sees usually are in the 20s but uh yeah this is G spot from G leaf and the dispensary I got this from was nature's medicine off around 40 it's definitely not a bad find and with buds like this if I put my lighter up to match yeah it's a pretty decent size but right there you don't I'm saying all things considered so yeah you could definitely get some nice buds for a photos check me out on my Instagram all one word Maryland marijuana review if you want to get a better look at these buds or a zoom in pic um yeah I guess that's it for this one folks I do appreciate your time and look forward to doing the next one Steve Stephenson Maryland marijuana review you folks have a good one", "p2-tFISTcks": "about a game trail blaze with Tim here today I'm just going to take a few moments and I'm trying to explain to you the difference when it comes to poisonous and non-venomous water snakes so stick around and let's find out here in the southern United States of America and most of the southeast areas when you tend to enjoy outdoor activities a lot longer in the year because of warm temperature that being said comes along with a lot of outdoor water recreations along with that comes dangerous [Music] water moccasins in the southeastern United States there is generally around four different species of actual water snakes you have the banded water snake the green water snake the brown water snake and the cottonmouth also known as a water moccasin in the next several Clips I'm going to show and explain to you what to look out for when it comes to knowing the difference between a venomous and non-venomous water snake so you want to watch this is the general region in which you will encounter these types of snakes the first of our water snakes is the braided water snake then we have the brown water snake as well as the green water snake and let's not forget about the King cottonmouth water moccasin the braided water snake is the smallest of the four different species has a round pupil and generally you will not see these they're very to themselves non-venomous next is our green water snake as it resembles its name from its color large bodied reptile and they're pretty invasive you don't see them very often on to the brown water snake same round eyes low profile large body reptile non-venomous unto the water moccasin they have a large head and always have their head at a 45 degree angle slitted pupils and always have a distinctive stripe across their head no matter what very deadly unlike popular myths these things are not going to come at you unless you piss them off they're also when they open their mouth up and ready to strike you'll see that they have white that's why they called it a cottonmouth very large body reptile pack-a-punch can put you in a hospital even if they're black and color you're still going to see the stripe going across her head 45-degree angle and slitted pupils there you guys have it appreciate you dropping by I hope you learned something leave me a comment down below and let me know if there's something I left out or something that everyone else can get some use from know the difference makes a lot of difference okay because you know a lot of people just treat any snake as if it's going to bite and kill them and that's the natural instinct if you don't have to go around killing every snake you see because they're just minding their business like the rest of us thank you so much until next time I'll see you then take care", "6XPGQgWHLqk": "here are some trick water snakes they're really cool because they have pearl on the inside so you can see like how cool they are when they swirl anytime you move

on my head", "mJ9oH6AQle0": "okay there we are i think that's top of the hour sorry i am getting back into the swing of things and trying to figure out uh my setup and how everything's working i've tweaked a lot of stuff and i've got new audio boards and extra wires and different headphones and so i'm a little flustered trying to figure out how to make sure everything's working that's what i get for not testing ahead of time uh welcome back everyone i apologize for my long absence on the stream i was out sick for a while there was a cold that ran rampant through my house uh and then also i ended up just with some scheduling conflicts and it has been busy so i do apologize but with that said we are in the middle of hacktoberfest and after a slightly bumpy start uh to the month digitalocean got things uh more or less squared away uh the big change is hacktoberfest repositories in an effort to cut down on some spam they're making repositories opt into it so the material design project is uh or i should say has been opted into hacktoberfest so if people are looking to get their pull requests in to earn a shirt great uh we would love to have people come in i i wrote up a bunch of uh initial tickets and i think they were gone in like 24 hours so i've been largely overwhelmed with the huge number of people that have jumped in and been contributing on top of the normal contributors so thank you thank you to everybody um unlike some repositories there hasn't been that much spam i don't deal with a lot of spam with the material design repository i don't know why i don't seem to get as much as some people that were complaining there's been one or two that have come through that got flagged and valid but for the most part people contributing actually seem to be legitimate and just trying to get involved some people may be still learning uh github for the first time and that's that's the point of hacktoberfest so we welcome all newcomers and if you are uh new to it just leave a comment let us know we're happy to to help out i've also been just with my chaotic schedule i've been somewhat ignoring the getter chat room i apologize but jasper has been on there and every time i check in seems to be doing an amazing job answering questions so thank you jasper if you're watching i really do appreciate all of the help um it's been amazing having so many more active people on there helping people out and answering questions so for tonight that was a very long-winded introduction my plan is to dive back into the material design stuff there's been a lot of braking changes and stuff that's been merged in in preparation for a 4-0 release one of the things i'd like to do is get the 40 release um prepped potentially even to support.net 5 which is scheduled to release later this year i think november not sure but sometime in the near future we're in october you're in the early hours of the morning not quite so i am uh west coast u.s so it is late in the evening for me about 9 00 p.m so it is late um and i've been doing a lot of early mornings so we will see how how much energy i have to go i've got my caffeinated beverage of choice which my green screen happily deletes for me there we go so i've got caffeine and we'll see how good the caffeine is at keeping me going tonight um yeah so i'm gonna dive through some of the material design stuff not a lot of rhyme or reason to my madness tonight and we will see uh what comes from that and once again i didn't i didn't prep very well so let's jump forward and let's make that a little bit bigger for people so i am going to lead with pull requests there's been a lot of pull requests that have gone in and unfortunately because there's been so much activity some of these got blocked for merging just to merge due to merge conflicts so if that's your pull request i apologize this one down here actually interests me the most and i think we actually also have pipeline failures because the one thing that i don't see in this list is my um the pack icon pull request that's almost always open because on a nightly process i've got a a pipeline that goes out and does it and so i might actually lead with that let me let me go and grab that devops instance uh and let's take a look because i i'd like to get that pipeline going i'm i'm very lazy and so i i enjoy trying to get things as efficient as possible uh so let's see here uh where are we switch directory and i want to be in i think this one sorry i've got a got way too many devops directories way too many projects hey that looks like where i want to go okay so this guy here and once again we'll make that a little bit bigger so main pull request is fine but i think it's under i think it's a release pipeline yeah so big red x that's not good so it's been failing for a while and i'm kind of curious what goes on so for people who aren't familiar with what what is happening here so there is a uh a tool uh the resource gen tool that can generate the pack icons it goes out to the material design icons.net downloads the latest stuff runs through it generates out the latest set of icons and if there's new icons or any changes to existing ones it just opens a pr for me so i'm lazy and then all i do is i look at the pr and go yeah it looks good submit it um so something about this pipeline is failing and i'd kind of like to know what because it clearly blew up a while ago uh this project references nougat packages that are not on this machine okay so on an initial clone this guy is coming down attempting to do a restore and this is broken um i have a hunch i know which change did this so we were using um packet to do our our restores and i have a sinking suspicion that when we switch to doing packet as a net local tool that this guy decided to blow up so it's under a second solution so we'll just fire that guy up here real quick and we'll go and look and see what what are these nuget packages and how are they being referenced because that's that's likely part of our thing i also saw a pull request that was designed to change this tool which that pull request might actually fix this so we might just go and look at this so oh so this is using the old cs proj oh that's fun that is that is fun and exciting so let's let's unload the project and let's edit this guy okay so what what exactly are you referencing okay so this is probably part of the issue so i see a bunch of stuff here that are being referenced this is the old um package config structure what i was looking to see is if this thing was also using packet or not and it doesn't look like it is um that's interesting that those versions are out of sync so that's interesting okay so i think where i'm going to lead is i'm going to go actually back i want to look at that pr that was porting the md resource gen over to net core so this looks like so and i'm also curious why so the command line so there's conflicts on the branch is part of the issue but i'm sort of curious i'm sort of curious to check this thing out and then just rebase it and see what happens because i have a sinking suspicion so specifically what i'm looking to to see is the change because i'm not real concerned about some of these and honestly web client probably just needs to go away this is this was written a very very long time ago um and so fancy new shiny http client is the the latest hotness for doing it and honestly i this is a kind of a weird console app i would switch it to using the system command line library all kinds of other fun jazz this is just some some basic cleanup cleans up some of the xml interactions great great great switches from oh i guess this is still linked to xml but changes the base types looks like largely goes through and just cleans up some of the code this kind of looks like what i expect to see with the jet brains oh oh excellent so this um explanat exclamation mark here this is um what is called the null forgiveness operator but the presence of this seems to imply that nullable reference types have been enabled which excites me so this is really what i want to see so it switches to the new project type changes the output target framework clears out all of that stuff removes the generated template cs and goes to town on everything looks like a rev of the package versions too if i'm not mistaken yeah significant rev of the package versions to the latest that is awesome wax the packages config dependencies storage none i'd have to look at exactly what that is i'm not sure why these ones need to be done i'm not sure if the packet changes are even necessary given that this project wasn't using packet to begin with so let's start with let's go and just check this out so pull request 2124. so everybody's favorite get kraken and i've got way too many things so 21.24 so let's grab this guy check it out and we'll do a quick rebase and just see see what's going on so as you can see this guy was done way back here it's actually interesting because this is the last time the pipeline icon shows up in my history so it must have broke shortly after this point uh let's see is my master delayed no my master's up here his remote master i got i got too many remotes being shown okay so this guy here uh yeah i don't really care about that that's just because visual studio is open and trying to be helpful for me close you down i don't really want you to be helpful discard please thanks um i think what i want to do is just rebase this onto master and we'll resolve the conflicts then because i i should get the same same conflicts here uh let's see so we want this one here yeah because i want to take the master change of that and this guy is deleted so we'll get rid of that continue rebase okay so that didn't seem that hard so given that let's grab this and verify it compiles so if this guy compiles and runs i'm very very inclined to switch over to using him and then i'll change my release pipeline because i think the breakage on the pipeline here is the task in question that's being used so if we go back icon update edit this guy is using an old school visual studio build task and i think we just throw it away and just use the straight up.net cli task and be done with it because that'll do the nougat restore and all the the cool hip happy things for me which would be awesome okay so there's that let's reload the project let's make sure you work oh uh one other thing i i forgot an announcement uh let's see spokane.net user group so um i am speaking at a local user group coming up in november it is a free event it is on all of the uh essentials of c sharp nine so myself and my boss mark michaelis who is the author of the essential c-sharp book series um we will be giving that presentation is it november 14th november 10th so it's a it's a tuesday evening 5 45 pacific um i think 5 45 is just when the the uh the live stream is going to go up um but i don't think the actual talk is going to actually start until six usually there's some sort of like uh fun quiz or whatnot or kind of thing that's gonna go on in the first 15 minutes just to give people a chance to join in and whatnot and then a couple hours of diving through all of the awesomeness that is c sharp nine which will be coming at the same time that dot net five drops so just be aware uh that is very much forthcoming okay so back to this so first thing i note the dependencies yellow triangle this is usually what you get when you clone a new package and the nuget packages need to be pulled down so there's a functional change that happens when you switch to the new sdk project style from the old one so you'll notice there's no more packages config and more importantly when these packages get downloaded they get downloaded to a shared package cache on your system it's usually under your user profile in a dot nuget folder but it means that all projects that reference the same version of the package will use the shared instance rather than having a separate one checked out everywhere so you get a lot better performance and i believe i saw this hang on one second where's the unload blind or stupid oh i'm not on this um i believe because i think this is an issue that i saw with the the the preview that i'm on a visual studio is it the icons don't update after they initially get downloaded so they're now all downloaded and updated this guy runs i hope look at that that is that is wonderful okay so the fact that that guy compiles and that the code is largely identical i don't think i need to do much more than this um i think what we are going to do here is i am going to force push this uh and hope that i have permissions so question i have permissions so that'll rev the the pull request so i should see back over here if we hit refresh that will resolve the conflict so this guy should no longer show with conflicts and the the main pipeline will kick off and run which is kind of a worthless ceremony at this point because the main pipeline isn't going to actually compile this project what we are interested in doing though is changing this guy so i want to update this pipeline and go through and test it so i want to add a new step in here net core add right so it's not a build command that i want i just want to kick off a run uh actually i guess you know i guess we could just let this thing compile and do a build because the generate icons is going to do that as well so you'll note this guy's all the way down hidden underneath build configuration which i assume there must be a variable declared for that yeah build configuration release okay so i could we could we could we could whack both of these steps and just do it in one sh do it in one shot so let's just disable that disable that for the moment um i think so let's let's fire up let's fire up terminal here real quick so d colon uh uh change drives please uh cd dev and that one and so i think what i'm what i might want to do here see md regen i i think we can just do a net run and i think if i do icons it'll do exactly what i want uh oh dot net space run and then the the double hyphen if my memory is correct yeah so it's downloading icon data um the double hyphen will say anything after this is raw arguments that i want to pass to the um to the actual executable so we can just yeah so this guy is off to the races of running perfect which is exactly what we want to see so we can eliminate two steps and just do a straightup.net run and all we need to do is make sure that we change our directory into the same directory as the project so the dotnet commands if your working directory only contains a single project or a solution it'll just assume that that's the one you want and use it so you don't have to specify anything else as long as you're in a directory that only contains one of those if there's more than one and it can't figure out you know what to do then it gets confused so this takes it this just takes it a minute because it has to do a lot of thinking and crunching and we've added some smarts to it so i'm gonna let that guy sit and think about what he's done for a moment oh could not find part of the directory uh that may be a bug that we need to address because this looks like it may have put together something bad oh that's an interesting problem i'm willing to bet it's making the assumption that the working directory is something like bin debug oh yada yada yada all the way down that's probably a really bad assumption so we'll go and we'll go and fix that here in just a second yeah but i think as far as the pipeline is concerned we're going to get rid of these two tasks because this one was just literally executing the compiled one and we're just gonna let's see dot net run arguments i think all we do is let's see so not that we just want dash dash icons right because that was the only thing that we did oh we actually probably want to do um what was the variable name configuration or similar build configuration so we can do uh a dash c and pass build configuration so that'll that'll do it with release or whatever we change that to so we don't need path to project specified uh yeah that should be fine that should be fine the working directory is not fine we need to change this and i think what we're going to do is just uh yeah so we just need to switch the working directory to there and away we go i think that'll get we're going to save that first of all and then let's go and check this thing uh let's see icon thing yeah so you'll note our output oh that is tiny let's go bigger there that's better that's better okay so if we look here we saw a bunch of this i downloading icon data got icons updating enum right so doom this guy here pulls it down got some items where's that got get source data i don't know if that's that doesn't feel overly useful okay so let's clean some of this up um i'm not going to change away from the web client stuff at the moment i'm more interested in the writing of the files yeah this is what i was worried about right is this guy here write all text he's making some very large sweeping assumptions about the working directory so pac icon factory is here so in the main repository or i guess here right so we need to get ourselves back up to the root and then all the way down i'm almost wondering if it's better to have i'm wondering if it would be good to j to have the the command line pass it in or which or if it should try and derive it trying to decide maybe we should be a little smarter and just trying to decide how many assumptions i want to make because like the the cheater solution is for me to go oh i already know the working directory that this thing is going to be run as let's just use that i'm thinking the but then that has problems because now if i f5 this guy it's a slightly different working directory and that's a problem right um i'm thinking it might be better if this guy simply made the assumption that some parent directory is going to contain this right um i'm almost wondering if we just iterate until we do it uh so let's do this for string current directory gets path uh get full path from here right uh loop while uh what isn't a path uh is there a well i i because if i remember right get directory returns null at the root i think is how that works uh let's see let's just confirm that interactive boom so i would like to test uh so for people who haven't seen this the interactive console is just a free c-sharp rebel you can just dive in here and start typing c so get directory name but and i'm pretty sure if i feed it something like c colon slash right this guy escape that right is going to return null okay perfect so we will loop while uh current get directory name is not null and current directory will get pat path get directory name so it's also worth noting get directory name is kind of a misleading sort of a misleading method if we look at this guy here and expand out his docs uh returns the directory or null if the path denotes a root directory or is null uh let's see if the path does not contain directory information oh so maybe we should check for empty null or empty now that'll work but it'll get you the the path to the parent directory so let's let's try that so while not string is null or empty all right so we'll do that clear that poof and so if file dot or i'm sorry let's do this uh string path gets path combined so current directory and i want to hunt for this and actually i think i think what we're going to do is this we're going to we're going to chain uh we're going to change this up a little bit so if uh so this is usually a horrible idea so in general checking for file exists is fraught with peril because there's no guarantee that after i check that the file exists so i check this i get back a boolean right as soon as i get inside this if statement i have zero guarantees that that file still exists none whatsoever so aside from that badness we're going with it this is just a helper app i'm not worried about being overly overly pedantic so we will then do file write all text passing path and content all right so we'll do we'll just do this so i think what we're going to do is we're going to change this guy up here and we're going to make this guy path combine so put these together for me because i don't want to think too hard about slashes because that's a lot of thinking so that'll put those together and this is going to change from file name to file path and then this goes away right so that now works so he's going to walk up from his current directory regardless of what that is because i could try to get like the directory of the current assembly or something and walk from there but i think we're just going to say we're going to assume that our working directory is in a child that will contain the passed in file path and go from there that way if it's in a bin debug release i don't care i don't care if it gets nested one level deeper or not right so let's clear that out we'll just recheck our net run and confirm that this works and then we'll push one more change up to this branch just to confirm that this guy works this this thing also has extra stuff for like generating the color templates which those have been a little less helpful um especially since the material design stuff has changed so with the icon generation very very handy i kind of wish i hadn't cleared my output because this looks like a different thing than what it did before so let that guy go i assume if i check here right yes the the check should show why do i not see checks i'm a little confused why i don't see checks being run on this thing do i have another bug no see some of these are getting these hey yes robert wpf and at the moment fixing my fixing my pipeline for auto generating icons because nothing's better and it's very nice being able to delete that that and replacing it with net run no thinking just go do the thing and then a bunch of stuff to do get checks and all that kind of jazz because i can do that kind of thing yeah does the audio sound okay robert i don't know if you were here at the beginning hey marcus how you doing i am a little shocked excellent i uh so this guy broke interesting.net build air why did this pipeline break we've got pipeline problems oh boy wait boy bae okay well i'm not going to stress about that because i'm about to push a change to it here in just a second uh sweet that's good to hear so for those people who uh have no idea what robert's talking about we did a wpf change today to enable virtualization on an item's control which is fun uh let's see question for marcus do you have a course for beginners in wpf so of course not really however i do have something that will likely interest you um this url here so uh youtube kabood.dev and there is a uh there is a video and or videos here where was it called um was it i think it was under my my budgeting one uh learn c sharp and wpf so this guy here this so this one here is i would say a very good one for for learning um and then there was this is a bit of a follow-up to it the app center one but this gets you a little bit deeper into deployment options which is probably beyond what you're looking for but i would i would suggest starting with that one um i go into a lot of it just kind of laying it out it's worth noting that wpf is uh highly opinionated uh people have various ways that they'll tell you that you quote unquote should or shouldn't write wpf with a large camp of people heavily favoring um mvvm oh yeah and pluralsight as well i think correct me if i'm wrong robert but i thought uh wasn't pluralsight doing either some deal or something this month where it was oh deal ends today in two hours yeah so there was a deal going on on pluralsight um i remembered i had seen something about it um so if you're interested there's a lot of really good courses up up there as well so if you are interested i will say i have not uh specifically watched the wpf ones myself but i've had other people tell me that they they found them to be very useful so definitely a worthwhile resource so this guy did go and generate the pack icon stuff which is great um it does interest me a little bit that it generated oh yeah so there's all of that there's all of that okay um i'm a little shocked that i see the data factory and not the enum value typically there's two changed files because you can see it's it's adding enum values here uh so that that mildly concerns me that that didn't edit both but i see oh probably because there was a who didn't uh okay so here's what we need to do here this thing needs to return when it finds it and then down here console right line warning failed to find right we need to we need to give ourselves some some useful output because not having output is a great way to be very very confused when things don't work uh file path see i'm a junior uh because the beginner's materials are very difficult to find thanks yeah no problem and i will say the the thing i would would encourage you to do the most is come up with something that you that you want to build um i usually recommend to people that because people will ask you know what programming language or or things should i start with it's like it doesn't really matter but find something that you're interested in building and build that because if you're interested in it you're going to stick with it and it's going to last a lot longer for you so let's see update enum this is source file blah blah blah i'm just trying to figure out if this this is just looking for a template which is fine um kind of wondering because this one explicitly excluded the templates and i'm wondering if maybe so here real quick auto format and i think i actually want to bring in the templates i think right um why don't i see the template files where are they palette oh so it is here oh this is just removing it from the compile set there's still the none am i am i missing it oh they're right they're literally right here in front of me uh because it's being used by another process so that tells me oh this thing is still running why did that hold on to it does it have a read line at the end of this thing hahaha i think we're going to just get rid of that there's no reason he uh let's see just hit the c development fundamentals and scored 280. uh i'm better than 98 of the developers on the deviation according to the test on pluralsight congratulations robert i've never actually done that so don't laugh but the very first microsoft certification test that i took was on c-sharp and i actually failed my first time i was very disappointed and i was a little annoyed because some of the questions that i missed i felt were either worded poorly or or let's see there was several that i felt were worded poorly or were misleading and i was and it kind of felt like i was being tested on my ability to read into the questions rather than on knowledge of c sharp it was it was it was annoying after that i then made it my mission to go back and beat the test which i did eventually do so they they are beatable so the tests are good for testing your knowledge just don't put too too much stock in your results unless you get good ones like you did in which case put a lot of stock in them that's important okay so we'll clean that up clean that up okay just because just because i haven't gotten it to work all the way probably good maybe let's get one good successful run out of this and then we'll go from there because this would definitely break us so let's see here we want to gotta put on the resume yes you do uh let's see so that's just formatting at some point i should probably change my formatting it's defaulting to four spaces for all xml based files and i don't know if i like that everyone has their own preference uh let's see fixing working directory when tool is executed from project root no longer pausing at the end of execution so the it's worth noting the reason that people used to actually go through and put this type of stuff the console is input redirected at the end of their um code is because before what would happen is your terminal window would come up and then if nothing stopped it it would just close not overly helpful so what they uh so what microsoft did in i think it was might have even been like one of the later releases of visual studio 2017 is now when you f5 into them the default is to leave the terminal window open the only time it it automatically shuts down is if you launch it from outside of a visual studio or similar which is yeah add a console read key last line the only problem is with that console read key robert is it can screw you up for automation right because then you have to also check if input is redirected so that if you want to say run this tool in a pipeline that it doesn't just hang your pipeline waiting for that input that never comes okay so that finished and if we look ah there we go now the enum got updated great lots of enumi stuff that's what we like to see and then the pack icon factory so these changes i don't want because these are generated so those go away um and these guys come in here uh let's see not longer no longer pushing at the end of execution one of my co-workers shared one of those websites where you can go and measure your typing skill i described myself before taking the test as an advanced hunt and pecker and unfortunately at the end of it what did i come up with i think i did 45 words per minute with like a 98 accuracy i discovered that i work with people who are really good typers i am not one of them so proof that you can be a developer and not be very good at typing means you're going to wait a little while okay pipeline so i think what i now know is i can remove this task i can remove this task and now my entire pipeline is clone the repo right it automatically checks itself out into a particular branch robert i'm legally blind if i had to hunt and pack i'd be horrible that is true thank you robert i am i am a better hunt and pecker than a blind guy i guess i i ended up not posting my initial stats right away because i was looking at everyone else's and i felt bad i'm like man i'm literally at the bottom and then ultimately i was like you know what screw it let's just post it i was like for all i know maybe it'll encourage somebody else to post and not feel as bad about themselves so we did okay save that save that and i think what we're going to do is this guy here is probably kicking off another run right now and i'm a little curious if this guy's going to fail or pass it kind of shocked me that it failed before kind of shocked me a little bit because this pipeline should not be failing because it's not building that other tool so it so let me just double check the latest run so checking the uh the branch that these things were from yeah the last build off of master was friday shoot almost a week ago that's how long it's been wow i gotta get on this more and it succeeded and then a bunch of pull request builds and they all well aside from mine succeeded so i don't know why that last one failed that that's just weird oh i might know because we did technically change some stuff uh you were six of those so that's a reasonable excuse yes yeah i i mentioned to robert earlier today i was um while i was sick i was like you know maybe i can lay in bed and write some code that lasted about five minutes i i went through and i tried to write some code and my head was so foggy from either the the cold medicine that i had taken or just being sick that i kind of just stared at visual studio for a while and went yeah i i can't handle this this is this is not working it's like unfortunately programming takes a certain amount of brain power and my brain had no power okay so i'm betting that when i rebased and my changes to packet must have broken something so let's let's check that real quick so restore via packet should have handled it so let's let's jump back because i imagine that's actually so we can we can look at the changes up here right so this change doesn't matter this change could matter because this is dropping system net http same here so these well this is wpf test mod apps tess this is just the app config that doesn't matter icon thingy this is the thing we just changed and more importantly it's not what's causing it to break this is in the resource gen resource gen cs project change we looked at package config storage none this change could be doing it this change could be doing it so i wonder if because i'm not familiar with what storage none does i am somewhat tempted to take that back out and what is the get ignore changing oh it's just white space so that doesn't matter um because this is dropping system net http which is probably a good change i don't remember why that's in there possibly for this old one but i'm wondering if this storage nun is doing it uh how is the jason.net package completing with newton's oh the jason.net can be with newton's stuff um well so i'll uh i'll put it this way if you were to go to this and just look at packages uh newtonsoft uh dot json what is that double the next closest number by so by by sheer downloads um newtonsoft.json is more than double second place so it has a we'll say a commanding lead it hasn't been updated in a little while so that might give you a bit of pause um the there's a couple things i guess to consider so the newer uh microsoft json library is significantly more performant like it is it is a significant update um however there are a few features that it doesn't support in order to get that performance and i'm trying to remember what they are there's some interesting stuff around like default naming or if you've got a bunch of investment into like the the attributes because we ran into this problem at one point on one of my projects um and we ended up because if you're inside of an asp.net core project you can just switch into the other like it's like three lines of code to switch back to newtonsoft it's not hard um and you're off to the races and we switched back only because we had upgraded a project from net core like 2-1 up to 3-1 and there was just a ton of stuff and in the effort to not touch every file as part of the upgrade we just flipped newtonsoft back on but i believe the plan is to go back and switch turn newtonsoft back off and deal with the there there was something weird if i i remember right with like the casing of the naming of members or something um so i would say newtonsoft.json will probably stay in the lead and remain there for a very very very long time i would be shocked if if the new one usurped it anytime soon in terms of like sheer numbers but if i was building a new project i would be using the new microsoft library that would be my preference okay all of that and i now need to go edit a packet file packet files nope not packet files it's packet uh not packet restore targets where the heck is this thing live where are you packet dependencies that's the one i want packet dependencies you so i don't remember uh let's just get rid of the storage none sorry you gotta collapse something uh okay so i don't know what this does more importantly this was working without it and it's not working with it so we're gonna we're gonna try it and see what happens because i do i do want this change this is a very very good work uh removing storage none uh push and i'm sort of interested to see packet uh storage none i'm curious what that does storage none you can opt out of generating the packages folder by using the storage option here um got it so by setting storage none oh so that is very likely refresh so that is actually very likely my failure because the failure that we ran into here is the imported project [Music] uh and that the file exists on disk so the material design demo is failing to compile and it appears because the packet expects to find a build file in the packages directory this may not be related to that we may go flip that back on um let's get the other solution open first let's get the other solution open so reading reading op let's see so one i am noticing that it is expecting to find this in the packages directory so turning this on may legitimately fix the problem but this file likely won't be there so i think what needs to happen and i'm surprised that this is the pr that's breaking but what it's saying is this guy here yeah see this is this is the line here that's breaking this is the line here that's breaking is this is an import so couple things worth noting inside of a nuget package nuget packages there's a fancy trick where if you create a targets file and put it inside of the build folder inside of your nuget package and the file is mynugetpackageid.targets it'll automatically get picked up and included inside of your cs proj for free right that's part of the the microsoft nougat workflow the problem is um packet has to duplicate that behavior in order to you know work work accurately with nuget and so it's generated this import project here and the issue being that this thing no longer exists so by taking out the the packages file this file will no longer live there and i'm not entirely sure i want us i'm curious to see what this thing does because this guy so mine's going to work because the packages file isn't under source control so unfortunately it just doesn't get cleaned up um and we could do a like a get reset hard and put ourselves back in a clean state but i'm a little curious i'm a little curious to know how how pack it's supposed to deal with this i think just turning that off likely fixes our our problem uh nope it did not let's go and look again and let's see what it's unhappy about so it's still it's still saying it when it's pulling this down so something i'm a little confused as to restore packet so packet dependencies to recompute package lock file blah blah blah changes were detected so it downloads all of these i'm just not entirely sure where it puts those let's i'm curious so let's look at this docs real quick um so the storage option has three values packages right which is let's see here disable packages folder yeah so when you switch to the new team the packet team notice a dramatic increase of well-known package folder uh historically one way to still pack it you only want to compile [Music] uh yes uh net cores don't require an explicit deal load scripts can reference file in the global cache uh therefore the make the packages folder uh opt out so that's fine um so i'm a little curious so let's let's handle this real quick so oh i apparently closed down my other terminal so cd uh let's see dev material design so okay so here's something before before you do anything crazy you first make sure you have no pending changes this is a horrible command to run if you have pending changes right so gotta zoom in a terminal is just so wonderful okay uh get uh reset uh hard uh what is it oh no sorry get clean directories force all the things okay so this is going to go uh visual studio needs to not be running anymore because it's going to hold onto files and should i try again please [Music] yeah so we're just going to run that one more time because it yeah the vs directory okay so it has gone through and removed absolutely everything right so this is clean clone state nothing fancy whatsoever so let's go and look at real quick here so this does a restore tools so if we look at the command that's being run it is running dot net tool restore which we need to do so we will do net tool restore because we switched to using um packet as a net local tool right so it restored restored packet which is great that's what we want so we'll look at the next one right and the command being round is dot net packet restore so we'll do that next so dot net packet restore and it'll go and do its thing and i'm curious uh cannot detect any platforms please tell the package authors well given that i am the package author consider myself told they're wrong yeah i'll i'll double check this i know this is an old and a deprecated one but it is a legit option for the nuget package uh yeah so that's fine so it restored let's check and see what we've got here in our folder right so down here we have no packages directory and so if i were to build this i'm fairly confident what's about to happen is it would fail because of that import so the question is is do i care and is it necessary i am thinking that import might just be a holdover from so i just want to check show me the xaml so i'm thinking that that guy is a holdover and not necessary yeah so i think that is true so i am going to try this we're going to just comment that guy out because he is ultimately the the problem child yeah and then we are going to rebuild it because i so this target here um i wrote myself right and so i'm which is why it didn't get cleaned up and i'm thinking simply removing it this thing should still work and i'm i'm mostly confident in that so rebuild successful that's what we're looking for set startup project i am very shocked that that the other builds have all just worked okay so we test this by going to like the buttons page right so show me the xaml works like a charm okay so the short version is we just remove the problematic lines and i think we could go back and put that storage none back in so we're gonna stash pending changes let's see here uh revert commit yeah auto convert and then uh yeah that and then we'll pop stash pops dash okay so that cleaned up the cs proj okay stage all changes uh let's see uh removing problematic uh show me the xaml references in demo app so there there is a bit of a a chicken in the egg problem with show me the xaml so it wants to run as part of the the build so that it can generate up all of the xaml needed to show that pretty pop-up the problem being that the build is also the thing that likely restores it so you get this back and forth thing so that target that was in there was largely there to give a useful error if people had failed to run a packet restore and they were curious why their demo wasn't working but if you fail the packet restore you're going to have a different problem now so it's kind of meaningless okay so that's there see i'm glad i actually checked the pipeline so this guy should now kick off and run i'd kind of like to see that go just so i can have this thing run because i would like to see a successful run of this guy um because this guy is saved i just can't do a release until this other thing merges and i need this other thing to merge by getting past the build so we will let this go and then we'll go review some other stuff while it's off to the races and then we'll merge in okay so while that's thinking about it let's go and look at what else is potentially out here so we'll clean that up clean that up clean that up okay so made it the default startup project uh oh that sounds helpful i am a little confused as to how this works like this change isn't bad but how i don't believe this will actually make it the default startup project the issue with this is the default startup project i'm pretty sure is user config and stored in the dot vs directory which is explicitly excluded um we'll circle back to that i want to i want to check that one in a clean repo because i don't i'll pull that out and do that same thing uh let's see let's start at the bottom and work our way up multi-trigger for disabling checkbox animations using ripple assist so bug in question i assume is yup that that looks like a legit bug they added a test in the toggles which is great thank you very much i appreciate it when people do that um so let's see here though so before we had an event trigger that triggered on click and this adds so it's not on click it's on press which is technically different but is it different enough to matter i don't think it will i don't think it will um because press you can you can get something into the state of is pressed without necessarily using the click event for example touch events can get you into a similar state okay i mean this looks fairly good let's just confirm 2126 collapse that 2126 check it out oh get cracking you make me so happy oh stop loading stuff on me okay so we'll fire that up we'll fire that up and this guy here uh [Music] new what are the build errors uh was not imported by right so that other one is really going to hang me up until that merges in good news is it got past the build and it's just running tests so unit test passed and now it's running ui tests which is great that's what we want huzzah zaha i do want to get so the the ui testing library that we're using is my my own called xaml test um and the big advantage is unlike normal ui testing libraries that go through the accessibility layer this one is built around developer focus and so you get to interact with your objects directly which is a lot simpler in my opinion makes life a lot easier um so that you can act on stuff there i've got some high hopes with some of the net interactive stuff in snoop that will hopefully make it really really cool at some point um uh in the interest of simplicity let's just go and we know that we know the bug these two lines need to die okay go ahead and launch and you should be fine what a unique key is required what no key was specified oh yuck because this was targeted on an old version of packet or on an old version of show me the xaml which means every single one of those is going to be broken uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah um yeah because i'm fairly confident that this guy did a bunch of references and i might need to just restart visual studio too the ms build process that visual studio uses for compilation stays running so unfortunately can cache stuff they've been working on fixing it but i keep running into cases where it's smart but it's only so smart and it can occasionally just lose its mind yeah so the yeah the issue being that this guy is man is it every single one of those that's blowing up oh my word yeah it's because this is targeted on an old version of show me the xaml okay this is getting annoying this is getting really really annoying i kind of want to just okay revert changes revert changes okay so more importantly i know a couple things about this i know the thing runs and i'm somewhat tempted to just let it merge [Music] you should be built now right yes i don't know why this thing has stopped showing checks i i legitimately don't because it's clearly running them um yeah so green check that guy works let's put this guy it's part of the 4-0 milestone i don't know if it needs much else that'll work that goes there confirm squash boom okay so that fixes that which is great now most importantly we're going to pull up latest here because they're going to get one more commit up there and then this disabled checkbox ripple right click rebase okay now we're cooking with fire rebuild and be happy again pretty please so but the short version is this pull request here is at minimum something a good that we want so we're going to pick this up uh don't it's not a breaking visual change because this thing it wasn't implemented before so there was no way for it to do it uh okay so we're gonna just drop drop you uh let's see packet restore and relaunch and you should be in a happy place you shouldn't have you should have just literally this stuff left where's the mountain dew good point unfortunately it's empty now i made a mistake and did not bring enough with me i really need to fix that okay launch demo should not i'm sorry what debug profile doesn't exist okay i'm gonna have to go with you you are not paying attention visual studio i said launch i know you work because the pipeline worked okay so when in doubt get clean dfx wipe that sucker out so get uh what was it or not dot net tool restore great dot net packet restore i'm tempted to put that those lines into a little powershell script or something and check it in um because that should that should fix it everyone should be happy we should just launch right when in doubt throw away everything and i am a big fan of having uh like startup scripts or similar like if your repository build successful what a shock i'm sorry material design specified in the debug profile doesn't exist set a startup set as startup where why do you think okay i'm confused why it thinks that that's where it needs to be looking so main demo wpf right bin debug net472 bin debug net472 folders empty well that's not a good sign folder is empty you compiled sorry what last i checked compile means generate executable okay build succeeded no it didn't you're lying to me yeah that actually that's a good point robert uh when this thing's done i'll go and check the the build order and see okay so it claims to have built bin debug okay maybe just needed a rebuild i'm wondering if the obj directory was caching something and so it thought it was already built okay all of this so that we can go to the toggles page and exactly which one so you put in an example and it is ripple disabled so ripple disabled that's disabled check boxes oh ripple disabled right here yeah so i don't know if you can see that there's that kind of like ripple circle effect and this one no circle effect perfect looks good to me ship it ship it chip it ship it so pull request looks fine review changes approved submit let's see that's in the milestone let's make sure the bug is also in the milestone and squash merge squash merge and away we go okay uh theming issues uh let's see so what are the issues in question that we're talking about here so flat button theming issues so current one oh yes yeah we talked about this when there was some discussion back and forth of how to handle this and the issue is the hard-coded thingy bobber here all right so you can kind of cheat a little bit and we had talked about attach properties we could also use a converter yeah so which one did he go with i'm not overly picky brush opacity converter to do parameter convert to double if the parameter isn't convertible does it default to zero trying to remember how that works uh value is solid color brush so one thing i'm noticing is in general it so anytime you use the as operator in c sharp you absolutely must null check the value because you'll get null uh everything in telerik does uh i assume it is a dependency property yeah that sounds right uh see convert back doesn't do anything brush opacity converter so this was the bug ultimately is the primary humid brush was being explicitly set to this with an uh to the primary hue color with a default opacity which was uh frankly dumb so this guy here comes in let's see so relative source foreground so this gets handled by that and this is actually a change so from border brush border brush becomes foreground why did we make that change yeah so let's i'm not sh so this change definitely makes sense uh this trigger was clearly not doing anything so getting rid of it makes a lot of sense this changed the background brush and the border brush i'm wondering if like i understand the intention of dropping these but i do believe border is still being used yeah because border brush and border thickness are still a thing so i'm inclined to say this thing should keep this and it should match because otherwise the border brush is going to remain as it was and i don't think that is correct so this sets this guy here i think though what's bg button mean material design light what the heck is up with these material design flat mid they're based on weird styles what the heck these these bg ones might need to go away i'm not entirely clear what they're doing material design flat accent button i realized i realize these aren't part of the pr they just stand out to me so and then this one here material design outline button the border brush has changed from the border brush to match the foreground i i don't think this is the change we want let's check it out and run it 2131 so let's see grab latest master and then we can let's switch off that so uh 2131 yes i've got some old pr's that i need to go back and and ultimately decide what we're going to do about there is uh did that full theme editor get a push there was uh some some massively large prs that had conflicts and i off it was one of those i asked the original authors if they would mind uh going through and doing it oh uh robert one thing you might be interested in seeing uh there's a feature i put into the material design stuff for automatic color correction um specifically for accessibility what the heck it is really slow on restoring these um and i was curious what you what you thought of it um as somebody well so it's it's not necessarily for color blindness per se um it does automatic color correction um to support um contrast what the heck seems like oh i'm on the wrong branch so that's part of the problem let's switch branches and i was gonna show this to you so so all you do at the app now so the the syntax is simple it is it is an opt-in feature because it is very much a breaking thing but this color you you set color adjustment to a new color adjustment class and this thing lets you if you want to change the the contrast ratio and what colors it mucks with you've got options for for toggling this or the desired contrast ratio so material design spec says that for small font which i think they define as like 16 point and smaller is what they consider small font the the contrast between background and foreground needs to be at least 4.5 and so this guy here you're going to make me restart you or you're just going to figure yourself out i think you're going to figure yourself out so this guy here will automatically toggle it because the biggest issue i had is you select your color theme right so you know in this case deep purple is the primary and lime is the secondary the problem is is what colors look good on the background changes based upon whether you're saying dark or light theme so for example we're dark theme here because my windows is set to dark theme but if i go light you'll notice the actual color of purple is changing so it's it's one and this is why i made it an opt-in because if somebody explicitly went through and like picked my my company's color theme they probably don't want me mucking with those colors right it's like no no no no the designer gave me these rgb colors don't touch it's like okay fine hands off i won't touch but if you if you want it to it will go and change it so that this is actually like because some of this stuff was this deep purple when you put it on this color of purple that does not look good on a dark background and so having it automatically switch to do this i like so but that's why i made it an opt-in feature so if people want automatic color correction you add this one line and if for example you want it to only only muck with like your primary colors so you can choose you can choose whether you want whether you want to do all your colors just your primary colors just your secondary i suppose you could pick none but if you're gonna pick none you might as well just get rid of the whole thing altogether so so that's what i built i thought it was pretty cool there was a lot of math and ultimately i came to the conclusion that there's not a you can't just run it through a formula so it does a uh a guess and check and does it kind of does a binary search through the gray scale looking for the right hue in order to achieve the target contrast ratio so it does it's it's a little more resource intensive but i think the i like the end results i think this is this is ideal so i think it's pretty cool we'll see if anybody else we'll see if anyone else uses it it'd be cool to get people's feedback on it uh is a nice scaling for size you mean like based on monitor so that it scales up or down accordingly um because there is where is it there is this thing here uh not on monitor but like for me i have to scale things bigger sometimes oh gotcha right that's actually a good point is it would be nice if there was like people could kind of build that into their app but the this idea of scaling the whole app is somewhat challenging because you basically need it to scale up or down nicely you kind of like the only thing that wpf has built in is you can make it respectful of the um dpi uh so one of these guys here yeah so you can go through and if you create an app manifest you can make it um per monitor dpi aware which for people with multiple monitors or like as i imagine you run with a higher dpi than most people you can go through and do this so if you want to you can steal the app manifest out of the demo app and drop it in yours um obviously some of this stuff this is a request to the operating system to say please add this and some operating systems just won't do it but i had somebody very conveniently add this into the demo i was like oh thank you it's nice having a nice sample of doing that uh okay so before i got so carried away we were checking out 2131 and i think specifically i wanted 2131 uh i've used linear algebra to just add an artificial magnifier on the app as a whole yeah because you can also do something with like um let's see rebase onto master because you can get away with something else too where you do like a view box or you set like a render transform or a layout transform on like the root element it's not it's not great um because that's not really what those things were intended to be used for like they weren't designed to effectively theme out your your app for sizing trying to think of what would be the easiest way to do it like it would be nice uh yeah something like root element magnifier it would be nice if because what you could do is you could set font size on all of your text elements to a dynamic resource and then start and then just have something that changes that dynamic resource so just like you would do with a color where you dynamic resource out to a brush you could have font size set to a dynamic resource so you basically give yourself some like name sizes like font large medium small or whatever and then you know based on you know user click button or whatever you change that root resource so you know font size large i'm going to bump everything up by two points or or whatever it needs to be and then all of the text grows but not necessarily the layout of the app because that does get a little harder is how do you change the layout and i think something like that might scale better because then your layout engine still gets free reign of everything it'll probably also expose places where you need to turn on like text wrapping and and that kind of thing uh right buttons flat buttons that's what we're doing i knew i was doing something knew i was doing something okay so these guys here you know it is interesting because this is the other one that changed out yeah and i i think the font the sizing is harder than colors like colors don't affect layout whereas sizing does and that's where it gets really really interesting but i do wonder like if i was trying to do it for this demo app my my initial gut reaction would be to dynamic resource every text element's font size to say a name size right like i'd i'd figure out how many sizes i'm using and i'm probably only using i don't know five six maybe total and then rev that dynamic resource when i wanted to change quote unquote the size because i imagine what you care most about is the font size not necessarily the size of app elements just you know make it bigger so i can read it um okay so those all work and those look fine so the key thing i'm looking for is the mouse over and then the ripple effect so those look good yeah sometimes even the control click areas are stupid small yeah i think that though you just blame the app author and fix it like the um some of the stuff in windows apps that i've seen they have what they call touch mode which basically just like adds a bunch of padding around every single element so blow up my my hit test area by by some percentage okay so visual look of this it's fine so okay brush opacity converter that we wanted to go and look at so that guy we want this guy should really do a null check here so how about if value is we'll do some pattern matching solid color uh brush brush then we'll do all this work right so boom [Music] uh return null right so c sharp eight pattern matching it attempts to type cast if the typecast succeeds assigns local variable to brush which is kind of exactly what we want and actually let's move this down because if this type cast fails we don't need to do the conversion so we'll save ourselves a little effort there okay so that that'll handle that click that off for the moment this guy here so that removal we like that removal we like this has border brush so i'm a little curious what happens if i go to the buttons demo right so i think there's a bug here where if i were to set the border brush i'm going to get unexpected behavior so let's can let's confirm that so this is the flat button style where this is applied and so let's do do material design flat button great so you sound fine so let's do as everybody knows border brush should clearly always be fuchsia uh and i think we're gonna have to set a border thickness too uh border thickness and let's just make it five because i want this to be big and obvious and ugly and i should figure out i should chase some of these designer errors i've been sort of punting chasing any designer errors in this because there's been so much designer work microsoft has been doing on um the latest visual studio stuff and so i've been kind of just biding my time going some of these bugs might just go away so which should be really handy so that that's interesting so it is so that okay so previously what happened previously the border brush got changed and now this lea now if you set the border have a good night robert thanks for hanging out alwa always good to chat with you so previously it changed the border brush too and this fuchsia would go away but now it just leaves it in place that's probably better i guess that's probably better okay so these ones here i might see if these ones are even being used this might just be uh let's nuke these things because i don't understand flat like it bothers me that this the name of this one is flat button but it's based on raised button there's something really off there um okay so this one is the outline one and this is changing the border to match the foreground so let's look here okay so let's look at outline button let's jump back over here boom outline button so once again we're gonna go with uh border brush fuchsia because naturally and we will do a border thickness of five again just again to make it big and ugly i've got xaml edit and continue so it's interesting this one completely disregards the brush i'm sort of wondering if a better fix here because this is setting border brush i i think if the intent is for this to match the foreground because what sets the foreground here right because it's clearly picking up the primary color let's see template apparent that one definitely picks it up but how is it getting the primary mid oh does this guy set it this guy might set it foreground yeah so this guy is setting it here i think a better solution here is to leave border brush alone right and just default it because if somebody wants to override it i think we let them right and they get the same behavior as they do on the other side i think that would be better so let's go to buttons.xaml and let's look at that so to do down here theme buttons buttons buttons buttons buttons buttons let's take a look flat button outline button so i think what we want to do is we want to set something similar to what this guy does so we want rather than relying on the foreground property i think we want to just default the oh it does have a border brush property i think we just changed this here right so we change that guy to primary humid brush right which lets you overwrite it and then down here this goes back to border brush that way if you set it and overwrite it you end up with this so if somebody wants to set it and get something they can or if they don't set it such as here right then they end up with something more akin to this where it styles out appropriately i think that's better i think that's a little cleaner okay so what all did we change here so let's start with this uh adding null check on converter do that as a separate commit and then let's see here i don't think we want the demo app change there discard changes um switching uh outline style to use border brush again uh this allows the border color to be overridden yeah because we've gotten ourselves bit a number of times where we reuse a brush because they happen to be the same and they some people always want to change them to be different um i'm wondering if i should write some tests around this real quick this might be worthwhile to write a few tests around the outline style specifically given that that one was there because there's some behavior here that i think is worth trying to capture and making sure we identify that it's something that we want to keep as part of our spec uh so we're gonna do copy paste copy pasta this one and let's do oh i gotta stop executing so again these these ui tests are using my own saml test library so i initially had advertised it as this is not a full ui testing library but i feel like i'm slowly moving that direction i don't think it's quite there yet but the more i use it the more i want to use it in other places and add more features to it so there's that uh okay so this guy is going to because he derives from test base he's going to automatically spin me up a a thingamabobber and it's going to do when we call load xaml it will initialize with all the material design stuff so that's cool that's awesome um the only thing i was curious about is what that doesn't get me a that doesn't give me any control of i want to include another resource dictionary uh we might need to give ourselves another another little button because ultimately what i'm wanting to write here so i want to have a button but i want it here let's let's do this let's just move you down a line uh so let's see style to do and we will do static resource and very similar to what we had on our buttons.xaml here uh nope nope not what i told you to do not what i told you to do outline button so we basically want to grab this right so this is the behavior we want to test so when i do this i want to assert that i can do things or i want to assert on things like background color it's border color trying to think what else is important here let's start there let's start there so it's going to grab the primary humid brush and pull that out of the theme colors which is great i don't know if this is actually going to resolve this style this might not not do quite what i want uh okay and so we want to do something like uh color do do border color gets a weight button dot get i don't have i don't have that which is really really really obnoxious uh so these all these extension methods are not fancy at all they pretty much are wrappers around this but it's really convenient to have stuff like that right why does that one have nullable huh i wonder if that's just a decompiler uh task color i think we can do that uh let's see border brush so it's worth noting it'll also do magical conversions for you oh and i i really shouldn't do that i should really use name of button dot uh let's see grab name of button why what are you resolving to oh system control oh system windows controls button dot border brush boom um well you are not you were batting a thousand today system.windows.control that's what i want trust me really really confident oh this is because it doesn't know which button to resolve to uh metal suck hey metal slug how you doing i am finally feeling better uh i was out for multiple weeks some of it was getting out with uh or getting knocked out by a cold and then i had scheduling conflicts and it was it was an adventure so we're just gonna explicitly tell it that is what button is stop thinking for yourself b button why are you having so yeah it wasn't bad i i thought so my my two lovely little children had both gotten the cold um before my wife and i and so i and they bounced back in about a day like they're young they were out they were kind of feeling yucky and then coughing a little bit and they're like oh i don't feel good and then they woke up the next day and they were fine so then when i caught it i'm like oh not a big deal and then it leveled me for a week so that wasn't that was not fun at all yeah it's this button it's this button namespace that's messing it up down here but this will work uh okay so border color background color what else was in what else was important about this style um because what we just changed on here let's see do yeah i think that's fine i think i hope uh papa yeah i think that'll that'll work so we'll we're basically looking not on the flat button on the outline button we're looking to verify because the border brush gets changed and we want to verify that that is as expected rather than this down here and i think we might even want to check it because if we just check the border brush on the root it's not going to be the same i think i want to check the the border on the inside uh yeah uh let's see so we want to do var internal order gets button get element how are you doing metal slug uh let's see get element weight that'll give me a new eye visual element and i think so i want this uh let's see outline let's see outline button uses theme uh color for border which is what we're looking for so i want to grab border color i don't care about background here at all and then color internal border color oh i'm sorry about that where are you located again it was california or similar right interviewing with a couple companies well cool interviewing looking for another like csharp.net position or just whatever is available so let's see we're going to do the same la california okay that's right uh [Music] get property oh nullable and i want i can do this thinking getting into scalable tech looking to relocate interesting well let in the name of shameless self-promotion uh so when you say scalable tech uh let's see so teletech.com jobs if you are interested my company is technically hiring um though i think right now they're looking mostly for yeah so there's a google cloud developer position software developer uh secretly we're always looking for this for if we can find good people um the hard part is for all of our positions we were very much trying to favor finding people local to western washington we do have um like so where we're located in spokane washington uh like northern idaho is not that far away it's like 45 minutes 35 minutes and so there are people in like northern idaho and like uh coeur d'alene or post falls area that we get a lot of people in so there's kind of there's a spokane isn't quite like it's not big like when you think of like an la or a seattle or that kind of thing but it's kind of nice it's slowly been growing to have it so if anything there interests you um by all means go through and click and apply um feel free to reference my name and let me know if you've got questions like i'm happy to discuss further if there's anything you want to know about like the area the company that kind of thing so but that's all that information there yeah it's actually been so my company has been not i won't say not affected by like the covid stuff but we've weathered it better than most so like the ceo is really good at being conservative with finances so making sure he's always got a backup they're really slow to hire because they they absolutely hate to let people go um and so it's one of those they they go out of their way to try and be really good to their their employees and take care of everyone which i definitely appreciate uh so let's see we want to verify that those there and we want to make sure that they match that so i want to do that boom and i want to do that so yeah like i said if there's anything that interests you or you want more information on the company feel free to hit me up and you can always uh yeah yeah like i think when when covid launched at one point in time there was we had a we were doing like monthly company meetings um and at one point in time was like every other week just because people were remote and they were trying to keep people to feel like they were still part of the team and so they there was one point in time where they're like yeah you know we're gonna we're gonna put a hold on hiring people right now just because we don't know you know what's gonna go on with this and then i think the next company meeting the update i heard was yeah we just got a bunch more contracts coming through the pipe we're now back to hiring again it's like oh so uh that's how bad it is got it okay cool so that works and i think what i'm gonna do here is i'm gonna add one more uh yeah and it is nice so now obviously i have an incredibly biased opinion um but in my opinion in in this area my company has the best team out of anyone by far so but again my opinion's biased like and you'll like any company that's been around and sticking around i've got a theory that they've got at least one good person on their team because companies who don't have any good people usually just tank um and so like at most pla at most places you can always find at least some good people but in this area like i said i my biased opinion is we have the best team out of everybody let's see on mouse over uh uses theme brush so this is going to be the same type of thing but if we jump back here really what i'm looking to do is test this trigger out right and make sure that when the mouse moves over this guy this guy's background gets changed now this guy is picking up the foreground color with an opacity that's probably okay yeah that's probably okay do i want to assert that it matches the foreground or do i just want to assert that it matches the default i think just that it matches the default i don't think we need to do anything too yeah i don't think i need to do anything too fancy so that there uh we don't care about we do need mid color we do need the internal border i don't need the outer properties border anymore so that's not a thing that i care about and let's see here and i do apologize if i miss chat messages my my app that shows me the chat history has decided that chat history is optional so i see the same chat history everyone else does except for i don't get to see the past ones i only get to see them as they pop up so i apologize if i miss something and don't reply to it within like a few minutes say it again i probably just missed it um so i want to do let's see move cursor to element and i believe i have something uh i was able to see what you're up to uh so we're gonna put the cursor just right over the center of that guy and then we're going to grab his not his border but his background right so we want to pick that up did i use oh in this case i was just testing border okay so because again it's this trigger that i'm looking to test so internal border is the target background property and i want to assert that the brush in question that gets pulled up is the theme brush that's the mid color now this is going through foreground and jumping through gyrations but my assertion i don't care how it gets to it i just care that it gets to that color so the mid color is what it is but i want to do um with opacity right and i want to do 0.16 right that's yeah so then if we run the test and this is why i've been liking my xaml test library is that was easy it failed but that was easy okay so why did you fail because visually that looked correct uh so expected was something akin to this actual was way off so let's see here so that was seems unusual i'm wondering if there's just a timing problem uh let's just check and see i'm wondering if i it moves the cursor and then immediately grabs the property before the trigger has a chance to execute so let's see so it grabbed a color oh so it actually oh that's that's interesting oh because the color is correct the color is correct the issue is this is a brush property my library is being smarter than me i don't like this um this thing is generating up opacity on the brush not on the color property so the color is in fact correct so do i care to test that so i think what we do here right is i do solid color brush all right grab that grab that um and i think we just test uh internal border background i think i think what we do is this guy uh color should match and then what we said is the brush itself should have an opacity of 0.16 okay let's try that that will probably get me a little closer and i probably won't need that delay on there so i might still need a little bit okay so that guy is unhappy it's saying he got back an opacity of one oh this is likely an issue of xaml test i have a sinking suspicion that when it does brushes it doesn't move the opacity with it i that is probably a bug let's see xaml test and i want to look at service and get property uh let's see get value assembly qualified name set value yeah that ain't gonna work that is that is not going to serialize that across because it's using the type converters so that is a bug there and so i think what we do is we simply drop this and just test against the color i think that is the solution okay and then we want to get rid of the timing issue so we get rid of that and we see if the test still passes and if it fails we'll just put a explicit weight in because we don't want we don't want to use a timeout like that yeah i kind of think this won't be a problem for timing yeah so okay i think i like that that gives us tests over the stuff we changed so we'll add that in too so uh adding ui test for outline button oh that's what that's what else we wanted to test we wanted to uh theme color for border uh we want to assert that because the issue with the change that was there before is you couldn't override the border right outline buses uh let's see uh border can be overridden okay so we need to set some stuff here let's break this up i'm starting to think i don't like that yeah we'll do something more like this uh let's see so border thickness should be i don't know we'll just set it to five anything non-default will work and then let's do border brush and here i think i'm just gonna use red because that's an easy thing to manually convert the rgb code for and let's see internal border so this is what we want but what i am looking to grab here is so you go away don't want to anymore but i want to grab border dot uh border thickness and this is going to be a thickness property to do switch that yeah yeah i understand you're unhappy hold on i'll fix it i'll fix it trust me uh naming things is hard uh so border thickness and border brush yeah so we will do border brush and this will be a solid color brush again paste so we'll do that and border brush and we'll just make sure that this still works so expected thickness that we expect is a universal 5 all the way around so border thickness and the border brush we expect colors red and nope border brush color all right so we expect that to work great works like a charm okay so add this in adding ui test for outline button yeah great so we'll add those in push some changes force push force push and we'll get that pr merged in and i may end up calling it for the night but so let's see here so this becomes here approved submit yeah hush you are fine so this goes into the 40 milestone and then the two linked issues need to be moved into 4-0 yeah i'm not sure if i flag those this one's already been flagged so we'll do that so both of those are handled might be nice to write some ui tests over the this one here but it's after 11 pm and i started my day before six so it sounds like a sleeping time it sounds like i need some sleep i am very interested in why it's like devops is working yeah thank you it's i've had a lot of early days um if if people haven't seen it so um i've been working with uh a guy dan from let's see build five uh nines.com and so if people are interested um we did a couple sessions on uh terraform so there's the the devops playlist uh has it there's also a specific uh terraform playlist that has all of them in there if people want are interested in doing like infrastructure as code type stuff and azure devops and pipelines and all that kind of fun jazz so may end up doing more with him uh just kind of depends on where things go so if people find that interesting that's been the the early morning activity okay the thing knows there's a check being run it has the circle it knows it knows how like you know this i this is just weird i can't decide if this is a bug or what the deal is but the fact that it's not showing it it's almost making me wonder if i've got like um a web hook or a service connection problem i might have to dig into this a little more tomorrow and see what's going on because there is something that is inherently off with this something is inherently off with this uh but we have the pipeline right here so just refresh show me your pipeline whoa hello houston what are you doing that's running for infinite yeah we're gonna cancel you i've seen this happen a couple times where it clearly gets stuck doing something and it starts running for a very very long time unfortunately i don't know exactly what's causing it it's always difficult to debug a problem that's not like a failure that's just a straight up like it's either it's either hanging or similar and i don't have a lot of there's not a lot of calls or things in there that can hang forever there are some weights and whatnot but there's nothing explicit it's like it's getting itself caught in a loop or similar and i i don't quite know what's going on or why because most of the time the tests run quite fast it's just some of those get stuck yeah so i wonder if maybe that was hampering its ability to report progress yeah it should be in here hmm i am confused and the fact that i see this little itty bitty yellow circle in the corner means github knows the status of the build is in progress it knows it knows and it just doesn't want to show it to me and i don't know why for all i know it's just a simple bug so get me past my tests and then i click the button come on run those tests should only take it a couple minutes to kick off because i think the last ones that were successful the the ui tests yeah they take a couple minutes to run but considering all of those tests each one of those starts a brand new wpf app not bad at all still faster than a lot of ui test frameworks so as long as it doesn't run for too long i would expect it to finish at roughly the same rate okay so get that going get that going and then i don't know if there's any other is there any well while we're waiting on this actually put that back there's no quick and easy ones that i can just toggle there was this one for the startup project let's let's just check that real quick visual studio startup project i don't know if that's going to get me uh how about where is stored i'm because i'm pretty sure this is stored in the user profile if i'm not mistaken yeah it's stored in the suo file which is a bit of an issue yeah like i under that yeah that is a bit of an issue i think though so the one thing that this change does do oh and i bet you that's what it's doing it's probably cheating uh because it changes the order of files in the solution that's what it's doing okay because when you first clone the project on an empty clone it doesn't have a startup project so visual studio is dumb and says i'm just gonna pick the first one in the list and so this just moves this down so the demo is the first one in the list i get it i get it i get how it works now that's that's kind of clever so this gets a demo app label bump a bum goes in the 40 milestone squash merge that beast easy win easy win uh let's see okay ui test pass okay all the tests passed so we're just going to merge the other one too and squash merge squash merge and away we go that should that should kick off that should go out the door i just want to confirm that my other pipelines are running successfully so yeah so the one from 1016 did successfully get itself out to nougat and then these ones will go out again so the way the pipeline's set up is it automatically kicks out these releases here and i think what i'm going to do is i just want to i'm going to manually run this pipeline because i'm fairly confident that i want to see this run i think it's set to run in like four hours or something i picked a time when i would hopefully be asleep the problem is if there's an issue i'd kind of like to know now and not when i get up in the morning plus if this guy runs successfully he's likely to open a pr because that's usually what um ends up being the trigger for the nightly releases is it automatically opens up pr's let's see this one i think got changed didn't it for some reason uh sure yeah okay so that one's a known thing so once that's done because that that is one that i i held on and i wanted to keep at this character counter thing too i also want to take another look at because my goal would be not to have it just be a single a single thing let you put arbitrary content there would be my end goal okay so that did you guys we merged that pr oh so you guys aren't closed anymore though so close issue because the text didn't say the word fixed it didn't auto close so there's that there's that and then back to here you are running good news didn't just straight up die so that's that's a positive note so welcome to net core 31 huzzah thank you very much off to the races give me give me a clean give me a clean run please and then give me one more pr to merge that way i can feel like i merged a whole bunch of stuff today and was productive um let's see let's look at this this is probably an easy win oh he even wrote a test for it this works he actually wrote it as a unit test rather than a ui test so that's fine doesn't bother me this does a template binding to background does background default to transparent let's just check background defaults to transparent so that will have identical behavior that's another easy one to put in especially with the the test there that is very easy to accept and squash merch squash merge let's make sure you're in the right milestone bring that in that close that close uh i think the other ones i probably need to have more brain power to look at oh there it is huzzah freebie okay and squash merge squash merge there it is icons updated to the latest and greatest stuff so you're welcome everyone we have icons again okay pipelines are working stuff is running lots of stuff merged i got more stuff to review but i think we're getting there so thank you everyone for coming and hanging out as always i had fun i hope other people had fun uh hopefully i'll be hearing from people uh if you've got questions if you're thinking about doing uh hacktoberfest there's still plenty of time to do it um it's gonna there's a 14-day delay on pr so you've got time yeah metal slug like i said if you've got any questions or whatnot on company or anything that sounds interesting to you you can always message me my dm channels are open on twitter it's probably one of the easier ways to reach me so if you want to grab me twitter link right
