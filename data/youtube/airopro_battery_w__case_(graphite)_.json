{"xv-7QYC1HhI": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to pop on 4/20 as always thank you for joining this channel won't we get started in this next video guys I'm gonna need you to do a few things as usual i'ma need you to like my video make sure you hit that notification bell and definitely make sure you watch the last deal which I did on candy this week guys I'm so excited because we're doing I'm super excited about this product guys I had a chance to be the representatives of this product at one of the dispensaries that our frequent and sunny day in Vegas Nevada we're gonna get into this product right away alright alright guys so here I have the air pro battery this is an advanced vaporizer system it comes with a graphite air pro vaporizer with a micro USB charger in it so let's get this open and as you can see battery is in here we won't get right into it guys this is you open it up you get a user user manual sorry it's early in the morning this is gonna be a battery it's the graphite I can get it onto the package and there's a USB cord attached to it for the purposes of this video you cannot see this charging but I so guys not enough got it all charged up and as always guys before I attach my cartridge to this I do want to make sure parents know that this is a canvas product we need to keep it out of the reach of children so make sure that you have these items laying around for your children anyone under 21 is not allowed to consume cannabis I'm gonna go ahead and plug in my charger I mean I'm sorry my cartridge guys see that this particular cartridge is a 0.5 grams and this one is called the black mamba and I picked it because it says black mamba but not only that guys and this particular one is the sativa so I want to just start showing you guys to Tevas because I usually use us that even during the day time just to get my day going it doesn't tie up my day and make me tired so I thought it would be great just don't get my work done and I will be able to use this as you guys know I got a bunch of product reviews to do and I need to keep my head straight sativas keep me right but this particular one is black mamba it has a pure distillate oil which only means that they have some clarity and purity to this oil I'm not sure from the research I did how they dissipated the oil there's different ways of getting me away with distillate form so you always want to do your research whenever we serve this particular product we go to air procom shut up at air pro we're gonna open this package up as you can see the package is a little tough to open I have no idea how I'm opening this but we're gonna figure it out okay guys obviously please change our location because it was a little noisy outside but the last you saw I was holding up the package that was childhood but it's also adult food so now we got the package shop guys I'm just gonna get closer got my 0.5 cartridge that's Black Mamba here is my battery is the graphite battery and I'm just gonna show you guys I've already charged it literally the charge only took maybe about 10-15 minutes so you didn't see that because of the purpose of editing the video but the charging takes really fast and it did turn colors when it discharged so I'm gonna go ahead and figure out how to put my cartridge on there we go so you just pop that mouthpiece off and then Oh Meg Nick magnetically it clicked idiot let's do it again wow I like that and I like that because guys it keeps it from leaking some of these cartridges you'll get they'll start to leak into your battery this one is magnetic and I like the way it just draw someone you don't have to like screw it on so you just sit this part to the side guys and we're gonna get ready to see if this thing more all right so remember it's supposed to find rate there's a manual a user's guide so I'm just gonna look quickly and see what it's supposed to do okay so it's supposed to vibrate lightly in your mouth yes I just said something's gonna 5r8 lightly in my mouth so let's see the vibrations oh my gosh that's amazing okay instantly guys this is amazing I can taste the blackberry as the top note with the hint of citrus but it's not a tangy centrist now let me let you guys know that I do know for a fact that this particular cartridge the Black Mamba cast terpenes in it the terpenes is what really brings out the benefits of the particular oil or the flour which is made out of flour so guys what I really love about this particular one with that citrus taste in it that's that limiting coming through and I love a terpene limit because for me is the antidepressant and anti stressor so it has that has pine all in it I think it has some lemon linen all in it as well so if you're looking to do Turks that's what you really want to be at to understand what the oil is doing and what is it bringing out of when you're inhaling it so for me um wow that feels really good in my chest this system is really great and this has been on high time magazine's top when our air pro and I love how sleek it is can you see that you can slip it in your pocket it's really adorable and right and it gives off a nice cloud the smell is great idea I'm like truly in love with this one and I feel like because it is a sativa guys I can go on with my day actually we might film doing some more stuff doing my day so you guys can see how a sativa will work doing your day so when you have a sativa this is gonna be great because you can still go to the gym you can still get your grocery shopping all those things that you need to do in your day sativas won't allow you to do so remember if you need it during the day so theses are going to be the way to go and air pro has some excellent sativa cartridges and these are dissident oils so they have already made pure fighted and clear it up so it's very clear on your chest the second pose you see I didn't even have a call back which is great and I still feel like I'm consumed inside kind of thing I know that sounds really weird cuz this is like my new friend like I can actually like in my little pocket and my yoga pants matter of fact let's just go to yoga and I'll just keep it in my yoga pants done nobody knows it's there let's don't get on my nerves boom vibrating in my mouth oh yeah I feel like dancing this right here alright guys I'll be right back and I'm going to show you how my day went on this air pro all right guys as you can see it's been about what about an hour or so and you know I met the guy named Jim on Stairmaster owning every Pro what I've let one that make you work tell you what I'm working up that's what it's this evil dude that he paid to this we're feeling great I just got a great workout in on the Stairmaster [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] it was amazing that gives the clarity and the purity of this I [Music] [Music] because I [Music]", "VSyat0Zod40": "[Music] simplistic here back with another video this is going to be another bait cartridge for piyah Terry battery I would say I don't know if this is a 5-10 threading battery but it definitely looks different than your you know your typical 510 batteries usually they're like a pencil like cut the [ __ ] I mean they don't usually look like this but I mean similar and uh it's a cartridge as well and you can see I got the flavours sweater this is one of the sweaters they actually gave me it's probably like the only sweater a cat that gave the rest away but yeah I like to I like this color I got some water stains oh yeah this says AeroPro advanced vapor system premium carrying case not included but this box includes a vaporizer micro USB charger u.s. user guide and aluminum alloy body with the 320 milliamp per hour battery running it 8.5 power or 8.5 wattage power output so arrow pros advanced ceramic cartridge technology specifically designed for pure oils delivers superior performance and taste also has a one-year warranty as well to speak but it does say distillate so you know as far as just let's go they usually taste the same in terms of what terpenes they use when it whether it be fruity or whatever but this one apparently is Northern Lights two indica so let's just open some of these up so for uh what I mean by proprietary battery is batteries that you the cartridges only work for that specific battery I'm not saying like this is a proprietary battery or whatever like a rock garden car tree earth semi GE luck he likes to say proprietary battery a lot but proprietary battery only means when the powder you express it just like a plug-and-play like the only thing that's gonna work with the plug-and-play battery is a plug-and-play cart the raw garden carts you can use with any 510 threading cartridge the voltage might not be running as good for that specific cartridge because the raw garden cartridge is gonna run good for its own cartridges but you could still use it and that's that's what proprietary means it's it that only works for that you know 5-10 threading batteries raw iron batteries for all 510 threading so like this just make that clear you know just like he means well but that's what it means yeah and a lot of people don't really like proprietary batteries because it's like well I got to get this battery or this [ __ ] cartridge when you know 510 threading cartridges are Universal on most batteries so I do feel it but this one it kind of does look like this so it is a five strand by ten threading I believe [Music] in queen I also got my cousin on my bed back so we're gonna open this right off the bat when I took it out it smells really it smells like that the distillate like fire oh jeez from plug play like that very earth the tiny taste so I'm guessing this is just the then you take out okay hey so you charge on the bottom as well microUSB and like I said it's a 320 milliamp per hour battery so it's fairly alright I believe this one's like 400 so probably can get a decent amount of use before you have to charge it so so there is no button you just hit it and then those are light right here so we're just gonna hit it okay so you guys didn't see that because obviously you have to have like crazy-ass heists to see that but this actually vibrated while I was hitting it so you don't actually need to look at the light to see if you're actually getting anything because with this list sometimes you don't even know you're hitting it because it's a it's a very thin oil or I don't know what it's not really thin but yeah it's just sometimes when you're inhaling this lis it's sometimes you don't get the sensation that it's actually going into your lungs so the vibration is actually a good touch and I've actually seen this from Desmet before they had a few prototypes they let me try but they kind of look like this but they vibrated as well but this is the first American company I seen that implemented it so pretty good as far as the taste goes it kind of tastes like [ __ ] licorice I don't really like licorice okay you smell this real quick it's mostly it's not sweet has like a weird aftertaste I'm not really a fan of it but I will be smoking on it because until pretty I don't know I'm not a fan of licorice taste but you know like sweets I do and you like candy and [ __ ] yeah but not like one like sweet meat [ __ ] but overall I'm probably gonna try another one of these actually this is a proprietary battery I believe because this cartridge has the metal magnetic attachment stuck on it so you would have to have this cartridge to work with this battery so it is a proprietary battery in itself but overall it's a pretty pretty nice looking product not gonna lie it is running at 80% THC so it's definitely in the mid-range when it comes to cartridges and yeah I'm probably to take one more hit and we're gonna end the video here hopefully you guys enjoyed it this is 0.5 as well and as far as pricing goes you're gonna probably put it in the post edit process because I don't know and there is good vapor production I'm not gonna lie that you pretty much saw all that cloud that came out other than that I'll see you guys in the next one [Music]", "X57hkIS65UU": "what's up everybody's a boy mastermind here wild cannabis life and we're back with another review video today we're talking about Buckeye release brand new product in partnership with the company called air pro these are 500 milligram or 1/2 gram babe cartridges so let's go ahead and jump in let's begin another mastermind here [Music] all right so let's start out with an unboxing here of at least one of the batteries in one of the cartridges and we'll talk a little bit more about it as we go I'll give you some more information let's jump in okay what you're looking at is an arrow pro advanced vapor system battery which comes in a nice box here as you can see and you get a carrying case in the USB charger and user guide that's a 320 milliamp battery this is in partnership with Buckeye relief so basically you know one thing that they're doing is they're offering a one-year warranty on the battery and a 30 day warranty on the all their vape cartridges all their vape cartridges come in 500 milligram leak free ceramic etat autonomous these are designed specifically for marijuana oil in our field with the following robust terpene profile so they have three different product lines the strain series which is high quality for technical terpenes formulated to replicate some of our favorite strains the live flower series which is 100% cannabis oil firm formulated with him to ride terpenes and also the live resin series which is high-quality fresh frozen live resin for the strange series they have three different ones they have jack herer which is a sativa blue dream which is a hybrid and Northern Lights which is an indica for the live flower series they have blue widow which is a high rip purple Hindu which is an indica and super silver which is sativa and last for the live resin series they have oral Blanco cocoa and straight saws the oral Blanco is an indica the straight salsa sativa and the cocoa is a hybrid so they have a pretty good variety as you're seeing with the battery as I'm showing you here it's this one is purple but they have a couple of different colors it basically is for regular micro USB chargers you're seeing and this clear piece that you're seeing here at the top that is actually a dummy tip so you basically had to remove that so so now I'm showing you the actual purple hindu vape cartridge and as you can see it's color-coded with the blue indica label and this as you see is a live flower series and you can see the test information right there and as you can see this package is sealed so I haven't opened it yet but I'm opening it for you guys in this review video and you know I think it's interesting that they're offering a one-year warranty and they're also with the battery and a 30-day warranty with the vape carts let me know if you ever come across another vape cart or vape battery that comes with a one-year warranty I think that's a little bit different you know this particular company is it's been around for at least a couple years the box was dated 2018 so it's not a brand new battery company yes so this particular vape cartridge has a magnetic bottom so there is no thread so this will not work on any other 510 batteries that you may already have laying around the house so as I'm showing you here that you have to pull off this top piece and then you can see in there chamber there it is the magnet in there you pull off that clear piece it's kind of like a dummy tip once you clear that off then you can put the other part of the cat the cap I call it the cap back on and it won't work unless you have that cap back on there properly so at first I try to put it in without the cat pointer that didn't work out so well so you have to have this purple part that I'm showing you now all the way on there so even though it's a little bit of purple showing I actually don't have it all the way push down but once you drop it in there the magnet sucks it right into it so it is connected instantaneously even if you turn upside down the cartridge will not fall out so again I think it's very interesting that this particular VAE cartridge has a 30-day warranty and the battery has a wonder one year warranty so if you've seen another product like this in Ohio definitely let me know in the comments but I think this is the only product that I'm aware of that has a 30-day warrantee on the vape cart itself and a one-year warranty on the battery so I think that's pretty interesting so I'm gonna go ahead and let you guys see what it's like for me to hit it and so here we go alright so definitely again I love the color and just to show you guys now close you can see that this is seated properly so all I do is just take a tote and right off I can taste some really great flavors taste fruity now something else I like about this is there's actually choke hold car by calm joke hold the carb hole so if you want to make it if you want to adjust the air flow there's a little hole there and that will affect the airflow that you get and so that makes a difference with the CBD it's definitely gonna have a good benefit for paying you're looking for something with pain you definitely want to get something that has CBD in it again like I was showing you an unboxing with the case it just kind of fits right in there and that's kind of easy as far as you just put your charger in there and I don't know you might take your dummy cartridge with you heck you might have another cartridge and you might have a setup like this you could have like a nice little medication pack going on I think that's cool and I like it they actually give it a little instruction menu that shows you exactly how to use the product I think that comes in quite handy and as far as you know I also have the oral blanco live resin one and I can tell you this tastes great this tastes like oral Blanco and I mean this this is one of my favorite pens so far in the whole program I love the color tips I like colors I like to the fact when you hit the battery or vibrates and like I said as far as prices goes they have three different price points 60 65 and 70 the 70 is the highest one for the live resin live resin cause a lot more to process than the basic THC oil and you know I just wanna let people know that I do a lot of reviews and I always hold on to my receipts and I think everybody in the program should be keeping their receipts and their containers just in case something ever happens you never know if this is gonna be a recall on something or an issue and since they're offering a one year warranty on the battery and a 30 day warranty on the actual cartridge it's definitely a good idea to hold on to the receipt and even here I've put my labels on the back so that's something you guys might want to start doing but definitely keep your receipt no matter what for at least up to one year and if you just can't keep paper receipts in there just want people don't like keeping that land around take a really high resolution photo with your phone or go ahead and scan it that's something I can recommend as well because that will always give you a digital record of when you buy it which you bought and then if you ever have to scrimp so you can prove that you actually purchased the item and that you paid for it so I think it's important to keep your receipt just want to touch base on that what you didn't see in me in the review was the other package is different where the alive resin it's a gold Cullen I already opened that one and that unboxing didn't go to where I wanted it to so I couldn't show you that one on camera but like I said it's very very good and it's worth every penny that I paid for it you know I definitely purchased the next the Coco one to try that one as well to see if it's just as tasty so with that I'm gonna tell you if you like what I did in this video make sure you like subscribe button I'm trying to get to 1,000 subscriber I can't do that what your support so many visit subscribe button right now make sure you check out my website Debbie that without Ohio cannabis live.com and also make sure that you like us on Facebook I'm also on Instagram and if you have any questions make sure you leave your questions in the comments I will try to do my best to get you the best answers and if you want to know where to get this product I do know for a fact they had some available at Ohio grown therapies in Newark and you know that's where I got mine as a shout out to our growing therapies in Newark their service was great I also wanna let you guys know I think pure Ohio wellness might have had some as well I can't confirm it was on their menu at one point but you know how these things when they're new when they're good they go fast so again with them I'm gonna go ahead sign off I'll see you guys next time another mastermind here [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "YpziYHdrR_w": "hey guys this definition we're reviewing arrow pros live resin series particularly this is wedding cake it's a hybrid coming in around seventy nine percent THC so this is the new thing from arrow Pro that they're doing live resin now all the carts before were just really distill it and I got to say I really like this the flavor is more cannabis oil type flavor it's not as you know flavored with different kinds of flavorings like mosteiro pros are and i like those flavors - I gotta say mountain mists which is a menthol kind of flavor I like it as long as the the carts are clean and it's done right I'm down the flavor carts I've had some that just weren't that strong like the rad vape but I've never had any AeroPro cart that was not strong so I really do like AeroPro and again this live resin something I like as well it's it seems like the oil is a little darker color than the distill it it does not have any like co2 which kind of taste it tastes like a good live resin so people that like that live resin taste and enjoy the Arab for hardware might like this instead of their regular cartridges I probably would still just be hitting both I think strength wise they're pretty comparable so this new method didn't really sacrifice any strength and I found that even arrow pros at like in the high 70s like I've had mountain mists at 78 be stronger than some of the other carts out there at you know in the low 90s so actually I would take I've had an arrow pros at 78 I would take over a Eureka I had at 96 percent THC which was still a Eureka was great but the arrow pros a little better and arrow Pro they've sold over three million cartridges and not had a single health complaint so everyone's worried about oh cartridges people getting sick you know that's all vitamin E acetate and cuts and stuff like that arrow pro is a multi-state company you know I they do have individual people that I think it do something with oil in different areas but it's all like a very high standard and that's why three million units sold and not a single health complaint so I know I mean who safety teas but I'll be hitting AeroPro for for a while so let's take a hit take a look it looks like you know I didn't take the fattest hit here's about what mm-hmm yeah you're a pro hardware it's basically a magnetized automatic magnet I see so with the vibrating function puts out a little more vapor than normal I like it and take another look at that resin and this also has been vaping pretty slow and hit this thing a lot and the oil Dave's pretty slow so AeroPro live resin you got to say overall two big thumbs up and I got to say I kind of expected that from AeroPro everything they've done has been super high quality the only issue they've had is they've had some batteries that have failed and I know there was a bad batch out there so you did have that the information is on our site on one of our prove ease we'll put it there to get that replaced but that's the only issue there I Pro has had and they warranty it so besides that I mean everything has been so great about it the product is excellent it hits well the live resin takes good so our po2 thumbs up this dab connection thanks for watching guys and have a great week", "HxaXzw59RyY": "you're hey guys and welcome back to my channel it's your boy real matty smokes and today we got another air pro guys we got another air pro and it's Innoko Northern

"what's up guys is why pose I'm back with another little video but this rig is gonna be so quick because now I'm gonna lie I kind of ran out of video ideas so this video is just gonna be like another part two of how to hit you got down cart without a battery if you don't got a battery or if you do have a battery but the battery doesn't work or if it doesn't tap or something okay and I'm gonna make it more briefly because the how to top a ding how to tap your car without a battery my other video like that [ __ ] pop it didn't really even pop I like I got some views that I was not expecting at all not at that point at least and but that videos really sluggish I was like really bleak [ __ ] type of [ __ ] so I'm gonna just do another one part two and yeah so first off what you're gonna need obviously is your wires now I'm not gonna describe I'm going to describe and explained in this video how to make your own wires but you need this you see these things you need these things these are so important this black right here that you see here is gonna go in the bottom of the cart the bottom of the cart see that little thing that hold that little circle that's in your cart yeah the black has to go any right and also your wires or whatever it has to be already connected to something like right now it is being connected to my to my laptop it could be I think connected to your ps4 your little put it in a box put it yeah and see but you definitely do need this and it needs to be in your little out there or whatever already so yeah quick and simple this black right here that you see right there the black this is gonna go inside the cart boom it's already inside the cart right you guys see that right and then the red they see right here you can see it put it right there that red right there that's in my nose that red day see there is gonna come along on top right here you're gonna want to put it next to this like there and you just don't want to leave it there and then as it's in there top it like go and inhale start inhaling and then boom that's does I do it there I guess i'ma do it for you guys though this car Billy huh sir it's gonna take a while to top but like to hit but like is in a work yeah my card so dead the card is really dead but you can still do it when your cards like all the way up or is that like it's a full cart no one is almost basically dead because look guys like my [ __ ] I'm basically flinging on like a dead car right now you know but like I'm doing it for this video so you guys could know just letting you guys know so again this is basically a cart for the tries of doing this with the wires so basically again same [ __ ] you guys are gonna want the black the black is always gonna go in here the black always in DC a circle boom put it circle right there boom put it in the black is in then the pink or the red you're gonna want it here and I doubt right when you put it like that just stop it just hit it just start hitting it the skirt busy eyes but yeah that's it that's how you tap your damn cart with or with no batteries no nothing and yeah cheers I hope you guys enjoy I hope you guys you guys got to hate your cart

cartridges in they have very good air flow hits like a dad so if you want something that's a heavy hitter out of your pen something with big clouds good flavors it's our switch doctor for the natural therapies definitely one of the best ones on the market it comes with the cold pen is going to be magnet see so technology so it vibrates when it hits so that the oil moves through it evenly and snaps right back in there throw the screen real classy the package also comes with six different slots for all of your different cartridges and it's UV protective so if you're at the beach or at school or anything like that and you need something to protect your cartridges is definitely did I mention it hits like a dime my favorite one is gonna be to Jack Herer something good get me up and moving through the day we'll also got some different one folks a bubba kush Nightrider now that's Girl Scout cookies because that's our AeroPro come check it out exclusively here at new world", "QLhppSATkwY": "hey guys is Deb connection and we are doing a comparison of the arrow Pro versus the Z versus the Jeep NGO and the Jeep NGOs actually had close to empty so zero pro so hopefully the hits come out okay but I'll still explain to you the differences and what I kind of think is the better hardware what has a better oil and all that so first we'll talk about the hardware AeroPro is made by Cecil and it's a ceramic core but it's basically a C cell in a different format the steezy is also a ceramic core it is made by Ald which is another popular company probably the second most popular to see cell it's also a ceramic core it's the same Hardware heating element that is used in the plug play if you're familiar with that is just a different looking format the Jeep NGO I am Not sure on the Chinese manufacturer behind it but it is some kind of proprietary system that is only 2 geo it is not a ceramic core it burns off a wick well vapes off the wake Bob you've hit it light enough I don't know if you hit it light if it will burn out but I know if you hit a little bit too hard it definitely gets Bernie and if you search Jeep NGO breakdown you can see our breakdown of the inside of that and that's the only one that's not the ceramic core so these two have superior hardware I like the arrow Pro a little bit better than this TV hardware however I really need to try this again with better oil to get a fair look at those two but both these two I say are good hardware and if you want something just like the steezy but rather put your own oil in it check out the Ald V fire that is gonna have the same heating element that is the same thing that is used on the plug play the Jeep NGO because it burns off the wick has substantially worse Hardware it actually has a better form factor the battery actually feels cooler in your hand there's actually a lot to like about the Gio it's just the main most important part of it which is the core of the heating element which is essentially like your engine is not that good if they change the core in this it might might very well be the best hardware okay now let's talk about oil so AeroPro makes their own oil steezy makes it an oil and g-pen does not make their own oil so you're getting different oil producers in inside the geo pods and there's a bunch of different brands out there okay so comparing the oil to oil a lot of the people that make oil they were Pro and cz Eric low just blows it away steezy was really strong at the end of 2017 when it first came out it had a wider oil or clear kind of cut oil much lighter color and it was really good I mean steezy at the time was probably the best and or even early early 2018 weren't the best or the best when the new the newer see so hardware which this is based on has also brought up the hit strength just Dizzy's hardware it's just there oil is just so weak now essentially at this point when I have a steezy left which I got this one just to retry it I essentially consider myself like I'm out of stuff it's really just there's just no strength on this and when it comes to the oil compared to the other stuff so oil to oil AeroPro just destroys easy and AeroPro is is like one of the best brands you can find and it's a multi-state brand so the the quality on the oil is just better it's stronger it tastes better AeroPro hands-down winner over steezy now jeep NGO does have some really good oil pen makers that are behind it one of them in particular that i know of is the BAM pods from a company called body in mind and I don't know why they use the Geo it would be way better off in something else but make a very clean be hol for a vape pen that's it's hard to see I don't really see that often where there's a straight B hol card or parts or pods that you know are mixed with something but they're excellent pod so I really do like those but overall is the overall package aero pro is the winner and that's because oil is good and the hardware is good so both good hardware best oil worst hardware has some good companies that make some good oil for it though but really you're burning a wick and that's what's not good now let's do a hit of all of them you can see how they all hit and hopefully there's enough oil in there for that so hold on one sec okay first gonna hit the arrow Pro you know something's out there that say taro Pro produces three times more vapor I don't know that like if you have a really good battery like that vessel battery for example I think I don't know that it's necessarily three times more it does produce great amount of vapor the vibrating thing you get used to it I like the battery but yeah it's good now let's do steezy yeah the hardware hits good I think honest tastes easy doesn't taste bad either it's just there's just like no strength on these things and you know the last batch of these so the end of 2017 they're great you know early 2018 they're pretty good mid 2018 they just got super weak and I was like you know maybe this is just this batch I got six of them I thought maybe they're fake or something I wouldn't got another one this is that pure light from Placerville so I know 100% legit and it's just no strength like to me like I gotta hit this over and over again and I barely get the effect I get hit this twice and that's literally better painting this ten times 100% hitting this twice better than ten times hitting this twice is better than just hitting this all as much as you could possibly hit it really just this you just don't get that much effect off it's really disappointing because it was such a good product before and I really hope steezy makes a stronger line I've heard that the reasons TZ is so weak now is they're trying to appeal more to a mainstream audience and you know maybe people like us just need something that's too strong so maybe they can do it select it like select for a while head select oil and select the lead I don't know if they still do that elite so stronger one you know Stevie you can come out with that and a 20-17 I'll make a stronger one it's gonna be a top product again no here's the Geo and this is nothing I don't like about the Geo so it actually kind of really done so at the end right here but you can just see the inefficiencies in that you know there's a lot of inefficiency it just like oil getting stuck kind of on the side and things like that plus absorbs orbed into a wick which is probably you know longer if you look at the wick with it's broken down it's definitely bigger it seems at least in the Cotton's that they use in the other ones you know take a look at fishin see here so the steezy pod is actually fairly efficient you know so it goes down there AeroPro that's really efficient so started to efficiency in there let's see if this works the other thing to the G pod the Geo pods are real actually really tricky sometimes and see look now it's not working so I actually got to do my fix and this happens quite often they get stock I just suck from the other side to make the airflow go and then it'll work I'm gonna pause doesn't be difficult if I gotta put paperclip in there okay so I broke the air through now let's put this pot on so the G the G low hits good bet if I take way too big of a hit it's just going to get super Burnie and that's kind of that's kind of a down point but that that well from bama is very good they got great oil I hope I hope Gio makes this core better and they got a solid solid solid product steezy go back to them to 2017 oil and you got a solid solid product AeroPro is a very very solid product and one of the best base you're gonna get anywhere and you can go get them in multiple states which is also a plus so there's my comparison arrow Poe versus TZ versus Geo intro Pro clear winner on all fronts steezy still great hardware Geo good oil makers needs improvement thanks for watching guys have a great week", "APKXe_Fii-k": "hey guys his nap connection we're doing a comparison of the arrow Pro versus the vessel battery and we're gonna be using an actual C cell on the vessel battery so a couple things I should mention the vessel is getting a lot of height because it's well it's really nice but it is very expensive it was $99 the arrow pro on the other hand most people think of it as $35 but that's actually when you buy it with the case you may find it at some dispensaries and if they don't give it to you at first ask for it say you guys have the battery only because the battery only it was only 15 bucks and that's really not that bad I got to say overall though the vessel hits harder than the arrow pro I still love arrow Pro the quality of the oil is excellent I'll still be getting over cartridges but I do think the vessel that's harder and I'll do a compare compares hit both them here first we'll start the arrow I mean you're opposed to Hut's great and here's the vessel on a Cecil specifically on arutz cartridge actually you know also being able to hold the button here gives a little bit advantage but you notice as you get deeper into the hit with the vessel it just starts hitting harder and harder and that's why over all minutes have to say the vessel hits harder than the arrow Pro it just does arrow Pro still great still gonna get it vessels 100 bucks but I gotta say a vessel so far is the best battery I've used for cartridges and I'm primarily using sea salt cartridges and I say it's only a battery I've had that actually works better than the the Palmer Cylon sea salt carts now is it worth 99 you know if you hit a lot of cards probably if you don't maybe not I think it is a bit expensive you know $4.99 like see made in USA stuff if they could like it like just wood was like handcrafted in America or something maybe I'd feel a little bit better but the thing 99 but the reality is if you're spending 40 50 bucks of cartridge and it does hit that much better yeah it's probably worth it it really does hit nice so I give both these products to thumbs up but that's just your comparison of you know the vessel in the arrow Pro thanks for watching guys is that connection have a great week and I'll also be giving away one of these vessel batteries and we'll have info on that below thanks for watching guys have a great week", "JVvjqk9nMJI": "you know what is going on guys today [ __ ] you would think after [ __ ] years I would have a different intro I hate seeing that but getting in front of camera is like really awkward for me still test now this new best dab pen compared to my last one this baby still rips it's called pulse battery $80 on dispensaries but now I believe it's down to $60 so if you want to actually I can't promote selling things or buying in these videos so don't [ __ ] buy it okay may have unboxed it already now may I put it back in the package just for this but comes in the little arrow Pro this my first time on a camera by the way I just bought it um a g7x I've never had a camera before usually I just use my [ __ ] iPhone but hopefully this is better so get this little bad boy here let me let me just [ __ ] pan over for you guys alright alright this what we're looking at this is the new guy little arrow Pro sweet little box but basically it takes different carts than a normal one like these ones you know any normal cart goes on that but these ones check it out alright don't [ __ ] blame you for my camera skills I don't even know what the [ __ ] I'm doing here okay yeah you take this damn it's a [ __ ] magnet needing this no button nice [ __ ] dough compared to this one this one rips but there's a button it's gonna be a smoke you wanna hear today whoo yo beam in our cameras [ __ ] dough I'm gonna review these [ __ ] carts now we got this badass pen now we got to put a car in it okay we obviously did that it's the Northern Lights is what we're having it is a 86% you know me I'd be rocking with the indicas I don't know about you guys put in the comments what's your favorite strain I'm really obsessed with indica cuz honestly I just like to smoke alone you know I still get my [ __ ] done because we can't have stoners out here not getting their [ __ ] done I still be getting stoned and going about my day it's gonna work he had done about to be moving so hopefully I make a vlog out of that skirting my way out of [ __ ] Idaho back to the hometown Seattle where Lee ro weed is legal so I don't get no more [ __ ] trouble here been in way too much trouble lately with the law first strain ever invented and it was because this dude grew in Alaska and like Aurora lights you know the Northern Lights in Alaska went over the weed and weed before this was never a green it was always red grown by Mexicans but when this dude drew it in Alaska with the aurora lights it turned green for the first time so he called it the Northern Lights and the second ever strain was alaskan thunder [ __ ] from Alaska as well obviously BAM first two strains I actually really like this these flavors good as [ __ ] just don't know it but I've been sitting in this chair for like 15 minutes just on my phone [ __ ] hitting the dab pen I totally [ __ ] forgot about the video I was just getting stoned sitting here um anyways let's move on wait let me take another rip I'm gonna give this a score 1 out of 10 but I'm gonna I'm gonna give you that like a seven we are now having wedding pie it is a 82% in because well you know how it is I always be wrong with the indica what I need to do whoa this one looks cool that's badass look at it it's wedding pie by the way Wow smells like [ __ ] dang boys I'm really [ __ ] hungover today and the alcohol is trying to come out of my system no sir that was that you gotta see this [ __ ] I'm over here [ __ ] dying now hey don't me in the comments call me a [ __ ] [ __ ] okay I'm hungover as [ __ ] I have an 8 I'm ripped as [ __ ] and I keep [ __ ] coughing this alcohol whoa but I'm doing it for the [ __ ] content okay normally I would just be in the [ __ ] bathroom and I would just [ __ ] I mean I didn't puke I don't know why I'm saying it like that I ain't no [ __ ] any of this one's strong as hell it's killing me every time I hit it okay I've only hit it two times and every time I've been almost yakking now hey again don't call me a [ __ ] but my the [ __ ] alcohol is trying to come out I'm gonna give that a six out of ten maybe a seven sis I'll go 6.5 pull it out okay next one the OG bubba kush indica of course i only go with the indica sativa sometimes when I'm working but most of time I say [ __ ] it and I just at work hi I'm kidding I'm kidding my [ __ ] employer finds this well sir we have a 90 percent coming in at 91% for bubba kush let's test it out damn this so bright that I look white oh wait I am white I just look pale suppose all right not gonna lie another [ __ ] ten minutes has gone by of me just sitting here doing nothing cuz I'm so [ __ ] stoned like I've just lost track of time I don't even know what one I'm on oh I'm on the bubba kush okay i'll give that like an eight matter of fact I'm gonna bump the other ones up to the first one was honestly the best I want to give the first one like a nine now I don't know what I gave it before but it probably wasn't the [ __ ] nine wedding Paiwan [ __ ] me up also wedding pie is the only door cord all right end result Northern Lights nine wedding pie 7.5 bubba kush hmm probably an 8 probably an 8 this one is fruity pebbles or Strawberry Cough honestly I've lost so many [ __ ] cards I don't know which flavor is which okay is smaller this one was more expensive this was a little cheaper just because I got it on a sale at the dispensary all right boys that's been the [ __ ] video I'm going to turn this camera off and sleep actually it's Sunday so I'm gonna watch the football game Packers are on in three hours let's go I almost forgot to do one more red", "C_jsQRBh6Nw": "what is up everybody welcome back to stoner vibes today we're here and I'm gonna review this [ __ ] new pen that I just got it's called the arrow pro to stop the whole [ __ ] pen doesn't even look that much like look like a pen looks like some kind of like my grandparents have diabetes they have today you know like prick themselves with like this whooping it looks like one of those that's what it looks like to me because it looks like that just like a little cylinder has a little tip it is press a button phone like I need we'll just fix them so they could check the blood and [ __ ] but yeah this is the arrow Pro it's super interesting honestly was it was weird they had a promotion there where I was where I was at the dispensary I was at but here is here's the package it came in the package it came in yeah it's arrow pros advanced ceramic cartridge technologies specifically designed for Peter oils deliver superior performance and taste and this has like a one-year warranty included cartridges were sold separately yeah this is it's pretty cool it seems like it's made in China but yeah the arrow pro it's crazy it has no lights or anything it has a light - like in the cake when it's charging and when it's done charging but that's pretty much it like it is really I'm gonna take a pull from so you guys could see it doesn't light up or anything but here we go cheers everybody I hope you got a smoke come on tapping mom whatever you guys are doing as long as he doesn't getting high here with me but here we go everybody Cheers [Music] anything rips that's the thing that's the thing I like about it if it's it's pretty good but the thing that I think is the craziest is that this thing vibrates when you hit it like it's not like and then like an aggressive vibration it's just you know you just feel you know it just you know it vibrates it to let you know that you're taking a hit since it has no but no lights no buttons or anything like that you need to know I'm getting it so it has a culture that literally just vibrates and [ __ ] so I think that's cool I mean I guess I have in comparison I have this desire here it's a BAM oh that's a sticker that I put on there but it's strong and I just picked this up yesterday comparing these cuz I mean I guess we could compare them this one you know it lights up it has a little lights at the bottom this is a regular state everybody know is dizzy they just came out with the big sticky which is something I want to review so if you guys want to see that video hit that like down there comment below and I'll [ __ ] make a video on that but give me like this real quick cheers everybody we got some strong Hannah right here I really like this runner runner is really good it kind of tastes like smoothie but well yeah we got this ones I mean I like it it's pretty cool only there's there's downsides to it so I'll do the pros and cons on it so this right here the pros and cons of this is the pros know it's stuffy as [ __ ] like this this is all it is charges to the bottom right there yes we got this right here charging for it super stealthy it's like magnetic and it's like not even like that's all nother thing right there I guess we could compare and I mean it doesn't really make a difference but this one right here you know it's not gonna fall off it won't fall off but this one like it takes it takes quite force to like you know it's a pretty strong magnet is what I'm saying so your cartridges I'm just gonna slip off or anything what else I think honestly those are the only pros you know it oh it doesn't have a light so I mean that's why I think it's so [ __ ] stuffy because you could just hit this anywhere in the dark in the movies like and I don't think anybody would know if you just blow it down and [ __ ] and you just you know goes to hit or something but yeah this is pretty cool I like it the only the piece of these are the cons because it only comes in half grams so you only gonna be able to get this review and I didn't be able to get a full Brasco the other con is at the 40 bucks each [ __ ] halftime cartridge that's another Angus it's another Pro that it's Inc it's pretty good [ __ ] weed like I don't know where where I left the bag I [Music] threw it away but the bag where this comes in doesn't even come in like a little case or anything it just comes in a bag it just gives you although they has CBD has THC all that and the percentages the tested percent you know will they tested it out and and that's another Pro you know it's it's a good quality oil it's a good quality cartridge everything's good quality it's just that it's 40 bucks for a half gram where I could buy heavy hitters for like 40 bucks and that's a foreground I could buy a freaking brass knuckles 45 program but that's over here in Cali and where I live so I don't know exactly what what it's lucky for you to stick your in but you know I think it's not worth it for the money but that they had a deal where if you buy the cartridge you get the battery for free and the battery is 40 bucks itself so that's like easily 80 bucks just to get a half gram cartridge and abetik so it's kind of cool it comes with this case oh my god like it's a pretty cool case I bet you charge as well but has a little station where you want to put your battery you can put you up your cartridges right there it's pretty cool the display came with like a bunch of them so like display her all of them fall and I kind of thought you know it was gonna come like that with all of them like an empty empty ones just there you know but it didn't it just came with it just came with the one the battery in the and the charger and some like you know little papers inside there that were like their their brand and I think some instructions but I mean I honestly done them take a look at the instructions I think the structures are still in the box but I'll take a look at them later but yeah this is a it's it's it's pretty [ __ ] interesting it looks honestly looks weird little ass [ __ ] fanny let's see the size difference this dizzy isn't over smart [Music] honest I prefer this dizzy it's it's cheaper that could also mean cheaper quality oil I'm not sure I think it's pretty good but then again these these are 65 for full graph so it's still you're still paying good amount the only thing is that it get pays off with the with the battery because the battery is only 20 bucks so but yeah that's that's that's my review on this you know I really like that it's it's kind of small it really looks it's kind of weird so like I'm not sure if it's like it like at first I'm seeing I don't know if it's uh if it's just like a big pen like I don't even it is a kind of doesn't even look like a cannabis fan other than the color I [ __ ] I mean it comes with red once it comes with orange ones and the color I got maybe that might give away its sweet cuz it's a green but other than that I don't think anybody would know it doesn't light up like if you want to hit in the dark you're not gonna you're not gonna see a little little light but it does vibrate so it gets a good full as well like the air feels pretty good a little bit more restricted than the than the stiff but you know it's still good it gets it gets a good hit but yeah I mean compared to this dizzy or anything like that I mean I first noticed it just based on price because this dizzy is just pretty pretty simple pretty basic you know with the light at the bottom same a same charge as this one but yeah I probably wouldn't buy this one I probably not gonna buy another cartridge of this one unless like I don't know I'm gonna buy a cartridge for my friend I mean a battery for my friends so like if they have that deal again I probably just buy a cartridge and just give my friend the battery but I mean I don't know I just it's just I probably won't buy this anymore I just probably just gonna keep on use buying these or the heavy hitters but I just lost my battery so I haven't been able to get a 5-10 thread on hydrogen water so I don't know but I believe you guys it's it's it's been fun but I'm taking last hit from both of these [ __ ] until this one blinks I don't know he's never gonna stop but [ __ ] go cheers everybody I hope you guys enjoyed the video I hope you guys keep tuning in like subscribe follow me on Instagram all that jazz but peace everybody Cheers [Music] Oh God Cheers [Music]", "ZN9vFY9hdlk": "they're going oh yeah it's going everybody check this out there's a new thing and try out I don't know if you can read it play backwards it says AeroPro a ir o PR Oh check this one out yeah so this is a battery it's Calexico and shaped and over here you keep your cartridges and you just go like this magnetic and ready to go and if you want to switch kinds from your huckleberry mango twist to your [ __ ] pineapple butthole surprise you just magnetic slip right loop and there's no light on it it vibrates it vibrates so I wish you could hear you might be able to hear it anyway I guess you could like stick it up somebody's butt or other orifice and then suck on it and it would vibrate that would be kind of cool I'm weird I'm weird for you even thinking that but anyway it's called AeroPro and it's this pretty cool thing you can hold up to six cartridges and the thing goes in there and this is the only battery on the market that you can use while it's charging you can charge you can be charging it and still use it works pretty good anyway check it out I don't know how much the cost this was a vendor gift which is one of the perks of having your wife work at a pot store anyway that was my review of the arrow Pro I guess it's a vape pen that's a vape pen it's awesome because it has magnetic cartridges that just pop out just slip in about the screw nothing until you're done getting stoned huh and then it's got this little plastic thing that goes in it for storage put this back in there like that move it up and you're on your way okay that was my arrow Pro review see you guys", "ijAeBlWMhu8": "what's up ladies and gentlemen I'm the host of the show Josh Thole we're in the heart of the Emerald City downtown Seattle Washington here at Pikes Place Market and you're watching wreck rated the number one source for recreational cannabis product reviews on the Internet [Music] all right on this episode we're taking a look at the arrow Pro vapor cartridge this is a half grams distillate cartridge this one is branded as the Nightrider sugar plum I'm excited to try this out you do need a special battery in order to put this on there so there's an additional cost for the battery all in total we paid about 75 dollars for the package today so let's get into the Nightrider sugar plum and take a look at how it tastes what's unique about this indigo Pro is that it vibrates when you smoke on it so it's always gonna be making sure to like agitate the oil and make sure to get it down into the wicking system on this and also it is unique that it has this magnetic cartridge it's just convenient you just slide in your cartridge if you have multiple flavors you can just pull them out swap in a different flavor puff away you know what they're putting on the package for the flavor is a pretty good description of what you're gonna get what did it say this is a sugar plum and it definitely kind of has a plummy flavor to it this is kind of like a it's a little bit of like a plum and an apple pie or something a little bit of a pieace in there I have out a couple of cartridges from them that weren't weren't really the best flavor but for the most part a majority of them have been really good so if you want like a really good flavor [Music] all right so we're back with the final review of the arrow Pro this is the Sugar Plum half gram distillate cartridge we've been having it out all day today and so far I've really enjoyed it it hits really smooth the taste and flavor is a real good sugar plum flavor the battery life has lasted all day and there's still a lot of oil still in this half gram cartridge so you're gonna say this gonna last maybe maybe two or three days at the most if I'm just kind of puffing on it the only downside I would say is it's a little bit expensive the convenience factor you're gonna pay a little bit on there but you're gonna get a really good quality product I've used probably maybe 10 of these cartridges from harmony farms and I've never had a failure never single issue with one of these cartridges overall stellar product really good flavor I'm gonna give this one a four and a half out of five check them out the arrow Pro formerly indigo pro peace [Music]", "er1VFCYGszI": "what it is what he do I am D welcome to the first episode of we enjoy

day podcast we podcast and young song get any like comment subscribe", "ps32Z5PM7Ec": "what's up guys fake earpods perot are here within a month of release of the original earpods pro there's already so many clones that have flooded the market and these are apparently one to one perfect in every single way from the originals they took about two years to actually perfect the design these it's astounding how efficient and Chinese market is at getting these outs as soon as possible so we'll take a look at these I think these are called these super copies and then there's I five hundreds and from packaging to the actual product to the software these are apparently one-to-one and I'm curious how deep that goes okay so let's take a look at that package you begin with first off the quality is of course worse and here we've got more of a gray look and not as detailed on the image but it is embossed it's a nice little touch we've got the same air pods Pro wireless charging case on the side it is reflective silver also apples packaging by the way the easiest way to tell is you're not gonna have to use a knife or your teeth to get into the packaging of air pods Pro it has a pull tab here does not the sticker is not separated into on the side it's one solid sticker here so the attention to detail is pretty dang good ok so just from the packaging you know unless you're experienced or you've seen this video you're not gonna know so seeing lots of these in news actually getting my hands on it we'll see if the pairing process is just as easy apparently this has the h1 chip inside of it whether or not it's bluetooth 5.0 it's gonna be hard to tell but ok so here are the air pods so they seem a little light I will do a little weight test they came in sideways like this not proportioned correctly to how you open the box so there's no pull tab to remove the plastic already a big difference just in the opening experience it's on the inside a defect and of course we do have our lightning to USB C cable which is a nice little touch paper tabs as well so the customizable earpieces are completely missing from the packaging one size must fit all here all right and wow I'm impressed that looks really really good and they popped up right away on my 11pro max here so that's amazing that's magic by the way this is on iOS 13 point two point three so it's on the latest version and comparing these side-by-side so the LED it it's not flush it has a little hole in it you can tell that it's not the same quality there but it's a bright green little LED same as apples just not as diffused on the bottom here lightning port very high quality looks good and this was specifically in the listing is that the hinge was mat and oh that's so funny oh no it's not it looks painted on for a seconds but I'm actually amazed that the tolerances are smaller than apples apples has a gap between the hinge this one does not also the button positioning and the text is a little darker but no one would be able to know unless you have them side-by-side so impressive work on the hinge and it feels very solid like the snap feels good it sounds really good this is apples a little deeper a little snappier I actually prefer the sound of this one it sounds more like the originals huh Wow look at that so on the inside of the casing you'll find serial codes here letting you know that it is a real product and apparently they're from real ear pods Pro but don't you dare try taking these to the Apple store let's check out the actual little bulbs and I want to do a weight test here in a second but compared to these relatively the same way maybe apples feels a little bit heavier so on the bottom here you can tell that the charging contact points are not as beautiful as apples it's taken straight from the first generation air pod so not as beautiful but it'll do the job and there's a grate there for a speaker exhaust I believe hmm definitely not one-to-one in that regard also there's text here underneath the bulb a portion next to the sensor so that part looks good and here we've got painted on sensor so this actually doesn't do anything it's just painted there's no speaker grate here whatsoever so that is not one-to-one and the actual ear portion does not have that large of a hole so I can definitely assume that the sound quality will not be the same here it does have a force sensor here but from what I understand it probably does not work I mean that's fancy piece of technology that our highly doubt they'll be able to reproduce that and do these come off oh they do huh and that's what it looks like so it's a very dinky looking exhaust hole this is the difference between $80 to 250 dollars that's sound quality there I very much do assume that these will sounds nothing like apples also wanted to see how strong the magnet is inside of the cases so if I try and fling them out oh wow it's actually really strong and will they fit each other's cases so this is a fake one it does fit into the original and vice versa so a little bit loose which hmm and it does close there it is the design really is one-to-one in terms of size but they're using different technologies for the actual sound and charging still is impressive that they were able to reproduce it in such a small little form factor okay so let's get to connecting and sound quality now I'm genuinely impressed that they were able to get this menu and spoof it from what I understand it's a Mac ID spoofing they're not actually cloning the h1 chip but it still works and it's incredibly fast so that's apples original we're not getting the same animations yet but let's go ahead and connect connect iPhone hold the button will hold it on the clones and there it is so it did connect we've got ear pods Pro showing up on our iPhone cloned and part of the listing did mention they will show up over here does show the air prods Pro charging if I pull one out yes it does show up as right that's amazing the integration is sically om okay so with that connected I want to play some post Malone let's check out that fit and they feel really good like this feels like the OEM one they're the same size they do seal off the ear canal it's somewhat noise cancelling I wouldn't say the same effects and you put in official ear pods Pro there's a seal and pop effect it's really cool until you try it you know you don't really know what I'm talking about but suddenly the world goes silent and this does not have the same effect but it is more noise cancelling than any other air pod clones that I've used so I guess it somewhat has that I highly doubt it's gonna have the integration ya know noise cancellation integration but it does show up as ear pods Pro so about half away it's pretty loud about 75% oh yeah most definitely this does not have the quality of original ear pods let me pop one of the real ones in so I'm attempting to share audio it detects them but then doesn't actually let me share audio to them they get struggling with that would have been interesting just for my little analysis of listening to them I gotta tell you the sound is not that good I mean it's clearly a downgrade it's 70% of the sound I'd say of the originals maybe 65% you're obviously not getting that noise cancellation and it's pretty clear just no bass there's like almost no bass whatsoever definitely more of a tinny sound and of course you're not getting any of the software features such as transparency mode it also doesn't show up with the little logo in the control center letting you know it's a generic earpods Pro clone so the software integration could be better but it does work it connects very fast be prepared not to get the same sound as Apple's original there's a very wide margin between those two in terms of sounds but still I'm very stunned that they were able to get this kind of sound and out of such a small package within such a relatively short amount of time so wireless charger is working as pop these see if they have a coil inside and it appears they do not also wanted to test the individual weight of the air pods Apple is five point four grams and clone pod is three point two six so Wow actually a significant difference between the two it feels lighter now that I saw the specs apples entire package is fifty seven grams almost and this one is thirty seven so twenty grams lighter I'm just picking them up yeah this does feel more solid it's a little dinky little light so clear difference there in terms of quality and before I forget I do want to test the controls for switching music it's not a press the forced press sensor doesn't work so they retain the tap function from the older clones no force press this is all a gimmick here on the side so don't expect that to work and lastly a test I want to do is testing the electromagnetic interference radiation coming from air pods and metric usually people don't care about but this is something you're putting next to your brain what do you want it to be safe apples air pods are playing and right next to them I'm getting about four volts per meter if I step away from them it drops to about two so say about four volts little over four volts per meter for point two it was a baseline of about two volts per meter next to the fake oh wow six volts per meter near the fake ear pods pro so definitely over five five point five that's insane so you're getting way more electromagnetic radiation coming from fake ear pods versus originals I don't know how harmful this is but that's two volts per meter more than apples if anyone knows more about this leave a comment but that's kind of scary Bluetooth 5.0 and apples versus whatever Bluetooth this is about 30 feet it's still holding strong 40 feet 50 feet still good straight line of sight I'm able to get a strong connection on both even at 100 feet passes the range test yes these look like ear pods Pro they connect to your iPhone like ear pods Pro but they do not have any of the features that make ear pods Pro amazing nor the sound quality so $80 200 depending on where you buy them from are they worth it I don't know you really have to want to flex on somebody to spend this kind of money I mean I'd rather just save up and get the full amounts it's just not worth it compared to apples maybe if the price comes down to like $50 sure but at 80 plus I don't I can't justify that price tag even though it's a very good clone of apples I'd still of course go for apples any day well keep an eye out for any better versions of this otherwise thanks for watching peace", "n6S5MMcXJz8": "yo hey guys and welcome back to my channel it's your boy real natty smokes and today you got a little cart review for us guys and

frickin get them from nowhere else you know I'm saying so we gonna be alive you know I'm saying so let's get it let's hit this [ __ ] again and let's feel the effects here and this is my first smoke of the day but this time like the taste I taste at this moment is I taste like like a chocolate mint you don't say like you know like the chocolates they give you guys like when you guys eat out like a restaurant and I mean they give you that chocolate mint I know they give you this mint I like but olive garden I'm gonna give you those little chocolate mints you know I'm saying like chocolate and

for example I like this one here is jack hair it's a really energetic sativa I like it for when I have stuff to do I'm going about my day or cleaning the house it just gives you that energy to keep

this all right perfect hopefully you guys are having a good day oh push here all right there we go and that's how that comes if you guys haven't seen these take a certain battery you have to buy the

remember these are finicky it's going to take a second to get that vibration to hit yeah that's the one bad thing it took me forever to get this so it's pretty much a fail a strong citrusy taste definitely the only bad thing as you see it took about six or seven draws to even get that connection and you gotta suck hard too the only good thing these are good for i would say i mean not the only good thing but if you have like a vision problem or anything like that to where you can't really tell how much you're intaking with the whole vibration you can tell exactly how much you're getting

I hope that I won't be spilling any today. Same Brain Mugs, link in the description. Do you guys know what's\nin front of me right now? Of course you do. AirPods Max. They are here, and I can't believe it. These have been rumored for quite awhile, but of course they were\nrumored under the name of AirPods Studio, and when\nthis name was finally announced, not only did people have a\nlot to say about the name, but they had even more\nto say about the price. At $549, they're a pretty\nexpensive pair of headphones, but are they worth it? Should we get this unboxing under way? Thought we would maybe go for something a little tiny today, just kidding. I don't even need a knife, do I? I'm so excited about this! These come in five different colors, this is the space gray,\nthere's also a silver, a pink, a sky blue, and a green, basically the same exact colors as the new iPad Air. Here we go, here we go, here we go! Oh, wow, ooh! Wow, okay, okay! Who says that, who says, \"Okay?\" - [Tyler] Lil Jon. - Yes. Oh, oh, oh this is paper, I thought this was the color of them. Oh, this is nice. I'm looking off camera\nat Tyler, he's like. Pretty. Look at, here they are. I'm gonna set them right there and let's just see what's in here. I was hoping that they would have a matching lightning cable\nfor each of the headphones, but they don't, it's just\nthe basic Lightning 2USB-C. I do wish that they\nwould've made these USB-C, but it kind of makes sense because all of the other\nAirPods in the AirPods family are all lightning, and the\nphone is lightning, makes sense. (gasps) It's magnetic. It's kind of like the Smart\nFolio case on the iPad. This soft mesh, this kind of feels like the Home Pod covering, super soft. This is the first taking\nout of the case moment. There will never be\nanother one after this. Oh, they're light. - [Tyler] Maybe do it from the top down. (beeps) - Go, there will never be another one. This is take two. Wow. (upbeat music) Ear cups off. Speechless. Okay, let's get these connected. You basically are just able to bring it next to each other and they\nshould automatically connect, here we go! \"Press the noise control button \"to switch between noise\ncancellation and transparency. \"The media control, press\nthe digital crown once to play, pause, twice,\" oh my goodness. I'm so ready. They're connected, they're\nconnected, here we go, here we go, here we go, are you ready? Holy crap, I'm excited! (gasps) Oh. It's such a nice fit, like\nyou don't even feel this sitting on your head. This is why they call it AirPods, because it feels like I'm floating on a freaking cloud. I need to listen to something right now. Transparency mode is on,\nTyler, say something. - [Tyler] Hi! - Hey, I can hear you! - [Tyler] Hello, hello. - I wish they, and it's\nlike so super clear, it's almost like I'm\nnot even wearing these. I don't even feel this\ntouching the top of my head. It's so wild. Okay, noise cancellation is now on. - [Tyler] Hey, Justine. - I heard you say something,\nI don't know what you said. Play Noah Cyrus, \"July.\" So if you press the digital crown button, that activates Siri. I'm gonna turn up with the digital crown. Oh, it even has the little click sound that the Apple Watch makes. (calm music) I have it so loud, like I think it's all the way up. I can't even, I actually can't\nhear my own voice right now. You gotta put these on. Get over here, get over here. So you're probably gonna have\nto adjust this a little bit. I actually never even adjusted it yet. I was even listening to\nthat over top of my hair. - Whoa, whoa!\n- Whoa. - Whoa. - I'm waiting, what?\n- Whoa. - What do you think? - I can't hear myself.\n- Right? - I can't hear myself. - I know! - Am I still talking?\n- Yeah. - I'll just keep saying whoa.\n- I know. - Play \"Laugh Now, Cry Later\" by Drake. - Hmm, the tears of\nTwitter taste delicious. - I have them turned up all the way and I'm yelling, and\nI can't hear my voice, and it is perfectly, it's perfectly clear with no distortion at all. - This is the loudest that I've ever heard Tyler raise his voice, I've never-- - I literally have no idea\nwhat you're doing or saying. - I have never heard him\ntalk louder, this is it. - Okay, okay. Wait, aren't they comfy?\n- Oh my god. - I'm so in shock right now because I knew they were gonna be good, and\nI know everyone's expecting me to be like, \"Apple fangirl\nJustine, you got an I \"in front of your name,\nlike you're gonna like them \"no matter what,\" no. I am honestly, genuinely surprised. Oh my gosh, I can't believe\nthat I can't hear myself. This is so weird. You know, hold on. You know what this fine\ngentleman Drake once said? - [Tyler] What? - \"We started from the\nbottom, now we here.\" (laughs) I mean I don't know what else\nto say, like I'm honestly, like I am not being a fangirl right now because I really wanted to be critical, I wanted to have something to say. They're incredibly comfortable, like I don't feel this\non the top of my head. A lot of headphones,\nyou'll be able to feel this pressure on the top of your head. Where I do feel most of the pressure, it's kind of interesting because it is sort of like right around here, but it's giving you that\nseal around your ear. I still have transparency mode on and it sounds like I'm\ntalking perfectly clear, but, there's nine microphones\non here, did you know that? We're gonna get into the tech details. I wanted to do that before I do the test. But now, I'm so shook, I\ncan't even think straight. When they first announced this, obviously the AirPods\nare meant to be wireless but for me as an editor and\nfor a lot of other people who do a lot of stuff\nwhere you need to have no latency in editing or in\nsome type of music production, I need to be able to plug these in. So this is their lightning\nto 3.5 millimeter audio jack. This is crazy because I still\nhave the transparency mode on so I can kind of hear my hair\nrubbing on the microphone, but it sounds so perfectly clear that it's like I'm\ntalking without these on. And then when I lift this up, it automatically\ndisconnects from my phone, and then as soon as I put it back on, I hear it again connecting to my phone. I got distracted, so this is the lightning to 3.5 millimeter, and I'm\nlooking for something similar to this style for our podcasts that my sister and I do,\nyou guys may have seen that we have mugs now. Tea has never tasted better. I wanted to use these for podcasting that you have to plug them in, so that's where this comes into play. So this is a lightning to 3.5\nmillimeter headphone jack, so I'll be able to use this and plug this into our roadcaster so we can use these as we normally would use other headphones for our podcasting, and\nI am gonna try this out because we're actually\nshooting our podcast tomorrow, so this Saturday, if you guys\nwanna check out our podcast where I'm going to be using these, check out YouTube.com/samebrain, or you can find us on Apple\nPodcasts as Same Brain, or you can go to Anchor.fm/samebrain. All of the places, wherever\nyou listen to a podcast, it's probably there. That's gonna be a real test\nbecause we'll be wearing these for like over an hour and a half. The comfort level, anyway,\nthere's so much more that I need to tell you about these. (electronic music) So the new AirPods Max\nhave high fidelity audio with an Apple-designed\n40-millimeter dynamic driver that will produce well-balanced sound across the entire audible range. These also have a pair of Apple H1 chips for computational audio that is capable of executing over nine\nbillion operations per second to adapt the audio to the\nfit and seal of your ear. This is called Adaptive EQ. This actually measures the sound signal being delivered to your ears\nand will be able to adjust the low and mid frequencies in real time based on the fit and the\nseal around your ear, also taking into account\nglasses, hair, or even piercings. So for the noise cancellation,\nthey have eight microphones that are able to capture and cancel all of the unwanted noise. There's three outward-facing microphones on each ear cup and\nthere's one on the inside that's able to listen to the sound of what your ears are hearing. So using that H1 chip, it's\nable to analyze the data and is able to create an\nequal and opposite sound that will then reduce the unwanted sound. Transparency mode is something that is on almost all high-brand\nheadphones at this point so this will allow you to turn\noff the noise cancellation so you'll be able to hear\nthe world around you. You're able to turn this on or off on your iPhone, your Apple Watch, or even on the headphones directly with this button right here. Spatial audio is also something that is very interesting, and\nthey did announce this before and it is in the latest AirPods Pro with the latest iOS update, but I actually have not tried this yet, so this is gonna be so exciting, that I'm gonna be able to\ntest out the spatial audio for the first time on the AirPods Pro Max. So what this spatial audio\nis is it basically gives you a theater-like experience\nwith dynamic head tracking, so the sound is always mapped\ndirectly to your content, so as you move your\nhead, the accelerometer and the gyroscopes both in your AirPods, your iPhone, or your iPad will constantly be tracking and comparing\nthe motion of your head to your device. So Apple's obviously known\nfor their attention to detail in design and I really\nlove the look of these. So this is a stainless steel headband, and it has a mesh headrest and these memory foam ear cushions which magnetically attach to your AirPods and you can also mix and\nmatch these if you want to get an extra pair, so they're $65 a piece, so you can get them as a replacement or if you just want a different color. The digital crown is a really nice feature which is pulled from the Apple Watch, and this lets you adjust the\nvolume by turning the dial or push once to play,\npause, or answer a call, twice to skip forward,\nthree times to skip back, and then press hold for Siri. There's an optical sensor in each cup that will detect when\nit's placed on your head and positional sensors where the headband meets each ear cup that\nwill be able to detect the movement and rotation. There's also an additional\nninth microphone that is used to enhance your\nvoice during phone calls. So these have a 20-hour battery life and this smart case for storage. There's a built-in magnet\nthat activates the case detect and the sensor in each ear cup so that it'll be able\nto place the AirPods Max into an ultra low-power state\nto preserve the battery. So we're now gonna do\na spatial audio test. I've never tried this before, I know it is in the AirPods\npro, but for whatever reason, I haven't tried it yet. So today is the day, we've\ngot \"The Mandalorian\" all loaded up here. So in the control center, when you long press into the volume, this gives you your noise\ntransparency control and then you can also turn\nspatial audio off or on. Let me turn it off and see\nwhat that sounds like first. Spatial audio is off, turning my head, nothing is happening. Now let's turn it on, okay, now it's on. (gasps) Oh my gosh! It's like I'm in \"The\nMandalorian\" right now. Hold that thought. Hold that thought! (light saber sounds) Try spatial audio once. (beep) (laughs) Becomes a Jedi very quickly! (beep) The look on Tyler's face is very scared. (beep) Let's see here. Will I hurt myself or somebody? (triumphant music) Yeah! Where does that leave us\nin terms of this review? (beep) Spatial audio's cool, dude. (beep) Ooh, another test. Podcast test. There it is, ready for podcasting. Look at that, it's so small. Hello, hello. Turn this up, oh my gosh,\nit's freaking perfect. It sounds like I have transparency mode on but I don't because I'm\ntalking through the microphone and it's coming through my head. - [Tyler] What if you\nput Transparency Mode on? - Then it's just gonna\nreally mess with me. Hello, oh this is just weird. I'm talking to myself through myself. (laughs) Oh my goodness, Jenna\nis gonna lose her mind. Tomorrow we're gonna get Jenna's reaction and she's incredibly cynical. It's hard to impress her, I\nthink she's gonna be impressed. Try with glasses, with glasses. Oh, I've gotta try it with glasses. You have glasses on. - Yeah, it feels good. - Podcast game has just been elevated. Oh man, my head is small.\n- Yeah. - This is perfect, I don't even know, it's been really difficult,\nI'm sure many people who wear glasses have had the struggle of wearing glasses with headphones, Tyler's like yep, me. I mean I also wear glasses\nbut most of the time I do wear contacts, but this is nice. This is nice. Well thank you guys so much for watching, this was kind of just a first look and a first impression\nof the AirPods Pro Max. I keep calling it the Pro Max, but it's just the Max. I am honestly way more impressed than I thought I was gonna\nbe because obviously, like I knew they were gonna be cool because they are incredibly\nexpensive, but here's the thing, you're paying for what you're getting. - [Tyler] It's crazy. - I know, I know, I know. - Like--\n- I know. - [Tyler] It's totally\nbeyond anything I expected. - Same. - [Tyler] I thought they'd be nice, but. (electronic music)", "PVOf98mLzcM": "what's going on YouTube so with all of the recent vape cartridge scares out there I wanted to try and find a company that manufactures a products that allows me to fill my own cartridges with distill it that I can go and pick up from any of the local recreational stores here in Washington State with this company Lynx vapor they created a product called the Hermes 3 and this guy is a standard 510 battery vape cartridge comes in this nice little carrying case and so it comes with a 1/2 gram cartridge your 510 battery and then the charger within the case you can also order a full one gram cartridge as well but the beauty of this thing is that it's manufactured out of a hundred percent medical grade stainless steel and borosilicate glass so you know not only is it going to offer the best quality as far as vapor and flavor production goes but it's also going to make sure not have any toxins or anything that is going to leach out into your oil and concentrate that can potentially make you sick or give you any type of inhalation issues so as you can see I've got a cartridge I have already ran about three-quarters of a gram through this guy without any issues the only one thing that I have noticed and this is standard with any 5-10 cartridges is that the vapor path does start to gum up so you can just lightly go in with like a toothpick or something clear out that vapor path and then it has no issues again but I've got a little bit of distill it left that is some forbidden fruit that is absolutely delicious so that I've got right here and that is just in a little glass syringe so what I can do is I'm going to change camera angles will go in for a closer look and I'll show you how we fill this thing up ok so here is a close-up look of the cartridge or at least as close up as I can get with this particular lens and have it be in focus so you basically just unscrew the top piece and so that comes off and you're just basically left with this little cartridge and then what you're going to do is you're going to take your little syringe and we'll just pop this cap off here now ideally you would have not all cartridge or not all syringes come with a little metal tip but ideally you'd have a little metal tip that would screw in there and allow you to put it into the cartridge a little bit easier but this is going to be kind of the standard way of doing it for most people so you're basically going to come in with your distill it and you're just going to kind of gently squeeze and I'm slowly rotating the cartridge as I'm squeezing it in there and it's just going to kind of roll down the sides as you continue to put more in and you don't want to go too fast otherwise it's going to gum up over the sides kind of like what I started doing there so I'm just gonna back off a little bit let the Sun kind of warm it up so that it will start going down into the cartridge now the beautiful thing about this particular vape cartridge as well is that this is a ceramic atomizer and it will burn any viscosity oil whatsoever so if you have a super thick like this kind of viscosity or if you have a little bit more runny that will work in this cartridge without any issues whatsoever and link's vapor does quote these cartridges to last about three to five times longer than the standard cartridges that you're gonna buy and just throw away after the one use so kind of when they're big sales features about these things is that it's helping to keep some extra cartridges out of the landfill which isn't a bad thing whatsoever okay so now that we have put some distill it into the cartridge it's time to go ahead and give this guy a try so this battery does utilize three different temperature settings it has a low medium and high setting just like any five ten battery cartridge you were just going to go one two three four five to get the guy to turn on and it's going to show you a few little let's do that one more time one two three four five so it will show you a red blue and green light to let you know that it is on and blue is going to be your low setting green is going to be your medium setting and red is going to be your high setting so personally I like to use cannabis more as a medicinal and spiritual use basically for dealing with mood control chronic pain as well as consciousness expansions so I personally am NOT looking to get just blasted out crazy high which is why I like the low setting if you really do want to get blasted out and take more of like a DAB like hit off of this thing you can double tap the button in either one of the temperature setting modes and activate what's called sesh mode and that's going to run the atomizer for 10 seconds and allow you to get a big nice fat ripoff of it me personally I'm more of the kind of surge and pull type so just to show you as an example so as you can see great vapor production that was basically just like a two or three second tap let it go for two or three seconds two or three seconds let it go two or three seconds let it go and that allows for air to continue to go through and cool it plus give you another bit cool it give you another bit and that really allows for a very smooth clean rip and the flavor off of this thing is dang near close to an oil rig so by being medical grade stainless steel and borosilicate with nothing else present in the construction of this piece it really helps to maintain the quality of the flavor of the concentrate without altering it whatsoever like you get sometimes with some of the cheaper cartridges that use like a plastic mouthpiece me personally because I am very sensitive to flavors I can taste that difference of the plastic especially as it's getting hot and that just can't be good for you so from a health standpoint link's vapor you're spot on with the production of this thing the quality of it is great I really like the fact that it comes with this nice little case that you can just pop everything in it's right there conveniently placed close it up and it's a nice kind of metal on plastic so it will keep it nice and safe mine unfortunately did get a little bit of damage in the mail USPS kind of got a little bit abusive with it if you will say it was actually severely dented and so I took it apart kind of manipulated everything back and it doesn't look too bad it's it's still a nice case it still serves its purpose and keeps it nice and safe the one thing that I would say if I had a complaint with this piece is actually in the case Lynx vapor I think you guys could have designed this a little bit better so that you didn't have to remove the battery and atomizer every single time so by making the case maybe a little bit longer and less thicker in this direction that could have happened or maybe by creating a couple more cutouts so you could have a few more cartridges within the case or just as an example so if you do get the 1 gram cartridge there's this little foam insert that you can pop out so the 1 gram cartridge couldn't sit in there and I think you guys could have done something like that on either side where you could make a pop-out so that you could fit other cartridges in but that's just maybe a design standpoint for the Hermes 4 or something else do to come down the line links paper manufacturers several other products one of which is called the blaze which is designed more for waxes instead of oils I will be doing a review on that here shortly as well they have also a lot of accessories for these units specifically a couple of nice glass attachments which I'll be showing in the next review on the Lynx blaze as well as of a couple of other things that comes with that unit as well they do also make some various herb vaporizers as well personally I'm not much of a flower person anymore I do prefer concentrates over flower because I don't like the combustion of the plant material like just the pure plant essence that you get with the concentrates but from what I've seen on other reviews and on their website which I'll link in the description box below all of their products are made from borosilicate glass and 100% stainless steel so they are all designed and either using quartz or ceramic for their atomizers designed to really give you the best health quality and performance and longevity that they possibly can so thanks again links vapor for sending this out for me to do this review I am looking forward to doing the review on the blaze next and I will see you guys next time", "wVssXLxUX-c": "[Music] hi everyone in this video I'll be showing you my new carbon arc torch which I made at the suggestion of a few of my subscribers that left me comments on my last few videos a number of people suggested that I use a carbon arc torch to aid in the generation of synthetic rubies so I looked into these I had never heard of a carbon arc torch before apparently these were invented in the late 1800s I was especially interested in making one of these torches because apparently they are a good substitute for an oxy acetylene torch which I've never had in my workshop this torch can reach the same or maybe even a hotter temperature than an oxy acetylene torch without needing expendable fuel sources this runs right off my arc welder which of course runs off my wall outlet if I really wanted to I could buy solar panels and batteries and power this torch purely from sunlight which is an intriguing thought this torch uses carbon rods with the measurement of 5/16 of an inch by 12 inches so there are footlong and 5/16 of an inch in diameter and I bought a 50 pack of these carbon rods on eBay for like $20 so they're less than 50 cents apiece and they actually last quite a long time I don't think I'll ever have to buy carbon rods again these rods are mounted in metal clamps which are on an articulated handle so that I can bring the two rods together and strike an arc between them the handle itself is made of wood so that the two articulated pieces are electrically insulated from one another to each section of the wood handle I've attached a metal rail to extend the end of the torch further away from your hands and at the end of each rail a clamp to hold the carbon electrodes these clamps were about three dollars each and the steel rail was also only three dollars sold as a mounting bracket for shelves the clamps attached to the rail with bolts and then each one is screwed into the handle at the base I've articulated the two halves of this handle with a small hinge so as I pushed the handle part with my thumb it brings the tip of the carbon rods close to each other I've wrapped several rubber bands around the front of this handle to give this action some resistance and also to keep the carbon rods apart when I set the torch down to go turn the welder on and off if you were to build one of these for yourself the most expensive part is definitely going to be the cable a cable this size that can handle the power from an arc welder could be five or six dollars per foot and I'm using about twelve feet for this torch if you can ask around and find someone with a cable like this that's collecting dust you'll save quite a lot of money on this project two wires from this cable are split at the torch head and connected to each of the rails that hold the carbon electrodes on the opposite end from the torch to pieces of copper act as terminals bolted to a wooden block this just allows me to connect the power supply from the welder to this cable in a secure way the most important thing to be careful of is making sure there are no metal pieces that could make an electrical connection between the two metal rails for example the screws that hold the rails to the wooden handles could touch each other in the middle if you're not careful so I filed their points off and put a piece of rubber between them and that's really all there is to it this whole design is really just a clever way to touch these two carbon rods together and keep a spark going between them so with this torch completed let's see what it can do this works great for heating both conductive and non conductive materials and I've also seen it work for brazing an obvious disadvantage with this compared to an oxy-acetylene torch is that you can't adjust the flame to be either oxygen or fuel rich it just is what it is superheated air this can cause corrosion in certain materials like steel but if you wanted to get fancy you could add a line to blow a shielding gas into the arc the same as with a MIG or TIG welder alright so that is it for this project this was a really simple build but I think this is a tool that I will find really useful around my workshop as you can see I already have a set up here to film a follow up video with this torch that I think you'll be really interested in we're going to be generating a flammable gas using an arc torch in a process that I don't think you'll have seen so stay tuned for that video I also want to mention that in the current crisis that's going on in the world right now keep in mind the people and around the world that have already been struggling especially places where hunger is an issue and families are being forced to decide whether they go to work to feed their kids or stay home to protect their elderly there are a lot of people around the world in that dilemma right now so keep in mind if you have some extra income try to support some organizations that are working to feed families around the world that don't have any other choice but to go to work if they don't want their kids to starve I'll put some links in the video description below so you can support some organizations that I have enjoyed supporting over the years anyway thank you for watching this video I hope to see you on the next one I'll have some more interesting projects in the future leave me comments below I'd love to hear from you especially if you have ideas for future projects obviously this project was inspired by some of your comments thank you for watching I'll see you next time", "4AvISpz3z_E": "hey welcome to cannabase IG's today we're taking a detailed look at how to use 510 oil cartridges with vape and batteries this episode is brought to you by New York vape shop you can find all the devices that were using in the demonstration today at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with the code rough 3 first we're going to take it look at the anatomy of a 5-10 cartridge first I want to talk about the tip and the tips are pretty much a up to you like however you decide which is your preference is they come in all types of metal they're come in ceramic and they come in wood so the tips are pretty much straightforward next we're going to talk about the tanks the tanks themselves are what holds the oil and they're usually half a milliliter to one milliliter and sometimes the really big ones like the two gram or 2.2 gram heavy hitter cartridges can be really long but referring to the tank is the actual part of the cartridge where the oil is inside of it the two part and then there's the oil inlet and sometimes they come in various whole sizes you can see the one at the top there has a little bit larger hole size than the cartridge there at the bottom and generally for the thicker THC oils you probably want more of a thicker hole then there's the airflow if you can see at the very very bottom this is a bottom airflow and you can see that the airflow hole is right there in the threads at the bottom of the device other devices sometimes have them at the top near the tip and so generally one is either a bottom airflow in most cases sometimes a top airflow and then there's also what they call a variable airflow and you say the case here the airflow is adjustable at the top there so that's the one one thing to consider as well as part of your cartridge and the last and perhaps the most crucial part that we're going to talk about there's here at the base and that is the atomizer and the atomizers are usually either wick or ceramic and the wick they're okay but preferably you probably want to use ceramic today's you get a lot better even distribution better flavor and you see the ceramic heats the oil as it passes through now let's talk about best practices one of the most important things when it comes to using your 510 cartridges with a pin is to use the right voltage setting and you can see generally if it's a variable voltage for these kinds of pins that will vary somewhere between three and five volts and that's the appropriate range for most 510 cartridges but if you're using something like a box mod like the steam cloud that you see here that goes up to sixty watts it's going to be way too much so you're going to want to bring that down to like five watts or to the lower settings and to make sure that you're using the proper voltage or wattage another thing that you want to make sure is that using the proper airflow type you can see this is a bottom airflow device but used on this box mod if you pull it all the way in there there's no air inlet and so for this is the type that you'll need a top airflow so there are types of devices that may not be compatible with certain types of cartridges so that is one thing you want to make sure that for instance of this case you'd want to use a top airflow device and a variable and would be even better and you can see here - this is a bottom airflow and on the bottom airflow there will be a little bitty notch where the air would be allowed to flow through at the bottom of the device so you just want to make sure that you're using the right kind with the right type of device another thing is that when it comes to your empty device you probably just want to throw it and not throw it away but you want to refill it and not just keep hitting it because you're going to burn it out so when you get done with it either go ahead and toss it it's done or stop hitting it until you're ready to refill it or you're going to burn it out another thing is when you're putting in your pocket you really want to be careful with the tips especially with the ones that have an exposed tip and rather than sitting down into a sleeve because if you leave it in your pocket you can do something like this a lot of times it'll bend the tip over one way or the other can expose the electronics and cause you some problems so if you're going to be putting it in your pocket you might want to go with a device such as this where the cartridge sits down inside of it like a sleeve and the last tip we're going to go with here is to make sure that you keep your battery charged or keep a backup battery so if you have a nice pin that you like to use you might want to keep a little cheap on the side that you can have always kind of have as a backup by your charge in the other and that pretty much brings me to the end of my tips and best practices on using your 510 cartridges with your vaporizer batteries if you'd like to learn more about their products here

"VPqYXdOYa-I": "something that might help actually is taking a paper clip and just kind of getting that hole started a little bit see there that way it nice and easy and now I kind of got that area opened up a little bit because I mean the syringe diameter is a lot bigger than the paperclip diameter whoever's still kind of over the tip of the syringe there if I can get up a face see I just need to get that rubber to come off the tip of the syringe and then we can start deploying the oil I think actually I might have done it with the paperclip and that might have helped get the rubber kind of all the way out of the way and get broke off a piece of rubber oops okay well now it's in there I actually shoved it in there with the paperclip in there and then pulled the paper cut out so now the syringe is all the way into the cartridge and well now we want to give it slow twists and slowly let the oil come out of the syringe and we don't want to let the syringe come out of the cartridge while the pressure is being applied to the oil we're gonna pull the syringe on the cartridge we need to let the pressure stop being applied all right it's just uh can I buy everything give it a few twists oh I was going the wrong way the air comes and this part can be a little tedious but less is more with these twists because one little twist is gonna give you a good amount of oil that's not even like a quarter turn turning it like it was a clock like one hour if it was the hour hand it's pretty cool lives for sure [Music] so I hear on that side I probably like one more twist and then I'll have to let the air like move all the way to the top and the bottom by hitting it a couple times can just do that for you I definitely say the hardest part is getting that syringe into the rubber part but you know doing it a few times you'll get the hang of it and it'll become easier so now that I'm done and I want to pull the syringe out I'm going to twist it so that the the plunger moves back away so I know the oil isn't pressed up I like all the way against the top here and then let it kind of hang out for a second so that you know that you've sucked most of the oil I kind of out of that syringe I mean a little bit of oil might pop out with it something else that happened to me last time is this metal piece actually came off of the plastic for the tip of the syringe that metal piece there and this little piece there so I'd watch out for that but I was able to like push it back in what happened I mean definitely macgyvering this here but you know saving some money and it's gonna leave a little indent there you know looks like the oil might you know ease its way back out but the rubber roll will hold it it won't push past that rubber there what looks like just at the five minute mark there in the video so that's actually not bad I mean about five minutes to fill up the cartridge there and the paper clip technique I think definitely helped get the syringe into the cartridge there and I still have about half down of oil left in this guy here so I can fill up a whole nother cartridge I really hope this helps out Sarah happy holidays happy smoking", "OkiLenpSPl0": "but i mean come on bro these are pretty sexy like just objectively even if you got all four you were just ripping it it'd be pretty hot what's up everybody youtube's been really busting my balls about their community guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks hey what up before we start this cart video usually the cart videos just don't have a lot of smoke in the air there's not a lot of you know big smoke so we got to fix that with this cheers everybody oh my god i'm doing exactly what i needed all righty man i think that's exactly the type of hit that we needed to start out a video you know when you get a hit like that the video is just going to start out good man but this video is not about the dab so i guess in a way it kind of is man we're talking about some cards today some really [ __ ] expensive cards it's the whole reason why you clicked on this video so listen you've probably if you're especially in a medicinal state medicinal only state you've probably gone to a dispensary and seen some absolute [ __ ] cart prices like forty dollars for a half gram of distilling which is like mind blowing like 80 gram of [ __ ] [ __ ] like get out of here bro then you get the live resin carts which can be around the exact same [ __ ] prices like 40 on the half gram it really depends on where you live because california i mean i've seen live resin carts go for 35 on the full gram i've seen some [ __ ] dislike for 40 i've seen dislike for like 10 15 so it's just it's just really depending on where you live but these bad boys right here these pod tones made straight in la are 55 wait for it not for a half gram they're 55 for a 0.3 i don't know if you can see it right there on the bottom net weight 300 milligrams so usually it's a thousand milligrams for a gram cart and uh if you were to buy three of these which i only bought two because i'm not a [ __ ] maniac if you were to buy three of these bad boys it would be 160 dollars and you still wouldn't get a full grand you'd get point one off it's like someone skimped you on a full gram cart now of course if we're gonna buy all this [ __ ] we gotta have a sponsor for the video you guys know who the sponsor is i absolutely [ __ ] love them they've been with us every single month for over a year now adam and eve just the wonderful people over there listen man this this [ __ ] and sex kind of go right hand in hand i'm not gonna lie what's better than getting baked and getting late it's like my motto damn you can get 50 off any single item and free shipping if you use my code con and uh obviously you guys are using that [ __ ] because they're coming back so often so listen shout out to you guys that are using it maybe you guys even use it consistently i bet you i have several people that watch every month and get reminded and they're like oh yeah i need my monthly sex toy you [ __ ] freaks i like that [ __ ] shout out to you guys that's awesome like i said for guys girls anything in between just anything you know what i mean whatever you're into they have it i promise go check them out it's good stuff maybe a little birthday is coming up or something you know it's just surprising anyway these little bad boys right here these expensive ass [ __ ] i haven't even opened this one yet so i'm excited to try this one out these are made from rosin like i said so if you don't know if you need the breakdown explanation of live resin rosin difference and all that i made an in-depth video right here it's like 20 minutes pretty [ __ ] long but if you want like the one minute breakdown distillate which is probably like 80 or 90 of what you see on the market it's a majority of what you see is made from a process of just nasty like crude cannabis oil pretty much and it goes through a distillation process over and over like two three times and then you eventually get a very pure thc extract it's like upwards of 99 just thc but the only problem with that is just like distilled water there's nothing else that comes along with that like extracted thc it just gets you high there's no flavor behind it there's no profile there's no nothing it's just like distilled water it's it's like it's flat zero so if your distillate cart tastes like something it was most likely added terpenes after there's artificial terpenes are there's actual live resin terpenes but even if you add live resin terps to the distillate it's still a distillate cart a lot of brands will try to get away with that they'll have like on their packaging it'll be like live resin terpenes like a little small little thing it's like it's 90 distillate which is not awful i just personally don't like smoking it now live resin on the other hand is a lot different live resin comes from actual cannabis plants so as soon as the cannabis plant is grown instead of hanging in drying it gets frozen and then you extract it through a variety of like butane processes or gas processes whatever then you get an extract at the end of it which unlike distillate already has all the plant profile in it because you just got it from the full plant so you don't have to worry about adding any [ __ ] after any cutting agents or you have to worry about any of that because it's the it's the full cannabis profile plant and i love it because if you get like a gorilla glue live resin cart it is so much different than getting a gorilla glue distillate cart with like just some gorilla glue terpenes after it's just it doesn't taste the same it's not even close to the same and the feeling that's the main thing the feeling is way different because you don't get what is called the entourage effect entourage effect is pretty much all the cannabinoids working together to make you feel a certain way so you know you necessarily don't get higher off a bong rip but you get like feeling good off of a boundary but when you take a fat rip of a distillate cart like yeah you get higher but it's like not the same you don't feel like the body high it's just like a real like a it's like an unclean high you feel like you're just getting too much thc and not enough for something else which is exactly why i don't like it but this [ __ ] on the other hand rosin which i know i think specifically people in the northwest have known about rosin cars forever because when i was there for hemp fest i think 2019 i saw several people several people came up to me like homies and fans and [ __ ] and they're like yo bro like smoke this rosin card like it's all we smoke out here and i was like what i was like damn that's a lit like even cali's not even on the rosin card set heavy if they are they're taxed as [ __ ] as you can see ridiculous rosin is a whole other game than live resin because live resin you need a gas or some type of extraction kind of like butane propane whatever method to get it out rosin you use very simple heat and pressure you literally get a nug you put it between two plates you can even put it between a hair [ __ ] dresser a hair dryer or whatever i've seen a lot of people do that on youtube and [ __ ] crazy i don't know if i'd recommend that but you squeeze it out at a very specific temperature and a whole bunch of juices come out and those juices are what you're smoking so you don't need any sort of additive or any sort of extraction really like crazy method it's very like simple it's almost primitive in a way you just [ __ ] squeeze it juice come out monkey smoke you know that's really what it is it's [ __ ] dope you get the whole plant profile with it without needing any circus sometimes if you're not a very good extractor with live resin you know there's a lot of companies that are qualified a lot of individuals that are qualified but sometimes if you're doing black market shade there's a lot of live resin out there that like these are you know amateur extractors and the live resin isn't as tasty and there's too much butane in there there's too much like they didn't extract it right it's just there's a lot of [ __ ] that can go wrong obviously like i said this [ __ ] even an ape could do it's very primitive you get two hot rocks and just squish a [ __ ] nug in between and i'm pretty sure that's how they were making like juices and [ __ ] back in the day like it's the same method but we just smoke it this one that we're smoking right now it says notes of chocolate berries and citrus with a relaxing body high and a positive mood lift it's a little bit cap i'm not gonna lie i don't know about the chocolate but i do taste the berries and citrus i'm not gonna lie pod toads are made from full spectrum whole plant rosin extracted from premium flowers for a natural and delicious entourage effect like i was saying entourage effect beautiful i like how they said that on there no added flavors whatsoever 100 cannabis rosin made in los angeles good [ __ ] right there so here's the craziest thing that i think is on this whole package right here it says it uses over 1 8 of buds for this i listen dude i'm not a professional i'm not trying to like tell any brand what they should and shouldn't do but like damn that's crazy dude i feel like i got two rosin presses right over there i can show you i'm literally just whipping around real quick those two bad boys right there i can get like a grandma rosin off of an eighth probably but then again i have to like extract it once more to be able to put it in the cart so maybe that's about right maybe they are using some real gas in these bad boys it better be for 55 a goddamn point three they better be man technically if there's an eighth of buds in here you're paying for like a 55 eighth which is very in line i guess with other la prices indoor prices top shelf prices whatever you want to call it this one that i'm opening right now oh [ __ ] there's some uh try them all it says up fun chill and dream see that's another thing that i'm not exactly too sure about i i'm not too big of a fan of when carts say that stuff for like because it's very it's marketed towards like the karen that just walks into the dispensary for the first time and she's like i just want something to have me chill and it's like they sell these to them in the beverly hills or like west [ __ ] hollywood and then they're like all right yeah like i'll pay that amount but i feel like to a connoisseur that really enjoys rosin that enjoys like because i feel like they're not getting appreciated they're the type to be like well why would i spend 55 or 50 or whatever the price is on 300 milligrams when i could spend like 20 on this a thousand milligrams this one over here they don't understand the difference so it's like it's a very weird marketing i'd say it's a weird grab right here i will say that pod tones i think you should uh put some strains on here i think it'll be a lot more desirable to the people that love rosin you know i mean that are very interested in the extraction game in the actual cannabis profile and trying to get a specific flavor specific you know terpene profile so i mean i don't know hey i'm not trying to tell anyone how to run their uh their little shming skis right here but hey this one's called the dream i will say that these are [ __ ] these are it when it comes to just the profile of them this is one of my favorite looking disposables maybe ever it probably is the shape the feel and i'm not sure if it's plastic it might be a little bit metal like maybe metal coated or something aluminum coated it's fire though it feels good in the hand it's like cold to the touch you know what i mean you know sometimes you get the plastic ones and it's like whatever it i'm a big fan of build quality sex appeal i'll call it a lot of people call it box of peel or look a peel but i mean come on bro these are pretty sexy like just objectively even if you got all four you were just ripping it it'd be pretty hot i will say that after a couple days though they do get they do expect you to finish in a couple days which i respect they're expecting you to chief on these because they do get clogged if you're not chiefing them like very consistently that was very nice let's get a little dream rip in and let's read the description i like if you can read the description and then taste it at the same time i feel like it just enhances some things maybe it's a little bit of a placebo but who knows let's see a perfumey floral bouquet that okay did i say that right like a bouquet of flowers i might be tweaking that delivers full body tension release perfect for letting it all go at the end of the day so it's a indica i imagine some sort of strain very heavy maybe a little og i will say that the airflow off a fresh pod is [ __ ] way better than this man like i said they expect you to [ __ ] go through these very fast dope it tastes good i like it i mean [ __ ] i don't know if i'd spend another 55 on the other one i feel like at this point if i already have half of them might as well go for the other half some point right i don't know they're expensive as [ __ ] though are they worth it probably not i don't know i feel like the common theme on my channel is just like i'm a [ __ ] cheap bastard man that's that's the whole point of the channel damn near if you were to just watch every video you'd be like damn this [ __ ] doesn't like spending money at all like dude i don't know i just feel like 55 for a point three like come on like they're dope and everything but like i said you guys in the northwest you guys been smoking rosin for a fat minute man a hot minute you guys have been smoking rosin cars you can probably get a gram i think even in the northeast i've seen some people in boston a little massachusetts gang where are you at man i have seen some people with rosin cars over there you're probably getting full grams of rosin what 50 or 60. come on a third of rosin a third of a gram for 55. i said a third of a rosin what the [ __ ] does that mean it has been the whole video we haven't taken a blinker which i think is pretty [ __ ] up so without further ado let's do a little blinky action man cheers everybody oh yeah wow that was a very short blinker but i feel like that was an appropriate amount of smoke like that was that was a solid blinker bro i've definitely taken 10 second blinkers that didn't have that much vapor i would have to rate them if i had to give them out of 10 including the price including everything within the packaging the feel the the high that you give with it the flavors taste but mainly the price with mind i'd have to give these a solid seven and a half like uh as the price gets cheaper i feel like the stars would go up you know i'm just that much of a [ __ ] cheap bastard whatever that's my final review on these bad boys listen you guys are [ __ ] crazy i appreciate you oh they're just knocked over no i knocked over my torch we're all right shout out to um i don't know you guys i don't know i was gonna say shout out to adam and eve there you go for the sponsor i was like i didn't get sent these but these are pretty cool cool little somethings man i just always like pointing out making videos on expensive ass things when i see them out in the cannabis world i got a 120 gram of rosin that i'm about to make a video on like in a few days that shit's [ __ ] like like what why is it so expensive like it doesn't even make sense dude so thank you guys for watching so much i appreciate you make sure to check out adam and eve make sure to check out the code you know use the code get sent off check out these if you're a big baller if you like some rosin carts if you're in the northwest just laugh at people on the california coast that are smoking [ __ ] these for a ridiculous price you know the crazy thing is i always go to a certain dyspo in west hollywood that has these and they [ __ ] are sold out of them all the time so that means they're hot on the shelves people are buying them i wonder what the market is man i'd be very interested anyone at pod tones watch this video check them out i kind of i didn't [ __ ] on it i gave it a seven and a half it's a good score right there be very interested in knowing more about the company like just your demographics and stuff if you had a breakdown of this i wonder if it's rosin enthusiasts or like karen's and moms that are just trying to get high and [ __ ] i don't know i love you guys thanks for being here thanks for chilling i'll see you very very soon on the next video and uh i'll stop slacking i promise i love you see you soon you", "6V1gPRAQ_IE": "oh that's good joe i am hot sweaty already ain't nothing i could do but i've been forgetting i'll do all of my cannabis products and uh why not do the timeless battery attached to it is you know say most people know the brand pacific stone but here they are uh pretty sure i'm smoking on pretty sure it's 805 sour it could be forbidden fruit it's funny that something so distinct i guess i'm not a hundred percent sure on because they do taste very differently hey maybe if this battery rips clean and uh allows me to enjoy some terpenes then maybe i can actually know the strain and then i just let y'all know hey this battery is great for like distinguishing like for a person that has multiple cards you know i want to come a little bit to the shade so you can see that it lights up a little bit and so i could maybe stop sweating so much um oh this absolutely rips higher than 3.5 volts if you're looking for like a low uh low temp part this this as well as most automatics in my knowledge aren't actually great for that you'll want like a variable voltage or just maybe like a lower voltage button press battery for that type of experience but yeah i'm pretty sure that's forbidden fruit the my issue now with it is actually the heart not even the battery so i can even maybe try to change the cart so i can review this battery for a little longer have more content and have more feedback for you because i don't really feel like if i don't get enough you know like a satisfactory hit i can't really review it that well and that cart was just uh the oil wasn't lining up with the wick it was tasting burns but i know that has nothing to do with the battery so i'm gonna go back to this shady spot it also helps me to see good this thing i actually can't see the recording at all it's too bright but yeah we're back here okay yeah it's a little puff rock garden usually clog so i guess i kind of have to for a video like this show you what a blinker would be like am i ready though i believe that was a standard 10 seconds oh yeah it's ripping this raw garden beautifully oh oh wow show y'all the view or whatever so you don't need to see my face when i'm suffering i might need some water but i'm i'm crawling it's just it's just a blinker actually i took back-to-back blinkers very very nice i'd raise some pictures right there probably going to use that for the thumbnail if i can wow i'm now i'm just sloppy um i'm i will check just for the [ __ ] sake of this video or should i just think excuse my head right quick yeah yeah all right i got it okay and i hope oh no no it won't work it won't work never mind okay i thought i had a different type of cart so i could show y'all maybe three three different types but that one it actually requires you to be a below like three volts and a taste burn when i use it with this battery well i think none of these damn um battery reviews ends up being one of my longer videos because i'm just out here vibing oh and i guess it's rare that i have this much runtime i'm always low on storage now a little more nature oh i guess my flash is on too i don't think that's really done much but yeah i really like this battery it's held small definitely should have showed y'all what it like came with honestly i think i have in a different video oh my god my hand but yeah my hands have all this like you know just sidewalk concrete take a nice deep breath in okay oh my god well yeah realizing that taylor these blinkers contributing to me sweating too i love this [ __ ] battery um it is a small battery doesn't last the longest but i don't feel like it dies hella quick either so he won like a nice auto draw with some swag it did come with a carrying case that i might actually just add on to the video or not and um you really just like can't go wrong with him like this unless you have specific cartridge that says you cannot exceed like three volts or you know you gotta be on it you gotta rip this live resident cartridge at a lower temperature otherwise this is crazy", "BWRP-RngOpE": "hello everyone welcome back to my channel my name is tawana marijuana if you're new here today please hit that subscribe button i got my vape in my hand and ring the bell to stay up to date with all my weekly videos because i do post every week if not every other week welcome to my world of cannabis knowledge and insight into the canadian legal market yikes hit the spliff if it ain't too tight yikes take a rip got you feeling right yikes bubba kush got me taking flight we be like trippy night today's video is sponsored by toki toki is a canadian cannabis brand located in toronto my friend demini over at toki has sent me a 510 battery along with a 510 wax cartridge kind of like i'll show you i'll show you what it is so not only is toki award-winning they really take pride in providing premium cannabis vape products and for those of you who are getting into cannabis vaping or maybe don't really know a lot about cannabis vaping i'll put a link up here somewhere click that link it'll take you to a video um just telling you everything that you need to know about vaping just the basics it's important to know that stuff because i'm sure there's a lot of misinformation around vapes online and i just wanted to help clarify what some of that meant this is a live resin 510 cartridge and it is amazing because distillate is really bad personally i'm not a fan of dyslex because it's basically the purest form of thc so there's no terpenes or other cannabinoids to contribute to the entourage effect of your experience and there's no flavor so there's not really much character to your high compared to live resin which has all of the cannabidoids and terpenes and amazing flavor and it just better experience and then i'm going to be trying the premium five diamonds for the first time this vape can use 510 cartridges and you could smoke your own concentrate consistencies in there too typically when i smoke distillate i'll be puff puff puffing away and i'm like really really really like intoxicated for a good five minutes and then it goes away with this live resin cartridge it lasts just as long as it would compared to smoking a joint or taking a bomb wretch [Music] make sure it's snug on there and then there's a little button right here that you would press five times [Music] uh the flavor on this is unreal honestly if you're spending like 50 to 80 bucks on a cartridge you might as well want a battery that's gonna you know match that in terms of quality the charging port you can charge your phone on it as well as the vape you don't have to worry about you know making sure you remember to bring your charger well you gotta remember to bring the bank but you know what i'm saying you don't have to rely on a cord you just have the bank and you need the vape and as long as you have the two you can charge your battery and support black owned businesses i only share premium cannabis products and this these are premium af so get your wallets ready from the design to how it smokes to the technology i would rate toki 10 out of 10 and i'm really looking forward to seeing future products of toki and i would recommend everyone try these out because these are gonna last you a long time and it's great quality if you made it to the end of this video thank you so much for watching the entire video if you haven't good riddance thank you for tuning in today and please don't forget to give

you for TV TV in the studio with a very special video for you today I'm super excited about this one we have the best oil pens and 510 threaded batteries of 2020 a lot of your experience will come down to your battery cartridge and oil all working together in harmony but the battery is the thing you have the most control over so choosing one or even multiple batteries that match your needs is the most important thing obviously the better the battery the better your experience will be with your cartridge and oil also because these batteries are relatively inexpensive and you might find yourself with multiple carts it's perfectly OK to own up more than one of them I personally have three that I cycle through if at any point you like this video throw us a thumbs up would you if you're gonna go scrubbing your way through it at least leave us a like before you bounce and if you'd like to pick up any of the batteries I talked about today links will be in the description below without further ado let's get into it sitting in our number one spot this year is the tronie inline of 510 batteries trone ian landed in the market with a splash releasing a handful of batteries all at once the line consists of three batteries the neutron hITRON and tau tron and an oil cartridge called the tron pod they also have a disposable battery which I'll touch on later what I like about Rhoni and batteries is that they've nailed the space between budget-friendly and performance with a device for every consumer their units are versatile and calibrated to work more effectively with a wide range of 510 cartridges and oils the patron is one of the cheapest and smallest offerings of the Tyrolean line along with a distinct pen shape it also has draw activation which works with any draw activated cart so make sure you check the instructions on your cartridge before choosing a battery the Piton battery is built sturdily and can handle any size 510 threaded car it has 350 ml amp hours of power which is impressive for a unit of this size and price point and I absolutely love that there is a USB charger on the bottom of the device it couldn't possibly be any easier to use just screw your cartridge on and inhale the neutron is another incredibly budget-friendly battery and just like the patron comes in at under $15 offering a very similar pen shape the neutron has a one button three voltage settings and a preheat function the on-board voltages are two point six three point three and 4.0 volts giving you a large range to work with that preheat function I touched on before does a great job of warming thicker oils and concentrates it is universally compatible and should be able to power most carts you throw at it five tabs will turn it on two will change between temperatures and three will activate that preheat function it is no larger than a literal pen and can be completely hidden by most hands for some stealth vaping at the top of their lineup is the Tao Tron the Tao John features a magnetic adapter for your carts that you can easily screw on to the base of your 510 threaded cartridge that will allow the cartridge to slip completely inside the housing protecting your car from damage the couch on has been designed to automatically detect the resistance of your cartridge and is calibrated to accept almost any viscosity of oil when fully charged it has a max voltage of 4.2 volts when you draw from the tower on there's a light that illuminates at the bottom of the device to show that power is being supplied to your cartridge the design is just super clean and I love the fact that they have cutouts to show your oil levels which is certainly a feature I prefer for my batteries there's nothing worse than taking a dry head it is draw activated and features a 380 million power battery that charges via USB and even for the top of their line the tower on is extremely budget-friendly I like everything about this device from the size to the power I love how small the tower on is it's shorter than other pens it's smaller than other mods it just works and that's why it's my number one choice I know a lot of your experience is gonna be down to buying prefilled cartridges but for those who like to fill their own cartridge Choa nyan has also released the Tron pod the Tron pods are perfectly calibrated from the tronie in line to offer maximum efficiency they also offer better wicking than most cartridges on the market meaning less time waiting and filling and less dry hits I've also been told some oil producers will be working with Tony and to get these Tron pods filled so keep an eye out for that lastly TRO nyan does offer their disposable vape pen the alphatron the alphatron is the solution for anyone looking for a disposable pen that also has a childproof lock it is designed for one-time use and is geared towards those who prefer to fill up their own cartridges the battery comes pre charged with enough juice to finish the attached Tron pod considering you get an empty cartridge and a battery for the price it's not bad at all the literal only issue I have with it is the spelling alpha with an F come on people as a Greek boy I cannot stand by and watch this travesty happen alpha is spelt with a pH okay droning sitting in our number-two spot this year we have the vessel battery if you are a classy as [ __ ] oh no sir with a need for the top of the top rugged devices look no further than the vessel it is a seriously gorgeous device that comes in a plethora of colors to suit your tastes there are three voltage settings on the vessel 2.8 3.2 and 3.6 bolts there is a notable difference between the voltage settings as well and the vessel can handle any cartridge with aplomb I've been using mine for a while now and I've never put a cartridge in that it could handle if you have a wider diameter cart you will have to forego the shield but it's super easy to take off the vessel is a 240 million power battery that you can get about a hundred rips on before it needs to be recharged it is slightly larger than your average oil pen but it's nothing to write home about as it still fits in any pocket or bag and the included cartridge protector can stave off most dents and scratches and keep your cartridge safe I really like the performance and look of this device it makes me feel super classy as I'm taking ribs in an alleyway on my way to the grocery store the price point is a bit high but if you want a top-of-the-line high performance device the vessel is the battery for you in the number three spot we have the tried and tested and true pocket one plus a great device with a lot of versatility the pocket oneplus has a wide cartridge area and can accept almost any cart you throw at it don't throw your carts at it and then blame me and please just don't do it don't it also works with top and bottom airflow cartridges which is pretty cool the pocket oneplus is another solid device that protects your carts from breaking it also has that magnetic adapter just like the tower on the and it has three temperature settings which is just the icing on the cake it runs up three point seven four point three and five point one volts if anyone cares I use the preheat function quite a bit yes it does have a pretty heat function another thing to love about the pocket oneplus the pocket oneplus has a 660 million hour battery that should last you a number of days even if you're a heavy user ok this is not a challenge don't come back to me and say I hit it 483 times in 30 minutes and the battery died that battery tops up in about 45 minutes which is also pretty great the oneplus is a great size and the button placement is spectacular I'm laughing because I might be the only person that cares about button placement but seriously it's great 5 clicks will turn it on to will change temperature 3 will activate that preheat function it's just simple to use just like the vessel the price point is a touch high but if you're willing to shell out a couple extra bucks you will certainly not be disappointed coming in at number four the C cell battery lineup has two great devices for use with your favorite oil the palm is a great budget-friendly device that is built really well it protects your cartridge and features a 500 million power battery simply screw the magnetic adapter onto your cartridge and slot it into the base the palm fits easily inside your hand great chest and is a great buddy for a night out the silo is the palms slightly bigger brother it keeps most of the same features we loved about the palm like that 500 milliamp hour battery and the fact that it protects your cart the silo fits into any pocket and you won't be worried about any damage to your cart because of that card protection I touched on earlier it also has the little newer slot so you can monitor the level of your oil in the cartridge there is no voltage control to speak up on either C cell device but for the price point I don't see that as a big drawback at all I personally find the silo to have a slightly better form factor and I just like the way it fits in my hand either way C cell batteries are built really well and a solid pick for any user the only thing I would note the narrower cartridge opening means they are not universally compatible but again a minor issue sitting in our number 5 spot the Lynx herm\u00e8s 3 is a solid pen this ultra slim slick device does a good job of pumping out clouds but where it really shines is flavor the ceramic atomizer does a good job of pulling the terpenes out of your oil it has three voltage settings to customize the flavor and the density of your clouds the atomizer doesn't leak and wicks really well this is a solid choice for anyone who sources their own oil and wants a refillable device complete with a tank as the atomizer is really good quality and can handle being refilled multiple times the kit itself comes with the pen the USB charger and the handy carrying case which is really typical of links and just gives you everything you need also typical is their consistency with build quality as the hermes 3 is a well-built device that features a 290 million power battery it's super easy to use five taps will turn it on three will change voltage settings and as long as your buddy Jon knows how to press a button and inhale at the same time you should be okay to pass this around at parties without having to explain to anything I'll leave the choice on whether or not to do so up to you and that's it for this one guys thank you so much for watching this video I hope I helped you even a little bit to choose the battery that will work best with your favorite oil if you enjoyed this video if you learned something please tap to have that like button if you really enjoyed it hit subscribe in that little Bell to stay up to date on all of our latest if you think I've missed anything if you have a differing opinion than me please throw it down in the comments below until next time my name is Alex for TV TV and for all you connoisseurs out there keep baby", "rRqRobaMKf8": "[Music] it's Colorado Kerry coming at you today with a review of our cannabis products with the hub's managing a recreational store we get the chance to try out a lot of really cool new interesting property and today I am going to bring you one of my favorite things ever it is the Indigo Pro advance of vapor system as you can see it's also right over there alright so what I'm gonna do is just basically take out what you get in the Box tell you how much it costs and where you can get it what you get in the box is first as you can see to whatever direction that is to me a sweet sweet case I freaking love this case it is so handy and nice and keeps things all super together I love it I love it the way you get inside is the battery now as you can see here maybe you can see it yeah it says indigo Pro and the purple one of course it also says there's this other little piece there's no need for you to ever take that off so just leave it on there alright so inside the case we've got case the battery pack this is very important the charger pretty easy USB very handy nice and the little Direction ebook the thing here so the user guides pretty self-explanatory it's like a page long so it's not a big deal at all so now what else you need to know this is just the battery so you're gonna have to buy yourself a cartridge now before we get into the cartridge I do want to let you know that you can pick up this battery for about thirty dollars at a dispensary near you these are only sold in the state of Colorado in Washington so yeah you'll have to you have to go there to get one alright so now back to the cartridges the next thing that you're gonna have to do is purchase some of that sweet sweet weed oil this is my favorite one that indica one it is called Knight Rider the flavor is a sugar plum so the cartridges come in other flavors as well there are different types they have sativa and the two flavors for sativa right now are blood orange and apple berry and then the indica flavors are sugar plum and black and blueberry I like both of those flavors but I really like the sugar plum is so delicious oh my god they also have it in hybrid which is a combination of the indica and sativa those flavors are mint and cinnamon and finally they have a CBD two-to-one and they call the flavor harmonium so I'm assuming that it's just terpenes that are flavoring that more on terpenes in a later video otherwise you can check out my blog at the bottom and I did link to a little description of it below there so each one of these little cartridges that you have here they are half a gram of pure cannabis oil now these are also impressively high potency for instance my cartridge that I just have been using recently it comes in at seventy four point six seven percent THC that is crazy high amazing I have seen some like hubs just got one for himself a different brand not this but it came in at like eighty nine percent or something which is just nuts these cartridges the half gram of oil which is what you're gonna need to go along with your battery pack they're gonna run you about $45 no you might think oh my god that cost so much but really they last a long time like a really long time I use them a lot and weren't totally totally great also a quick special note most batteries and cartridges that you purchase at the store they are all interchangeable the Indigo pro is not interchangeable this is like the Mac version of vapor pin so none of the things actually go together within the other products do not let this deter you however I still love it I love it so much okay what makes the Indigo pro extra special okay so first off they're magnetized it's a magnet it sticks to things that are magnets I can't even like it is so cool okay and so I don't know if you can hear it or not oh so we've got this [Music] yeah it's so you know I'm putting it over here because my mic is stupidly on this side I hope you can hear me you guys okay so that's enough of that it's magnetized also sticks to things like your refrigerator it doesn't hold it's not super strong so be aware of that also it vibrates yes I said that but not like I mean you have to be sucking on it for it to vibrate so it's so nice it's like a wonderful little like like fluffy like nice little vibration okay now the reason I really like the vibrating part that is one of the reasons I like it is that it means there's no on/off button if you look it's just the thing that's where it plugs in there but yeah there's nothing it's just literally it goes in you put it in there we suck on it when the battery starts to get low it pulses back at you so if it were becoming low I would suck on it and then it would just move back to let me know that it was close and it would do mm-hmm so twice if it was really close three times this was super close like 10% and then when it finally dies it does it ten times and then just kicks the bucket charging is super fast too so I kind of like it behold no having to turn it on and turn it off makes us so the battery life on these are super good for you know people who might be forgetful so yeah extra plus I'm sure that you've already noticed it's like a weird kind of see it's a cool little shape it feels really nice in your hand I like that it's slightly larger than a pin most of the time I don't even have another one on my desk I'll show you but a lot of times they're exactly the same size as a writing utensil and so it's kind of hard to find it when it's in the bottom of my purse I really like this indigo Pro I've tried out lots of other little batteries and pans and I don't not like any of them this is just seriously yeah it's the best okay well I think that that's that's it if there is a cannabis product that you would be interested in see me do a review of let me know down below in the comments and I'll do my best to come across that and get a hold of it and then I will do a review of it and let you know what I think about it as always thanks for coming by and checking everything out if you like what you've seen here subscribe follow up like do all the things that you do on social medias to support [Music]", "MeVzVvDGnOI": "[Music] hey guys today we're going to take a look at the number one most common problem that you'll have with your vape pen and cartridge and how to quickly fix it so what you want to do to start is unscrew your cartridge from your pen and take a look at the two connectors there sometimes they can become too recessed of whether its packaging or being screwed down too tight and it's really easy to fix to bring it out so you'll want to grab a paper clip and just gently catch underneath the edge of the connector and tug on it very gently to make sure you don't pull it up too hard you can damage the cartridge that way so be careful and once you catch an edge you can work around the entire lip there so that it's in a nice proper position for it to emotion correctly with the battery next we're going to move on to the battery and repeat the same process we're gonna work underneath the connector here and ring it up nice and gently you don't need to apply much pressure again and once you catch that same edge just work around nice and slow so that you don't have an uneven space for the connectors that you're touching [Music] so it should be all ready to go here and we're gonna grab our cartridge and screw it back in the cartridges don't need to be screwed down too tightly for it to work once it's there you should have a green light ready to go all right guys thanks for watching [Music]", "df3VjGHuAD4": "hey guys its definition reviewing the arrow Pro Black Mamba rift fabulous and a searchlight bowling alley and you know look like a darker color oil but it tastes awesome this tastes awesome oops the strength is in the high 80s comes in about eighty nine point four eight four percent excellent strength excellent flavor arrow Pro has definitely become one of my favorites arrow pros available in multiple states you can get it in California Colorado Nevada maybe some other places too this black mama just reaffirms in AeroPro really is really one of the best out there great quality and this seaso gold hardware also helps you'll see our general review on arrow pro and we'll show you that information we'll take it I'll show you what it looks like as soon as you see as you see hit strong it just hits like a strong sea so maybe is a little extra kick to it has a little vibration when the battery is going but this black mom is a great strain and overall I got to say arrow pro is a great setup thanks for watching guys is deaf connection and have a week", "GkYcYx105WA": "hey guys is the app connection checking out the arrow Pro live flower series now just reviewing this stuff and it's awesome arrow Pro always strong what some people might not have liked about arrow pro before is the flavors so here's a skunk number one and this other blue and I forgot my box I don't know where it is but these are both part of the live flower series in the differences flesh flower terpenes full spectrum extraction you for contra or fact basically it's really good it's arrow Pro it's strong but it doesn't have that artificial flavoring that a lot of people don't like an arrow pros I particularly liked the Mountain mist some of the berry ones I wasn't that big a fan of flavor but if it's strong I still like it and some of their I liked all their citrus type flavors were great but if you want the arrow pro strength and you really just want straight flower tasting these are awesome and I got to say these taste great I probably would pick this over a lot of the flavors and I would still get some flavors here and there but for someone that doesn't want any flavors and just I mean this artificial flavors just once like that real flower flavor this is great and this one was a skunk number one Kate and it came in at 86% you know arrow pro is basically C so hard we're in a different package magnetic and hits a little harder and really performed well this other one I lost my packaging but I liked it as well same strength that you expect the narrow cartridges the other thing is you might want to check out our live resin review if you really like live resin more than distill it arrow pros live resident substantially stronger than any of the other live resins I've tried and maybe it's a bit of the hitting system maybe it's the way they make it but I found air opposed live resin to be stronger than raw garden it was stronger than Pinsk it was stronger than remedies it was stronger than I could think of bloom farms those are the live resins I tried recently and it was substantially stronger than all of those so shout out to the live resin but back onto the flower series this is a distill it with better tasting stuff and I gotta say overall really great quality product so let's take a hit of the skunk and they'll take here this other one don't talk a little about the flavor defects all right yeah it just tastes like tastes like weed just straight like weed and even like more so than other carts that have tried to make the weed taste this really tastes almost like you're breathing in like when you open a bag of fresh weed actually smells like when you open a bag of remedy we died I like the taste very similar the heir to one of the flowers that I have theirs let's take a look at the oil too on this one getting towards the end all right that's it the other one now all right this one also just taste straight like flour actually reminds me of one of these those rubber circle pre-rolls that I had he's very similar this let's take a look at that of oil yeah I like these I would say on average I would pick a life a live flower series over a regular flavor AeroPro even though there's some flavors I still like I really like this life are they really got the flavor on this way more like weed even than other cards sort of like tried to get that weed tastes 100% on point AeroPro one of the best brands out there you can get in multiple states thanks for watching guys they had questions or comments about it please post below this definition have a great week", "C6-FVBebXdo": "guys my name is Joey I'm here at discount vape pen and today we gonna be talking about the new cloak [Music] alright guys so like I told you earlier in the video there's a new cloak by Hamilton devices is gonna be a new discreet cartridge battery device I mean the screen I mean very very discreet so inside the package you're gonna have your little note right here it's gonna tell you a little bit about the extractions and how to use this device but after this video you should definitely have a good understanding so we have a small little device that looks like a pod vape and it's basically just posed to act like a pod fate and it'll show you that in a second so right there you don't have a USB port you have your little uh helmets in the device shark right there this is a little design logo top of is gonna be the mouthpiece and then that's it now you're asking yourself how you gonna put the cartridge in easy you gonna slide this right over so it's a two-piece alright guys so like I said this is a two-piece device so there's gonna be the mouthpiece and a little place where the Karcher is gonna go in there's the magnet that holds the top and then right here you don't see this is where the connection is that's your 510 it is the auto auto draw the device because there's no burning so you want to take this cartridge there's gonna screw it right on it's a lot of threads guys now once is on all you got to do is take another piece right there slide it down push and we're done so right here you won't have two different size cartridge you have the point 5 mil in the hole 1 mil this does the fit both size and it fits a magnitude of different size cartridges as well so just like I showed you earlier you won't screw it on stays in place pop the cover over and we're done so this device is a 500 milliamp battery so it does have enough power that'll last you all day without having any issues or run into a charger and the way it works is there's no just ability to it it just goes by the battery power so it's fully charged he's gonna hit at 4.2 volts once the decrease in charge it lowers the power of voltage so like I said guys fully charged which this it does gonna hit at 4.2 volts so all you got to do is press your lips against that little mouthpiece inhale and they'll activate and I'll show you that right there and it hits pretty freakin hard at 4.2 volts definitely recommend this oh guys like I said earlier this device is pretty awesome small and discreet and I've been reading the comments

hey it's mad at roughhouse to use welcome to Canada basics today we're looking at the best Penn batteries for 510 THC or CBD cartridges this episode is sponsored by New York vape shop you can find all the devices use in this video at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with a code rough 2 with a growing trend of THC and CBD oil 510 thread cartridges out there you may find yourself in the dilemma of wondering which is the best kind of vaporizer battery to use for it there's almost as many types of devices as there are cartridges themselves we're gonna look at the stylist type the flat micro a variable voltage a mini compact as well as it box mod vaporizers [Music] first up is the stylist now the stylist is the most simple of all of them it doesn't have a power button does it have any controls or anything like that is air operated and it's just usually a simple stick with a 5-10 thread on one end they are compatible with most types of cartridges and are really really easy to use you just inhale and it automatically works just by inhaling through it the pros of a stylus are is they're simple to operate and usually like I said the most affordable the cons are you have very limited temperature options and usually they're small and they have a small battery capacity next up we have the micro or the flat style and you can see it's flatter it's not round like the other ones and it still has the 510 thread at the top and it fits most different types of cartridges one thing I like about these is that they're usually charging by USB and like I said they are adaptable with many different types of the cartridges pretty much any kind the difference between this and a stylus it does have a power button and many times not always but many times it also has multiple different power settings this is a Z steam cloud micro available at NY vape shop comm and it does have three different settings for temperature the pros are the micro Penzer they're affordably priced usually about 20 bucks for these they usually have micro USB charger rather than the the kind of you plug into the USB adapter they're very compact easy to hide a problem again is that they're usually small and have a small battery capacity next up we're gonna look at the variable voltage pin now much like the other ones this is a style like a pin style vaporizer but the big difference on this is that it has a variable voltage and usually this is at the bottom sometimes it's at the top though but usually at the bottom there's a little dial that you can use to set the voltage at different types and then you could use it for different temperatures different types of cartridges or just to get a different flavor intensity when you use the vaporizer these usually have a power button and rather than having multiple settings it's a variable control at the bottom the pros of these type are is that you can dial in the best voltage for your cartridge that you're using and you can use them with other types of add-ons as well - and usually they have stronger batteries than the other two smaller the cons are is that the height of it leaves the carts vulnerable and they're larger and they're less stealthy and can't really put them in your pocket as easily and this brings us to the compact style pin or them this is the actually of the Steam Cloud Mini 2.0 and these are like a side-by-side the cartridge actually goes down beside the battery they're USB charging usually and you can see that there's a little cut out there where the cartridge will go down into it they do require usually some sort of magnetic adapter that will help you adapt the cartridge and so it'll stick into the device when you stick it in there and they also require or they don't necessarily require but they work better with the cartridges that are a little bit longer and unless they have an adapter that actually extends it which some of them do I really like these kind because they're very pocket friendly the pros are that they're compact and stealthy and that insect connection it protects your cartridge because your cartridges handout in the device cons are it does require a magnetic adapter they're usually included but they're small and easy to lose and it's best suited for the longer cartridges as the small ones might get lost out inside and now we're going to look at the box mod you might consider the Box mod sort of the helicopter uh vaporizer pens it's a little bit more complicated most of the others it has a power button it also usually has a an up-and-down button to control the variable voltage it also has a compatibility with sub ohm tanks so you have a lot of vast compatibility here and you also have a lot of functions on these that you may not ever even need to use with a actual cartridge pin because they work with a lot of other kinds of add-ons and adapters and sub ohm tanks and such like that but they are so very effective for the cartridges they fit most 510 threads just fine and you can lower the voltage down to suit whatever kind of cartridge that you have in the device at the time I really like using the Box mod especially this one this is the steam cloud and it's the steam cloud box mod it's a lot smaller than some of the other ones it's very compact and really easy to use with these cartridges the pros and cons are the sizes 510 cartridges and sub ohm tanks it has most options for the power and resistance and different settings and it usually has the strongest batteries the cons are is that they are bigger and less stealthy although this is a small one and usually they're more expensive than the standard types of vaporizer pins so when it comes down to it it kind of depends on your needs if you really want simplicity and affordability one of the micro or the stylus is probably best for you if you like adaptability then you probably want to go with the variable voltage at the minimum I personally like these compact ones because they protect the actual cartridge itself and they're really really pocket friendly and stealthy and if you're a purist or if you really want to get the most bang for your buck you might want to get with the box mods and use it with lots of different devices if you want to pick up any of the devices that we use today be sure to check out NY vape shop comm use the code rough 2 to get a free gift and

Rafal studios comm hundreds of cannabis videos made just for you this is Matt Roth how stereos thanks for watching [Music]", "Fe3b9S-SibI": "hey guys this afternoon testing out the arrow pro blue dream cartridge came in at 90 percent THC and been hitting this out for a little while I'm gonna say good flavor it's not as flavorful as some of the other arrow Pro cards that I've had but it is very strong the 90 percent each key obviously shows here but TV percentage isn't everything as I would say that I think some of the mountain mists that I've gotten have been a little bit stronger than this one still overall a great quality cartridge and can't complain I mean it's way better than most cards out there but it's not the strongest of the strongest arrow pro but it's still really really good and here is a take a hit of it so AeroPro if you're not familiar with it they use their own type of battery and that battery has a different type of connection so it's an automatic lead magnetic connection there is no threading it fits nice the battery when you hit it AeroPro batteries vibrate while you hit them and how you tell when the battery is dying is as it's degrading dying you'll start vibrating like when it's done hitting then you'll feel another vibration that means the battery's starting to go out there's different ranges different vibrations it does for how much percentages laughs there's three of them and we'll post that in our arrow pro review that information but overall two thumbs up cartridge tastes pretty good and effects are pretty awesome it's a great strength not the absolute strongest arrow Pro cartridge this blue dream but a great card nonetheless and definitely one of the better cartridges out there thanks for watching guys as Dow connection and have a great week [Music]", "cior4pVoKCA": "hi guys I'm Dan HOF chief operating officer of honey stick and today we're gonna give you guys from popular demand a little tutorial on 510 thread stick vape batteries now we've been getting a lot of questions on what the differences are between different types of stick batteries so this quick video is gonna give you guys a nice little tutorial about what the key differences are between stick batteries and a lot of these we actually do sell so the first question is what is 510 thread 510 thread is the actual thread adapter that is used by a majority of vape cartridges these are cartridges they're prefilled with CBD or different medical oils that you can pick up at your dispensary and what companies will do is they will pre-fill these so that you buy just a cartridge and then you go and purchase and attach it to your own battery in order for you to be able to vape so 99% of the cartridges sold in dispensaries and CBD shops use what is called a 5-10 thread which is actually just the threading of the cartridge now not only do prefilled cartridges use this but a lot of just vape products like even slim wax adapters like our silencer they also use a 5-10 thread so they can appeal for the dabbing crowd so once you've figured out what you want to vape then it comes down to picking your battery and what the differences are between your batteries and what i've done is i've narrowed them down to four main types of batteries the first one and one of our most popular ones is the twist style battery so it has a 5-10 thread which will allow you to screw in the cartridge like for example our performance cartridge to screw that into the battery so it has a 5-10 thread adapter there or an end right there it has a push button which means that you have to push hold the button throughout your inhale and because it's a twist battery it has a little twist knob here that allows you to adjust the intensity of your vape and this one goes between 2 volts and 4 volts 4 volts being higher giving you greater intensity now how do you turn this battery on once you have your vape Karcher attached you simply push this button 5 times to turn it on 1 2 3 4 5 and you see it's gonna flash and that means that you are ready to vape once your cartridge is on there now most of these twist batteries ours included does have a preheat function on it for when you're using a cartridge for the first time there's thick materials in there that need to be preheated before you can vape and that's achieved by pushing the button when it's on twice in succession so you push it twice rapidly one two and you see the LED is changing colors there that means there's going through a low voltage preheat to get your cartridge right of vaping at any time during the preheat you can push the button to exit so that is our twist battery it is very simple to use not a lot of clicking adjustable power there nice 510 battery these are a high capacity and they come in several colors I brought along the multicolor in the red and we actually even just launched a brand new carbon fiber version which it uses real carbon fiber so there's a real carbon fiber version right here the other battery is a 5-10 variable voltage non twist battery so you have your 510 adapter here that you can screw your cartridges into or of a products that you buy like for example your prefilled cartridge show you guys we're prefilled one looks like so here's a pretty little prefilled cartridge simply screw it on in there this one is a variable voltage but it's a non twist this is actually a pass-through as you can see a pass-through meaning that the charging port is here at the bottom so you can actually if you're vaping and it's running down or you're one of those people who works at your desk or in your car you can have it plugged into microUSB have the battery on in succession while you're charging the battery which means you don't have to take off the cartridge to screw in a charger so this one does not have a twist function on it this has just a button but you still have variable voltage and preheat the difference is is that you would change the voltage by clicking the buttons and Wogan that so to turn the unit on you click the button five times rapidly one two three four five as you see it blinks right there now it's on if you wanted to go in to preheat as we do it the other battery same thing push the button two times one two and you can see the LED again is going into the color change mode you can exit that at any time to get out of preheat mode and if you want to change the voltage what you do is you push the button three times quickly one two three and what you'll notice is that the LED changes different color now what that signifies there is that now you're on a different voltage level so your power intensity has been adjusted and this battery actually comes with three voltage settings three different intensity levels and you can cycle through them by just clicking the button three times one two three now you see the LED turn blue so blue red and green so that shows your variable voltage nan twist five ten stick battery for your reference the other battery that I've outlined is a 5-10 thread a lot of people refer to this as a stylus because it has a little stylus tip that people used to use for their Palm Pilots and you could use for your cell phones and touchscreen devices but as you will notice this battery is a standard it's a buttonless battery so it doesn't have a button on it so what you do is when you put your cartridge on there you don't have to turn it on or anything like that just make sure it's charged all you have to do is inhale so it's a different action you don't push and hold the button throughout the duration your vape as the other two batteries we showed you you just simply inhale and it will turn it on a couple of things to point out at this battery so a lot of companies do sell batteries like this we don't because for auto draws to fire ceramic cartridges they have to be much more powerful and we offer auto draw models like our elf concealers and elf twist but they provide a lot more power so they can fire ceramic cartridges that have thick heaters this little battery doesn't have much power to fire some of the more modern cartridges the other thing is it to be Auto draw it requires your cartridges to have an air hole at the bottom like this one let's see if we can zoom in to make sure people see that there's an air hole here so this cartridge has an air hole which means that when you inhale it lets the air travel through the cartridge which then reacts with a little sensor microphone in the battery that signals the battery to turn on into vaporize now if we take a look at these two cartridges we'll notice that they don't have air holes so you would technically not be able to use these two cartridges on this Auto draw battery stylus battery when you would be able to vape them just fine with the twist batteries I showed you before or the non twist variable voltage battery that I showed you just before that so that's just a little bit to keep in mind when you're selecting your 5/10 or your perfect 510 third stick battery now the last battery that's pretty popular is this ego style battery now this is a 510 and also stick battery and I see a lot of people carrying these with cartridges that ask however you'll see this is a little bit different than this because look at the the difference this this right here is flattened flush where you screw the cartridge in and this one kind of pokes out and you have this exposed piece that's because there's two different 510 threads is your standard 510 cartridge thread so it's your 510 C thread and this one is your 510 ego thread an ego thread means that there used to be cartridges for a liquid that would screw on to the exterior of this and make an interior connection so you can use it with the older style eliquid tanks as well as with prefilled cartridges well you'll notice is if you're really into just prefilled cartridges is when you screw it into this ego tank it this transition looks a little funky it'll still work and they work good but you'll see that this just doesn't look that nice it looks like I need like a transition piece of metal there like a skirt or something like that and you know this is a fatter battery so as you could see the widths don't exactly line up like other tanks like this you'll see it's a much smoother transition it looks like they're all one piece versus like this now there's lots of ego batteries on the market there's ones that have twist knobs there's ones that are longer the thing is that you can these are about 500 milliamp hour batteries for so that's a pretty good decent capacity for a battery these ones are usually between 350 and 650 they're this size you can get longer ones or all the way up to 1200 or 1100 milliamp hours so you can get ultra high-capacity powerful fat ego batteries like this but one of the trade-offs is if you do use a lot of cartridges they're not gonna line up they're not gonna look a hundred percent with these stick batteries they line up so you can use all different types of heating materials like ceramic cartridges standard a stainless steel or organic cotton coil cartridges you can use high performance ceramic like our performance tank you can even use wax tanks like our silencer with these little 510 thread batteries so we hope that today's video was useful in showing you guys the differences between the different 510 thread battery types and we familiarize you with some of the pros and cons are of each one so when you are on the market trying to pick up a 5-10 thread stick battery you can see some of these differences and figure out which 510 thread stick battery works perfect for you for lots of cool products that you've seen here today you can check out our website

I couldn't take them to work and then when I came back from work I would always have leaky batteries leaky cartridges and that was really before I looked into proper maintenance of my oil cartridges so today I wanted to share a few tips I've learned along the way that I'll help you get the most out of your oil cartridge oil cartridges are great great for my producing they preserve your contents for a lot longer like most devices it's the small things that go a long way save you time save you money frustration but you don't want to take advantage of this by refilling new oils in the same oil cartridge do not fill your cartridge more than twice why is this bad to do well if you keep refilling the same cartridge over and over again it can cause leaking clogging lots of paper production thick oils will begin to harden on the wick and you won't be able to vape new oils properly stuck in an endless loop pulsing for good drawls and there's a special circular inhale for things like that especially you'll burn the cotton and the oils and once that happens even the best tasting oils they won't be able to mask it I like to think of it like oil in a car you wouldn't want to change your oil too often without changing your filter and the cotton inside of your atomizer is like the filter in your car you can go and get new oil but without changing the filter you never really have clean oil don't do what I did and leave your cartridges inside of your car or any hot place for that matter I know it might be convenient but for most you out there a good rule of thumb is heat bad cold good high temperatures can not only degrade the oil taste and potency but it can cause leaking the best places to store your oil vapes are cool dry dark places like a desk drawer or a refrigerator put the rubber plug back onto the bottom of the cartridge and start it ideally in a dark place around 70 degrees Fahrenheit or less but don't go too far to the extreme to the other side when stored in the freezer because that can create moisture inside of the cartridge so avoid heat and avoid freezers but now when you take your cartridge out of the fridge the oils gonna be thick and all thick oils need to be primed first priming your new oil cartridge is going to make the difference between the first hit being smooth and magical or dry and burn the nasty teetsi oil is thick so you need to give it some time to soak into the atomizer here's how to do it make sure your oils are at room temperature if they're fresh out of the fridge pull the cartridge in between your palms for about two to three minutes to warm it up if you're loading an empty cartridge only fill it with a small amount so if you run into problems you don't waste all your oil take about five polls on the cartridge without the battery being attached what you're doing is simulating vaping and pulling a little oil from the atomizer then attach the cartridge to the battery and give it a try I recommend pulsing the battery here it's the best way to ensure that you're not burning your oils if it's still too cold go back and warm it up and then try it again so there you have it guys those are the main ways to get the most out of your oil cartridge dont refill it more than twice always prime your new coils and always keep them in a cool dark place to prevent it from leaking on you keep in mind that not all cartridges have wigs some only come with ceramic or glass cores it's your responsibility to know what you're buying it's always smart to clean the bottom of the cartridge before storing it with cotton swabs or alcohol wipes that way when you take the rubber cap back off you can see if it's leaked hopefully these tips helped you guys where do you personally store your cartridges if you have any other

cannabis delivered to me as also as well as I meant to say as well as buying it in store from nice people I'm not gonna give out names yet cuz I'm not them but they're good when I was there I was filling out that paperwork and I realized that people are allowed in Maryland to smoke inside of house or vaporize they are not allowed to smoke inside of houses that are owned by landlords but they're allowed to vaporize inside of houses that are owned by landlords so for those of you who are renters it's okay to vaporize and if you knew that awesome if you didn't know that now you know if you forgot it you remembered so this is the arrow Pro used to be called the Indigo Pro comes in this fancy case here it's sleek matte black it's got the arrow pro writing and logo writing on there with the little leaf that is the sprout of a cannabis flower plant and as you see it's very nice I'll show you two products that I use by them and I'll show you the battery itself and then we'll flip this camera around and get into the goods piece okay so this is kind of what a kit looks like it comes in cartridges which are distillates you can get indica which is the one that makes you more tired and lethargic you can get hybrid which is in the middle or sativa which is more uplifting and it's a distillate which is refined kind of thing for instance the distillate cartridge of Sumatran sunrise has a THC content of 80.5% or 400 two point five milligrams and those are the cbn content CBG CBC THC CBD and Delta eight THC percentages here's the hybrid sunset sherbert or one of them uh THC is 83.4% or 417 milligrams there's the percentages as well as milligram contents for the rest says it's a pure distillate oil full terpene profile and high potency and I got this at Zen leaf in Jessup and I got this one at remedy in Colombia it says it's a new name but same great product on both of these so it used to be called indigo Pro now it's arrow pro I like this one for the beta carry awfully level of 2.5 to the Delta limonene percentages of 1.48 and then I really like this one for the Delta limonene of 3 point 5 3 and the alpha-pinene of 4 point 0 9 so those are what the cartridges looks like they come in half half grams usually but here we'll get into this kit uh so again there's the logo it opens up I got my pushing cat in here from when I got a backpack anyways sorry about that burp here's a charging cable it comes with it you can charge it with your laptop PC charging block whatever you got car I wouldn't recommend smoking it on the go though but if you're in between the dispensary and going home and you want to charge it you could do that Eero vapor comm arrow pro users guide advanced vapor system tells you about charging it with the microUSB shows you the mouthpiece for the five point five milliliter cartridge the sleeve the device body the halo ring and the USB cord gives you warning labels about the arrow pro not to be used with other devices so this is a single kind of care kit so if you want to vape other distillate cartridges like a rhythm or a MPX or anything made by Gigli for verano it wouldn't be synonymous with it and we want to work with it tells you how to use it one pulse for that kind of stuff tells you about the pulses and halo flashes four batteries expiring or being working care and safety troubleshooting specifications 32 milliamp hours power output 8.5 watts charging current three hundred milli amp 1.5 watts length 97 millimeter with sleeve install diameter 14 millimeter weight 27 grams environmental and responsibility era pros committed to seeking out the best practices for the creation of our products to ensure the impact of the world it is a positive as if the impact our products have on the customers I'm sure I read that mistakenly anyways mine is a purple vaporizer battery this is what the cartridges look like in here this is magnetic so this will just open up and slide back in there without even having to push it in but you've seen the cartridges that's what they look like this one's just about gone this was the first one that I got with it and I really liked the alpha panning and limonene levels for my mild asthma and bronchodilation and breathing as well as the properties for limonene but I'm gonna flip this around and then we'll do a review of the Sumatran sunrise one more time because this video on YouTube got a lot of views so I'm doing another in-depth review with a hybrid as well as another Sumatran sunrise cartridge piece all right so I'm gonna do a review of this product now it kind of rumbles when you hit it it kind of vibrates and rumbles when you take an inhale so you know that you're getting some vapor production and it if it still haven't figured out exactly how the pulse thing works for telling you the battery percentages either being at a like thirty twenty or ten percent but I understand the halo ring flashing if I see any lights on this I know it's expired and basically I'm just gonna charge it in between so I'll do an inhale and show you the cloud production so so it's very good cloud production this particular strain the Sumatran sunrise which is a sativa tastes very piney because it has alpha pining at a level of about four percent three point eight to four percent and the limonene so it's like a Lyman but it's more piney in flavor aroma I don't know what it smells like in the air because I've got a fan blowing and I'm in a very open area in a basement of my parents abode so it's not really staying in one spot so I'm gonna like inhaling it or breathing it in with my nostrils to smell it it's just kind of moving and circulating throughout the air but I imagine it would smell like a pine needle or something piney I actually wanted to medicate that time instead of just showing you how much I could exhale where you still got the same effect it's good huh but if you actually inhale it and don't just blow it out um yeah so another thing that's great about this is if you buy multiple cartridges you can fit them there so you can take this cartridge out for instance and say put it right here and then you've got your battery which comes with this weird glass or plastic thing that slides in there to stop it from doing that I guess you want to do that when you're charging it so I know dust or particles get into the battery and it'll be charging without any gum getting in there or if you want to just carry it in your pocket you don't have any cartridge at the moment you know you can walk around with this anywhere you can even go through customs in an international airport they're probably not gonna hold you up it'll just be like what the hell is this and you can tell them it's a vape cartridge or a battery or something as long as there's no cannabis in there it should be okay that's what I think at least but anyways I'm not talking about that cuz I don't travel internationally that much it's been years but um yeah this is a good arrow Pro indigo Pro previously I don't recommend smoking it in public but I would recommend smoking it in your landlords house if you rent or your house that you live at or you know what you got so those were the two kits that I got today I mean the two cartridges carts those are the two carts that I got today for those of you who don't know what a cart is it's basically just a shorter version of cartridge and they're distillate cartridges which I will read you the information about if I had that card which I don't actively so I'm gonna do that later maybe I've done it in other videos anyways it's basically just pure distillate oil they use a very fine distillate process with I think some kind of alcohol or solvent or something instead of heat or pressure and so that would be the AeroPro distillate cartridges with the battery I got mine as a kit for $60 with the cartridge I think they're selling the batteries and the cartridges independently now so that's what they are peace out dude I like mine I still use it I found the terpene values to be greater than some of the butters or live resins even or regular shatters or crumbles or flowers obviously so that's what I would recommend to some cancer patients or people who have diabetes or just one of them Medicaid therapeutically for any of their other ailments and want to get a specific terpene at a higher percentage I'm sure they'd have a strain forward and I'm sure they'd have a cartridge for it if you want to get just that terpene percentage just go ask your local dispensary people to look at all of them they might not know the person individually because it's kind of a newer product what the percentages or milligram content levels are so just ask to look at all of them if they have time if it's not busy go on a day at a time when it won't be busy so you can learn a little bit about the product and see if you actually want to get it know where you're going in for and see what kind of terpenes you need and then look for what goes with that that's kind of what I did but anyways I'm gonna stop rambling and just say it's good I like it I still use it today I've had it for a couple weeks now and that was one of my liked videos one of my more viewed videos I didn't get any likes but I got a lot of views for it so I wanted to just come back and say I still like it and I still use it and I bought another cartridge or two today so anyways peace", "l8xBPlIt0rg": "[Music] you", "EB3zNluGzhM": "hello senior stoner fans us the real senior starter back at you for the newest in my innovation products what I've decided to do is try to upgrade some of the things I have to make them more pleasant make them more aesthetically present Pleasant and make them more powerful first there's gonna be a new battery this is the vessel by vessel and the vessel has performance air intake a smart battery LED indicator three battery settings 2.8 three point two and three point six volts a 240 mAh battery and a magnetic charging port but what it really has I thought and I really am satisfied with was the visual appeal and the handling of a true German writing piece you're gonna be walking around with this now thinking that you've got a pen in your pocket not a vape pen but a pen this is real wall nut on the bottom and the cartridge has real walnut on top it does not come with a cartridge that's filled it comes with a dummy cartridge and I bought this empty cartridge and filled it myself this is tangerine dream THC distill it in here and it's a 5 button system for easy on off so you click one two three four five and now it's going to turn off and I'll click one two three four five again ready one two three four five and it will come on and right now I have it in the middle setting of temperature let's see this is vape pen I'm not usually a cartridge person but when I filled them my selves I've been very satisfied in the past Cheers instant hit not like a prefilled cartridge boy stronger I'm onto something here this is nice I mean this really is a pretty device and it has a very nice magnetic charger so what happens is the charger fits on to the bottom and into a USB so I would say this is the perfect high quality battery pen device for senior citizens this is simple to use this is a button click hold on device just push the button down and it's pre it's refillable which means you can up the ante that's what I mean by that sometimes you can only get 70% 67 percent THC in the prefilled cartridges you know the companies that make them I juice mine with another brand with my syringes I fill it myself of the THC distill it and I get it up to 99% 97 to 99 percent so hopefully you'll take a look at this again I'm very impressed with it now hands on substantial device called the vessel substantial device let's get one more hit and I'm coughing before remember I haven't caught on this yet you can control it yourself that's the really good thing about this it's got the variable control but it feels like you're holding a month long pen hats off the company vessel double thumbs up from seniors donor I like it a lot the vessel is a welcome

follow my Twitter's you know I go on likes like once a week or maybe even [ __ ] zero times a week or might need three times a week cuz thank you guys appreciate every one of you guys and yeah thumbs up this video cuz yeah", "Jd1MxfFfJO4": "[Music] [Applause] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is a battery video not a battery like review video but more like a video discussing a very important topic when it comes to cartridges and batteries and it is do batteries really matter when it comes to cartridges like should you get the branded cartridge battery along with the branded cartridge you know a lot of companies obviously they're gonna have their own branded you know battery so it can match their cartridge it makes it all look nice and pristine and match and all that good stuff but does it really matter you know most companies I'm not gonna name any because most of them do it they just buy from like China like a source and then they imprint their own branding on the battery itself most of them are very generic batteries at one point everyone was using that button list little like pencil one with the stylus at the end now they can switched on to like a more box [ __ ] or they have a cylinder [ __ ] but I just want to explain like does it really matter and also proprietary batteries a lot of people are getting mixed up about what a proprietary battery is there's two different types of batteries when it comes to you know cartridges and stuff at least in my opinion I think there's Universal batteries which are 510 threading most of the time and then there are proprietary batteries which are batteries that you would have to buy to use with that specific pod cartridge thingamajig you know I'm saying so give me some examples right I got four batteries one with actually a raw card and share that's wrong aren't you know I'm saying raw garden cartridge on it but we're gonna explain the batteries here so we're gonna start off with a regular 510 battery but I would say that this is like a hybrid proprietary battery because you do need adapter which you know not a lot of people have this is not one it doesn't you've been here I've somehow misplaced is so but if you do have them in a magnetic piece you can actually use it on other like cartridges you don't have to use it on the arrow arrow Pro pen cartridge but it does look nice with it has the micro USB and actually vibrates when you hit it that way you don't really need to look at the light indicator to see if you're actually hitting it which is pretty cool you know and then we got I would say a proprietary battery yes you know saying we got the plug-and-play you know only thing that works with this battery are plug and play cards right unless you can find something else I do know that the plug employee I think they copied the design of vape pen cartridge no I'm saying I forgot what it was but yes be fire or some [ __ ] like that something weird okay and then we got a universal battery you know I'm saying this is the - babe I will post the link in the bottom description below nice little but this is a 510 threading battery you can see it's the non mehnat non-magnetic one right here so you just screw it on I feel like a lot of batteries are switching on to the magnetic way because this tends to like [ __ ] up your your cartridge I wouldn't say all the time but at one point like I would have left the cartridge on this and then not on this but like another twist on thing and then oil actually seek down and it actually stuck to each other so you got to avoid that but I haven't had problems with this dads vape very very nice stuff and if you could even put the cartridge let me just show you how how Universal just really is so just yeah I wanna be on the lookout for another dad's big battery review I just got one in white gonna be doing it pretty soon within the next few days but so you're here preheating as well so it's good to buy these Universal batteries you know another thing about voltage settings like most companies have their set specific voltage setting and I think some companies even hardwire their batteries to work better with their [ __ ] which I could see you know some companies doing and I feel it you know why not have a battery that works specifically for your oil even if it's like a 510 threading Universal battery but generally doesn't really matter just start with the lowest voltage you know the lowest you can get minus 2.8 where's the battery has to is the lowest so you know everyone's just gonna have different things boys so yeah 510 threading all that good stuff very very good stuff oh I didn't show you this so you could actually hit it like this too maybe even much more discreet I'm saying like all batteries are gonna have different functionalities you know then it's just gonna be on what you prefer so let me just like this so this is actually like a universal third-party battery like Danis weight makes batteries for cartridges they don't make their own cartridges or fill them up or anything just like the pocket all these other batteries that you can buy that actually are just batteries made for cartridges you know if you want to invest in something if you see yourself as a cartridge guy you know I would definitely recommend buying like a third party battery you know cuz they just work a lot better than these company ones they have a lot more features and yeah unless you're getting pods and stuff then you're gonna have to settle for you know this or its dizzy battery you know but when it comes to cartridges which you know is the main Universal way of you know pods aren't really like as popular as cartridges note saying just because there's not too much on the market you know there's only a 1/8 a select few that you could probably name in one hand so with that I'm going to take another hit but this time though I didn't explain this but this battery so if you guys have been seeing this lately on my channel I've been using this the most but this is the chill battery and this was made for a distillate pen a few months back I did a video on it the cartridge actually came with this battery and it worked great with it you know I'm saying but it also works great with this wall garden and the point of this video is like you don't really need to spend $15 for a battery it's but like when it's when it's like a 5/10 rate obviously but if you plot a slugging play you're gonna have to buy this that's what I'm saying but you don't have to spend $15 extra if you have one of these batteries laying around start with the lowest setting and work your way up because that's how you should do it you know with that I'm gonna take another hit and we're probably gonna end the video here I'm gonna drink some of this milk well quick yeah I know it's the morning I don't I switched up from tea and milk maybe some milk tea in the future who knows no exam let's cheers guys who so there you have it guys that is going to be it for this video hopefully you guys enjoyed it let me know in the comments do you care about batteries that much or do you just pick up the battery that's closest to you and use it with a cartridge just like that you know because at the end of the day most of these mother [ __ ] aren't universal you know except the pods so most of them should work unless they have some like weird like you know physical like blocking [ __ ] on there you know then yeah it won't work like this you know you can't really put a cartridge in there without this but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video [Music] [Music]", "zGYZkyvEDkI": "hello everybody cheapest vape supplies dot-com here doing a product review on the double concentrate and cartridge bubbler this is one cool product we looked high and low and couldn't find anything comparable on the market to this device very unique so underneath the box here we have a card that this comes with and then we have a little instruction manual and then we have the main contents so this thing it looks a lot bigger in real life than it does on the box itself seems huge it's like the size of your whole hand it's got a gasket here at the top it's got a glass tube here okay right behind it and what you do is you just pull this glass tube out of here you see this little little bubbler here it goes all the way down you want you see this ring here you want to seat that ring right to where that silicone is eventually you're gonna fill this up with water here when you're ready to use it right now we'll just go ahead and attach it in here just squeeze it down push it down gently till it clicks there you go and right there now you're ready to go now here we go the magic is right here pull this off here and you have to cartridge 510 thread female receptacles so here we go we have a 1 mil seesaw style cartridge alright the black ceramic tip and then we have a white one Mel C cell style cartridge began with a ceramic tip so once these are screwed in obviously if you know you're gonna use the liquid in there you're not gonna do this empty so there you have it and then you just simply put this right back on top here and you're good to go now you have two cartridges going at the same time you can basically blend two different styles and create your own hybrids this button here is your power button two times re I'm sorry three times to change the voltage five times to turn it on and off and hold it down you know indefinitely for as long as you want

Matt from Rafal studios and welcome to the placing gear review of the prism cartridge paper Iser I would like to thank the guys at Belle X for setting up and sponsoring this review if you'd like to learn more about this product or there are other products please visit Belle X techcom now let's get started here's what comes in the box you get the tiny little Velux prism vaporizer itself charging cord you also hit two different size cartridges as well as instruction manuals and the little magnetic connectors now let's take a closer look at the really cool little prism vaporizer I really like the shape and design the angular shape is really cool of tiny size and you see it has a micro USB charging port there and then there's one single button that's sort of molded into the side of the device there on the side really cool looking nice and boast of logo Velux there on the bottom and the bottom of the device is smooth there's no way to get into it or open it on the side of it there is the little port and the top has the fitting where you drop in your cartridges you can see it slides in there and that little port on the side lets you see the level of the oil inside of your cartridge and the cartridges that come with it are two sizes of a milliliter and a half milliliter and then you also have the little screw on adapters that will magnetize the cartridge and let you fit it into the cartridge holder and fit in place all right now we're going to take a look at the functions of features first we're going to charge it up I have one that's already charged up when it's fully charged it shows green light there and then when it's charging the light is red and it'll pulse to let you know that it's charging and then it's solid green once it's fully charged all right we've got one charged up and ready to go like most vaporizers you turn it on with five clicks cool little green light comes on just to let you know that it powered on and then you cycle through the three different temperature settings with three clicks each and come notice that the lights are very similar in color so sometimes it's kind of hard to tell which color you're working on but it's blue and light blue and a purple you see whenever you put a cartridge in there it lights up a couple of times to let you know that the cartridge is connected and then when you're connected you'll be able to actually hold down the button to get a hit off of it you press it twice and it has this cool little preheat mode and it'll just preheat the coils a little bit in there so that you don't get that little bubbling sound or whatever when you first hit it and then another really cool feature if you click it four times it'll go to this mode that is a tank heating mode and for a minute it puts really really low temperature on your tank so it'll melt those thick oils that might have run down into the coils before you use it really cool features there on the dual heating modes and then you cut it off with five clicks now we're going to jump into the usage and testing my favorite part and always like to make my own ejuice out of rosin and use a wax liquidiser or something like that to make it myself so I know what I'm getting so I've made us a mini Jesus and filled up two cartridges here these cartridges are really cool they're ceramic on the inside they have an innovative honeycomb shape there on the inside I've been around the coil and I'm really interested in checking that out and seeing how it works they're really good high quality feeling cartridges with the ceramic kits on them I like that so got one filled up here and we're gonna test it out and I mean I tell you what this thing gets one of the biggest hits off of any of these type of vaporizers I've tried in a while I'm gonna chop that up to those really cool coils great taste and man I'm telling you Big O Big O puffs and unlike a lot of vaporizers it the puffs continue up even after multiple sessions it's still getting big hits so I like that let's get to the results in scoring the pros are it's beautiful and stuff the design I love the shape because there's two excellent 510 tanks that are provided designs those tanks are designed for thicker oils if I teach the oils great those dual preheat modes are neat and it has those three temperature settings the cons are the battery is a little light with only 500 milliamps understandable for small vaporizer but it's also really hard to see the difference in colors of the LED lights for that reason alone I'm taking off a half a star but four and a half stars awesome little vaporizer from Belle X again I'd like to thank those guys for sending it out and for sponsoring this review check them out that Val X tech comm and you can

milliamp battery [Music] so guys there's the card ascent 280 small slim little battery I'm talking about definitely the same size as a cartridge actually some cartridge actually over hang from it it's not small and tiny it is definitely easily impossible you notice there is no button these are automatic draw there is no adjustment it only hits at 3.7 volts and anytime you take an inhale these lights will light up these little holes right here those actually the LED lights this device is quite compact and it's 280 million battery like I said 3.7 volts and here's the charger for it which is better than the old classes with a wire use this one that actually is built tough so guys that's the car saying 280 unless you use all the red lights there was a small device definitely for good put in a pocket in a purse anywhere super discreet so where can you get it this kind of a pen calm remember order before 3 o'clock same day free shipping on Eastern Standard Time please [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "q3KEeMaCL1A": "what's going on guys angel from discount vaping today we're gonna check out what we think is the best device for our cartridge we're going to dive down up and close we're going to give you a detailed look at all of them and I'm going to tell you what we think [Music] alright guys we're up close and personal now with mysticus we're gonna go over them we're gonna show you in depth what the features are on them and we're gonna pretty much show you why they're the best unit to have so this is a standard Mystica very very sleek design very small cartridge sits inside with these so basically you have a magnet on the bottom I'll show you this here this is your magnet this pretty much will screw on to any 510 cartridge so if you have your own it's not you're not limited to this cartridge and it does come with basically screw that on and now your cartridge is ready to go with some cartridges you're gonna have to adjust the magnet just to make some sometimes you will have to adjust the magnet that 510 pin won't be in the right spot which is not a big deal you just adjust and then you drop your cartridge in and it'll make it to connection just fine he have your button here this is your regular button just five clicks he'll turn it on five clicks will turn it off just like any other beep and then obviously you're gonna have to hold it down to inhale and when you're done you let go does have a USB charger the USB charger is included plugs in right here it's just a micro USB so if you lose it very easy to replace in the kit you'll get the device itself the empty cartridge and you'll get two magnets [Music] it is a concealed unit so most of the cartridge is inside of the unit itself you're not gonna have to worry about snapping the cartridge off like if it was on a pen that's the regular Mystica next on the list we have the Mystica menu very similar to the Mystica as you can see there's no button on this one so this is a vacuum activated or as they like to call it the auto battery all that means is when you go to inhale it will actuate the battery it'll start to fire and when you stop inhaling the battery or stop fire no on and off on this one which is nice because if you do put this in your pocket you're not gonna have to worry about hitting the button it's not gonna fire on its own you do have to actually inhale for this to fire this is another option charge port on the bottom same thing microUSB comes with the kit that's the mystic a minute the last Mystica which is the one we prefer at all of them is the mystic a variable voltage this is gonna be the best just because you're gonna be able to adjust with any cartridge you have looks like the regular Mystica you have your button up top your charge port here your USB charge port now doing different repetitions of the button for example five clicks to turn it off five bucks to turn it off you do two clicks it'll adjust the voltage you do another two it'll adjust it again the light inside will change colors to let you know what voltage wrong some cartridges require a hotter burn which is why you would want to adjust it some of them require less of a birth so with this you're gonna pretty much be able to use any cartridge the only thing that will limit you with any Mystica is gonna be the thickness of your cartridge most of the standard 510 cartridges will fit there is only a few maybe maybe four or three cartridges that we've ever seen that won't fit because of how thick they are but at most of the 510s they'll fit in here no problem this is a thicker one as you could see compared to this one it's a tad bit thicker and it fits in no problem it just sits in there so that's the only thing that'll limit you but with the variable voltage you're gonna be able to adjust like I said if you have you know cartridge that requires a little bit more you just click it set it a little bit higher and it'll work just fine that's our open/close of all the mysticus all right guys so we dug down we showed you what we think about dom\u00e9stica showing you all three options of them pretty much this is gonna be the best unit you can have it's concealed it's small you can adjust the wattage if you go with that option if you don't like that you get a regular option with a button works just fine if you don't want that you can get the auto battery you just have to pull on it very simple to use and the Chargers is also probably our favorite part because you micro USBs are everywhere you can find them anywhere if you like what you saw in the video

before use to do so screw the USB attachment to the vape pen battery and plug it into a USB wall outlet after it's charged unscrew the USB portion from the pen [Music] remove the rubber stopper on the bottom of your vape cartridge and screw tightly into the vaporizing pen press your lips against the mouthpiece and begin vaporizing by taking one three second draw repeat as many times is recommended by your physician", "55VlDEspgkk": "what is up can FM and welcome back to another product review video just for you guys so check it out for this video it's not necessarily a weed product a cannabis product per se but it is definitely something that aids you in getting high what I'm talking about what we're going to be reviewing today is the silo here this is the silo and this is by sea sample okay this is a vape battery so you guys might have seen the other one of this that is a little bit wider it fits a little bit better in your palm kind of it's a little wider though and you kind of put it in there with a magnet and just hit it this is like the say the brother the older brother this is the silo battery for your bait cartridges okay guys now let's get into this and I'll just have to open this back up here in just a minute but this is it this is the battery it's very easy to fit as you guys can see in your hand you can palm that [ __ ] right there if you know what I mean so it fits very easy it's nice sleek I believe this is full on titanium all the way through which is very nice I mean especially vers those plastic ones because it this looks like it can take a drop okay so if I accidentally like oh [ __ ] you know drop it it looks like it's it's still gonna be functional it's not gonna break it looks pretty sturdy okay now it's got a normal charger there on the bottom with the normal USB and I believe that it does come with a charger so you open it up you're pulled ahead out we don't need that and then yeah so there's your charger right there get one and then there's the little magnets that gotta go on the bottom of your vape cartridge which I'll show you here in just a second so there's the box really cool box that's cool now this silo runs about thirty dollars retail okay so if you are trying to pick this up you can probably pick it up anywhere between 25 to say 35 dollars I picked this one up for 30 I've seen some places do it 35 and I've seen just very few like maybe one or two places do it at 25 so just all depends on where you go to get it okay now what I need to do I'm going to put this over here now what oh I almost dropped it that could have been a test I will drop it anyway so what I need to do here is as I get my cartridge here I have some starfighter cookies one gram distillate cartridge by buddy's big shout-out to buddies and it again normal 510 thread on the cartridge is a normal standard cartridge nothing fancy on the cartridge and these pop out just like you know like some [ __ ] Tylenol or some [ __ ] you know all right [Music] there we go now what you're going to do is you're going to screw this on the bottom of your vape cartridge just licked out fits there just like that screws on very easy super easy and then this it should be ready to go now what you're gonna do is just sit it down there now there's a magnet you guys see that I'm pulling on it there you go sits down in there now it shows you right through that little window that it's all in there everything should be functional now there's no button on this all you need to do is just wrong now I'm unsure I believe it's got like a 10 to 12 second draw on it don't quote me on that but I believe that's what the plaid tender said when I bought this so here we go we're trying out the silo let's get much love guys [Music] okay that was just like a pre hit hit you know what I mean that was just to make sure that this was working all right now here's the real hit pretty good pretty good I mean wow just like a normal battery but a lot easier to handle a lot easier like no bad or no button that's that's super awesome I know there's the other ones that have no button but the way this fits in your hand the way it's kind of just compact easy to slip in and out of your pocket looking when it does don't come at you you know like that is all awesome the fact it's titanium that's legit we're gonna do a palm here okay so I'm sure just out with the palm way here we go so just full of palm in this [ __ ] [Music] that's pretty good I like this I really do all right now it does come with two of these little coil things that go around the bottom of your vape cartridge okay these little metal screw deal things that go on the bottom now you get two of them which I guess that might you could say that that might be a setback about this product is that you only get two of them so if you're really high let's say your cartridges you've hit the last little bit out of your cartridge you're super high maybe you took some dabs maybe you smoked a blonde hit your cartridge you know what I mean pretty high throw it away like I don't need it anymore I could see that being maybe an issue forgetting about that we does make people forget sometimes so there is that so that'd probably be the only drawback I could see with this product I mean just keeping it a hundred percent real just keeping it honest you got to do the good plus the bad about every product it's not all sunshine and rainbows all the time but besides that I like that I like everything about this I like that you can do two because let's say you have like a indica cartridge let's say you have a sativa cartridge let's say during the day you like your steve-o's at nighttime when you're about to good bad indica this allows you to kind of switch up very easily without having to unscrew it screw back in and unscrew it screw back in on that you can just switch between the two cartridges it's really cool um if you go buy another battery so if you got somebody else that you know you're living with and you grab another battery that's even more so just saying and overall I like this I like this I believe they do come in different colors so if you're asking they I don't want blue but I do I think they do have different colors I think they got black gold and pink and again don't go down all those colors I believe that's what I remember seeing at the shop is those colors I know they have a pink but yeah overall I really like this again this is about a $30.00 battery and it keeps uh hold on let me where does our [ __ ] let's see how long the charges it's a silo battery it's got a warranty card on it which is really cool designed in California 500 mah okay okay so there's your warranty card on it keep that just in case it breaks because I tell you what want to keep this stuff even if you don't keep the box you want to keep this stuff just store it somewhere very easy to find because if there's an issue with this you need this to have them fix it or send you a new one okay so just throwing that out there [Music] okay now I'm just trying to find out if it'll tell me the exact how long the battery lasts because I feel like that's important information when your battery shopping you know how long your battery lasts right and it unfortunately doesn't tell me anywhere it doesn't say anywhere how long the damn battery lasts well then maybe okay so here's the colors black gray blue pink I was right I wait no I said gold not great so I switch those to gray not gold but I got all the other ones right so hot and yeah it just does not tell me it's just a silo battery that's all it says it doesn't tell me how long what the hour is on this how long is it going to last is it gonna last six hours eight hours is the whole day is it only gonna last a couple hours what I dunno I just pulled it out of the box so I do know it's probably not fully charged but another way I wish I had that information for you guys if I find out I will make sure to post that information in the comment section below on this video so you guys have that information because I feel like that's very important when you're doing a battery search when you're going to find and purchase a new battery you should know how long the battery's gonna last alright also to kind of add oh this does not have a temperature fluctuate or you cannot you know change the temps on this this is no way to change the tenon the temp is whatever that the battery is set at and again it does not tell me that information either anywhere in this so there is a little bit of a drawback to this product like I said before it's not all sunshine and rainbows but overall I still still stand by this product very easy to use very sleek sexy easy to Palm in your hand easy to hold easy to fit your pocket easy to pull out you know there's no button so if it's in your pocket it you know you don't have the chance of you know maybe your pockets rubbing up on it and holding your button down and starting to burn your smoke you know all that kind of stuff so that's really cool it's very easy draw it's like a 1012 second draw here let's max that out actually [Music] Wow actually think it's longer than that that's like a 15-second draw or some [ __ ] anyway so it's got a good draw to it overall I [ __ ] with the silo okay I [ __ ] with it okay all right so this has been the review and my honest opinion on the silo vape pen battery by C cell and this thing is pretty good i [ __ ] with it i [ __ ] with the heavy alright so check it out let me know your thoughts and opinions if you have this if your tried it maybe a friend has this whatever let me know your thoughts and opinions on this product right here in the comment section below and also please give this video a big thumbs up

__ ] thank you a dumb [ __ ] go hey we salad clouds around", "HPGUJh76XkY": "today's video we'll be going over the yokan uni s [Music] what's going on guys it's jimmy the camera guy here at discount bay pin and today we're going over the yokan uni s which is the newest addition to the yocan oni family so we'll go ahead and crack the box open here we have your instruction manual as well as a verification card and in the device here we have your usb c charger not your micro usb anymore now it's a type c and we also have your magnet right up there and we have the yokan oni s which is the newest little brother as you remember that's the original yokan uni and here is the yokan oni pro i know you guys remember these and if you don't go ahead and get yourself familiar with them and check out the discount vape in videos on the uni pro and the yocan oni but it's not about these guys it's about this little guy right here this is a 400 mah battery so it'll last you a good amount of time depending on how often you uh use your cartridge there it does come with variable voltage as well as preheat five clicks on one two three four five and i just turned it off one two three four five on here down here you'll see your battery indicator light as well as your voltage setting lights to change the voltage simply press the button three times one two three that's your lowest voltage setting there one two three now you're at the middle setting one two three now you're at the highest setting that also works for charging these lights will begin to fill up as the device is getting fully charged thanks to the usb type-c charger which you see the port here on the bottom this device is fully charged in about 40 minutes to 45 minutes here on the side you have your level adjustment for your cartridge whether you're using a smaller large cartridge as well as your diameter adjustment right there and the nice uni s to let you know what kind of device you're using all right guys so i'll go ahead and take a rip of the device for you as you see right here we're on the middle voltage setting so i'll press the button three times to get to the highest voltage setting and we'll take a rip nice little cloud there this is an awesome compact uh device if the yokan uni is too big for you and maybe you don't need the yokan oni pro with the screen the yokan une s is the way to go and before we let you get out of here we just need to explain what the flashing lights mean if you ever come across them so if you ever see the three lights flash five times that means that your device can't detect the atomizer so check your magnetic adapter check your cartridge maybe clean it with a q-tip but there's some sort of connection issue there if the device flashes five times that means that it's a short circuit so maybe the device was dropped or some liquid or something got in there but your device is short-circuiting and if these lights flash 10 times that means the device is dead and needs to be charged no frets simply plug in your usbc charger here and in 45 minutes time you'll be good to go that was the yokan uni s and you know where to get it discount discountvapepin.com same

today we're gonna talk about the new tomb stone [Music] my name is Joey I'm here at discount vape pen and today we're gonna talk about the new tomb stone so guys remember I was talking about the cloak before well good things do come in - so it's doubled it up the new tomb stone and you know why they call it tomb stone right these you're dead after you take a hit after this this thing is amazing so best of both worlds small and discreet but at the same time insane two cartridges yep so right there is gonna be your double connections for both cartridges and remember it can use different sizes 0.5 mils or 1 mil so like I said this tombstone does use a double cartridge and you could use you're gonna use up to one having an issue I'll show you like I'll show you right now that's come with a little plug and it's inside the package so what you're gonna do is you're gonna plug one side up and just plug the one cartridge that you actually want to use but of course you know here at this kind of a pen we go hard so we've definitely put dual cartridge fortunate one of them is empty but don't worry about that but look both sides not an issue double cartridge then the cap is gonna go right over and boom discrete so the tombstone unlike its little brother it says 650 million I've compared to the 500 milliamp this course is bigger so it's gonna have more power same concept it is a 4.2 volt fully charged battery that's what's gonna hit at the lower the more you vape the power is going to decrease and then the voltage is gonna decrease as well so you know I'm gonna get that great of a hit by the end of the night but in the middle of the day you're definitely gonna get ripped so guys I did took out that one empty cartridge and I'm putting the plug so we won't use just the one cartridge that happen here and we'll take a really really big hit off of this thing because this thing does push a lot of power so ah man yeah it's uh it's even good that CBD got me you know got my body relaxed definitely recommend this thing hey guys so that was the tombstone and his little brother the cloak so cloak is pretty awesome if you know you wanted like use it for CBD and all but if you want for more recreational use and more power definitely get the tombs don't put them in the casket this thing is badass it's $34.99 and remember you gotta pick it up from discount vape pen comm same day free shipping go pick it up [Music] [Applause] you", "Dyi1dvf5Q0M": "hey you know my name is Joey I'm here at this kind of a pens a day and today we gonna be talking about the new get high [Music] so like I said we're gonna be talking about the new get high this sees this might seem like familiar you know a little cartridge device that you might know love space in New Mexico so I'm gonna show you up close how's it gonna look but first let's get inside the box so we have a 650 milliamp battery so it's the same as the original Mystica you got the little you know charger inside a little baggie and it comes to the two magnets these this one does require to use a magnet on your cartridge so you could you know slide right in and fit actually I think I have a cartridge around me thank you brother so what we gonna do is pull out the magnet screw it on to the cart and also always have two teeth I'm not sure you notice it's like a little nut in the ring and I will show you a little bit easier so there's always a notch right there that's always gonna face up towards the tip of the cartridge [Music] screw it on and goes right in goes in magnetically well I should love this device it's pretty tiny and pretty healthy actually I'd like to wait to it so you have the USB charger port right there and a side of the device and then we going at the one button one points gonna give you all the necessary activation for the device I said turn it on click it five times rapidly one two three four five all right so I already found a little you know issue I'm not big happy about there is a light that's behind the bunch but it's very tough to see in date light it is on right now is that green green means is that three point 4 volts and then there's actually a second setting which is blue which hits you around 3.7 volts and then red which is a 4.2 volts which is the max right now I'm gonna set it to blue so I'm gonna click it three times one two three and right there you can see it might be easier to see on the USB port because after you guys see the light that light easier funny enough it's tell the actual button so there's a little tip right there so hold down the button take it [Music] it's pretty tasty so this card actually is from you know CD Flav really good company recommend it so so the vise actually has a little preheat mode which is actual one of my favorite things about like a lot of these cartridge babes you guys how you get like the most maximum flavor pieces heats up nicely so all you got to do is click it twice one two alright there's gonna cycle through different colors once again you could look through the USB port you can see it easier and also it's gonna cycle through different colors different settings and once it's complete you could take a hit you can hold down the button after it stops blinking or you can just take a hit naturally I like to press it by myself [Music] it's pretty nice alright so let's say the device you're using and the battery starts running low what's gonna happen is the light is that you're gonna start blinking flashing red actually it's gonna be like flashing red for about 10 seconds or 10 times and then it basically stops working its gonna beat that now even when you need to charge it I recommend plugging this in to like a computer laptop or like a game system not straight to the wall because is usually gonna fry the device so that's one tip right there while it's charging the light is gonna be red solid red and once it's done once is completely charging the light will go out and it's charged about like you know one or two hours it depends that you know what charging like poor data using but never use it too fast like charging port like a wall plug so guys that was a little review of the get high which is basically the New Mexico you know is the difference you know this guy's totally told her you feel a little bit lighter to get high they'll definitely get you by so where you can purchase that discount of a pen calm in order you know before 3 o'clock Eastern Standard Time same day free shipping so take it easy guys peace [Music] [Applause] you", "1K0KaKpc7Mg": "hey guys

link below please click on that link if you do use it it does support the channel and i greatly appreciate it so enough of me talking please like subscribe and let's get into the video let's go hey guys welcome back to the channel i'm ray thank you for joining me guys this is your first time joining me this is about diy how-to product reviews pretty much whatever i'm into i'm sharing this information with you guys out there and hopefully whatever information i can bring to you you can cherry pick what you like disregard what you dislike and hopefully it'll help you make you make better informed decisions in whatever you're into all right as you see in front of you guys i have the roo uh battery charger all right for my gopro that i just picked up love this little machine i wanted the gopro for a long time and finally decided to pick one up and doing that i picked up the package one and it gives you two batteries but i didn't like that when you have to charge your battery on your gopro you pretty much have to unplug it and plug it in and i wanted something independent so going to my favorite store of course amazon guys i'll put a link below in this particular model if you're interested in it please consider using that link it is affiliate and it does support the channel and i greatly appreciate it this is how it comes in the box and we're going to do which simply open up and see exactly how how it comes packed and as you can see it's come pretty packed all right styrofoam gives you two batteries some uh a brochure and a cable all right it does not come with a break so you're gonna have to use your brake iphone brake or whatever brick that you have it'll be compatible with it all right so let's just take it out and show what's all about all right all right so what we have here as you can see they give you a usbc to regular usb charger all right so it'll fit whatever particular brick you have so that's a good look and again you got i have the three slot one and they give you the batteries and as you can see on it a roux and it's battered for the hero 9. all right so very basic again i'll put a link below this particular model and by the pretty much all the links very positive regards to this this particular model here so i just want to give you guys a quick look at it a little closer at it it's like some type of rubber topping on it so it's nice again usbc it has a little indicator when it's plugged in and that's pretty much it guys and again i like this one because again three bat they give you two batteries and if you end up buying the the kit gopro kit they already give you two batteries so that's a total of four batteries so you can have three charges and one already in the camera so recording time and power time is not an issue all right with this kit so that's pretty much it and what i'm going to do let me take out my other one that comes with the kit and again the battery is they rate it as a 18 milliamp batteries totally compatible with the usbc and let's let you see the two difference i mean exactly how it looks all right and that's pretty much it guys it's not really too much to write home about all right pretty much basic and again that's you know it's just how it is you know if you don't want to pay uh the gopro tax everything pretty much fits in just like it is uh you'll know the difference between the two this is the aftermarket batteries and this is your gopro so no way to get them mixed up and that's pretty much it guys i wish i could tell you what i like about this size of this is very small and again if you only case plenty of room to store it away all right which i like so if you own the case easy to carry all your batteries you have your plugs enough room for your gopro again very compact and that's what this is all about with the gopro having compact able to carry things in one pretty much pouch so you're not all over the place keep everything together again a quick look at it i want to show it to you a little closer at it and that's pretty much it guys and uh what i like about this tool i just noticed when you're charged up you got three led lights here so that's a good look so right now it shows uh it's in red color so both is charging and also you have an indicator light in the back so i definitely like that that feature on it so it tells you once it's fully charged which one is uh is ready to go and which one's not definitely a good look on it all right so but seeing video of it in operation will help you guys out there to make a better decision to see if this is good for you so guys again thanks for joining me please like subscribe and i'll check you on the next one [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] later", "iYl7nyyKbnE": "Hey everyone and welcome back to

dive right in right off the bat we can look at the packaging you can see it highlights some of the features nothing too crazy simple packaging but there's a lot in this little box which is really cool so if we open all right seeing here that's gonna be the attachment for the magnet so it's got a nice size to it this thing is that's the first thing you'll notice here just in the palm you can see it you could totally hide it in your palm even with the smaller probably 0.5 cartridge or one milliliter cartridge will keep a little bit at the top but that doesn't mean it won't work but if you use a point five this thing will stay tiny and that's what's really cool about it and you can see on the side here it's got a micro USB port pretty standard nowadays on you got your button right here nice click the little button sounds cool so if you dive back into the packaging can you get your mag know you're gonna get a short wire right there now you actually get two so you get a spare which is nice because a lot of times I have heard of our customers in the store sometimes throwing the cartridge out with a magnet on it so in this case you won't have to worry about that you'll each have a spare she doesn't want to thank on that happening well just see here drop that guy in there now this is a one milliliter so like I said it is peaking a little bit at the top that it will work fine like I said point fives are gonna stay very very slim and make a smaller profile so some of the cool features about this one is that it actually has four voltage settings which is pretty rare for most of these little pocket boxes a lot of times at 23 this one will actually hit two point eight volts three point two volts three point eight volts and four point two volts so it's got a wide range on there for whatever kind of cartridge you may have there's plenty of cartridges out there nowadays and having more options for selecting the voltage is always a benefit now the gap on the opening is gonna be 14 millimeters so it's a lot bigger than most so you won't have too many issues with compatib out compatibility with this one it's gonna be compatible with pretty much I would say 90 95 percent of cartridges on the market nowadays the battery packs of 500 milliamp which is impressive for the size again palm sight less than palm size you know there are some bigger boxes that only have maybe 300 350 400 milliamps this one's got 500 milliamps worth of battery life which is great and you should give another go around on the on the actual device itself it's got like a almost like a plant it's a plastic material so it's very very lightweight there's not going to be any metal to this one except around where you hook in the magnet so light weight is also a huge factor on this guy it's great for pockets you know you could really carry this around all day and you're not really gonna realize is even there and they come in two multiple colors too this is gonna be the red and black so just give you another whole look around the whole unit there's not much more to say these are simple but they work well it's probably gonna about wrap it up and that was our first look at the I mini v3 alright guys so overall great little device tiny tiny pocket size very lightweight it's gonna have four adjustable settings which is they're unique to the small boxes of this category and again you get two magnets in the packaging which is really really great so just take a little drop it for you I mean it's it's right on par with all the other systems in its class but it has some really cool unique little features so as our first look at it if you guys liked this video give us a thumbs up subscribe and if you like any of these products they're available for purchase on our website just have a pen pal [Music] [Applause] you", "Zeizb8RLgjc": "so we're back with the final four items here on the carousel of cannabis we've got a radicand charlie's a noisy namer the number 28 and then the um this thing let's shuffle it up here we go i don't know what i want this time i guess i want oh my goodness is it gonna give me this oh my goodness it's the figure liquid stuff oh my god well this will be interesting well well we've spun up the figure master vape thing here um jeez this is gonna be interesting here's the uh the device here's the liquid it's uh you know what they only had one type when i bought this terpene was the flavor and you know i think that might be the best one to actually go with because i think that's possibly a natural flavor whereas the other ones i don't know maybe they're added i don't know all right so i did some quick research just checking out the things there and they say all natural flavors are added so i don't know if that means that they take the terpenes out and add them in or if they add in natural terpenes from elsewhere i don't know it's a distillate and this one here apparently is from wapa stream so yeah that's cool anyways now this device here is 35 i got this for free um not from figure but from a um a coupon club that i'm a part of actually my wife is a part of and they asked her hey do you want one of these things and she said yeah okay and so she got one and um yeah it was 100 free part of this coupon club and i guess because we're vip members for having been members for a couple years now we got offered this but anyways they have four different types and the only type available when i bought it was terpene all these ones were gone i'm assumed because they sold them all because they gave out free units right so the thing about this this stuff is that it only works in here it's not a 510 so it's one of these ones where it's um a proprietary type of thing only works in this on ocs i think they call these closed loop anyways though let's open this up and see what it's like i hope i don't have to charge this fucking thing because um i'm gonna try it right now let's open it up there we are this is a nice little box what a very nice little box how do you fucking get it out though i don't want to wreck it or do i maybe i do oh my god i was trying to push it through but no you have to open it that's hilarious i was trying to push this through look at that what a nice fucking box of course the box is pretty useless now that i've opened it has no more use i guess wait what's under here there's a secret compartment what's inside here there's a box of secrets what's in this a usb charging cable that means i probably have to charge this bastard may ignite explode leak or get hot if damaged oh boy [Laughter] so it's an exciting unit here it is right here the figure master vape got it right down here it says somewhere that it has two temperature settings so that must be what this is it's got a one and a two two dots one dot let's see can i pull sections off oh no you can't pull that off you plug it in whoops and here must be where the thing goes right inside there look at that cool huh it must slide right in there now how do you get it to go i don't know how you tell if it's on or not let me check the instructions so there doesn't seem to be any charge on here i'm guessing it's completely toast so i'm gonna plug it in here give it a bit of a charge i'll be back in a little bit okay so i plugged it in and it is charging uh the the lights on the bottom there's four lights and the the one light is flashing like it's gonna have to do and then two lights and three lights and four lights and then it'll be charged so i'll have to test this out in a little bit but for now let's open up this so this has 800 milligrams of thc and it's a half gram 0.5 wait a minute that's per total gram so there's 400 milligrams of thc in here 400 and this thing cost thirty nine dollars so about forty dollars four hundred forty dollars so it's about a dollar per point or per whatever fuck i hate math at four hundred and forty dollars that's an easy math thing to work out so if you're good at math that's easy to work out for you so there you go let's open this up wait package date 2019 12 december 30th 2019. not super exciting date but whatever it's a liquid thing so maybe it doesn't matter right that's what i'm hoping for anyways oh come on you son of a bitch it's in there real good fuck oh it's got these little side bits again that's what gave me trouble last time on that other one i tried i'll shove those in there there we go hey look at that there's a little unit it's like a little usb card or something look at that does that look normal it looks kind of full is that full anyways it's it's pretty thick whatever it is there so yeah this thing i guess slides in there's the mouth bit so there's the part with those little uh little um what do you call them little bits that are sticking up inside they connect here and here so cool i just have to wait for that bastard to charge up now so let's see i'll time how long it charges it takes to charge let's try that so i'm still trying to charge this bastard thing up i've had it plugged in for four hours and it's still flashing with the one thing there and from what i've found online it's looking like this one here is defective so that's great so anyways i've contacted figure and hopefully they'll send me a new one we'll see anyways i guess this is on pause for now so it's been six days since i contacted figure and look what i have right here a brand new figure master vape thing they sent me a new one so i'm gonna have to charge this thing up now and hopefully it charges properly [Laughter] because then yeah then i'll be able to test out that terpene pod so i'm gonna open this up and i'm just gonna charge it and then i'll be back look at this here's my figure master vapes this is the one that doesn't work i think yeah this is the one that doesn't work this is the new one that does work and they they shipped it to me and it's already charred see the lights light up so yeah i'm gonna have to put this in it now and test it out this is the terpene pod i'm finally gonna get to try it out i'm excited there oh and the the lights lit up as if to say success so you're gonna gotta give a shout out here figure because this was a free thing they sent me and it was a dud and then they replaced the free one with another free one so one that works too so yeah um that's pretty good that's a pretty good customer service i would say but anyways i'm gonna try this so one thing about this figure vape pen is it has two modes i just tried a nice huge haul off of this thing on the um on this mode now we'll try it on this mode and see what happens so i had a couple more puffs off of this thing on the uh this setting i don't know what the settings are one thing that's weird about this is that it like a quarter of the way through on a puff it'll start flashing and then turn off i wonder if that's a feature to help dosing or something like that which i have no interest in i wish i could disable it so i could just go the entire time but it has an interesting taste very light taste and uh yeah it's so it's okay so far so this thing here i just checked the instructions it says does it it's a temperature setting one dot is low and two dots is high so i guess we'll set it to high because we want to get hot [Laughter] so let me show you what i mean when i'm saying that this thing turns off on its own i'm gonna go like i'm gonna haul like crazy on this and watch it's just gonna start flashing and then it's gonna turn off watch [Music] do you see that i have way more room in my lungs right i want to go to the max this feels like a it um it stops you at like one third i don't know why it does that that's very unusual kind of annoying so i've had about 10 hauls on this thing so far and it's it's done that thing where it disables itself after a third on each so it's like 10 divided by 3. it's like a 3. i know it's hard to keep track because it's hard to count them because it keeps um [Music] it shuts off before i want to this is the thing i don't know why it does that is that i'm sure it's intentional but i mean what's the point of that i don't understand so i remember when i had tried the um the uh the skittle the skittles or what did they they said it was skittles but it i don't know how you say it zika dolls or something but anyways i tried that one that was rough as fuck this one is not this one's not rough at all i don't know if that's because it's it keeps shutting off on its own when it it thinks that it's had enough [Laughter] not super familiar with all the different vape types it's like vaporizers not so much vapes like you know like this this is a vaporizer and this is like a vape so i like you know i don't know super much amount of these but yeah i can definitely feel something i've had like uh maybe 12 1 3 hits on this and i can definitely feel something i just wish it would stop turning off at a third of a hit i don't understand all right so it's been a couple days now since the last time i came on here i'm still using this thing see it's uh let's see how much we got left here ugh i don't know if you can tell here wow there's still quite a bit in there um so yeah anyways this thing here i've been using it for a few days now and um it's okay but at the same time it's not as satisfying or even as good as uh vaping uh you know like using a vaporizer like uh for uh dry flour right dry flour vaping is much superior to uh to this the buzz you get on this is like i don't know how to explain it very well it's like a half buzz and um it's strange it's not it's like it's missing stuff just like that last time i tried the skittles thing this is also distillate too so i don't know i'll show you a thing i kind of had an idea how i can explain it a little bit imagine this whole thing here is um this is your high or whatever right so say you're smoking or you you inhale some of this right normally you you get like this like a head high right and we'll just put these two dice here to represent like a full head height or something right but no it's not like that it's more like this you're you got some of it but you're missing this and then if you go you have more of it it doesn't go like this and fill in the missing part it's like this and then you go for more and then it's like this and it never it never feels like a an actual it's always feeling like it's missing something and i'll be sitting here just going on this like nuts until i get a massive headache because i'll fee i won't be like satisfied i'll feel like you know i need more and by the same time you do too much and then i get a headache because it has missing features from the high that you're sort of looking for and it's not there as for the vaporizer this vaporizer i'm not a fan of this vaporizer um mostly because well actually the only reason i'm not a fan of it is because it shuts off it has like i think a built-in dosing feature but there's no way to disable it to have it on just full force so that's um i don't like that i want it on full force i want to be able to go the entire time i'm inhaling not just a third of the time because that's insane that's for the flavor on this thing it's actually quite a bit like the skittles one but it's way smoother and it's way less harsh there's only like a little bit of a taste and you don't really taste it in your mouth you sort of taste it in your throat it's kind of weird but yeah so you know i don't hate this at all i i think it's okay say you had some edibles or something and uh you wanted to just boost it up a little bit maybe some of this would help with that but i mean you get even more so if you've actually vaped flowers so i don't know i guess this is okay if you i don't know i don't know who this is for i don't know who this is for because i mean i would rather have an actual vaporizer and actually vape some flour like way better but yeah this the the pod in here is like forty dollars the unit itself is thirty five dollars i don't think i'm going to be buying any more of this not because i hate it just because it's not enough it's uh it falls short very smooth though very smooth and yeah it falls short it's not a full high it feels like it's missing stuff um i'm not really a fan of this liquid stuff but you know what there is this stuff called full spectrum extract or something like that that might be i should try that because this is distillate i should try the full spectrum stuff and just to compare to see if it's better because maybe it's not missing the missing features like this has maybe it actually has a full high i don't know but anyways as for the figure master vape it's not for me um if you like these kind of things it's a nice little unit but it has built-in dosing that you can't disable um so that kind of sucks it holds a charge really nice really long i've never tried to recharge this yet it's only on three now i'm using it as a three flash instead of the full four so holds its charge well but yeah i just i don't know it's just not a full high it's like a half high and it never becomes full no matter how much you have of this so yeah not a fan i'm probably not gonna buy any more of this distillate stuff ever again just because i you know it's inferior to vaping so i it's not for me but anyways um what do we got there five more things on the or four three more things there's three more things three on the uh carousel of cannabis so if you want to check those out hit the subscribe button and the bell and then you won't miss one when it comes online it'll tell you but that's it for now so we'll see you later and have a good one everybody you", "ShtXtVA7zRM": "this is the true leaved Mystica vaporizer this

to do a quick comparison video for everybody on some things that I really like that might help us get through limited supply local dispensaries have put out a lot of information in new jersey flower is hard to get it has to be grown takes time and they didn't expect the rush they're having what do they have a lot of cartridges many dispensaries around the country I expect are going to be left with a lot of cartridges now you have to make sure you're buying them from a reliable source do not buy them on the black market do not buy cartridges on the black market let me say that anybody hear me do not buy cartridges on the black market what you have to do is get a trusted source or a dispensary who actually with legal documentation certifies what's inside their cartridges once you do that you will be able to have one of the more efficient methods for medicating not gonna taste the same maybe it's not gonna medicate us as well as the flower were used to but what it's going to do is keep us calm remember there's a supply of cartridges at most dispensaries even if they're short on flour let's talk I use three main batteries for cartridges starting with the vessel by vessel you want to ground sugar go ahead go the vessel is a designer battery I bought it cause it looked good the unfortunate thing is it has a proprietary battery charger so without that you can't charge this puppy looks really pretty very nice device I like it because it's a screw in and screw out I fill my own as you know but why are these things gonna be important these things gonna be important because they're variable voltage you can get a really strong hit on them really strong so you can make your dollars go a further way and you can make your medicine go a further way most dispensaries count cartridges at a higher rate than they do flour because it's concentrate but with these types of batteries you'll be able to have your medicine last longer with with this trouble we're having in the world right now it's gonna be about making things last longer let's go to the picket one the picket one is a really really thick piece of metal fits right in the palm of your hand that uses a magnetic adapter for a C cell cartridge pops right in very easy button to adjust temperature very easy auto draw has the pre-work pre-warm a little bit once it does an amazing product again these are the key to a world that's more complicated because it simplifies things simplifies things I don't want to tell you how many cartridges I have in stock the point is we calm down if we realize we have our medication so find a way to go through everything you have see if you can make it last longer cartridges are a great way this is the pure buy kind pen another variable voltage battery product that fits right in the palm of your hand and delivers a nice knockout punch with variable voltage the choice you need to make on these devices you want something that's gonna look like a pen and fit in your pocket like this or do you want something that's gonna be small and very light very light or do you want something that's gonna be heavy like a solid piece of metal but also small remember they do the same job it's about which one you want to have the juice the juice for me is in a syringe but the juice for many of you would be in a cartridge that you would buy at a dispensary if they're out of flower I hope you all enjoyed this comparison of these three batteries and a great way to be more efficient with our medic medication in a difficult time Cheers", "CqT6AoZKIT8": "[Music] so [Music] hey guys calex creations here and i'm back and today we're doing a different video today we're going to be doing a comparison between the vessel vape pen the original and the new v2 that recently just came out but before we get started we're gonna talk about you guys thank you for getting me to a thousand subscribers holy [ __ ] thank you for getting me to a thousand subscriber guys you guys are great i can't believe it i'm [ __ ] humbled i can't believe you guys love my piece of [ __ ] content this much i would have never guessed i'm so happy you guys have no idea so thank you i really appreciate your guys help can do it without you thanks again my 1 000 subscriber video celebration will be coming very soon i'm going to be doing it when i harvest my mushrooms but for now we're going to be talking about a wii technology review vessel vape pens now i'm a huge fan of vessel vape pens i was a huge proponent of their original design back when it came about came out about a year ago in case you guys don't know this is a vape pen battery that was basically designed in california but still manufactured in china which you know depending on how you feel about chinese products could go either way but as long as it's made well in china i don't mind i really like their v1 a lot it was a slate in walnut very elegant design it was 180 mah battery and my original review of the pen was that it was a 8 to 9 out of 10 with its only weaknesses being its battery life well i am happy to announce that their v2 is not only an aesthetic upgrade but it also has performance upgrades going from 180 mod battery to a 300 mah battery which means extended battery life and they added an extra heat setting for even more you know even more precise heat control and this is great because now i have no complaints about the vessel vape pen it is now a 10 out of 10 in my eyes but not really it's not this version at least this copy of it is a 9.5 out of 10 but only for an aesthetic reason which i'll be talking about shortly but for now let's go through the heat settings it now has a fourth additional heat setting which as you can see in the video is now green which you'd think would be their starting color like most other brands but no it's it's it used to be just blue it used to go from blue to yellow to purple now it's green blue yellow purple i know it's it's different than the standard you know green yellow red but i can't complain they wanted to be different and they executed flawlessly with regards to being a bit into with regards to being original now what's also special about the vessel vape pens in case you guys didn't know is that they had magnetic charges the vessel v2 just came out at the same time as their carrying case and their home wireless charger which you could just put on your desk as a nice base just to charge it there when you're not using it which is great because now i could just i don't know if you guys saw the old charger but it literally just looked like a usb magnetic charger it literally stuck out of my computer or you know the box that came out of the wall and it was a little weird to charge but now it has this home base a lot nicer to do a lot more seamless to charge and now i'm going to use it more often because i don't have to pull out a wire at least for me maybe not for you guys but seeing that it's there and that it's effortless to charge my pen encourages me to charge my pen which encourages me to use the pen more now moving on one thing okay so i i mentioned that i took off half a point earlier and not to disappoint the guys at vessel but they charged the same price for the v1 as the v2 even though there were obvious performance upgrades now it made me think that they had to take away from something in this process and i found what it was the wood on the bottom of the pen the main feature that brought me to it is not flush with the pen itself now this is somewhat disappointing i'm not gonna lie i like that the design was flush on the original v1 it made it feel seamless in the hand you could go from metal to wood to metal and not even feel like it being that obvious whereas with the v2 the laminated wood which now feels a little bit cheap i'll admit it is not flush with the metal around all sides it's steep on one side and then sticks out on the other which is disappointing i would have liked to have had it completely flush if i do get a second copy that is flush i'll let you guys know but as far as i'm concerned my copy is not flush and that's the only thing keeping me from giving it a 10 out of 10. another thing to mention that i didn't mention earlier is that the wood from both sides is actually different you could tell on the v2 that it's a completely different type of wood composure the grain is weird it's also laminated a little bit whereas the other one you could literally feel the wood grain in the texture and on the v2 it just sort of feels laminated and that's that's disappointing i liked feeling the wood texture on the v1 uh maybe that'll be different for you guys but i'm hoping it is mine was not but other than that the performance is definitely a 10 out of 10. i'm happy with the general improvements it looks great with my craft concentrates pen pen cartridge which i will do a review shortly enough on it's a legal dispensary cart from colorado and it gives off some big puffs as i'm about to show you because you know what's a video if we can't get high again all right oh that reminds me if you guys aren't getting high with me i definitely encourage you to do so because it's a little weird to watch my videos sober if you can't watch my videos with me while getting high with me then definitely get high right after i don't want to i don't want to you know be the only one smoking here you know what i mean ready holy cow [Music] let me tell you guys it's really obvious that the dispensary carts are better than the black market cards black market cards could be as good as dispensary cards but not none from colorado i'm kind of honest with you dispensary cards in maine could compete with black market cards but in terms of concentration in general i've never had anything beat colorado i love colorado concentrates and craft concentrates is another one of those brands that just doesn't disappoint but uh yeah that's it guys i think i'm going to end the video on a wrong way with you guys i feel like it's weird not doing that anyway pen sites are kind of gay i only do those in emergency situations you know if i'm traveling that's the great time to hit a pen but i don't regularly like preferring the pen it's not better to me than good old bong rips it is not better than me than dabs but man if i'm you know if i'm hanging out at a family's house family member's house or i'm on the go of course i'm going to take a pen why the hell not right especially if i can't smell but yeah guys cheers get high with me again if not immediately after the video otherwise you're missing out let's go this is the old magnetic charger this little wiry rinky dink thing i'm happy i got the dust set up more i think it's fitting kind of whack this thing right looks like it's gonna you could lose it any second it literally magnetizes to every single thing on the table [Music] but yeah it's still fun though see all right now i'm getting childish i'm gonna end the video there guys thank you for watching thank you for paying attention follow me on instagram if you haven't followed uh if you haven't already follow me on uh pretty much everything if you can like why the [ __ ] not right guys um yeah uh thank you again for watching i really appreciate you guys watching my piece of [ __ ] content i really appreciate you guys watching my pen review because i know i don't really do tech reviews very often i would do more reviews if you guys watched it but you know i only have one tech review so far this is going to be a sequel to that tech review let me know if there's any other products you might be interested if there's anything you'd like me to review but that's it guys thank you so much i'll see you in the next video good growing and get high [Music] you", "O3CD6k0EkM8": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive kind of think of it every day is a good [Music] all right guys back hit for another video today you guys probably already know from the title that I'm actually gonna be trying a new pin it's called the vessel it's about a hundred hundred something dollars and I just wanted a pin that was not gonna break on me in a couple months not I don't want to pin that's like the outer shell like the color of it will start coming off chipping off because it's rubbing up in my pocket and all that I wanted something that looks slick and professional and that would actually like last longer because I go through batteries a lot guys but the longest one that lasted me so far is my honey stick so I would go for a honey stick if you guys can't afford to get one of these vessels I saw vessel on the Eric Conn's channel if you guys seen Eric on I watch aircon lot time he's honestly one of the people that got me into weed blogging but um on another note I saw him with that vessel and that [ __ ] look [ __ ] sleek bro and I had to go [ __ ] cop that [ __ ] you already know what I'm saying but yeah I just got off work a shave little bay no because I was looking a little rough and [ __ ] this is the first [ __ ] longer for the dead guys in a clean bong you guys already know I like to clean bong looking act like I smoke out of a dirty bum but I like smoke down on a clean bong it feels better [Music] [Applause] but yeah guys so today is just [ __ ] chill as day guys just a little update I'm off tomorrow so tomorrow I'm gonna actually film another freakin vlog usually I wear Fridays or tomorrow I'm off because I work during a Memorial Day on Monday so tomorrow mom so I'm gonna hit you guys up with a fake cart shout-out to simplistic he literally like did the idea that I did but I'm gonna actually have the cart the fake one with me and this company is it I'm just going to be honest actually I'm not I'm gonna tell you guys y'all way to the next [ __ ] to the next [ __ ] vlog for the next vlog because it's gonna be the next vlog but it's a new fake cart that hit the [ __ ] scenes guys out here in Cali and probably everywhere from the Midwest across the United States and like it's [ __ ] trash and I don't know how [ __ ] actually sell that [ __ ] people like you buy but on that note we're not gonna be talking about that today let's [ __ ] take one more bug rib and then we're gonna get into the vessel that's when we called cookies something some [ __ ] but it's pretty [ __ ] so here's the vessel guys comes in a super nice box actually it fits this what it said I'm just reading what it says on the back it fits most five threads cartridges it comes with the Chargers and the bias and then you got a one-year warranty you guys one-year warranty so use that warranty if you get this okay guys all right so guys at a cutting psycho buck so as you can see it comes look like a little like empty cart but it's not real it's just a little basically a prop to show you guys how it works so most five threads do work in this guy's but I had a friendly farms I'm not sure if they changed the way their carts are at the bottom but the bottom is way different than these I think I'm pretty sure than this one I'm gonna see if this one works because this is the new cart that I got the bezel so I'm gonna see if this works but it's a 5-10 thread so it might work so hopefully we can freakin try it but um off the back though guys it feels good like when you hold it whatever this material is that it's made with it makes it feel good it's freakin silver I like that color I'd rather have black for when it gets dents or something but Silver's not bad and then the cap on top said vessel in it you can pop it off just in case your card is too big to have this thing on it you can pop it off guys all right I'm gonna read this card because I literally have even used it yeah check out the card that it gives you sort of powered on five rapid clicks like any regular battery and then three rapid clicks to get through the settings which is like pretty like pretty much like every other battery except some like my the honey stick that I have you turn it on the bottom to change the temperature you don't click it through time but um the lowest tip is blue 2.8 volts medium is yellow three point two volts and then the red is the highest 3 point 6 volts guys you know so people can get the best vaping experience cuz I honestly like low temps but I'm gonna take a temp I'm gonna take a blinker of the high and I'm gonna take a blinker of the low guys for you guys cuz I know you guys like Steve takes plucking blinker kids trying to get me loaded as [ __ ] making me go to sleep all that [ __ ] so yeah it says to start off at the lowest setting and you're what a good thing the good thing about this battery is if it's inactive after 15 minutes guys it will shut down and it will not waste your battery so it'll probably last a lot longer if you guys want a promo code there you go it's 20% off if you can see that Criminal Code I think you could probably see it pretty clear its loyalty 20 all caps guys loyalty 20 all caps you'll get some 20% off I'm pretty sure you guys will be able to use it I think anyone can use that promo code it's just like flowing roam the internet so I got my bezel card on their orange spill and we're gonna click it on five make sure it's on the lowest champ the bully one so it's on the lowest Tim pright now it's like a sweetie goes hopefully you guys can see it so let's try it oh [ __ ] be a little bit of guys all right guys [ __ ] that [ __ ] even on the low temp it's [ __ ] a fat ass hey guys like it eat it up my car pretty well even for the lowest tenth so honestly I suggest you guys just use the lowest temple in there because you're gonna get a lot of clouds as y'all saw from the camera and you're going to you're gonna get a better flavor because it's a lower temperature you want to get the most flavor as you can out of the car guys you don't want to just be torching your concentrate guys no hot dabs either no no hot naps all right guys [Music] all right guys I'm gonna do one more blinker and then I gotta go I gotta clean up about to go skateboarding and I'm probably gonna do another vlog maybe I don't know hold on let me get my water ready cuz I closed it for some reason cuz I'm probably gonna be dying if it's the hottest I don't even know if I can make it to it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] honestly I'll try to get it so you guys can see the Bleecker but I don't know if you guys saw it if you guys saw it oh I mean I guess I'll know when I'm editing but freak that was a hot freaking hit did hurt I throw a little bit of water but um tell me guys what you guys want to see next we got the fake cart coming the nice is gonna be the next one I want to do another late night vlog with you guys I honestly want to do a freaking livestream with you guys but I want to wait until I get enough people to freaking livestream so I'm gonna leave a comment and like that comment if you want a live stream and I honestly think if you made it this far in this video you probably want to be on the live stream cuz you actually [ __ ] with me so shadows - guys don't forget to Like comment subscribe my name is Shaka Zulu if you didn't know already and peace man more videos to come you know would it be [Music]", "70_iY6RWPbk": "the excellence push is one of the best ways to keep your oil cartridges protected from fall damage or bending in your pocket in order to ensure a safe use here's a quick how-to video on the functionality of the excess push to get started press the power button rapidly five times to turn it on to change the temperature settings click the power button three times to adjust the desired voltage the LED lights will turn on in the sending order according to your set voltage two point eight three point two three point seven and four point two volts if your vapes been sitting for longer than usual you might want to preheat your oils for a good airflow press the power button two times to activate sash mode a 17 second no button press preheat cycle that allows the temperature to build up making sure not to burn your oils press the power button once to end sash motor Lea use any prefilled 510 threaded cartridge to load your cartridge remove the mouthpiece from the cartridge fill the oils around the heating post on the inside of the glass do not put the oils down the center of the heating post because that's where the air flow comes from then twist on the mouthpiece and attach the included magnetic adapter to the bottom of the cartridge and place it into the chamber before getting your draw make sure to push the trigger all the way up to the top of the unit so that it can work I suggest letting the battery drain completely before charging you for the first time charge it initially for two hours that never past an hour after that charging the battery overnight or four hours at a time ruin the battery or wear down the lifespan while charging the LED lights will turn on in the sending order to indicate your battery level when finished charging all LED indicators will stay lit press the power button rapidly five times to turn it off feel free to use dab swabs to keep the unit clean from dirt and dried oils if you found this video helpful drop us a like let us know if you have any questions in the comments

is the official video and launched for a long-awaited phantom signature serious eye since I started doing this view two YouTube videos have not had such a large number of emails requests and comments that have hinted at us doing one product and that was to make available to you guys my personal customized phantom which was our signature that I used in the troubleshooting video to demonstrate if you guys have any issues with the phantom so today we have available a limited edition number that we made which we might continue to add a continuously to our product line but we brought in some that we can sell as a pilot of my customised phantom Signature Series now this item is the same as our other phantom was in terms of the electronics the power and the functionality so if you guys want to go into details on how the phantom works operates the type of power that it puts out we have that video available right here on the YouTube channel vape on a stick but this video is being more of dedicated to accentuating the amazing features and feel of this truly luxurious concealer that ever since I've had my custom unit has been my personal and my favorite little luxury concealer do we offer so without any further ado let's come and bring a nice close-up and get the camera off of me and onto this wonderful product here's our phantom Signature Series now right away before we even get into how pretty it looks when you hold this into your hand we used a different grade of metal on here so it has a much more substantial and luxury feel to it just the sheer weight of it and the construction has been completely upgraded from the original you can tell the different grade of metal with the different tones in the metals so what I'm gonna do is show you guys on a previous phantom exactly how that looks you can see the different tone in the metal phantom to the other so we use a different grade of metal which does make its way through the field it doesn't make its way through to in terms of any different type of performance metric but just strictly as being something luxury that you carry around is kind of even a fashion accessory or a luxury accessory it has a really good feel to it there's a brush metal it also has each limited edition has a special nice and deep signature etching of the phantom logo right there on the bottom so another thing that we did that you'll notice immediately and when you feel it is that we've added this wonderful carbon fiber leather wrapped bodies so this is a leather that is a carbon fiber texture and look that completely wraps the body almost like a high quality stitched leather seat or shifter and your favorite exotic performance car it truly gives you a good feel a great grip and provides a wonderful look to an already good looking unit so this is like the Phantom AMG edition or something like that it is truly a gorgeous piece the next part is we have a custom handle that was made out of a different metal that we discussed earlier but it has our honey stick honey combs that are completely deep itched into here to offer a real textured real unique look accentuating that this is a concentrates vaporizer that is of course a two and one the handle also is a different hinge system so it has real quality feel when you're opening and closing you don't get any side-to-side it comes up and down locks into place with no resistance to wear it really shows you your voltage settings and things and the button is the same this is still a squeeze action unit we still have the the lights for the unit right atop the unit so while you're drawing you can see our different temperatures and when it's on and it still runs off of the same two magnet system each kit still comes with a concentrates adapter and an oil adapter and it comes together in this wonderful package right here so this is available on our website for a limited time in limited quantities and we would like you guys to definitely try it if you're on the market for a luxury concealer now let's just jump into what the cost is now this cost is approximately twenty dollars more than our other phantom even though it does have all these

Cheers", "F1Gj0gPR_Lk": "hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day today we're gonna be answering some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want to know I want to answer them but yet peace", "dOV48Xf3c0o": "come on guys the danger from discount vape pen today we're gonna be going over all the different egos that we have available we're going to go up close and we're going to talk a little bit about them and their differences [Music] alright guys so we're gonna go up close with all the different egos and show you their differences first here we have the ego 650 so as you can see just real basic this is the most popular one here just because of its size it's nice and tiny as you could see in my hand there no settings on this one setting hit the button and go and this is also gonna be one of the cheaper options available but as you can see I could literally make it disappear in the hand so it is really nice sleek and tiny probably why most people like it just the sheer size of it it's just tiny moving up from that we have an ego 900 so as you can see it's a lot bigger compared to that little guy but same deal one setting hit the button and go it's gonna be a little bit bigger so obviously you're gonna get a longer time with the battery it's gonna go for longer before you have to charge it and you're gonna have to deal with a little bit of exercise that's the only real difference between those moving on from there we have the 1100 so this one obviously a lot bigger a little bit harder to hide in my hand as you can see so it is a quite a bit bigger put them in comparison there for you that's the 650 in the 1100 same thing one setting you hit the button and go and basically you're gonna get a little longer burn time you're gonna get a bigger battery so you're gonna have to charge it less and that's the real difference between all the ones I just showed you is battery life there's nothing else going on there it's just how long the batteries and the last before it dies and you have to charge it now there is a different style of ego which is these guys these are the Eagles twist style batteries they're referred to as C twists or anything like that basically the one I'm holding here is two 650 and I'll show you the difference between the regular 650 as you can see something's going on there the they're both the same size battery but one's obviously bigger so with that bigger size is accounting for is the adjustability on the bottom as you can see there's a little dial here with numbers and you can twist to change the battery so you still have the button on there that you would hit like normal but you can change the voltage output so someone who wants to customize and like tweak a little bit to you know get their pen to hit a specific way this is gonna be the option for you and it's gonna be the smaller option to do that with because this is the 650 so the other one we have here is the 1100 twist so show you again here a regular 1100 compared to the 1100 twist so this is gonna be for the person who wants the most battery life and they're gonna want to be able to adjust their pen to hit at a specific voltage per whatever cartridge they have on there so as you can see it's a lot bigger same thing you got the button up there and the dial on the bottom so that's what the main difference between these two are is they have the same battery life but one is adjustable and one is not so basically when it comes down to choosing one of these pens it's just gonna come down to do you want one setting or do you want the adjustability it's also gonna come down to what size do you want and the size will determine the battery life just something that you're gonna have to think exactly how you're gonna use it and what's gonna work best for you and that's the main difference between all of our different egos that we have available alright guys so as you saw before that was the difference between all the different egos as you can see most of it is just different battery size which means it's gonna hold the charge a little bit longer than another and then some of them do come with the adjustability function you're just gonna have to decide what you're looking for and what's gonna work better for you and that's gonna help you make your decision if you guys liked what you saw in the video please give us a thumbs up it's star button you're interested in purchasing any of the Eagles you saw in the video today they're available for purchase at this cowboy bend calm [Music] [Applause] you", "0JmQ1VIZgxE": "hey guys so first of all let me say that I live in Colorado and I'm over 21 so this is completely legal for me except on a federal level hopefully gets federally legalized soon I think it would be a good idea um this video is gonna be kind of shitty cuz it's my second video like what do you expect you know third of all if you have a low tolerance this chronic is probably not for you okay because it's very powerful I took one hit off of it I was gone I thought I thought I was dying I was like take me to the ER please because it was terrible like a but once the dying part could have stopped it was okay like I was just really stoned but the dying part wasn't very fun but it lasted like an hour so if you have a lower tolerance I wouldn't recommend this product for you so let's get on with this review I'm really just gonna be showing you the product and what what it is so that comes in this nice box which I have effectively destroyed up here and then it comes in a little box in the box and then in the box in the box it's a case so you know this is fancy right it comes with its own like carrying case that says arrow Pro on it so inside the case inside the box inside the box there's a little charging cord a little like four page manual it's very very small very small and then we have the thing itself the thing that almost killed me the arrow Pro it's like a decagon shape I don't know if you guys can see that very well it vibrates when you take a hit off of it which is really weird the cartridge is magnetic so you can just pull it out and drop it in and it connect which is nice you don't have to screw it in but like I said you know this thing isn't for me and in the carrying case it looks like this fancy unit even has places to put your other cartridges if you want to collect other cartridges for it so I guess that's pretty cool I guess this is more for like dab and smoke every day all day every day smoker stoners you know and the cartridge came in this package it you know it's is childproof it come it came in a little little plastic box inside the package to keep it from rattling around in the bottom and possibly messing it up good choice I had my first experience with his vape a few weeks ago and it was kind of bittersweet cuz like I said felt like I was dying for a good I want to say an hour cuz but you know time gets all screwed up but and then once I was done dying I just felt really stoned you should have seen me go to the like kitchen cuz I was like venturing to the kitchen I bet I looked super stupid on my way there and I had grabbed a little asipi cup out of the cupboard and it was so much work to get water from the sink into that sippy cup and then into my mouth and then set the sippy cup down that's how high it was it was ridiculous it like in conclusion this this vape would be very good for if you dad wouldn't smoke all day for people with high tolerances because the cartridge is a distillate it's very powerful I leave an article about distillates in the description but yeah I wouldn't recommend it if you have a very low tolerance they're kind of expensive too so and I don't even know if they're sold outside of Colorado who knows maybe they are well thanks for watching this very short second video I'm NAT and I'm gonna be out a piece", "ACt-y8TEeu4": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we are gonna do an in-depth review of my Range Rover I'm just kidding we are gonna do an in-depth review of what looks to be a key fob battery but it's actually a vaporizer which is switchblade action known as our minimax Pro now I'm doing actually a second take of this video well our first video got removed for reasons that I won't get into but I also have some really useful updates for you guys on this model which is our new updated batch so let's start from the beginning since some of you might not have been privileged to see the first video so this is a vaporizer battery that is disguised to look like a switchblade action key fob as you can see you can put on your keyring as seen with the little premium metal trim key holder I have a standard sized keyring on it and I have it attached to my keys it's a pretty good size as you can see how it compares up with a standard key fob on the market or actually about the same size with this unit you have a standard 510 thread coupler to fit a grand assortment of cartridges so for example here just to show you guys an example is one of the widest cartridges on the market it is the V 9 Liberty tank which actually has the upgraded rubber trim on it so it is very very wide as you can see it fits and closes in there properly without a problem so let's get into some of the functionality we've upgraded this battery our first rendition was 500 milliamp hour capacity which I would say is about twice the capacity of your standard stake stylist batteries with the little stylus tips on them this new rendition battery on all orders in for June is gonna have a 650 milliamp hour battery so we upped the milliamp hours a hundred and fifty mili amp hours so it's gonna give you a little bit more life in between charges basically almost making it three times the capacity of a standard stylistic battery we also from a lot of our YouTube subscribers said they didn't like the button feel or if you push down really hard sometimes the button would fall into the unit or get stuck so we improved the button functionality and actually changed the whole button to where you can push on it as hard as you want and it is not gonna fall through and you're gonna get a good clean texture and a nice clean push and it's gonna have a decisive click and we have our YouTube users to viewers to thank for for giving us that upgrade and that helpful hand charging the device is really simple each unit comes with a micro USB cable that you will simply plug right into the inlet there now when you plug it in you're gonna have your lights around the button are gonna blink and then your unit is charging then once those lights go out which usually takes about people ask us this all the time it's more frequently asked questions how long does it take to charge usually from dead to full depending on what wall adapter you use you locate between two and three hours of a total charge time and with a six hundred and fifty milliamp hour battery even if you are a heavy user and are constantly using this thing your battery should last you more than a day of usage even if you're a very heavy user so at least you'll know you'll get a full day with this battery so let's talk about the action a little bit similar to a switchblade knife all you do is you would screw the cartridge into the adapter and then you would push the stainless-steel button here on the side to open and then you would also have to push it to unlock and be able to close the unit right there and it flips open very easily you don't have to do anything and the years ray of eight this unit will fit 510 thread cartridges because of the length of the body of this it is best for half mil cartridges or the 500 milligram however you want to call it all the way up to point six you can however put a 1 mil cartridge which would be longer for example this right here is a 1 mil cartridge of the same type as you can see it has a extra I want to stay probably about a third of an inch in height it'll close and be fine but the mouthpiece of your cartridge is going to slightly protrude out there so this is really built for half mil cartridges and if you do have a problem with your 1 mil cartridge sticking out a hair it would probably look about like that right there so that's how it look still gonna work just fine they've just fine but do keep that in mind because we actually received a lot of emails about that to make sure that it was good for half milk cartridges and how a 1 mil cartridge would look on it so how do you turn your unit on when you first get it you gonna charge it make sure that's fully charged we generally ship out our units with a 33% charge you're going to simply click the button five times repeatedly you guys see the unit light up and actually automatically you I don't know if you're able to hear that little fizzle but basically the unit automatically goes into a short preheat now when it goes into the short preheat if you don't want to preheat right when it turns on you can push the button one time and it will exit that preheat mode the preheat mode what it does it sends a little bit of current through the cartridge in case if your oils coagulate or your cool you know basically hardened up a little bit sends a little current through the coil to make sure that it heats up and before you start vaping or hitting that your oil has melted down and your cartridge is primed but if you have very viscous oils that you know flow very easily as you can see this is this is not really dropping much here as I turned it upside down so with oil that is this thick or a thicker we would definitely want to allow that preheat function to take its course before we start vaping on it so then once you have your unit on you have three temperature settings on there basically red is the most intense and each temperature setting can be seen with what color you see around the ring when you push the button here you see red now to cycle through your temperatures when the in turn is on you're going to click it three times and as you see it blinked up and now it is blue which is the lowest of your intensity levels now let's click it three times again and then you see you have kind of a white amber color which is your medium intensity level setting now some cartridges require more power some cartridges require less power so it's really kind of just there is no perfect incentive intensity setting it comes down to preference what cartridge you're using combined with which oil I know that we received a lot of questions about that so really it's just plug and play and see what you prefer now let's see how our minimax Pro key fob switchblade action battery compares to the competition there is another switchblade action battery that is on the market and let's see I think I have one right here on my car key as you can see immediately this looks more like one of those little buoys that you would put on your key when you go out boating so you don't lose your room your keys like or if it falls in the water will float and you'll see it it is significantly larger than our minimax looks pretty significantly heavier as well let's compare to an actual key fob so some of these we have seen they do have some of them have a variable temperature some of them only have one temperature some of them have preheat how do you charge a unit like this it actually has a little extension cord that you plug in to your computer your USB or into a wall adapter and I guess it'll just hang there with your keys until it's done charging it's like if you had a Tesla electric car have to hook an extension cord up to it and then again it has the same switchblade action to open it it got a little stuck there because these things they're not that wide so if you put a wider cartridge like our cloud tank on there it sometimes gets a little jabbed up there it goes okay so that's basically comparing the two so you guys know when you see several other of these on the internet so for the minimax pearl and several other cool items that we have on our website check us out on WWE paani stay calm use my special promo code honey 420 for 20% off this and several other

the cloak 510 vaporizer battery it has a 650 mah capacity battery it is 3 point 6 volts it is rechargeable via micro USB port with a cord included it is inhaled activated so you don't have to press a button so no button while inhaling is required right now it only comes in black but soon it will come in red blue and white so what's so cool about it is that it conceals and protects your vape cartridge so it allows for a stealth vaping experience all while keeping your cartridge protected and hidden so here's what's in the box say too much frame those are little instructions goes over everything I just said working voltage is 3.2 to 4.2 volts charging voltage let's see low power warning LED flashes eight times charging time is about one and a half hours resistance range is 0.5 to 2.2 protection timer of puffs or per puff is 10 seconds so we'll stop hitting after 10 seconds it accepts all 510 thread cartridges which is pretty much what everybody uses so here's the box see it is pretty bad get your USB cable this pretty much comes with all the units these days you get a couple of these little rubber gaskets that keeps it sealed which I'll show you why in a minute so I was pretty excited about this cuz it's nice and discreet so it keeps everything protected so more light so there's actually unit there's where you inhale right there that's the microUSB port on the bottom and how you open it is you just pull this top off like that and then there's your cartridge right there a little magnet so it keeps this on top hopefully you can see that sorry about the bad lighting again and then you simply put your mouth on here and inhale I think that was in frame so it's actually pretty powerful which I'm kind of surprised of but it seems like a pretty strong design and like I said it protects it you know slides over and it seems pretty sturdy to get the cartridge in I'll show you so this is a Graham cartridge I'll show you with one of my tallest cartridges I have here so you just screw it in like so I don't think it really matters where it sits and then you just slide this over slide it down it kind of clips a little and that's it right there I'll show you with a smaller cartridge as well I thought it really matters I guess but just so you know it's everything since you're half gram there's a few different cartridges here so mostly see celled a couple of different other brands and like I said you just slide that over and then it clicks down and seals into place and then there you go so it's not too bad I like how it keeps it protected like I was saying so in case you drop it it doesn't break it and that's about it if you have any questions or you want to purchase it the link is down below thank you", "eEKRqizO5QE": "hey guys this is Dave connection and we're taking a look at the vape mod X tube 710 it actually comes with this cartridge this charger these two pieces the battery and it hits hard but there's one flaw in this battery that really I did not like and other than that it hits hard it lasts long but we'll get to all of it so the cartridge is one thing here we did not test the cartridge out right now we just don't have any syringes available at the shop and we used it with what in a way that most people probably use it which is probably just as a battery to refill cartridges I mean for cartridge that are already filled so that's the bat mod X tube 710 that's pretty much the kit is all these without my cartridge and what I like about it well first off its got 900 mah which is a lot of power so 900 na you know compare that to like mostly other batteries out there that are pretty popular like the C cell silo or palm have 550 the vessel is only 280 so most batteries are like in that 500s range that our cartridge batteries and you know then you got those super mods at like 2000 you know ma stuff like that so a lot of battery life on this thing and it's got a few different heat settings and it has a preheat system I personally don't use the preheat system on cartridges I just always had a problem or sometimes it burns it a little bit or doesn't hit it just right I always just use the button push not a big fan of pre heat but it's nice that they have the option now strength on hits is good the hits are a little bit more Airy so it's not as like kind of tighter of an airflow it's kind of a looser airflow and some people might prefer that kind of hit and it hits strong and on the hardest thing it's really strong I think actually the best setting on for this bat month the xtube 710 are NC cell carts which is probably the most and type that are out there I think the blue setting is best so you have these different settings and blue I believe is your own green red yeah let's go to blue you like blue I think blue is like second hottest or something but you know basic style of changing the preheat settings one two three one two three changes it I believe it is for heat settings and that will put the specific details on that in our full or post but I basically go to the setting I like and I keep hitting it I test them out and then use it as if I was using the battery myself for quite a while and I've been using this about half a week and it's pretty good also the charging is nice that it has this it's a good battery but there's one flaw that's pretty major I look those that's you yeah it's a good hit it's a little darker background I think I see what the hits look like it it hits good so that's out of the way the major flaw I really don't like is this button and you know it's partially my fault maybe mostly my fault because I always forget to manually turn off the battery it's press one two three four five okay and I throw it in my pocket I assume a lot of people do that all the time unless they're using used to using my batteries and unfortunate what happens is the way that this battery is shaped with the button this button just goes off in your pocket all the time yesterday I pulled it out and it was on a preheat set he was on a preheat setting two or three other times you know is in my pocket and it just got all hot and it's because that bad replacement is just like placed in a way that it does just hits everything in your pocket like this will tap the cell phone you got all flat and then hitting like this and that's a major problem I have this battery and that's one of the reasons I probably wouldn't carry this around all the time leave this somewhere and hit it because I'll just forget to do that and it did melt up some of my cartridge juice because this battery this battery button and yes that is my fault for not turning it off but at the same time a lot of people are gonna forget to do that regularly and that does create a problem because on the other batteries for example the Toki 510 had has it on the inside the vessel has it flat and the vessel auto auto shut off after a while which is a really nice feature the seesaw upon the seaso silo doesn't even have a button so you're not gonna have it but yeah this button for me creates a big problem other than that I really do like this battery if you're hitting it where you you know you always are gonna turn off that button if you're always going to turn off that button then you're probably pretty pretty safe with this but if you're not gonna turn off that button here could I get some hot things in your pocket and I don't know if that's you can have some hot spots some hot spots in your pocket and let's see actually how much this thing goes for I wasn't sure on price forgot what the price was on this and it's going for Wow about 20 bucks on some sites so looks like they have a sharpie about 30 so yeah if I mean for that price it's good but that burning of the oil when I'm not in it does kind of make me mad and that and that's what happened with this going off my pocket so this battery for me personally I would still use it but I would just have it in a standalone thing I'm not gonna carry this thing in my pocket but the hits are good and it's got a little black char air flow so vape mod 7/10 I gave it one thumb up for quality construction and overall a good product but once I'm down for that massive flaw with this button placement for me at least and I feel like it you know bird up cell by cartridge by just getting off the hot side so that's why I say what time I want them down overall I think it's okay if they fix this button make it more indented and put an auto-shutoff that is a top notch battery if they do that as it is it's still pretty cool so that's our x27 10 review from bat mod is the AB connection thanks for watching you guys and everyone have a great week", "2Js-C1Xflj8": "[ __ ] uh we got the yokon unipro here and we got the the gt800 and to start off this hit this review we're gonna take a nice hit [Music] just take a nice hit of some regular distillate and cannabis thrive terpenes saw some pineapple express that was a nice flavorful hit anyway let's go into let's get into it so the reason why i call these the best batteries is because of many reasons let me let me let me start giving it off the top of my head so first and first foremost they conceal your battery that's i mean they conceal your car i like i like batteries that hold your hold your um your cartridge and keep it safe and stuff like that but you know you know those pen batteries that have no concealment you know i used to use those batteries but forget the concealment the functionality is actually what makes these batteries the best to me it really triumphs over batteries that i just showed like the vessel and and whatever [ __ ] because those are like you know three presets and that's actually okay for people you know there's no there's no there's no better or worse you know it's just what it is what it is but i just say that those have those have like three presets and you know you're very you have limited range while these have a lot so the yokon unipro when you look at the screen it shows the voltage and the ohm readage and seconds i guess that display how long you've been hitting your card for so i'm not sure how you can see that if you're hitting it but um at a two it goes lowers the 2.0 voltage and then it changes up in 0.1 increments all the way up to 4.2 volts and that's really really that's nice that's a nice range you know that's what i got this initially and i was like oh yeah i'm lit finally 2.0 voltage is lower than 2.5 but then immediately as soon as i got this i found out about this and i was like bruh what so this is the the the gt800 and i got it from qcell and they they sell the cheapest let me assemble it real quick so as opposed to the yokon pro it doesn't use this big magnet right here but i am going to i'm going to try the hit with that big magnet real quick and see how that does but we're going to load it and load it in and to me the unique thing about this uh cartridge is that it has this feature where well when you put it in as you saw how it acts to me for a new coil coil it detects its own it does the same thing as a yokan i think it just detects the the ohm readage of the of the car so that's it saying 1.51 ohms right now and as you can see the wattage is what i'm as well it's the biggest number here so it's like i change it by the wattage and the voltage is right there at 0.0 so there's this formula that i'm gonna have to probably put on the screen maybe eventually that relates all of this together and at 2.5 watts i'm at one point as you can see 1.94 volt and you saw the timer coming that's their timer so yeah so the whole reason why i like this more better more better yeah that's that's english is because it goes it has way more range like i said it changes it by the watts so if i go down the lowest is 1.0 watts and if i hit that to see the the voltage that's 1.22 volts like i did not know carts of a battery can go under underneath what's it called underneath the what's it called two i'm smack so yeah then the max as you can see i'm changing it let's see how let me see the per the per change per per wattage 0.1 so at 2 point at 4.4 watts we're at 2.57 and if we go up 1 to 4.5 we go to did i make that right 2.60 so that's a 0.3 change and then this is 2.63 another 0.3 change so it changes it in very in like small increments i've i've had a lot of changes so let's just keep going so the max is this the max i'm really going guy like i'm not going to hold you i've taken taking a lot of hits today so this is going to be a horrible review but the max wattage of this is 20 watts and the max voltage would be 5.2 whereas the lowest you saw it's like below two low ones so let's take a hit of it at like you know around 2.0 to to match the yokan hit that we took oh not even that let's just put them at 2.0 voltages and take take hits together and just see i'm not sure because i think the yokan has a weird heating mechanism that you have to just use i'm not sure if it burns oil faster i really don't know what it does so at 2.0 we're at 1.783 oh i'm not trying to go higher than that but let's see we're at 2.2 watts we're at 1.82 and at 2.3 we're at 1.86 2.5 1.9 let's go 2.5 1.94 2.6 1.98 so we'll say 2.6 over there i'm going to take this out and we're gonna hit it on the yokon and we're gonna put it to two volt to hit on the yokon first it's saying 2.0 volts at 1.59 ohms i'm not sure if that really matters if the homes even matters anymore because it's like if it's already two point 2.0 volt is 2.0 volts but i'll just keep that there and that's gonna take we're gonna take a 10 second hit let's go [Music] have a nice hit so now we're going to take i'm going to use the same the same magnet magnet for this experiment to see what's going on real quick so let me show you guys the setup so that's me for a new coil coil around the same ohms the voltage is going to be 1.98 so let's do this test [Music] performance is key so this one beats it in variable voltage um it has more preciseness more range better efficiency um better attack i can only say that the the yokan has better protection that's the only point it gets but yeah this is the liquid diamond sauce car we're gonna take ahead of this real quick we're gonna drop this down all the way to 1.0 watts to get the lowest voltage necessary this is the last hit i'm going to take of the video to show that this is a nice battery so we're at i don't know if you can see the arms i'm not trying to flip my camera this time but it's 1.43 ohms clocking in at 1.19 volts priming it up let's go i thought i was going to take a time to get ahead of that i don't know i should though [ __ ] i'm gonna do it you see the oh i don't nice um so uh yeah i like how the the the seconds is like down there you can i can actually see that's because before i wasn't counting but when i looked down i saw the second and it also stopped at 10 seconds so you're safeguarded so basically yeah that's it the the review of these the best batteries and um yeah as you can see uh yeah i gotta i gotta just get this video edited and just go go to work have fun guys", "m6nP_nydg9c": "good morning guys or good afternoon or good evening I don't know when you're watching this I keep smoking if you're in hola thanks for joining our review today we're gonna be checking out the cloaks this is one of my personal favorites from Hamilton devices because they're very hidden batteries they'd be shrek dick doo doo doo doo doo baby baby sure did it do do baby shy I'm sorry we did that to mama about these wait what are the covers okay so they have purple well they don't have purple eyes at some some purple tones y'all tell me if you think it's blue or purple or blue ball fine that's fine what's this one white all right where's red obviously Rick look questionably blue I like these batteries because it not honestly nobody could really tell what it is unless they're familiar with the product itself religious signs right off and you're able to put any cartridges you want this one also I'm like a palm in a silo does not require you to screw in this little thingamajig on the bottom of the cart I've lost a bunch of those ones my cartridges are empty so I just try to skip that extra step you screw it in and then once you have your cartridge on you can you simply just slide on the top and as I said you can't really tell what it is [Music] and there you have it these are the clothes they come in four different colors as we just showed you and that's actually brand-new these two only come in black we hope you enjoyed another interview don't worry we have a couple more coming up for you up please make sure to subscribe share tell your grandma about the seat make sure to check out Hamilton's devices on Instagram and also in Hamilton's of icing combos importantly if you need anything check their first they probably have it I'm telling you they got empty cards they got babes they've got davor everything you need portable electrical beverage so you high-tech solar stuff wherever you need it wherever you need it you just weren't putting your head properly thanks so much for watching you guys we'll see you next time this was coil pucks at Mack dizzle with and Hamilton directed that was pretty cool bye", "zGsIGnlSxkg": "all right so this is a review or kind of the description of the pc k t1 plus which is their newest model that came out I want to say about three or four months ago but it might came out a bit more recent there's a box it kind of looks like a box you get for your cell phone it's pretty nice one of the nicer ones that I've seen so in that box comes all this stuff these cartridges are the way and by the way these colors are rustic charcoal Avalanche crimson and this is midnight that I'll be showing you and they have a a blue and a that's called Pacific and a purple color that's called royalty so this is the midnight it comes in a nice case there's the big opening so it can fit some of those bigger cartridges the micro USB to charge it one of these is a light I believe let's see so it's about the size of a palm or a silo definitely can fill the build quality they boast that it's built out of a solid piece of aluminum and it definitely feels like that here is the power button right here that tells you how much power you have green means it's fully charged I believe there's yellow and red to tell you when it's 50% would be yellow and red would be 25% it has a 660 mAh battery let's see there's three different settings that you can set it let's see if I can change it one two so I think that's medium on two that's high and that's your lowest voltage and the voltages are three point seven four point three and it's max voltage is five one which is the red the chamber to fit the cartridge is eleven point five millimeters so that would fit a lot of the wider cartridges that are coming out right now and the nice thing about this that not too many on the market have is that it it can be activated with inhaling like a palmer a Cecil puff silo or it can be activated by pressing the button if you need to preheat it or if you just want a bigger hit you can control with the button or just by inhaling you do not need to press the button so I'll show you what comes in here you lift this up and you get the instructions here so tells you about the different modes the auto inhale will do like a multicolored light when inhaling manual fire will flash back and forth while holding the button depending on which setting you have it on when you turn it off it will blink three times I believe you press it five times to turn it off again a power mode slow is blue medium is yellow red is high and the battery life when you press the button if it's green is 100% charged yellow 50 and red 25 in here comes adapters like the C cell line up and it comes to the coal different sizes I'll show you here it accepts all 510 cartridges like I said it's two clicks to change the power setting one click to see the battery life you can press and hold down the button if you want to manually fire the device and it will stay on for 15 seconds which is pretty long so you'll get a pretty big you know cloud so let's see so that's that it does come with a nice warranty as well of believe a year and you can actually extend the warranty so in the box it comes with a micro USB cable which we've all seen before some do come with a cartridge I don't but it's available with a cartridge as well I haven't tested out the cartridges yet but here's magnetic adapters as you can see it comes in a short here four different size cartridges 0.5 and your 1 millimeter so that's those and you just screw it into there and it'll snap in magnetically so there's a 5 and just so you can see the height once it's plugged in in there like so it snaps in and it's all ready to go and cultures just sitting for a minute so took a second won't so that's that or you could press the button if you want as well so I'll give you a much bigger hit let's see so and then I'll show you the Graham cartridge on it I believe when you take it out it flashes at you as well just to let you know that the connection isn't there anymore so that's the Graham cartridge right there it's a C cell again these have been sitting for a second so it's taking a second for someone to draw through so again that's the midnight color and let's see I'll try it on this guy as well just to try it on a different style I guess you could always use the different heights if you wanted it shorter or higher just kind of nice so I have it on its high sitting right now oh yeah that thing definitely rips so turn it down because I usually don't want to burn out my carts or anything like that just in case so it comes with those there's a warranty card which I can't seem to find at the moment but this is the pc k t1 plus battery and see if I'm missing anything here seems like they really went for the highest quality battery let's see these are gold-plated adapters things right here I'll show you once again this is a half gram this is a full gram and I think that's it if you have any questions feel free to comment and I hope this helped thank you", "BdKWfo5LkxI": "hey guys it's dad connection we're gonna compare the Jeep NGO pod system to the vessel battery with a C cell and I would say this vessel battery with C cell is probably the best standard cartridge set up you're gonna get right now this battery has the best air flow and C cells are by far the best standard cartridges right now and Gio is one of the more popular Protestants out there and you see a lot of companies that are offering pods now for GOI cookies is a is a popular one that recently just added BAM pods baam is maybe not as popular but they're a great company and I hit a lot of their pots I'll hit them when I can get them and let's talk a little bit about feel and styling so feel on these pretty comparable as far as like they're both great I would say this is more of a rugged feel on the vessel this is more like a smooth contour kind of an ergonomic feel on the Geo and really Gio did a great job in this battery there's a lot of room for improvement and other stuff which we'll talk about in a second but the battery feel and everything in the discretion on this is great the vessel also a little more discreet if you have the top on I just don't have my top on right now but it's pretty discreet too I'm charging on these I actually like the vessel charging the thing I don't like is you have to have a special charger but it does start really quick it used that little Clark charger what is nice about the Geo's it uses micro USB which is pretty standard and you can pretty much find it anywhere so if you forget your charger oh someone have an old Android phone well you can charge your Gio now that will work the same charger now as far as battery life they're both pretty decent the vessel is not a huge moth like 240 mah but it charges really fast and that doesn't make up for a lot of the lack of battery life and it's the airflow is just so good it's worth charging it and here's one thing we're talking about on the cartridge differences okay so here's the pod so you can already see the C cell card okay so we're talk a little bit of difference between you know Geo pads and C so standard stuff so first off the Geo pod you can't see it in there but it uses a wick to atomizer so you're literally heading off a wick so it has a ceramic core if you broke it down initially but then you break it down a little further and you'll find inside that core is just a wick the atomizer and if you hit the Geo too hard it burns it so don't hit your geo too hard if you hit your geo too hard you're burning this the center and it's gonna taste Bernie for the rest of the rest of the card on the other hand see so it is ceramic core and it hits better so it it just gives you a better flavor it's not all Bernie it's not gonna get a Bernie taste on it and you can hit a little harder without again getting burning and it's probably not gonna get perma Bernie like the like the Geo car can get so you know as far as cartridge design you know C cell cartridges are pretty much ahead of the geo the Geo can come back and they could change this core if they change this cord this is geop NGO will be one of the best pod systems there is you know if you if you make this a good core it'll be great but as it is now a standard C so cart is well ahead and if you were to compare other pod systems to it you know you can take a look at sea salt you know see cell dart the steezy the LDV fire I would say these all are better constructed hardware when it comes down to the pod section then the Jeep NGO and you know quite frankly g-pen you know most of products have really been known for more like celebrity endorsements and kind of looking cool as as opposed to being like a really high quality product so if they can fix this and really and just change that core it'll be great but as of now you know it's only something I get because I really like these vampires I didn't really like Bam's oil so much and if they offered their stuff inside a standard seesaw I'd probably get it but for now the Jeep NGO is is really something that this get if there's a specific pod but other than that you know I'm probably gonna go to see so and you know one of the thing I'd like to mention on here is stickiness so I have an older pod and I felt like a lot of a lot a good amount of extra oil got kind of stuck around the plastic which didn't seem to happen nearly as much on Cecil's glass karts maybe this happens a little more and their plastic parts like the ones you see on select elite like the m16 but I doesn't happen as much on these so I had one of these it was just like a little cake of oil over it it's not a whole lot but you're probably losing five ten percent on that so you know that's another kind of efficiency issue both of them can be refilled which is great and we have a video I'll post video below and how to refill Jeep NGO but personally I probably wouldn't be refilling it I would probably instead get a blank sea salt and fill that up", "SLihlyzlkHE": "hey guys new cat discount vape pen and today we're gonna help you answer the question what is the best voltage for my cartridge [Music] alright guys so here we have two different kinds of batteries for you as well as two different kind of cartridges to kind of meet up a couple different scenarios and you could kind of just get a good idea for yourself what might be best for you to hit your cartridge at so I think the more important part of this is actually gonna be the batteries um so you can see here we have a spinner type battery and for those of you who aren't sure what that means is if you look here you have a little dial with varying numbers um so you can see start at 3.3 volts that's that's your power selection and you see what I did there how I could spin this little dial on the bottom you could increase the power up to different settings or come down so as you see I'm scrolling up to 3.8 this would be 3.9 ok 4 and so on so you could just keep increasing it decreasing it and go into different settings in between pretty much exactly what you want to do make it very customizable the alternative method would be a battery like this which doesn't at first look like it has any adjustments but what these are is gonna be a click style adjuster so we turn it on which is already on you can see that the color is green that's gonna signify a set voltage if we do three clicks just see the color flash and now that's an it's next setting so you have three three three presets of voltage increase all right so now just more - talking to that Oh like we just saw this guy is gonna have your three presets where you know you can scroll between three point four three point seven and four which is nice to be able to adjust but again with this spinner battery we can we can really change the dial and do the in-betweens of those settings so it's a whole lot more customizable and if you really want to pinpoint on exactly where you want to be this is gonna be your way to do it you know here you can see three point three and three point you know look that would be like consider to jump but here we can go in between I really do what we want if we want to settle it down or turn it up a little in between those presets of this guy that's what's great about the spinner batteries now how that's gonna affect your cartridges as you can see we have two different cards is here this is gonna be a ceramic type cartridge and you can see the heating element with with the way the wick holes are versus this guy which is gonna be one of your more old-school wick cartridges now the ceramic is gonna be able to take more power these are gonna be better at higher voltages the very low force is where you're gonna want to cap these out at so like you know four point two really should be the highest you're gonna consider going with these there are a few out there on the market that'll need more and at that point I would say just keep it at four point two and then if you feel like you need a bump turn it up just ever so slightly you know possibly with a spinner battery cuz that's gonna be your best way to do that and just come up and don't be afraid you know but also you know don't go too high can't start and then we have the alternative which would be your your cotton wick cartridges these guys aren't gonna be so good on keeping a higher power setting you're really gonna want to try to stick to around 3.6 3.7 3.8 I wouldn't I really wouldn't want most of these into the pores I have seen one or two in the past that have needed a little bit higher of a power setting but it's very rare so yeah just to kind of realize your bit your best way is gonna be keep it low see how it feels take a solid hit and then if you feel like you need a little more turn it up ever so slightly whichever way you may be doing that whether it's with your spinner battery which would be a little more I'm coming up in the small lengths or you can do it with your click button adjuster which that guy is gonna bring you to the next preset hopefully that next preset is gonna be in them after that close up hopefully you have a better idea of what the proper voltage to hit your 510 cartridge job would be um like we said it's really gonna depend more so on the battery um if you have one of the ones that has an adjustable adjustable slider on it like a spinner type battery it's better for finding exactly where you want to be because you'd go into the in-betweens that a 3 click wouldn't provide you so for example like we said this guy you click 3 times and it goes into one setting and the next setting in the next which is great because you can kind of take high medium low depending on what kind of cartridge you have but if you have a spinner battery it's really gonna allow you that freedom to go in between all those different sights you really find the perfect setting for your specific cartridge now the cartridge also does matter to like you know if you have ceramic which is going to be you know you can tell that it's ceramic if you look at it to see little Whipple's in the bottom that can be hit at a higher setting those are okay the low fours you know three point eight four four point two those are all going to be okay for most of the ceramic type cartridges if you have a conduit cartridge like this guy where you can see cotton exposed to through the center that's going to be on the lower head where you're at you know 3.6 3.8 maybe 3.9 again different company different cartridges by different companies they're gonna have the power requirements so there's a little bit of play play wiggle room on you kind of just figuring out based on what you have but either way these batteries will also provide you with the perfect hit depending on you know what setting you want to keep it at that's the partisan brand other than that I mean you just kind of use a little bit of common sense - depending on if they hit feels like it's enough you know that that's it you don't need to go any higher try to keep it as low as you can know what that being said that should really give you all the employee to know about that if you like the new these products they're available for purchase on our website at discount vape pen

they did send me a couple of them so i have the blue one here unopened i have the black one here unopened and then i did open the red one for myself i already put my battery in and all that but here's pretty much what comes with it it comes with like a little lanyard a charger and then this one gram cartridge unopened obviously so i went ahead and put in my true leaf cartridge so it also does come with a magnet so since this is a half gram it does look kind of weird in here but it's not a big deal if you really want to keep it portable this is super super small so i'm going to go ahead and read off the back of it so i'm going to show you guys this and i'm going to read off the back of the other one so 650 milliamp battery i'm just going to read them the important things 3.2 volts to 4.2 the ceramic atomizer that's the ones that comes with it and then the charger and all the basic stuff nothing nothing too special but the lanyard does go on this piece right here and since this is the red battery came with the red lanyard i'm assuming this one is going to be blue and this one is going to be black but here is the cartridge itself the tree leaf cartridge i forgot the strain exactly but if you guys are looking at this battery i'm gonna have the link down below so you guys can go ahead and check it out it does help me out if you guys go ahead and use that link but let's go ahead and take a hit [Music] so you guys didn't see that this was lighting up but this is going to be the medium setting so it's going to be like purple and i don't know what the other one is let's see blue okay so it's like red purple and then like blue so this is the medium so it should be like 3.6 volts something around there and go ahead and hit it again this way you guys can actually see the color [Music] one second so if you guys are wondering why there was a cut i got a phone call so i was just answering that but yeah this little battery does hit well the good thing is that it's small and that's also a bad thing so it's kind of annoying if you like having a full grip on the battery but you can also palm this battery so you can't even see it if you really want to conceal it but i'm going to go ahead and take another rib i've taken like two or three already i'm gonna go ahead and take another one jeez all right it's like the third rip i'm going to take like one or two more i can see if they can take a blinker i don't know if this battery does but we'll see [Music] i don't know how many seconds i was but that was enough that i could take before i just coughed it all out so it would have been kind of useless of a hit because i wouldn't have been able to inhale it but yeah this is a nice battery i do have these other two maybe i'll give one away on my instagram and give one to my friend but you guys can go ahead and look out for that my instagram is at i'm ethan smokes you guys can go ahead and check that out but this is the battery like i said you guys can't go ahead and look at the link down below and if it's not there look at the comments because youtube is kind of annoying with the links and stuff like that so you guys can check that if not it might be on my

tested in the 80s I think mid to high 80s I don't have the exact results down below and I gotta say this was a very high energetic cartridge finished this one kind of quick because I hit it quite a bit the oil burned vaped I guess you could say not so quick and it lasted quite a bit the mystical melody was another one I reviewed I really liked that oil but it did seem to vape a lot faster this is a pretty slow comparatively and the effects is pretty energetic it's be a good pre-workout cartridge you know if you're trying not to be all tired this is a great one for that I'll take a hit of it so you can see how it is but it's really no different on hitting then all the other arrow pro cartridges they all hit really good yes I'm getting towards the end so efficiency overall as always good an arrow pro know a lot of them say a seesaw right there there's really just seesaw hardware and a different kind of form factor so arrow Pro Jack rare two thumbs up great cartridge everything about

top I've got a fire button on the front it's got a charging port on the bottom first thing you're going to want to do whenever you get one of these is you want to dig through all your cords and you want to find one that's got a plug like this well that's not too hard we found one that has the mini USB right here plug it in to the unit make sure it fits find a power source plug that power source in and you can see that it begins to charge one two three just like that okay it is charged it will stop blinking okay that being said to turn it on one two three or four or five and the light blinks as you can see three lights showing no atomizer we screw our cartridge on to the battery hit the fire button that is the first power setting to change it one two three to change it one two two three

VapeFully.com and today I\u2019m gonna do a review of this little vape\npen \u2013 Linx Hypnos Zero. The Linx Hypnos Zero is designed for use with\nconcentrates only, it does not work with dry herb. Nevertheless, it\u2019s very exciting device\nand I can wait to show it to you! So come on guys, let\u2019s get into it, shall\nwe? The Linx Hypnos Zero is super small and insanely\ndiscreet extract vaporizer. It measures just 10 cm so it is much smaller\nthan other vape pens currently on the market. But in this case, small size comes with great\nperformance, and that\u2019s cool. What\u2019s unique with the Linx Hypnos Zero\nis the fact, that there are no coils in the atomizer. Instead of that, there\u2019s a ceramic plate\nthat heats up your extract. General manufacturing quality is superb \u2013 the\nunit is very sturdy, sleek and looks elegant. The glass mouthpiece contributes to great\nflavor. Using the Linx Hypnos Zero is very intuitive. You simply put a small dab inside the atomizer,\nengage the heater button and start inhaling right away. Therefore Linx Hypnos is super convenient\nand discreet \u2013 you can take a single puff and put it back in your pocket. What\u2019s interesting, there are four different\ntemperature settings to choose from. According to a chosen setting, you can get\nbetter flavor, bigger vapor output or something in between. Coil-less atomizer provides much better overall\nvapor quality \u2013 it is not scratchy at all, it\u2019s smooth, tasty and pleasant. And, of course, the vapor is very potent \u2013 for\nme 2-3 pulls work well enough. All in all, with the Linx Hypnos Zero you\u2019ll\nbe able to have a quick session and attract no attention at all \u2013 the device itself\nlooks very inconspicuous, just like an elegant e-cig. Ok, so what are the main drawbacks of the\nLinx Hypnos Zero? There aren\u2019t many, to be honest. I would like the battery-life to be slightly\nbetter \u2013 it definitely would last a whole day, even if you\u2019re a serious dabber. But some other vape pens require charging\nbattery only once \u2013let\u2019s say \u2013 every 4-5 days. With the Linx Hypnos Zero you have to charge\nit every 1-2 days if you\u2019re a heavy user. Also, it\u2019s not always easy to load your\ndabs into atomizer as they can be very sticky. But that\u2019s the case with most vape pens. Overall, I truly admire the Linx Hypnos Zero. It\u2019s super discreet, it provides great experience,\ngreat efficiency and the taste is second to none. So don\u2019t wait and get yours today at VapeFully-\nYour Trusted Vaporizer Experts!", "WPmZOIAopKg": "all right I'll try to keep this short and simple this is the C cell gold m3 battery comes with a USB charger that you can just plug into your cell phone or laptop or any USB outlet it comes boxed in a cellophane bag as you can see there and comes in gold and it comes in black which is a little bit more discreet it has a 350 mAh battery that is designed to give you flavor potency and give you you know large vapor and you know without compromising the taste it has 510 threading so it fits pretty much all your you know C cell batteries to non-si cell batteries they recommend that uses C cell battery with it but you know it works on pretty much all the ones I've tried has a voltage output of 3.2 to a 3 point 6 volts it charges in about 50/50 minutes and it has a quality circuit board with multiple protection so it protects the battery and it protects you know your your C cell battery or your cartridges as well whether it's not C cell let's see I'll try to get the light on the front like a white LED on this and it's the same color but this is has a blue cap on it so it's a little bit you know more discreet and hidden so so it's pretty good hit and that's that's a it's a C cell type cartridge but not exactly a a CE cell brand I don't believe but um you know through this one and this is C cell brand right here and I would say it pulls like a little bit better you know then a non brand but it pretty much works with everything and this is the black one right here again with a 510 threading so if it's all the you know all the main brands right now and I'll show you the light on this one if you can see and then once again it comes you know packaged pretty nicely and it lasts pretty good as well it's inhale activated of course so there's no button to press or anything like that you just inhale and it gives you a large hit and I think that's about it there's a purchase link down below if you're interested usually shipping is 24 hours or less so we'll get to quick thanks for watching", "UxPsq_6eIYk": "hello guys my name is joey i'm here at discount vape and today we're talking about the new yocan armor [Music] so how you doing guys so we're talking about the yokan armor today which is a concentrated vaporizer kit it does have a built-in 380 milliamp battery in this nice old metal packaging right here it is built in the most robust way there is um yokan did include their signature coil cap which basically makes it a little bit less messy when it's dealing with your concentrate so it's a nice free vaping experience just simply load up your material attach the coil to the cap and then screw on the cap and take your hit this does have a three button you know uh standard protocol when it comes to three different voltage and does have a five click on and off function is usb chargeable micro usb of course right on the side right there so you can stand it up so after you turn it on click on a button it's going to indicate which setting you're on so one blue light indicates it's 3.0 volts click it three times rapidly one two three now you have two lights two lights going to indicate three and a half volts now click it three more times one two three now it's going to show you three lights which is four volts which is the highest setting and to turn it off click it five times again one two three four five so guys like i said save the cap because this kit does come with two coils but only one of them has a cap so right there you'll see an inside a dual quartz rod wrapped around um wire and surrounded with ceramic so i'm going to press the button you can see it heat up real quick is it on it is so you can see the red right there it's not gonna heat up super hot because remember this is for concentrate so you want a nice warm but not super hot uh vape of course and it does have a preheat setting so if you press it twice there is a 10 second preheat so you click it right there one two and it's gonna cycle through the heat settings and while cycle is gonna you know set the perfect temp when you're done you can press the button you want to you turn it off and then you can take your hit and that's gonna give you like a nice milky hit right there if you want to this is 510 so if you want you can actually screw on a cartridge right here and use this as a cartridge vape and charges within 35 minutes guys that was a yokan armor which is a nice little device for a concentrate it does come with a premium pick kit so it's not

at the mechanic like i think at christmas and this [ __ ] was perfect so who [ __ ] knows man but ah i got the haircut i almost got work done these just need to get dropped off here got my mask um y'all it's time it's time we bust out that vessel that vessel premium vape battery i have been holding on to this until i could get a real haircut and i truly have no more excuse so let me go drop this off and uh yeah we'll go uh we don't even know if i put this uh if i put this on right i really don't but uh see you soon all right man let's see oh that's a little smudged up let's see is my car dead in this boiling ass parking lot yes yes oh my god it's like 90 degrees in chicagoland right now i absolutely not trying to be stuck out here um so like i was saying earlier i got a premium vape battery i just wanted to cut to the chase and stop buying these shitty five dollar batteries that break on me every two seconds and i honestly they put out a vape temperature how do i say this the pull to draws that i grab all the cartridges taste slightly burnt and i know it's because the voltage setting on these is simply set too high however the vessel comes in with a bottom voltage of 2.7 on their intro mode so the terps on these carts are about to actually shine through and not i don't know just tastes like burnt rubber okay i need to turn the ac on or someone cut this clip because i'm dying all right talk to you soon i gotta say man i gotta say that's what i like to see right there that's sharp that's hella sharp and it's showing the version that i got the new leather canyon series oh that's super crispy from the moment you pick up your vessel you'll obsess over its signature design and character we're in the business of making every experience more intuitive and personal delivering the best design and performance in our line of products the collection is an honest demonstration of our relentless attention to detail and craftsmanship now let's talk about this fits most 510 thread cartridges i have been interested to see is mine gonna work let's hope but uh looks like it's literally the device and a charger so let's crack it open man i'm in i haven't opened it yet oh [ __ ] okay let's check it out we have to charge load our cartridge in and then we get to enjoy it there's those voltage settings i was talking about earlier with their lowest being a 2.8 i think i said a 2.7 earlier my apologies um but blinking red lights means it's charging no lights means it's fully charged oh [ __ ] it's on this side oh dude oh snap yo that is dude i legit haven't opened this until now that's for real leather man [ __ ] i really like this damn that's dope here's the fake cartridge they have in place of where mine will go but come on man that is cool besides the voltage being lower than the competition i found some other cool stuff on this number one your device will power down after 15 minutes of inactivity that's dope man i would hate forgetting to turn my cartridges off that specifically had buttons too sometimes those can fire off in your pocket i'm not a fan however i don't think that's going to be a problem with this one okay as we can see no lights that means this bad boy is fully charged i didn't show myself attaching the magnetic part earlier there's me disconnecting it literally simple as that man i'm gonna try removing this okay that's getting rid of that cartridge so at my dispensary i literally straight up said hey man i am filming a review where i would really like to sample a cartridge i've never had before that's super flavorful this was the recommendation so to be honest i can't even remember the straight name i'm an idiot lime skunk see i thought it was um i'm sorry i'm so stoned i really really thought it was a different one but i have lime skunk liquid live resin half gram cartridge from cresco and um let's actually let's read this real quick crafted from premium fresh frozen flour our liquid live resin preserves the unique cannabinoid and terpene profiles of the living cultivar i literally almost said cultivator out of habit cultivar ready to use in vape form okay thank god dude i feel like an absolute idiot but i finally got that open let's um god this is just not my day dude whoa nice okay again here we are with a magnetic locking base in there and uh oh [ __ ] is this thing on no i don't think it is one two three okay i believe it's on i'm going to it said specifically do not over tighten okay i think i just hit the end of it right there so it fits um i think this bad boy is ready to rock let's hit it still haven't hit it i'm just admiring man god damn like this looks really really cool because i just turned it on after charging it i believe it's on the normal power setting i mean the bottom one 2.8 let's try this man [Music] [Applause] that flavor is ridiculous oh my goodness dude worth it first pull i know it's worth it let me take five and uh address my little pig over here perfect perfect dude i almost don't even want to turn it up to a higher heat setting but i know i obviously eventually will just because on white that's pretty nice man it's pretty nice i don't know if you all have these like type of berries where you're from but these are the most annoying things in the world to have a tree up stop eating that oh my god dude and my my puppy is eating so much of these goddamn well might as well get a quick shot of this in the sun holy [ __ ] man i really love it dude i really do from just overall but just button look feel it's just the strength of it how that it's magnetized as it goes in like i really really do love it [ __ ] i just remembered after 15 minutes of inactivity it automatically turns off okay now it's on oh my god hmm yeah these things that's easily the biggest rip i've taken off of this yet i'm definitely feeling that but i love that it didn't taste burnt man also at 2.8 i find i don't know if anybody else who like smokes a lot about bounds i smoke a lot of bangs with water filtrated uh smoke being my main source of cannabis to go to just like a dry vapor cartridge it sometimes can really make me hack up along but i think at 2.8 voltage that's exactly where you want to be like that's the cloud i want to see that's the flavor i want to have and that's definitely what i want my cartridge battery to look like i can't say it any more simpler than that it is morning i've got my amazing vessel 510 battery here and it's been so long since i've been able to awaken bake with a cartridge and you know i had to come out with it and we're on baby oh [ __ ] now what what excuse me what i'm experiencing now that i have in a while the cartridges there's the fly [ __ ] is that cartridges have all really tasted the same when they're hit at a voltage that's too high this is like taking a little drink of this lime skunk i i truly taste that and that's awesome i mean dude i'm very satisfied this is essentially what i purchased this product to do and look this great on top of it i thought while we're here might as well do one on the next highest voltage setting oh yeah oh yeah there is certainly less taste but i would be a liar to say i don't immediately feel the effects more hitting this at 3.2 i think 3.2 is the bottom voltage setting i've experimented with in the past oh that might work first off before i even address them down midnight go girl the vessel i in the end give it a 10 out of 10 because it did everything i needed it to do but more importantly it satisfied a long craving i've had of i hate having poor quality vape batteries that don't work half the time when i come home with a cartridge and i just want to enjoy it and i don't even want to have to think if my battery is going to a turn on b function correctly at a vaporization temperature that enhances my cannabis not takes away from it in the end um i really got no complaints here seriously uh go get you one non-sponsored as always wasn't contacted by them nothing like that i saw it on reddit for a while and i finally wanted a bite you know what i'm saying um but yeah kushner ketchup out hope y'all feel okay man", "SAPo_Q8iHCA": "[Music] calm I just want to talk to you guys today real briefly about one of our more popular batteries that we saw on the website it's our mod 900 milli amp per hour battery that we sell it does have three different voltage settings on it what you do is you hit the button here in the center five times to turn on real quick one two two four five the green setting their green light that you see there it's set at two point six volts and then you hit it three more times one two three should turn yellow the yellow setting is at 3.3 volts and then one two three again and now we are at four point one volts and then I believe you could hit this button two times I'm not gonna do it right now because you need a cartridge insert it in here for that to work but that's the preheat option so this ring will stay lit up for about 13 to 15 seconds these are a really good battery they do come with the magnetic 510 thread for the bottom of your cartridge that way when you do drop the cartridge inside there it does stick in there these are really solid batteries check them out at cheapest food supplies calm and use coupon code promo 10 that's P R o mo 1-0 it'll save you 10% on your order

videos because I got a strike I don't have you know I can't upload for a week so this will be uploaded [ __ ] a week from now or a week from when I got a strike so I don't know when this video is but I'm still making video so other than that I just like to mention that I got a new pocket from the people have pocket you got Randy over here where'd you get a [ __ ] on my top 5 cartridge video of 2018 I don't know why they did that [ __ ] I mean they said it was like sale of some ship I didn't link it to a sale of any cartridges just a you know a battery or a bait pain you know it's [ __ ] so that's my hater [ __ ] yeah we're still making videos I'm not I'm not I'm just saying it's gonna be a week since you've seen my videos we're preparing for it now you know yeah roll out we're having a little cartridge session on the inside first let me actually so I think they gave you a golden version yeah basically also I'd like to mention that basically there is another one they gave me for the channel but I want to figure out what's happening with my channel before I start this contest they gave me another one to give them to you guys you know leave if they hook me up so yeah let's do it yeah I hope you guys enter so you guys get a chance to win you know I think it'd be awesome just for you to receive a pocket I don't know if I'm thinking to be awesome it would be awesome Lucas glug so Dan that's a fat cloud ain't that high zoom oh man [ __ ] it's actually pretty long like 10 seconds you won't feel it though it's a smooth experience though with the pocket you guys already know this is my favorite bed like I said before I say anything else about the pocket this is something that is my opinion not not everyone else's you know what I say it doesn't mean that it is the say all be all you know and all be all type [ __ ] you know like this is why I like it feels nice the reason how why I haven't been using it is because mine broke due to my fault not because of you know faulty product you know it just feels nice and oh good it just has a has a chip in there and basically detects your cartridge and it basically adjust it to whatever temperature that it is going to be the best at you know it's great it's great product you could also press the button there's also preheating as well there's two batteries total of 960 milliamp sigh believe they're 480 milliamps each just a great overall product you know obviously after that he's probably gonna take another he's gonna be taking another hit or two but just make a video and just let you guys know that even though it's been a week I'm still gonna be making videos whether it be on YouTube or the we tube if I get deleted again on YouTube I'm still gonna create another one so you know this might be on that one who knows you know I don't know yeah it's been like a day so far so yeah another how many strikes can you get so like you get it like three and then I get two so if I get another one I can't look for two weeks but these are like videos that are like a year old already so it's like what the hell they're you just I don't know YouTube's weird but cheers guys that's [ __ ] weird a whole year ago see any stuff like hell [Music] yeah but on the bright side if you guys haven't seen by a week or already RJ has his new video out very very well edited for his first I would say his only video so far that he's edited by himself yeah yeah pretty good yeah thank you for the yeah I appreciate it so uh check him out you know at least one of them one of us is still gonna be on YouTube oh I'm still gonna be on you talk yeah if they delete me I'm still gonna be on there but airs right now we're being persecuted you know I'm saying so I don't know if someone's just flagging my videos cuz they hate or cuz honestly in that video I just provided all the brands that I thought we're good which i think is needed videos like that like there's so many fakes I just read on Instagram or some guy called blackness XYZ or some [ __ ] he follows all this beep [ __ ] that's like a like a legal [ __ ] that he just brings to the light and he told me that someone died in Chicago recently through vaping fake or illegal cartridges so I feel like those videos are necessary you know reputable brands should be known more to the public and federal federally legalizing cannabis to just it should be you know sadly to say that that probably is not going to be the only death due to illegal cartridges pressure has been more recorder yeah exactly so you know hopefully that I don't know it's crazy you know I can't say [ __ ] you know YouTube it's their platform I've been deleted before so it's nothing new to me and you know I'm not you know I'm over it you know I've been over it you know and uh I'll just create a new one and focus on the week two more because I finally seen the benefits of we tube you know I got a decent sized check but it was through the course of eight months and I really didn't really upload on there but it's good to know that that I got a check for that and I might just focus on that more who knows but YouTube has always been my passion you know live streaming has just been growing on me these past this past year or two so I'm taken to my head it's like am I kidding music - do I look like a head rush oh that high how my guys ever gotten hello I signify hit wished like hello brushing her head and I mean that's what's happening and yeah if anything you gotta say anything and say I appreciate it you guys Wow I already love these [ __ ] right other everybody knows what it is be fabulous we help each other it's only way we're all gonna make it I'm saying so yeah I mean I'm not gonna be scared and delete my videos I know my videos aren't [ __ ] like selling illegal [ __ ] or anything I'm just [ __ ] smoking the [ __ ] and telling you about it you know so other than that I will see you guys the next one peace out [Music] [Music] [Music]", "QClNoHWQ0GE": "Hello and welcome to VapeFuse. In this video\nwe are going to review the CCELL Silo 510 thread oil cartridge vaporizer. The Silo is beautifully designed and available\nin multiple colors. It comes with a 500mAh battery and it\u2019s\nslightly taller and wider than the CCEll Palm. In the box you'll find the Silo battery, a\nshort USB charging cable, two magnetic adapters, a warranty card and a single page user's guide. A single page only, as it is really simple\nto use. Let me walk you through it. It is recommended to put it on the charger\nbefore the first use to make sure the battery is conditioned. Once your battery is fully charged, screw\non a magnetic metal adapter to a cartridge and slide it into the device. Make sure you are using a good quality oil\ncartridge as it will have a huge effect on your vaping experience. The CCell TH2 Oil Cartridges for example work\nperfectly with the Silo. You don't need to turn anything on or press\nany buttons. The Silo has an auto inhale function, so all\nyou have to do is take your draw and enjoy the vapor. If you like to run your vapor through water,\nyou can use a Dab Cap adapter to make that process very simple. Let us know in the comments section below\nif you have any questions.

or check out some of our other videos this is John from CNC connoisseurs you guys have a good day peace", "eh-_v7jHmkA": "hi my name is Brian and today we're going to be reviewing a few products from Knox medical so stick around here's the bait pan battery from Knox medical and we're going to head and take a look at it on packages I've actually already opened this up I'm actually quite impressed by the way it it's constructionist so we're going to go ahead and show you what it looks so that's what it is when you open it up comes in three pieces so you have the battery right here and this is one of these one of these that actually has a button so you're going to know the way it works is you hit five times to turn it on when you want to have it when you want to draw we just hold it and it also comes with a cap top cap and a middle cap now the thinking is is that what you're going to do is you're going to put your you're going to put your cartridge right here and you select a cartridge over fact I'll grab go the cartridge and then you actually have a cap on top so that's the way it looks right there it has three controls click three times for its setting so it'll go from blue to pink or purple and then from purple to red red is the highest setting they recommend that you not use it in the highest setting because it could burn the actual oils and stuff like that so just like anything else is just screw straight in like this and then I have these two already screwed together so like it just slides on air like that and I just end on a really I really do enjoy this the reason why is just look I mean look it's just right in your pocket it's not going to leak out on you and it won't accidentally fire as long as you have the safety on my only complaint with the actual battery itself is and this might just be mine I'm not for sure but this battery button rotates and it's not completely round it's the way it's manufactured is it's supposed to stay in one direction if it turns a little uncomfortable on your finger but the button itself feels a little cheap but that's my only really my only complaint with this battery I like to take this completely off when I when I used it I found that um you can just use the and this is what I like one thing I do like about this is that it has you can see how much juice is left without taking it off however when you have the cap on I find it's very restrictive air flow so with the restriction of the air flow it's almost easier just to take the full thing off and then just put the two caps together it's what I normally do and then just put the whole thing together whenever I'm not using it anymore but again I would have to say the quality the quality is actually superb everything is metal everything is I mean I'm my only complaint this is button which may just be my my button so if I don't know if it's all the button but there is a button and that's one thing I do like is there is a button one complaint I hear from a lot of other other people even some people down my youtube channel here because they don't like the pullthru they only like they like that button this Knox Medical one will probably be my replacement and that's because of this cap I really like the fact that I can just put this cap close it up put it in my pocket and I don't have to worry about it leaking out if you're looking for a battery I would recommend shopping with Knox medical seeing what they can offer you now as far as customer service with Knox medical is concerned it is actually pretty good pretty decent at the time of this taping they are just now beginning to open up their stores so everything right now is just by order by internet order only if you have any problem with any product the fact that there is no store and I think this is just in general you're going to have you're going to have problems I actually did have a problem with my with this first order and actually have taken me two weeks to do this review because of it that's no diss on Knox medical at all it was a manufacturing flaw with the card off and let me explain part of the flaw within this is that these hold if they are one millimeter up or down could be the difference between whether or not this thing will actually work and that was the problem that I ran into it ran into this issue with multiple dispensaries that I've used so far so this seems to be a problem industry-wide not just with Knox medical it so it took a week for it to come back now I'm able to review this product so again it's not it's not bad customer service they did exactly what they needed to do and I have no complaints with that whatsoever it's just that in the infancy of this industry patience be careful because you could be without medication if if you run into an issue like this especially people who who like me live in rural areas and don't live anywhere near any dispensary you know the closest town to me is an hour away so so it's very important that you check that you check everything before they walk away I do recommend Knox Medical overall if they are close to you go ahead and give them a try they are very professional that has a very good product I have no complaints with anything like I said before everything seems to be of high quality so yeah give them much give them a try well that wraps up our first Knox medical review if you have

man today we got a special treat we're looking at these new CBD distill it be bait cartridges from black tie CBD no terpenes or cutting agents have been added to this at all they're nice jupiter-c sell cartridges and they also offer a really nice battery it's a self-drawn o button and it holds a great charge it's pretty good I don't mind it I generally hate non push buttons but this battery works for me it comes in a full gram cartridge and right now I believe they're 49.99 and we offer an exclusive discount code through the hemp bud form its hemp bud forum and I believe that will save you 10% off your entire order at black ties [Music] so if you've ever tried distill it it's got that distilling flavor but it also has some natural or carring terpenes in it that were present in the hemp that was used to make the distiller just distill it by itself does taste sorta bad so if you're not familiar with what purity to distill it tastes like unflavored sort of like burnt rubber maybe a cache bowl just generally just kind of gross ish this has a nice herbal base a bit of pine hints of lemon citrus notes pie a little bit of distill if not terrible tasting not the best tasting cartridge around the effects are fantastic as it's pure distill it at 60% CBD full-spectrum all the other cannabinoids are present including a small amount of THC I believe the effects for me are just spot-on with what a good full-spectrum CBD does it calms me relaxes me slows the anxiety down that I fail relieves tension generally in my body that's what I use CBD for and these effects come on instantly as do most vaping products for me and I would find this particular cartridge to be a hair on the night time you can't I wouldn't reach for this during the day for whatever reason so that mellows me out nighttime cartridge hit me with the comment below if you've tried these let me know what you think peace [Music] [Music]", "C5g8YqBuPrc": "[Music] most people reviews this they also say

battery provides energy to heat the oil in the cartridge to turn it into vapor this is the Moxie 510 thread battery it works with our liquid moxie or live resin cartridges as well as any other Universal threat card the battery comes with the USB charger you just insert the battery into the charger like this and charge it in your computer or wall charger it can take up to two hours for initial charge and then you're good to go you take your vape cart and screw it into the battery you click the button five times to turn it on it'll light up and now it's ready to use inhale and enjoy the battery has three voltage settings each voltage setting corresponds to a temperature setting on the atomizer the default setting is 2 point 6 volts which is the coolest setting and shows us green on our pen this heats the oil the least which preserves the most volatile cannabinoids and turbines we recommend using the setting for optimal flavor and efficiency the higher voltage settings deliver more heat to the atomizer some users enjoy that so that they can generate more vapor and blow bigger clouds to change the voltage setting you click the button 3 times from green 3 clicks will take you to the medium setting of blue which is 3.3 volts and another 3 clicks will take you to the red at 4 volts but for us we really like the green setting so we'll always click it back three more times to send it back to green when you're done you just click the button five times to power it off and you'll see the green light go out that's all there is to it if you have any additional questions leave them in the comment section and we'll get back to you thank you very much", "N94YtBsXbE8": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the cannabis sommelier i'm your host andrew friedman thanks for joining me

gold fits my swag this package really nice it's packaged like an apple product as we have come to expect from nice electronic companies i believe this one is like oh i can't remember 60 us dollars like 100 canadian dollars so let's crack into it i've been waiting to try this battery out very excited i love the i love the stiffer cell phone i don't know what it is stuck to me beautiful box nice raised whatever you guys don't care about the box you care what's in it oh from the moment you pick up your vessel you'll obsess over its signature design and character we work relentlessly to make your every experience more intuitive personal delivering the best design performance in our line of products the collection is an honest demonstration of our attention to detail and craftsmanship look at how beautiful that unit is that's absolutely gorgeous uh love it you know that is one thing these guys are are like that apple standard that's kind of what we hold every electronic standard to these days is like they're the apple standard of vape batteries and the retail store we were selling more vessel batteries than anything uh get started we're gonna want to register it we're gonna charge it i like to kill my batteries before i charge them load it and enjoy power on off with five rapid clicks and three to change it five volt charger only start using the lowest setting and work your way up that's what we've got in the box that falls out nicely and it is this beautiful gold so i'm i'm stoked that i got a matching set because i love that gold and it's a really nice design you know what i actually like in my suit jacket is this tends to fall over in my in my pocket and this one you know i can i will actually be able to find it's not and it's totally different really like the design you can see the usbc down there uh looks like they might have a clip charger coming in the future from these toggles or these attachments going on at the bottom but great color well let's put a cart into it and see what happens i got this cart from hexo that i did a review on and then you screw that in and then it swivels it screws in and then it has a tight swivel so that you can i believe maybe not oh yeah you get you get 180 degrees of swivel so that's nice so that i can always have the optimal mouth piece that egg's pretty cool and now my cart's protected so it's a good good traveler one two three four five our lights are on there we go perfect and i'm on light blue that's my lightest setting i love how it looks the color the feel the look of it the taste of it the smell of it the texture i love gold so much the edges it feels like a really nice uh car key this is this is beautiful love it let's try it out killer airflow i it i should mention the smart battery that has its variable voltage on how it draws if you're ripping on it it likes to mitigate the battery a little bit so that every puff is consistent between everybody especially if you're passing it around very smart battery great technology big rips coming out of it let's try it here one more time i think it's huge that i can actually move this that's really nice and then we'll take it back out knock it past and i just want to do a little comparison to the original battery this one's a lighter airflow it's not ripping as hard wow that's fantastic okay so let's say this is a lighter airflow and this one's actually one temperature hotter so double the battery moving mouthpiece uh very slick design um you got your very you like i said the smart battery slick design good nice big easy button hidden tank killer [ __ ] battery um i love these vessel products i i love this one a lot uh this one might start being my everyday carry just because i really like how it sits in the palm of my hand um and i've been loving this one for a long time i have multiple colors i love them so much this is like it's a great accessory if you smoke carts at all and you don't have a vessel brand battery you're kind of screwing up this is like the mont blanc pen of vape batteries absolutely fantastic cannabis somalia approved stand behind it 9 out of 10 the only thing that would make the vessel lineup better for me is if they bluetooth and i could start having some more control with my phone to the degree temperature seeing how many puffs i took that's literally the only thing that could be better for me these are the best batteries that i've ever used for anything and i will continue using them and standing behind them love it love it love it go check them out thank you so much for watching i hope you make sure to like comment share and subscribe until next time cheers what's my name what's my name the cannabis somalian", "14H2jkcXWS0": "Let's have a look at the Atmos Magna;\nthis unit is one of the many vaporizers from Atmos, this one focusing on\nconcentrate vaporization and offering convenient magnetic connections. Inside\nthe box you'll find: one 650 mAh lithium-ion battery, one single\nquartz coil, one dual quartz coil, one magnetic chamber cover, one glass\nmouthpiece, one USB charger, one loading tool, one user manual, and one carrying\ncase. To load the unit, remove the magnetic mouthpiece to expose the\natomizer. Using your wax tool, load a small amount of wax onto the coil.\nReplace the lid, unlock the Magna by clicking the button five times quickly, set the unit to your desired heat setting, and you're ready to vaporize! The\nMagna wax pen has three temperature settings as indicated by the LED light\naround the power button. These can be toggled through by quickly\nclicking the power button four times. Unfortunately, the exact temperatures and\nvoltages are not listed, but the heat is indicated from lowest to highest by the\nrespective green blue and red colors. To wrap things up, I'd like to tell you guys\nabout some of the key features of the Atmos Magna which make it a notable unit.\nThe first is the use of magnetic connections with the Magna.\nConnections which easily snap apart and come back together make the Magna easy\nto assemble, use, and clean for a long time. The second is the Magna's ease of\nuse; there's only the one button for operating the device, and the magnetic\nconnections make it easy to take apart, clean, and reassemble. And the third is\nthe availability of three temperature settings for the Atmos Magna. This wax\npen features enough options to help you generate either big clouds or low key\nflavor. I'm Mike for TVape TV, we hope you enjoyed this video and found it useful.\nAnd for all you connoisseurs out there, keep vapin'!", "n0M20BXChxE": "[Music]", "VN3VclSDdbw": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan HOF the chief operating officer of honey stick and today I'm bringing you what I think is our sexiest styled vape battery to date which is the new honey stick be master wallet vape pen kit we're bringing you this battery and I have been such a big fan of multicolor ever since high school that you guys might have seen you know forward launch some cobras where they did what they called the chameleon paint job and honestly you know to wear kind of within different lights it changes some colors and has this cool multicolor affect a lot of vape companies they've done multicolor but not III haven't seen one really truly live up to you know its previous glory of really accentuating that chameleon color that looks super car quality and multi-coated so these vaping batteries they they still sell so I brought a couple examples and these are hundred-dollar kits but you know one problem is the fingerprint sometimes the gloss finish they get finger pretty easy so we want to do is we want to launch a really special vape battery that solves that problem that you guys can use with your 510 threaded prefilled cartridges or 510 thread vape tanks so here check ours out it doesn't think they're pretty easy we made sure that with the texture and the multi coat of the paint and I want to make sure there's not much glare so I can show you guys the details on this battery you got a nice honey stick logo you got a stainless steel bottom this is a very high quality battery the finish is multi coated it just feels like an amazing piece when it's in your hand now let's jump into some of the technicals on this battery so each one of these batteries is going to come with a high gloss black bee master kit it is a wallet kit it's very small it's a high gloss very smooth finish this is probably the size of most wallets actual wallets it's very very thin it has a little locking buckle clip here that you just push down on the bottom half of it and it will pop open and then your ear kick comes out which is your honey stick bee master multicolor battery and your USB charger so when you get your kid out I want you guys to take note of all the quality that really went into this kit we we we went the extra mile to make sure that when you push on this button it has the perfect resistance and feel so that it feels like you're pushing a quality button some buttons when you push on them on the vape game when you push down you don't know if you got a click or it's too hard to push on so even though this is a 5-10 thread battery that is relatively simple concept we wanted to make sure that it had the quality feel we even made if you can see the spring pin in there to be very very high cause your tank in you're gonna have that extra resistance but what that's going to do is it's gonna make sure that it works with more of the tanks that have the deeper inner connectors or that that you know that have a 510 thread that comes down more that needs a more solid connection to fire so this little battery is going to fire more of the 510 tanks where other where other standard batteries fall short now what are the size specs or we have our goldline battery out and this is actually a little bit shorter we wanted to make it a little bit smaller more you know better for you guys to carry and have on the go so this battery is only 3 inches by itself so it's really small so a lot of you guys might think hey you know does it have a it doesn't have the capacity but we made sure that we still put good capacity into those battery it has a 350 mah powerplants so it's basically gonna give you about the same capacity as our best-selling beekeeper model but it's a 5/10 now charging the unit once you get it unboxed once you guys to get on the charger right away most of our units only come with a twenty to thirty percent charge due to shipping regulations so you'll take your charger out you'll see it has a 5-10 port on the inside of the charger just get take it you're gonna push lightly screw the unit clockwise don't over tighten it just get it to be a good hand tight there it is and then you're gonna take the USB N and plug it into a wall adapter there's a non Apple so you plug it in the charging time on this battery is about an hour and a half to two hours depending on what power wall adapter you're using so you plug it in and get it charged up for the one to two hours you're gonna notice when it's fully charged based on the bling pattern it will either disappear or change color for you and then you're ready to vape so you're going to get your favorite cartridge now the cartridge that I showed you guys earlier it's actually a half mil version of our cloud tank we don't have these up on our website but we're currently working on them this is a prototype you can see it has a nice little matte finish you just gonna take your vape battery and you're gonna screw it on in to the battery you guys spin the battery clockwise and then like any other vape battery it's a standard 5 click on 5 clicks off to turn your power on you guys see it's gonna flare up also in a multicolored LED this battery is three temperature settings so you have three intensity levels to hone in on your vape the top level which is indicated with a red light is gonna be a max out at 4.0 volts your lowest temperature which is indicated with a green light is 3.6 and then you're gonna have a middle temperature which is blue that is going to be right come right in at 3.8 volts so when we turn on it is automatically set to the highest setting it popped on is red you are going to if you want to change your temperature when it's on you click it three times so you click it three times rapidly you see it just shot over to green green is the lowest temperature set then if you want to change it again to go to blue which is the middle setting three times you see it turns blue very clearly illuminated and then that would be a three point eight now a lot of 510 thread cartridges as you know the oils are thicker and sometimes they get kind of coagulated and solidify towards the bottom of a cartridge so a lot of batteries of more modern batteries like our phantom and our minimax pros they'll have a preheat function so the preheat function means that when you activate that function it gives you about ten seconds worth the current through your cartridge at a very low voltage usually we like to set our pre heats at around 2.5 volts to two point eight volts within our batteries and it will send that current through there through for about 10 seconds not to vaporize but just to get get get heated up break up the coagulation so you don't taste coil or you don't don't pull a dry hit out of there and you know if you dry fire the tanks if it's really coagulated you can shorten the life of your tank so the preheat functions come a lot handy now how do you access the preheat in our battery well when the unit is on and then you push it once you see that some all you do is you push the button twice rapidly and then you see it will show you a solid light that comes on right there and that will last for 10 seconds if you want to exit at any time you're like oh I can see that my oil my oil broke up or okay maybe it's maybe it's cooking now at any given point you can push the button one time during preheat and exit out of the preheat function mode so that basically summarizes the the technical specs this battery and really how you would use it and this battery like we said because the connectors that we put in there and the voltage range we really built this stick battery to work with most 510 thread Carter's you're not going to have any non-compact compatibility issues when you buy those prefilled cartridges or when you're buying the tanks off of our honey stick website to fill so let's just do a real nice close up of this kit just so we can really show you the details in this hand-painted super car colored battery so let's just jump right in and do close up like I said before I think this is the sexiest battery that we have produced to date in terms of color and appeal and it really should catch the market by storm this is really done right I mean when I posted this picture on Instagram instantly my friends and family were we're texting me that they wanted one for their collection so I have a few this is really gonna gonna do very very well and really appeal to set apart our honey stick from standard stick batteries that are offered and just playing colors really is a beautiful piece let's get a look at that spring pin connection so you could see the colors kind of changing as the light hits them differently it is just chameleon done right alright guys so if you like this be master battery and want to

one of the most commonly frequently asked questions that I get personally and the rest of my service staff get is how do I choose my perfect oil pen and based on the successes of our other videos about how to pick your perfect concentrate and dab pen and also how to pick your perfect concealer well we really worked hard on this week was trying to put together a comprehensive checklist and run through our units to see how you can pick out your perfect oil pen so what our team did we put these factors together and then I did a job job of going out into our warehouse and assembling all of the various units that we have as options for oil pens that we felt viable and we're gonna run through them all based on our eight criteria that I've outlined so let's jump into my criteria I outline and I'm gonna rely on the audience of course to drop into the comments if there's a criteria that I forgot so people who are tuned into the video following along watching the comments can really still see and make the best informed decision that's what our videos are about is really presenting our products and just helping you guys to make a better purchasing decision or to just get a little more education awareness so let's jump into my eight factors my first factor when choosing an oil pen I think is based on the availability based on your state now oils are not necessarily accessible everywhere so it might not even be an option for you but in the event that it is some states they're only have it seemed to be available already prefilled into 510 threaded cartridges or they could be placed into so Changez already pre Lord or they can only be available in tincture bottles so based on what kind type of oils you have access to or what type of texture oils you have access to could really be a determining factor of when you when you're trying to select your perfect oil pen the next factor for you is to keep in mind and I think it's a second probably the most pressing factor is budget I know there's a lot of eight ballers out there who price is not a thing but a lot of medical patients and people who are on let's say disability or things like that that are using cannabis for medicinal purposes budget is a very important thing to them so we can't just go crazy on the price spectrum and we should definitely keep a price as a major factor when choosing a vaporizer as an option the next factor that I think is the most important is how stealthy the unit is so stealthiness can play play a factor in a few ways whether you have it on the go and you want to be discreet whether you just want to be small and compact or whether you are really taking your vaporizer places that you shouldn't and you just don't want to get caught or you want it to go incognito which is perfectly cool but that definitely plays a factor when you are choosing your perfect vape pen I think the next next factor number four is the ease of use is how easy is the oil pen to use and really what is your vape level I have a lot of people who have never turned on a vaporizer before who contact us and we have people who call in to educate us on our own vaporizers on how the best way is to use them so there's different places where you can fall in your vape knowledge spectrum and those will definitely have an impact on your buying decision when you are selecting your pur Victor oil pen is how easy is the vaporizer to use where's my current vape skillset or how am I willing to learn now we do try to make educational videos so that you know even if you do pick up one of the more more expert level vaporizers you know you watch our videos will walk you through how to get it up and running and really be able to use it next I think is battery life you know that comes into play when for me personally like when I'm buying a phone because I cannot stay connected to a charger you know certain people have certain lifestyles they take them on that or they can't get to a charger it takes a they want to be able to have a few days charge on it or they're going on a hiking expeditions is something we've gotten to where they want to make sure they can go about a week without having a charger so the battery life really does play into when you're making a decision of how long and how much you can use it in between charges I think that's important factor when choosing an oil pen next I think it is mobility is can you take it around or is it just gonna be something that kind of stays at home because generally you can get more power and performance out of units that are larger and you can get more kind of back to our other point of of being convenient and easy to use or stealthy out of smaller units so I think that really the mobility factor does play into it as to how and where you plan to take the vaporizer can you drop it in your pocket do you put in your backpack can you just you know throw it on a lanyard or keychain and call it a day next I think it comes down to the next factor really we're going into the nitty-gritty here is the power how much power puts out how intense it is I think that makes a big big determining factor to people because some people really thrive to get an intensity and powerful vaporizer that hits hard and to some people that's believe it or not that that can also be a turn-off to her they want a vaporizer to be very smooth and and and not you know be have any type of traits that to some people could lead off as harsh and I think in the last one is flavor everybody loves to taste good flavor when you're buying spending a lot of money buying concentrates or CBDs or whatever it is that you're buying a nateing sure surrender prefilled cartridge everybody wants to taste what they're getting fact is they're not they're not cheap and people want to get a unique and flavorful experience so where they rank on a flavorful level is also very important when choosing a royal pen so now that we've gone through all the factors and again if I miss something a really thought hard to try not to but if we did make sure to drop in the comments below so people can can see exactly what what other factors they should consider is let's jump right into our different assortment of oil vaporizers and start basically ranking them so you guys have a good knowledge and awareness of where these would rank first off we're a gold or honey stick oil disposable pen now I grab this has had some prefilled CBD in it some a gold lined CBD from our warehouse this pen ships empty so in terms of what you have available whether you if you don't have tinctures or syringes available this is not a 5-10 thread cartridge so you cannot unscrew this cartridge and screw your own cartridge in there so if in your state you only have prefilled cartridges this pen might not be for you however if you have tinctures and syringes available in your state you can definitely use this pen in terms of budget wise this pen is very cost effective because it is a disposable it's not recharged I think it's on our website for $15 so it's very convenient however on the same budget side it's not that economical because once you run through the tanks you would have to buy a new one and once you've ran through two three four of these you could have bought a rechargeable pen and price saved a little money in the wrong long run but if you're traveling or you live that certain lifestyle to where you don't want to take care of a pen maintain a pen you just want it to go through the tank or the the tincture or the syringe then this pen does definitely become convenient in terms of stealthy it's not stealthy in the sense of hiding the pan or the cartridge but it is stealthy in the sense that it looks similar to a lot of illiquid units and it can be disguise' belit is relatively small I mean it's basically about four and a half maybe five inches in length you can easily fit it into your pocket each one comes with a plastic tube and we did do a full review on this oil disposable pen it's actually very easy to use you just unscrew the top to fill it and we do have a step-by-step on there and there's no buttons to push no locking mechanisms you just inhale in terms of battery life this battery is good to run through the tank I tell people it is you should only really rely on it to run through the tank once even if the battery is not completely dead you don't want to get caught refilling the tank and then having to try to siphon or salvage oil out of a disposable pen because then you do have wastage and it is expensive so these they generally say are good for 200 puffs or one tank which if you look at the number of puffs on a half a mil which is the capacity of this tank it's between 150 and 200 puffs so that's what the battery life is mobility this thing is very mobile very convenient for traveling running around it's small it is extreme lightweight.you basically you could have a real lanyard and not even feel that it's here in terms of power that this unit doesn't have a high output this is more focused on smoothness and flavor it is auto draw and in general and again I say this is in general push-button units tend to hit harder than auto draw units simply because you're not using the power of your actual draw to activate the unit so this is a very flavorful a ceramic heating core and it it is not super intense it is more of a very smooth rolling and flavorful hits so that's where our disposable oil pan ranks one really select your perfect oil pan it is convenience oriented it is lightweight mobile flavorful but isn't going to deliver those those hard hits it's not rechargeable and it will not work with 510 threaded cartridges so let's move right along to one step up now this is not a unit that we have on our website however a lot of you guys have seen these these are the stylist standard disposable units this one we make exclusively for one of our distributors it's called the honey stick bee buzzin it is a stylus battery that comes with a high quality classic plastic wick cartridge what's cool about this stylus pen is it's basically the next step up from just plain disposable a lot of people do view these pens as disposable even though it is rechargeable in terms of availability this no matter what type of oils you have available whether it's prefilled cartridges or whether it's tinctures or syringes you can if you buy this kit you're able to use it because it does have a 5-10 thread battery that cartridges can screw on to however these auto draw batteries are not the modernized drawers like in the elf so if you're a cartridge is a high-capacity ceramic cartridge or a really wide cartridge battery could be a little underpowered in terms of budget price these pens retail for about twenty to twenty-five dollars they are their simple easy to use there's a very budget kit it's a very budget starter kit it is auto draw you know and with this carry case on our next level it is pretty stealthy because you just have in this little wallet case slip it into your pocket and you're not gonna hear or say anything about but once you have the the actual cartridge and the battery screwed on you know that that stealthiness kind of does go away now this cartridge is very similar to the cartridge that we have stock in our beekeeper unit and we have a detailed video on how to to fill this unit how to fill this year and up and it is actually very easy to fill up and to function there's no buttons there's no clicking there is no unlocking you just simply fill up the cartridge screw it onto the battery and your ready to vape it is an auto draws very easy to use battery life battery life for a rechargeable unit it probably does fall on the lowest end of the spectrum of our comparison it is basically about the same battery life if not less than our disposable unit so this thing it is you are gonna need to charge it more if you're on the go when it is charged up it's definitely gonna give you some good hits you're gonna run good with it but it is it is really the entry-level unit if you're just getting into vaping don't know of vaping z' for you you want to pick up a nice cost-effective kit that is gonna be easy for you to get started with just to see if you like vaping but it's not you know gonna be your daily driver or your long hauler mobility with the carrying case and even without it's a very lightweight it is a mobile we unit so you're gonna be able to run around with it you know it's it's a very small compact it is a little bit taller than our previous unit by about an inch with the cartridge on there and power this is an auto draw unit and it does have a more basic cartridge which has a wick so in terms of power they're not going to be that powerful when you when you draw you're not gonna get monster clouds because first of all it's not push-button second of all is because it's more of a traditional cartridge however it is very reliable of a unit now in terms of flavor again these kits were not knocking them at all we do make them they're very entry level in terms of flavor I don't think that you will get blown away you would have to switch it out to a different cartridge if you have very high quality extracts then I would probably consider upgrading the cartridge or stepping into a different level of a kit but very basic very good way to get started very easy to use lightweight a starter kit on that end all right next up our upgrade from our disposable pen we have our Gold Line vape battery okay which is a push-button variable temperature battery we did a very thorough review of this and it is actually paired up with our cloud tank here what's cool about this batteries it's 510 thread it works with all 510 thread batteries and also if you purchase this cartridge you can definitely take advantage of tinctures and syringes so in terms of what's available in your state if you buy one of these you're basically covered on all your ends in terms of budget this tank goes for I think $12 on our website and the the battery is $20 so it's actually your under $35 for this starter kit the way that it is and for that price you are getting a lot of bang for the buck because you are getting a very good battery it has three different temperatures it has preheat mode you know also chargeable very good we did a full detailed review of this pen if you want to see the features and specs it is actually very easy to use however because it's push-button it adds you know one level over the auto draw units that we just discussed here so you would definitely have to have some very basic vape knowledge but again this knowledge is very basic nothing to get freaked out about battery life this unit has a high-capacity battery it has a 650 mah battery so it is actually a very high capacity battery for a little vaporizer which is actually more than twice the the capacity of this so if you're looking for something more on-the-go and something that is definitely going to go to need less charges this is is a better unit option for that in terms of mobility it is a little bit long but it's still relatively light can still fit into your pocket still very transportable light enough to hold on a lanyard but it is a little bit long in terms of mobility in terms of power it has three intensity settings so you can hone in on what power you feel comfortable with so if you're not sure what you're gonna like it's definitely a good idea to have something that has variable temperatures and on the most intense setting a lot of our customers even have commented on the YouTube channels of of this pen that it hits really solid so for a small pen it definitely delivers the power if you pair this with not somebody else's prefilled tank you're filling your own you pair it with our cloud tank with a ceramic heater you're definitely gonna get good flavor so I really think that where does this pen rank in terms of an oil pen I think if you're looking for a beginner pen on a budget you cannot go wrong with this pen and it is a deftly a solid choice and the first step to get into the big leagues now let's move on to our most popular vaporizer that's being sold as the honey stick beekeeper it is a concealer so it is it's also been ranked by a lot of people as one of the best oil pens and the cartridge it comes with is a thick oil similar to the disposable very basic because most people do utilize 510 threaded cartridges it works on magnet adapter we have a very detailed video about this this this unit so because it does come with a tank you can use it for basically everything from tinctures to syringes and also 510 thread tanks that you could screw the magnet adapter on so no matter what your state has going on if you pick up a beekeeper more than likely you're gonna be able to take advantage of that it's pretty cost effective unit its selling on our website for 39.99 so it really isn't a big high-dollar unit and it delivers a lot stealthiness the concealer unit because it keeps the cartridge concealed it is actually very small as you can see here it definitely ranks very high on the stealth factor nobody really knows what's going on on top of it all it's a matte black looking like a stealth bomber I think it ranks very high in that level ease of use there's no variable temperatures there's one small button that's push button five clicks on five clicks off push and hold while you inhale super easy to use you can see our detailed video on that battery life this unit also has a high capacity battery which is just about twice the capacity of of these standard batteries so you're definitely going to be able to take this on the go more and get more out of it mobility I don't think you have a much more mobile unit to carry around it'll fit into your little jean pocket wherever slide into a little bitty groove into the purse it's not much bigger than a little thing of lipstick so in terms of power the beekeeper definitely does deliver power it doesn't have variable intensity sync so if you don't like a larger volume inhale you know you can't adjust it down real so it has a good power spectrum that delivers nice power if you're looking for flavor I really highly recommend you buy the high-performance beekeeper cartridge which has a wickless ceramic heater in it and it definitely brings out a lot more flavor notes and smoothens it out if you're filling your own cartridge and if you put your Magna dap tour on there it just drops in it even has a very cool stainless steel tip alright so now we're moving right along to our elf unit we just got done going over the beekeeper so the elf has basically a lot of the same characteristics in the sense that it's a very small actually a little bit smaller than the beekeeper concealer that works well with but that's a magnetic that works well with prefilled cartridges tinctures as well as fills a notable differences is the elf already comes with high performance good tasting ceramic cartridge so you can get a little bit more performance out of the stock elf cartridge it's glass then the stock beekeeper cartridge that that one comes with however a notable difference is they have the same battery capacity but this one is actually easier to use because it is buttonless so you don't have to unlock anything it is an auto draw unit now even though a lot of times Auto draw units are less powerful a lot of people have set the elf is actually a very powerful auto draw unit because the sensitivity of the sensor when you start drawing so you're still gonna get good power you're gonna get better flavor the unit is actually very stealthy it's a little bit easier to use if you're just getting started you don't like pushing small buttons a lot of people say they're medical medical condition doesn't let them to to push small buttons so it's very easy to draw the unit is very mobile has good power and because the high performance cartridge you do to a little bit of extra flavor out of it so this is also another good concealer now if you looked at the if you determine that hey I need a concealer based off of you know the characteristics that we went through our eight important factors but you want something that has a little bit more or has a little bit more battery power your next step up is our phantom unit which our phantom unit is basically a concealer as you could see it's very similar in size it's a little bit bigger but the reason it's a little bit bigger is it has two and a half times the battery capacity of the elf and the phantom so you're gonna go a lot more between charges it's also squeeze action so it's you're not pushing any small buttons however were the key differences is that it has four different temperature settings so you can really tune in on that power and flavor level that you want it comes with a high performance cartridge and what's cool is it also comes with I don't have it here on the table actually I do it even comes with a wax adapter cartridge so if the availability of prefilled cartridges oils that you can fill aren't there but waxes are you have the wax adapter as well so it really allows you to be very very versatile when you're using the phantom it's a very cool looking unit feels very good extremely stealthy because you can't see the cartridge still small but it does have more power more capacity and it has a four available temperature settings on here again we have a couple very in-depth videos about this year on the channel so if you're a going concealer this is probably where you're gonna be however it does cost more it is our most expensive concealer that we have over here which on our website think it's about 129 on here but really solid unit just you can feel the quality so if you're not sure if you want something like a stick a battery or concealer and you want something in between and you're really trying to get the vaporizer into places a vaporizer shouldn't be we have our minimax Pro which is a switchblade action key fob battery which will does not come with a cartridge the elf phantom and the beekeeper all come with their cartridges so if your state or your availability doesn't have 510 thread cartridges you will need to buy a cartridge to pair this with in order to get it functioning it is not that expensive of a unit it retails on our website for $40 it is pretty easy to use it does have three temperature settings but it only has one button here that you push so you'd have to unlock it and relock it and cycle through the temperatures through here what is cool about it is that it does have a pretty high capacity battery it has a 650 million power battery so it does actually have more capacity than the elf and the beekeepers so it falls kind of right in between these two units in terms of battery life the thing about it is though is it is extremely stealthy because it was designed like a car key it even fits on your keyring so it's extremely mobile so you can see the cartridge hides over here and you push the button and it flips open so you keep it completely hidden this is where the key would be I mean this thing is gonna fly under the radar basically wherever you have it as long as you pair it with your wallet or have it on your keychain because the three power levels that it has you can wind up the intense and you can get some really good power rips out and I know some people posted reviews on our in-depth video about this product and they said that on the third power level they will have able to get some really good strong power and depending on what cartridge you pair it with if you have it paired with like a cloud tank like our cloud tank on our website that has a good smooth ceramic flow your also get some really good flavor notes out of it so this little unit if you're really stealthiness is super important to you but you still want to have some good features in there and stay keep a pen that's you know under $50 pad your you're looking pretty good with the minimax Pro for your oil needs so we just went over all these regular oil and cartridge devices now I want to take take the next step to jump into a new level of vaporizer which is our sub ohm I have a video that really goes into sub ohm and oil vaping and I really truly do believe it as a future trend a lot of customers do ask me hey what if I just buy the most expensive pen is it the best pen or not well the short answer is generally the most expensive pens are better and more performance but it still might not fit your personal 8 characteristics that we went through as good as some of the other pens but the sub ohms are our favorite they're one of our fastest growing areas and honey stick is really one of the best innovators in this area so let's start off if you like the concealer but you want a sub ohm we have our old unit the Ripper which we actually have the new one here's the shell of it I don't have a finished unit because they are gonna be delivered this week so just a couple more days guys I know a lot of people put in their pre-orders and the new version is actually gonna look just like this really cool shell and it's gonna be a two in one it's actually gonna have a wax adapter as well but the Ripper is your sub ohm concealer so now just really really quickly what a sub ohm unit does is it just brings really low resistance really high power and intensity and what I would say is much greater flavour notes to oils and I put up a video about sub ohm oil vaping and we've reviewed a lot of our sub ohm devices now the Ripper is your sub ohm concealer it does not work with 510 thread cartridges so if you only have 510 thread cartridges in your state this is probably not a vaporizers that you're gonna pick up because you either need tinctures or syringes but it is actually disguised to look as a lighter you flip it open you have your button you know it has it has a telescopic mouthpiece that comes out here and we will have a full review of a ripper when it's in stock it only has one temperature setting which is in tense however this unit is extremely stealthy a lot of people have confused it as a lighter it's very easy to use because it doesn't have any digital settings it's not variable temperature it's just a 5 click lock and because the lock is covered you don't even really have to keep it locked the the cartridges just pop in and out which you do have to fill because they are subohm they just pop in and the top screws on it's a very simple extremely durable mechanism it does have an ultra high-capacity battery which actually has about 20% more capacity than even our phantom so very high-capacity battery it's extremely mobile extremely durable very tough unit and on the power scale it is off the charts in terms of intensity you can YouTube some videos of people using this device in terms of flavor I feel it has better flavor than most cartridges however when we get down into our digital mods and tanks you can really fine-tune the flavor so I think in subohm in the sub own category it has better flavor than a lot of standard units however because of all the power and because you can't really fine-tune it in it's definitely higher on the power and intensity spectrum that is on the flavor spectrum for sub ohm so that's our Ripper check out the full review on that one so moving into the sub ohms we really have two units that a lot of people often compare and contrast we have our our Cannabis Cup winning sub ohm original kit which a lot of people on the YouTube channel refer to as the OG cannabis cup kit really like that name possible name change there and our newest sub ohm Sport kit now both of them have very high capacity batteries both of them have really awesome tanks both of them are in terms of budget wise they're definitely on the higher end of the spectrum there there both under $200 the subohm sport is 169 and the sub-ohm original kit is right around that $200 mark so these aren't your regular budget kits these are your luxury kits but they definitely perform now in terms of availability of what you have available if you have 510 thread cartridges available you're not going to be will unscrew this tank and use a 5-10 thread cartridge on this battery without an ego adapter on our sub ohm og kit you do have an ego adapter that you unscrew right here you just flip this over put it back onto your battery and you're able to use 510 thread cartridges you can fill these with syringes or tinctures I would probably not consider these as stealthy as versatile and versatile even though they do fit into the pocket they are heavier I mean that's a good in terms of a quality standpoint but they do have a little bit of half so in terms of mobility and you know stealthiness you don't really get away with that the subohm sport is slightly stealthier than the OG kit because it has a window covering around the glass so you don't really see what's in there it also offers a little bit more protection now the battery life these things are both ultra high capacity they're way over the 1500 mAh as well so you get a lot of capacity of these you charge these things up a lot of people go days without getting a charge even without having to recharge it even our very heavy daily users both these units you can dial up the power big-time this one goes up to 36 watts which is more than what you will need this one actually goes all the way up to 60 watts which is definitely way more than you're ever really gonna need which which can just really you know melt the whole power spectrum in terms of hits now in terms of flavor they're going to be a little bit different you can use a blender option on here which uses a solid block ceramic heater and then this one uses a ceramic and Kanthal heater in here which has different bottom draw and orifice holes a lot of people say that this kid is really easy to get started with but basically you start off with this kit and then you graduate into kind of this tank with the the taste delivery and the power and how you're actually able to use as a blender and put solid concentrates into there so power these kits are both way up in the spectrum flavor I would say they're both up there and the very high rankings of flavor but once you you know really want to fine-tune your experience there's nothing really like the og cannabis cup kit that's what the judges and socal thought and really that's what a lot of our audience things but these kids are really closely matched now the only other thing that I can say to add to these two that's going to decrease your mobility but increase the power and flavor you're gonna be all have on tap is adding our bumblebee bubbler we did a full review and demo on this with honey girl or another one of our videos is you can pair it with our sub ohm devices and it can because you'll run it through water you can really crank up the power and really smooth out even more flavor to take your vaping experiences to all new levels however what's this gonna do to your oil pen definitely gonna increase you know it's gonna sorry decrease your mobility it's definitely gonna decrease any stealthiness that you had it's gonna increase the power I would say it will definitely increase the flavor notes as well it's gonna tack on another about 20 to 30 bucks to your budget cuz you're watching this video so you're gonna wait for the discount code at the end and it's also what's cool about those availability wise you can actually pair this thing with 510 thread cartridges to still put them on so this is still compatible with 510 thread cartridges so that's the bubbler lastly the only other way that you can improve your oil vaping experience is by having a battery like our speed barrier it has a lot of features but you have to be a really an expert vape level to really use this battery you can set the Watts in just fine but there's features and temperature controls and how you want your power to come on that you're not gonna get in standard batteries it really takes a step above even these two batteries and it has twice the capacity and power availability of both these batteries so you know you can also get one of these batteries to pair with your oil tanks however this battery is too powerful for a lot of little oil tanks so it's not gonna be fully compatible there alright so just to summarize guys thank you so much for tuning in I hope that walking through our old oil devices and showing you guys how we rank them in terms of what's available to you your budget your stealthiness your ease of use

look at both AVD platforms compatible from Blue River solvent less cartridges the AVD 510 seat is designed to use a non direct magnetic connection to the heating source with a switch for low temp settings that oscillates between a range of two point over two point four volts you'll never burn the oil off producing a clean smooth flavorful cloud the 510 C provides the best-in-class farmer table canvas baking experience the screw on magnetic attachment can be adjusted to increase air flow to the holes in the bottom of the cart by turning the cart kind of clockwise while to magnetically secure it into the battery engineered exclusively for canvas oils and designed to retain cannabis terpene profile the battery also features an intuitive haptic feedback once the draws been initiated free of use of any complicated buttons here's a few helpful tips to enjoy the most out of your ABDC battery charge a scene for at least one to two hours before use pull slow steady long draws for about three to 10 seconds and do not leave inside a hot car in contrast to the scene AVD has now released the stick built with standard 510 threading the slim draw activated battery is compatible with lieu reverse Ovilus for fine hashbrowns and sauces as well as ultrafine jelly sauce cartridges although it does not feature happy feedback the AVD stick does contain a variable temperature setting switch however we'd like to highly encourage you to only use the low temperature setting thanks for taking the time to watch this short review and we hope that you enjoy the best of your bloomer cartridge with either a media battery see you next time [Music] you [Music]", "O-oShgS1Xy4": "hey what's going on guys welcome to deaf connection in this review I got the vessel batteries so the vessel battery is intended to use four cartridges only and primarily only four cartridges and honestly I love this battery beckham this is out of all the pens i've ever tried an experience this is honestly my favorite one this one is the smoothest the cleanest and um i can't find any con about it other than its price it is pricey compared to a lot of other batteries like cecil or like she saw Siler she saw palm and all that but and some of them even cost ten bucks but this one's really worth it you really do get what you're worth when you buy the vessel battery so there you let me tell you all the features this pen really is a is a really sleek pen and it really is that smooth and simple to use it's just three different modes um the lowest one being like being 2.8 volts right here and that's another thing too it's pretty cool do you need it's unique in the colors that it has I thought that was pretty nice but the last mode is a 3 point 6 volts I believe yeah pretty sure that's right at 3.6 so it's not as powerful as other pens as well but another thing is the batteries really efficient it lasted me a couple of days and it charges fairly fast charges it wasn't like one two three hours that will last me anywhere he's pursuing like I smoked consistently so I do it does last meeting between 2 to 2 to 4 maybe even 5 6 days so I think that was pretty awesome now with the battery with the battery itself like what I said honestly there really isn't a whole lot to it other than it's a sleekness how the feel of it this one this one's really nice actually I love this one will op up the only thing to the battery is um right here oh and there's another feature that I love about it it's the air flow this is what makes it amazing you see all this right here this thing you can actually take off but the purpose of that is for airflow is for to optimize and enhance their flow the taste and all that and it really does difference there are some carts so you could see in the post off if you read further below but there are actually some quests that don't even fit this but that's what the person is for so you could just take it off if the car is too why you're just too big to fit that's another cool thing you know something other this very has that you could take off is the bottom part but first I had no idea where to what to do with it but it was a little confused at first um but I didn't realize didn't tell you about more about it that the bottom part is actually for the purpose if you were to drop it because I've dropped my vessel battery a couple of times and it's actually I know what nothing came off no paint came off not really like major scratches anything at all but this pen can withstand like impact if you drop it or something like that so that's pretty cool it's this thing but this battery falls and like bends or something like that right here this will be the first of that just to take it off this is where you charge it really simply just connect it's a magnetic charge port but yeah that is a that's a that's pretty much all there is to it yep I forgot to mention so I what I said this is um this pen is really for carts only and um it fits any sort of 510 thread and another cool thing is these are actually meant for it it's enhanced Cecil cartridge it's so see so these Cecil cartridges are better cause supposedly for Cecil silo and Cecil palm battery but we personally believe it the vessel better hits a lot better than the Cecil batteries itself so that's another really cool feature and it looks just like if it's really smoothly guys it's like that thing too is pretty much as convenience and it's sleekness its discreteness and how it hits uh how it just enhances every hit it really you really get the taste of every single hit with the vessel battery I know I'm hated I'm gonna smoking right guys just see how you can see how its Cheers all right smoke isn't fairly thick it's kind of thin but it's still it's still kind of rip so doesn't rip as much as I'd like it to but it's pretty much it's pretty much all deficient semen so it does less like what I said it just lasts a long time in every hit you really do it it really just tastes a lot better like actually with this cartridge itself to some of the carts I tried it with my other batteries um I tried it with the G pen and stuff like that and it was the only actually really harsh this actually gives this really smooth hit so that's another really cool thing so that's the that is a vessel better you guys if um another thing is I forgot to tell you the price yet it is worth a hundred bucks so I mean it honestly like what I said you usually do get what you what you pay for this thing is really worth it if you've got smoke cartridges a lot and consistently if you're more of a wax kind of person or just like prefer smoking and smoking weed or anything like that then yet I wouldn't recommend this pen but I do recommend is battery for everyone who small carts on a consistent basis so that's the vessel battery um if you guys have any questions or comments and experience with it posted them post them down below and I'll see you guys soon peace out guys", "cn-lVKfV14A": "[Music] [Music] no where's my relationship with Jo Serena's back guided with another review and today I got something I am really excited about guys I've been waiting on this package I

able to you know you know use them a couple times they don't have the wick so it doesn't burn out it comes with a charger looks like it's a microUSB okay and m9 it I guess it's compatible with the five 510 thread bait press press button five times to set to enter standby mode the green so it's like five times to turn on the thing and then also I think is this is pretty much the basic one where like you press three times to switch from different temperatures and also has a believe a preheat mode so that as you could look at that real quick there goes so yeah I could pause that IP I want to read that you see this is check out the back of it if you want to pause that and read that you know this is also you have to come with a lot of good stuff whatever later I don't know the exact price on this app I leave it in the description of how much this costs sorry soon back in in a second guys but I'm super excited to try this out I'm definite try the nicotine patch we are you can see like this is the site for the for the compatible pods and it has a good it has a good weight to it whatever like I belong to the battery is 400 415 man app yeah so it's an hour and a half charging time voltage is 3 volts to 3.4 23.8 it's made with the zinc alloy fireproof total packaging notice over here so the website you want to check that out I'll even in the link down below but it's a relax relax oh sigcomm come on even your Instagram and that website so you have to check them out like I've been I really like I look at this a couple times and I was really a big fan of these weather like out of all the different pens and car I mean while the different like styles of baits I believe this is the best one and I like those I like the Pens but like when the Pens they're like living on whatever so like it breaks your pocket or with the other ones that are the really big ones whatever they just like their oversized look this one that's a smaller battery that's only that's one downside to it but like it's it's it's very convenient whatever the size and then the double-sided is nicotine and smoke you know CBD or THC I'm the other side I also believe you could put a lanyard on here and click wear it around your neck or as a keychain like this is this is a revolutionary new to me I really enjoy when I saw this product and I'm like for the company to you know give me a you know one to try out and to review I appreciate you guys super-excited my I can't wait to try to sell you know it like enough talking let's get right into it is a shelter that company I appreciate up well then we try this now we're gonna look at the pod right here let's see this is the episode comes before and these are the mango good I'm not gonna lie even exaggerating right I that's just smells good like as soon as I like popped it open like you see this get like the mango I'm sure if I wanna make sure I got this the right way okay so I'm gonna turn this on Lincoln green but now it's on green I think I want I put it on the blue which is like the medium setting yeah so let me try the stuff I'm hopefully I have this correctly say okay this card is passing by that conforms like I said with it we'll just try this house i'ma go a little higher let me see that good um you see if I turn this around see if it makes a difference so I guess it doesn't matter which side you have it on be good it's double sided put it either way now let me try that hmm you could taste it um definitely that's a good flavor very smooth it's not harsh like those um well I stood there something eliquid okay I can't blame the debate because I have a mod that I you know the ones refillable with a big tank and everything and there's some times where it's all like bump it's like crackling and it's or it's leaking or like as a lot of like it has a lot of maintenance whatever and they're very expensive with this one I believe it's very it's very affordable and yeah you can still get the flavor rather than I believe some nicotine isn't was more that's a better liquid than the even it was that they so to me personally and I also have heard heard that a lot too yeah that's a very tasty tasty mango lunch and I'm super happy about this guys like this is awesome I've been waiting on this to come in but I said it came from China so it takes a little bit of time to come in right now okay so this is like I tried the mango now I'm gonna try an actual much higher half gram card of some kind or CBD kind of Express CBD that I got so as soon as you plug in the light turns on says like you know in it it signifies that it shows that it could tell me something need to plugged in so I believe that you're only supposed to have one at a time you can't have both because I don't know if they won't

[Music] you [Music]", "Yqny6qnTim8": "Hey guys! My name is Lili @justalil.nerd and today I'm\ngoing to be reviewing this vape pen by OHM vaporizers. First off, just gonna start by saying: I love\nthis pen. It is really sturdy feeling, really quality\nfeeling. But where the real magic comes in is: how\namazing these clouds and the flavour is of the entire thing. So, check this out. One little hit, great clouds. These vape pens taste amazing. I've been all around America, in Colorado,\nCalifornia, Seattle trying all kinds of different vape pens and this is the first one that I've\ntried in Canada that can hold the candle to any of those markets. I've always been a fan of OHM vape pens but\nthis battery is their new one and it has all kinds of fancy settings for variable voltage...\noops it was upside down! Variable voltage and wattage. It also shows you the battery life of the\nvape pen, and you can change the heat settings. So, if you are looking for something a little\nless intense, you can turn it down... hit it and then just turn it to the next one. Another great thing about this pen that I\npersonally really love is the pass-through capability. You can see here at the bottom, that's where\nyou plug it in. That means that you can actually charge this\npen while you are vaping. Which is a really, rare thing in vape pens\nfor some reason and you are definitely gonna get one with the pass-through capability. Cause sometimes your pen is dead and you wanna\nvape but you don't wanna wait so... The other amazing thing I love about this\npen and all of the other OHM vape pens is the quality. Not only the quality of the cartridge and\nthe flavour but generally the battery. This is a battery that I feel confident I\ncan throw it in my purse. I can bring it around in my pocket. I can lug it around and is just really solid. It's got a really nice metal finish, makes\nme feel like I'm not gonna break it if I drop it. To be honest, I have already dropped it a\ncouple of times and it is still working great! Definitely keep an eye on this vape pen. Pick one up for yourself. It is the best way to consume cannabis, in\nmy opinion, in Canada. Cheers!", "0V9NRRk0FQA": "hi I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we're going to be talking about the fastest booming trend which is concealer vaporizers for cartridges so let's say you're on the market for a new concealer first of all I hope you stop by vape honey stay calm to check out our selection because this is something we've really been working on and making sure that we innovate but you're on the market you want to know what the differences are what the categories are and certain things that you can go through or buy to make sure that you made the right decision for the cartridges that you like to purchase so today we're going to take an in-depth tour and talk about the differences between our concealers to make sure that when you buy you buy the perfect concealer okay so there's two general categories to these concealers you have ones that have the cartridge exposed and ones that have the cartridge is completely hidden okay these are kind of a way that we like to separate the vaporizers and then there's differences in between them as well so let's start off with the ones that keep the cartridges concealed so you cannot see them now most of them that on the mark and all of ours are powered by magnet adapters so you can simply pull the cartridge out and you have a magnet adapter now why would somebody want a concealer like this well first of all it looks cool second of all it keeps your cartridge completely hidden for discretion and it also protects it from anything hitting it or possibly breaking it and they fit and sit up right in the pockets they're very very sleek in size so that they will easily fit into you know the small pockets for women's purses and the small pockets you know the upper pockets on your jeans like so it stays completely head so first thing for people is size I want to show you guys this is our beekeeper model this is our latest elf model and this is our phantom model so everybody knows what a sip we're not promoting combustion here guys we are vape company but just to show you how size pairs up everybody knows what a standard sized Bic lighter with the size is so to take our beekeeper for example they're actually very close in terms of width as well as height for the body now we move on to our elf and then last our phantom so let's start off with our first model the beekeeper the beekeeper is a very good unit it was actually our first model that we launched in this concealer category and it has been our historical best seller it comes with a magnet adapter simply drop in the cartridges and it actually has a push button operation so you would push and hold this button throughout the time that you inhale and you also click it five times on five times off this unit produces about 20 watts of power and it also has a a 300 milli amp hour battery so it's gonna last longer than the standard batteries and it's also give you more consistent power it has a micro USB charge also that you can just plug right into the side port right there and then when you get a new cartridge you can just take the Magna DAP tur which if you lose it try not to lose it you can purchase more online you just screw it onto your cartridge and you drop it in so then once you hear a click and your unit is on your rate of vape so well we get from a lot of people is that there's a variety of cartridges that are on the market and some of them are wider than others so some people are concerned to order a concealer unit before you know when they have their cartridge to make sure it's gonna fit so what we're gonna do here is we're going to measure the openings so that you know how wide our concealers are before you make the order so let's start off with the opening of beaky so in millimeters this is exactly a 10 millimeter opening so if your cartridges are wider than 10 millimeters in diameter they will be too wide to use for the beekeeper now let's move on to the elf we just launched this unit a couple weeks ago it's something that we're really excited about it's available in five colors give you a brief little look the only one missing from our display is the white one which we do have available what makes itself unique is that it's not only a little bit smaller than the beekeeper it has a little bit more capacity so it has 350 milliamp hours so the battery's gonna last a hair longer it has a really nice texture to it I would compare it to if anybody has ever had a like an iPod Nano it has this very um the this this kind of grippy thick metal you just feel the quality when it's in your hand you know completely solid unit what makes it unique is that it is completely buttonless so it's Auto draw so people who really you know have been holding on to those pull through batteries this is the evolution the next step and the way that the technology is is you are just gonna get effortless draws on this vaporizer it is gonna be much smoother much more powerful and it's gonna fit a larger variety of cartridges that those auto draw batteries cannot fire now the kick comes already with a glass really high performance ceramic cartridge with a ceramic mouthpiece so if you are not buying prefilled tanks and actually filling them then this is like an awesome tank to get started with and all you do to get this thing fired up is its there's no clicking anything you just put your Magna adapter onto your cartridge drop it in and inhale and you will see it light up very smooth very good unit charge with a microUSB and again it's a little bit smaller which brings us to our ultra premium unit which is the Phantom the Phantom is not only for cartridges it actually comes with a wax concentrates adapter which is dual quartz it is our largest unit in terms of size comparison but it also has a thousand milliamp hour batteries so it's gonna laugh last about two and a half times what all the other concealers do now one unique function that this unit has is when you flip it open it has a squeeze action trigger so you just squeeze it to inhale and it also has four different temperatures that allows you to dial in to what intensity and flavor you really prefer and it ranges from 3.4 all the way to 4 volts it has a advanced preheat function and the unit also comes with two magnets a longer one as well as a shorter one so all different sizes of cartridges you can have the perfect magnet for it so your mouthpiece collar will sit flush and you will keep your cartridge completely concealed now what the beekeeper and elf do have in common is they both have windows so you don't have to excavate your cartridge to see what level it's at but they do do a good job of keeping it concealed so that is really a rundown of these cartridges now let's get into the width testing for these two these we've made slightly bigger as the cartridges have gotten bigger it is a hair under 11 millimeters we're getting 10.9 so most cartridges are labeled 11 millimeters are actually a hair under 10 point 9 so this will fit a standard 11 millimeter cartridges which actually does fit into the wider category now let's check out the phantom the Phantom has a slightly skinnier opening than the elf and it comes in at ten point eight five millimeters so that will give you a good idea if you already have a cartridge that you are buying prescribed to to make sure that the unit that you get will fit so to recap the beekeeper has a ten millimeter opening the elf has an 11 millimeter opening and the phantom has a ten point eight millimeter opening that will drop cartridges in but let's say you have an extremely wide cartridge what do you do well that brings us to our second category of concealers which is found in our mini max line you can check out a really cool in depth review done by a high-rise on our mini max to show you just how powerful it is which is our smart tip key fob vaporizer it's very light and with this line what we want to do is make them very light concealable and make sure that these units fit onto your keychain this these units both have 500 milliamp powered batteries the difference is this one has a variable voltage which is our minimax Pro and this one is a single voltage but it automatically adjusts to whatever cartridge you put on it it has a smart chip in it this unit the minimax Pro has three different voltage settings with a maximum output of four volts the minimax what you would do is when you purchase your cartridge it could be as wide as you want all you do is you take it and you screw it into the 510 threaded opening and it's similar to a standard battery but it is a little bit smaller much lighter and you have a charging port right here so the cartridge is exposed when you have a cartridge on it however it is a device that is designed to look like a key fob or a clicker which does make it discrete when you don't have the cartridge attached to it then we have our minimax Pro which looks a lot like a key fob and it even has a deluxe keyring holder there and a micro USB but what's cool about is you don't see the cartridge because it's actually folded in there and then you push this button at the top to flip it open and what we did is just to show this flip open as we use one of the widest cartridges on the market which is a Liberty variable air flow model and it actually does fit in here so this will fit cartridges and we'll check the size of this opening right here this will fit 11.6 millimeter cartridges so the mini max pro and the mini max if you're buying extremely wide cartridges are your best bets to making sure that your vape pen is gonna deliver power concealability and stealth-like options if they're very wide if you buy skinnier cartridges or are filling your own cartridges we went through these features and on our channel at vapor store direct on youtube we have in-depth detailed reviews unboxings and feature comparisons on the individual items so I suggest

i'd like to start by saying vessel is one of my personal favorite brands all their stuff is super clean and easy to use five clicks to turn it on this little beauty is powered by a 550 milliamp battery for long term use it also has a auto shut off so the battery life is safe the compass is fairly small it fits in the palm of your hand it is universally threaded so all carts will fit no magnetic adapter so it does just screw right in and when it's screwed in it does have a little indicator to let you know that it's in so you're not over tightening it there is three different heat settings low is blue medium is red and high is yellow i have it on high now and we shall see how it rips oh yeah it produces not surprised vessel at it again they did a great job", "J1xqZMVqZl4": "[Music] hey it's mad at Rafal studios welcome to my review of the vessel 510 thread cartridge vaporizer i would like to thank vessel for setting up and sponsoring this review you can save 20% off the vessel devices with a code rough 20 at vessel brand calm now let's get started here is what comes in the box with the vessel vaporizer you get two very stylish the vessel pan itself the proprietary USB charger and that's it the instructions are on the back of the box and it's a very very nice-looking well-designed unit we're actually will be taking a look at three different styles so now let's take a closer look at the vessel you can see the very stylish design has a one button on the side and then at the very top you have the screw off cap and that's just a place filler that's actually not a empty cartridge there that shit's a place filler and then you can see the 510 threads on beneath the little cap there it's a really well designed pin you can tell it's just got a real high quality feel the graphite metal you got the air holes there also right above the button the button controls all the functions it also has three little LED lights there and this is the woodgrain finish here one of the very many different wood grain finishes and then at the very bottom you have that proprietary USB charging port it's magnetic pops on really nice sort of a strong connection there and really easy to connect the charger [Music] so now we're gonna go ahead and charge up the device you can see when it's charging the LED lights on the front blinked to let you know the status of the charge you cut the unit on with three clicks of the button I'm sorry that's five clicks of the button to cut it on and off and three clicks to cycle through the three different temperature settings or not temperature settings of voltage settings and then it's each one of this indicated by a different color light there there's the light blue a purple and a green and the unit cuts off with five clicks just like it cuts on very simple to operate okay having looked at the features and functions we're going to go ahead now and fill up a cartridge here with some this is some rosin he juice that we made with some turps really great taste and stuff and we're gonna try out the pen with that you can see it fits most 510 cartridges and whether that's a top or bottom airflow it should work with that we're gonna try it on the medium setting first off it's a really great pen this pin is more about the design I think than anything cuz cuz sort of a simple sort of device and you know but it gets it right at all three temperature settings but he's really nice good hits really long battery life considering that us a pretty small battery I actually got really good long life out of it that brings us to the results in scoring some pros are is that ultimate design and customization there's so many varieties that you can get of this and it's a great great looking device and a really great build quality got the variable voltage two point eight three point two and three point six volts it's got that protected drop-in design for your cartridge 240 milliamp lithium battery USB charging port and the only con is that charging port cost twelve dollars to replace it and you know that's could be a problem for some people but it's five stars it's a really really well-made design great looking device you can see there you can save 20% off the device with the code rough 20 and then I'll bring it down to $80 it's $100 normally so check them out at vessel brand comm again I'd like to thank

back with another video i am at ben's house once again and uh if you've been seeing this tronium battery around it's because it's been dope but they also gave me a box one too so i'm gonna see what this is and then i'm gonna probably give this little small one to ben and then i'm saying the small hand for the band no i'm just kidding um but yes this is the box battery it's like a box mod type [ __ ] and uh they're kind enough to send me one so let's see how this works oh yeah shout out to the mahomey van for always being dope you know saying but this is what it looks like uh the back draw activation so there's no button 380 milliamp per hour battery micro usb compatible with troy pods which is the the cartridges the empty cartridges that they provide one year warranty so there you go right off the bat very very nice um [Music] i was about to say that's it it's supposed to there's a quick start manual [Applause] micro usb adapter which they offer for the the small one and the long ones so this one you use for full grain this one for a half gram manual also a qr code if you want to scan it well let's just get into it we got that nine dollar half grand papa herbs look how much i have left because i went live again last night shout out to the people you know what i'm saying oh nice so it's auto hit so how do you turn this on and off it's weird oh it hits it's actually a lot smaller than i thought it was going to be oh wow definitely start the day with this there's no button just hit it there's no indication here that's pretty cool like you like it has these like uh where you can see the oil yeah yeah you just you just hit it it's actually really smooth compared to the other battery this one there's no voltage setting though so uh it kind of just maybe it's like a smart battery i don't [ __ ] know maybe i adjust to the the cartridge how smooth is it is it cool i like i like the way it feels too how it's like uh it's got like this little the form factor right and that's his thumb yes yeah also um like i said the drawback with these ones how'd you like it it's cool so these are basically the drawback of having a stick battery is that if you put in your pocket it could break you know what i'm saying if you sit down if you just like put in here you know sometimes you just put a pencil in your pocket and sit around with it you know some tight pants or some [ __ ] you know so it does happen um micro usb on the bottom uh i thought it would be usbc by now but you know i'm saying you can't really go wrong with micro usb it still charges pretty fast 380 milliamp per hour battery um other than that i'm taking more uh like a few more hits with this uh i'm enjoying it um maybe i should take a hit alongside with this one to see how smooth it is compared but is there any light that indicates like it's i think it's right here can you see no no light there's no manual there is many oh what the [ __ ] what it's right here see if you can see the light oh yeah okay so the light is right here so you can so like i said uh they did send me two batteries the stick battery and the pocket battery and honestly i'm i'm digging this one uh the light is i mean it's kind of visible in the in sunlight but overall really really good experience and i'm saying it's basically the height of this one still you know i'm saying so but check them out i'll post everything in the comments below you know i'm saying i'll pin a comment because i've been getting you know deleted because i've been posting links and strikes and stuff so i'd rather just post it in the comments you'll that's where you'll find it but definitely a good battery from um i'm saying other otherwise known as t-vape as well so thank you for watching the video see you guys the next one [Music] he [Music]", "YI5irBQtIM8": "hello senior stoner fans it's the real senior stoner back at you on Monday afternoon to talk about something really important to me distill it pens that work that's right these are not the pens that you basically have a little battery on the end of if you can see it here clearly will you take the battery you screw the cartridge on basically buy them in packages that say cartridges I'm not a big fan of those because they're not strong enough for me so what I've done I know many of you do it also but I want to talk about it is I've come up with two great unfortunately they're expensive customizable which means you can fill them yourself with your choice of distilling batteries so these are functional luxurious and discreet each one of them has its own advantages let's first talk about the vessel the vessel uses wood I chose walnut uses wood and brushed metal I chose gunmetal and what this does is has a screwing design for any sea cell cartridge now what I do is I buy the refillable cartridges as you can see it looks like a regular cartridge but there's a big difference you can unscrew the top carefully top is now off exposing the cartridge head and what you do that is you take your distill it and then slowly after it's been warmed a little bit put it inside of the syringe into the cartridge fill the cartridge up right to the top put the mouthpiece back on reinsert it in this case into the vessel that is the name of the unit it's called the vessel and click five times one two three four five and you'll get three three bright lights this has a variable temperature control and it is one of my go-to units home and outside take a look the amount of vapor is extreme this is the vessel about $99 but they have coupons on them and you get them less expensive now they're becoming more mainstream the only and I mean the only thing about this is a little funky is it has its own charger adapter that means it's proprietary to magnetic circular adapter that touches onto the base you cannot use a mini USB or anything like that so the vessel is a wonderful unit of go-to piece for me but you have to use its proprietary adapter let's move to the picot 1 plus this was actually recommended to me by one of our subscribers and this is an excellent unit feels heavy and weighty in my hand I've got a piece of machinery in my hand it is a regular mini USB charge it is a 5 button odd variable temperature control battery and both the vessel and the pickety are wonderful units there are a couple of Vantage's that the pic it has let's talk about them first it's a magnetic cartridge that's right a magnetic cartridge so pop it in it's not going anywhere very secure secondly as I spoke before this is also a do-it-yourself fill cartridge system I upgrade certainly from the ones on the small batteries to ninety-nine percent THC distiller my flavors Applejack in this case but let's take a you a hit and see what happens you don't have to push a button with the picot Cheers another extremely potent device I like them both a lot the tremendous upgrades over standard batteries for bait cartridges and if you have access to distill it that you can get on your own they're an excellent way to consume it hope you enjoyed this comparison of the vessel to the picket one plus have a great day this is the senior stoner back at you Cheers", "e-jekw_kNdc": "so this is my review on the fp wellness uh vape pen battery as well as charger but you know it really doesn't matter if it's fp wellness cure relief uh true true leave saterra columbia health it doesn't matter wherever you get the pin from for the most part these same batteries pretty much carry the same voltage i can't really think of the voltage number off the top of my head but these are the standard skinny batteries that you see and basically all it does is you take this out of the package it'll come just like this you remove them out of the package and then you just twist this onto the part right here and then you place the usb inside of something that's that's a usb charger such as your playstation or your computer and then you wait for the light if it's dead it'll be red when it's fully charged it'll turn green and it'll start blinking red when it's uh when it's charging um once again for those that don't know you do not need a specific pen to enjoy a specific vape cartridge as long as the vape cartridge is about this size and this right here is a 3.5 uh gram this right here is a half a gram right here as far as the uh vape cartridges is concerned they usually only come in half grams and anchor full grams but uh this you just basically just take it and then you screw it into here and then you push the button when you're ready to inhale and then you just inhale and continue about your day so once again these little batteries are very very helpful and and uh they're usually needed usually this let's say you have a specific battery from a company but you lost your usb charger but you found somebody else's or you're using a different one a lot of the time it doesn't matter it will charge just the same um so go out there and get you one basically any questions let me know once again i'm not endorsing any illegal use by any kids or anybody who's not supposed to have this i possess a medical marijuana car in the state of florida and it's perfectly legal and i'm here to help those who have never used this product that have legal right to just point them in the right right direction basically all right if you got any questions let me know", "IiJuqmmvLio": "Let's have a look at the Kandypens Slim;\nthis unit is a pen-style vaporizer meant for use with thin oils and e-liquids,\nfeaturing a refillable cartridge and a 510-threaded battery. Inside the box\nyou'll find: one Kandypens Slim battery, one Kandypens atomizer, one USB\ncharger, one user manual, and two 1mL bottles. To load your unit,\nunscrew the atomizer from the battery and pull off the mouthpiece. There will\nbe this small plug on top of the chamber, which you can remove by gently pulling\non it. Place the tip of your dropper or syringe at the end of the open hole and\nslowly fill with the oil or e-juice of your choice. Replace the plug and\nmouthpiece, screw the atomizer back on to the battery, and you are ready to start\npuffing! There's no actual temperature control or anything like that with the\nKandypens Slim; you just draw and go! The battery is listed at 180 mAh \nand lasts for days of moderate use on a single charge, so the estimated\noutput is perhaps a little lower than the average concentrate pen or e-juice\nvape. Nonetheless, you'll have more than enough power to vaporizer oils and\ne-juices with ease.

dritech ego-c twist the ego-c twist is a variable voltage device that's got both 510 and ego threading it'll fit most of your basic tanks that take up to a 2.5 coil they will run higher but most of these at a 2.5 coil you don't want to allow the voltage to reach any higher than 4.0 the ego-c twist goes from 3 point 2 volts all the way to 4.8 so do keep in mind that you need to keep that below the 4.0 for maximum efficiency turn the device on and off it works on a 5 click system 5 clicks will cause the button to flash putting in the off position 5 more we'll turn it back on now when the device is on and active sitting here that battery's not going to drain you don't need to worry about turning it on and off unless you're worried about accidentally triggering that button whether it be in a purse or a pocket in which case turn that off as to not drain your battery or fire your atomizer when the battery is near the end of its life it will flash at you between 15 and 30 times once that buttons done flashing battery is dead and it's time to throw it on the charging cable to charge it you're going to take the device twist it onto the charging cable like so finger tight you don't want to over tighten these devices the easiest way to write threading or the battery is to over tighten you want to make sure that the battery is attached to the charging cable like this first and then plug it into your wall adapter and into the wall do not attempt to twist the battery arm to the charging cable while that's connected to power or else you can short the battery while the battery is charging this little light right here is gonna be red it's gonna blink green from time to time that's just letting you know it's running a test on the battery to see how full it is it has a stop

"TFbb2238KMI": "today's review sees m1 pods made by church just came out today so just probably haven't seen these yet some of you may have but I want to go ahead and look at this one this is my favorite I like Strawberry Cough there are 0.75 in here they may even have the label on the coil in there that's pretty sick and take a look at the results and these are tested like a week ago then these are pretty cool so here in Michigan we just went through like a a band type thing I'll distill it all vapor products so you couldn't get any of these for like the last like three weeks you literally couldn't get any carts or anything so it's been a little hard and then these just dropped today so that's it's pretty dope there all seemed to be filled up pretty well I think there's like you see that babe this uh it's not like clear it's like uh I don't know how to say it but it's not instant I don't know I'll open it up and we'll see it might be a cover it kind of looks like it but I'm gonna go ahead and take this out oh so this is pretty cool so this battery is compatible with Joule pods also yeah so you can put your jewel on top of here and smoke it damn it's kinda heavy has some weight to it this little thing has some weight do church is always awesome winter product stretches on everything widget everything then you got your little jewel pod compatible thing right here just take this I'm pretty sure you just drop it right in here just like that yep then you just put your jewel pod on top of there that's [ __ ] sick all right I got a button down here Oh in that lights up green blue white Green I wanted on green that's what they said you use it on - there's really no instruction that came others on the back I'll show you guys this three settings the white 3.0 2.7 3.7 is green 4.1 is blue all of a sudden light on the bottom means that it's it's dead and it was red so it's pretty much dead so this thing actually needs to charge 410 miles it's pretty cool and surge protected so it's never gonna overheat let's go ahead and open the Strawberry Cough here so how I like to open them as you grab both sides like that just kind of wiggle it out they have a different way of doing it but we all have a different way of doing everything and you got this little box in here you can either take that out or you can just grab the pod and just grab it like so Dan this is dope so it does have like a cloudy plastic type on it it is not clear so that's that's pretty cool that's new it's different it's kind of thick too you can see that it's not it's not just a half gram it's a full 7.5 and you got your bubble somewhere up in there kind of see it right there show the back real quick this is the peanut collision the pods are 0.75 they're not a half gram through a point seven-five so you can take a hit off of this before it dies so we're just gonna go ahead and match the search up a church put it in there okay maybe it needs to be in the other side I guess they hit the head oh that tasted good first hit on the M on pod Strawberry Cough one percent is seventy two point three as a very high strawberry taste to it it's like strawberry lemonade type almost there's a very clean flavor though very clean that's good as [ __ ] that's good as [ __ ] go ahead and take one more ripoff of these girlfriend just hit this and how did you like it yeah actually is pretty good vapor production for how small it is alright I love how small it is you can just hold this in your hands no no if you could see in there but you create we created two bubbles hidden into these a couple times now these batteries range from like think it was in charge they wouldn't let me buy more than one but tomorrow they should be stocking batteries and these are $30 at $35 depending where you go and then you get these carts right here for forty to forty five dollars but this thing is pretty cool you just hold it in your hand and just no I don't even know we did go ahead and die so I'm going to end the video here just wanted to make this little clip right here about this new m1 pods you're gonna be doing reviews on some of these other pods I got I got a few more that I'm not showing here got another bag but yeah these things are pretty cool if you do see these I do recommend these but they are kind of expensive to maintain not maintained but keep up with they

one of my favorite strains ever good ass quality pen right here it's not even a pendant it's like a disposable type I don't know Church does the best to fire", "YUfJ0UkejSI": "what's the difference in vaping no you got regular vape and you got a sub tank sub tank cloud chasing sellable coils regular 2.0 1.8 whatever 0.0 0.2 0.6 0.1 ever mm okay the difference your regular vaping and sub tank Nathan is the sub tank before sub tank you had your mechanical mod okay what's a mechanical mod well okay I'll tell you what a mechanical mod is is you would put your 18 650 battery inside of this mechanical mod reason they called mechanical mod is because your manual doing it there's no regulations what does regulation regulations mean these newer mods have regulations all right so if your own is too low or something you have no protection there to say Oh homes too low or something you know like whoa this one you dump you just got straight Shh as long as you're pushing that button Shh all right so you would build your own coils this is an old RDA it was just sitting there so don't be like DJ what's up for that I just say all right so anyway you got your calls and every RDA is the same you got positive and negative just like everything in the vapor were positive negative nine o'clock nine o'clock usually on RDAs your center post is your positive and then your outer posts are your negative so this is a dual coil so what you would do is this coil it's got two leads coming out so one would go to your negative one will go to your positive that's why there's two screws here and then over here at the same one one okay so anyway with this you build your own coil and the reason it's called a drip breeze because you drip your own juice on it and you put your top on it go to town very dangerous there was a lot of accidents with these because some people will put them in their pocket next you know their handshake it's going so like if you're just say you drink and you pass out and you're hitting that fire button either you're hoping the caller will snap and it would just cut itself off or more than that you could overheat that battery push it to its limited could start venting next you know you got a little pipe bomb pop so in the vapor world that came out with regulated mods which is a good thing because now you got a lot more protection it tells you when your batteries are low it also tells you if your arms are too low and some of these mods even tell you if you're out of juice in your tank okay so mech mod it's just straight battery goes in there that very bottom pin you see in there that copper pin that's your negative and up here is your positive so it just screws in catch your button you would make connection Shh okay that's a mech mod old-school don't mess with it unless you know what the hell you doing okay no Ohm's law there's a whole bunch to that so just steer away so for the safety purpose of people wanting to cloud chase and drip now you got sub tanks these have their own coils built-in it's a sub on coil now usually these are real low ohms so it takes wattage to push this not regular milliamps like you were with a regular vet regular vape you get more of a throat hit more like a cigarette if you're trying to quit smoking a regular vape is perfect that I recommend move your way up to this if you want to but I don't recommend you start off with this because when you're craving a cigarette you're craving that narrow throat hit the cigarette tasting oh you ain't craving cotton candy strawberry whatever you ain't off wow that was good give me a cigarette you know your minds gonna see it like retreat sad so I recommend a cigarette for every to begin with with regular baked take your time this is mao zedong mouth to lung means you're holding your button you're going on steady you fill your mouth once you got a good there you can't hold more than you inhale exhale mouth - look this one's straight loan here this goes straight to your loan the reason is is because it's such a low on coil you are kind of its radiator your help keeping that coil cool alright so your air is helping keeping your cool your coil cooler so if you got a sub tank and you feel like this thing's getting warm and hot oh my you ain't hitting hard enough so if think of a scale from 1 to 10 alright mines up 50 so Scout 1 to 10 I'm at a 5 if I got it on 80 now I go on the scale one to 10 to an 8 hippie 80 100 okay and it's not and it's not yeah you got a long stay keep it cool also big difference in juices this one is real high be gvg is the vegetable it's real thick it's easy on the throat regular vape juice is like a 50/50 so 50-50 means 50 propylene 50 vegetable of the 50 propylene is what's gonna give you that throat hit kinda like a cigarette like oh wow okay you feel like you're smoking start off with this people please alright so just to kind of give you a little tips and tricks of what goes on with vaping okay well maintain battery is gonna be nice and clean you see okay so every night I want you to take your tank off and always people just to finger tight to finger tight don't ya you know just to finger tight is all you need once it makes connection that's it just to finger tight okay see it makes connection if you go real tight what's gonna happen is you've got these little bitty rings inside of your tank I'm gonna show you there's these little bitty white rings alright these little rings out here if you put it too tight you're gonna keep these rings and juice it's just got a leak out alright so the way regular vet tank is built is you have your coil the bottom of your coil is your positive on your battery which is the center piece that barely tip in there that little circle is gonna hit the very tip in here all right so that's your positive on your battery all the outside is negative the whole outside is negative now inside of your coil just take this off to show you there's your coil so when you hit your battery you're actually warming up a little wire that's inside will be this coil so let me show you kind of give you an idea what's going on okay so here's your coil you see that little cotton right there all right that's organic cotton your juice is absorbing inside of there and then when you hit your battery button its warming up a little wire in there and that's how you're getting your vapor through that little bitty hole you could almost see the coil and see let me take this apart to show you so we just take the tip off and you know oats Co what I mean by that is people spend baking a long long time you can even rebuild these coils but it's something I don't recommend they're only a dollar ninety-nine just replace so anyway we take the call apart got your top pieces where you're getting your air from okay now this is your coil you see I don't know I'm sorry yeah anyway there's wire I really should try to organize this but I'm just trying to do a real quick video but anyway there's cotton and then you got your wire around there it's warming up okay so let's just kind of give you an idea I'm going to take the cotton out of there all right take the cotton out and you can see you wire in there now all right now if we remove the bottom here over our coil the bottom piece alright there's just a little rubber piece of what this rubber piece is doing is keeping these two codes from touching there's a little bitty wire sticking out you really can't see it but there's a little wire now I'm gonna put this rubber piece up show you okay now there's our coil actually so you got your cotton and your wire that wires what warms up is there wire warms up your Cotton's around it it gets hot that's how you get your big okay so what that's gonna do throughout your vaping day is cause condensation inside of your pipe all right let me see if mines got something you could see sort of a condensation up there so the best thing we do throughout your day when you hear at night gurgling just sling it out I'll grab you a q-tip take some of the cotton off and dab it out because the condensation is just gonna bounce around inside of that center pipe see inside of that center pipe is your coil with all these little rubber pieces it keeps it from leaking so inside of your tank is actually this little pipe all right this is what's holding your juice you see that's how you're getting your air so when you put your coil in there it actually goes onto that pipe and the little rubber piece on top of your coil keeps it from leaking sort of like you get the idea that anyway it goes in there and it keeps it from the consumer condensations go bounce around and there you're gonna hear that gurgle and don't freak out just sing it out okay also every now and then if you change your coil and you still like man I got juice everywhere pouring out everywhere what's going on with that sometimes wet your finger put it on the bottom here if you hear that then you're fine if you if you get a little bit of air you might not see it but this is just Pyrex plastic you could have a little hairline crack in there somewhere replace your tank they're only like $6.99 this is the cam 43 yes all right so you get in a coil you screw it in right here screw it back in put your juice around your Center pipe not in the middle but I recommend what you do fill your juice inside of there kind of hard about the mouthpiece that way if you put in juice in it and it does start to drip out you could use your finger to kind of keep from making a mess alright once you do you put your colon all back on that juice it's kind of dripping out just sing it out okay mm-hmm so anyway back to a sub tank right quick alright so going back to the sub tank you got that thick juice that 80/20 even 70/30 is a little too thin but a lot of people Beit 70/30 which is like reds Reds a poor it's great naked 100 which is our biggest sentimental but there are just the 70/30 so 70/30 is okay you're pushing it but on a 70/30 to thinner juice so you got a really really really keep it cool your it's radiator now let me show you that coil I don't know if you can see but you could see right through this coil like can you see this is an old coil so don't freak out this this coil you see how it's burnt it actually was fired dry that's why it's kind of burnt looking because there was a juice in there and it got fired so it just burnt up your cotton so as you see your juice is gonna absorb in that cotton and this is actually the mesh coil by smoke the prints it's absorbing you hit your fire button it warms up that that mash in there around your your countenance absorbing your juice and that's how you getting your paper but you see you can see right through it see there's a big hole that's your air so inside of your tank you got this sitting here so your air is actually the bottom on this coil so when you're inhale in you're hitting it Shh your air is going through this little beauty air hole here right that's how you're getting your vapors so if your juice is too thin you gotta see it's too thin of a juice it's just gonna go through your cotton right through your air hose right onto your mod it's gonna be everywhere you're like man this is a mess popping in your mouth and everything so you stay juice honest tank regular vape spine whatever juice but not to think of a juice on this if you put subtank juice in regular vape tank you've got to remember that was a little bitty piece of cotton so the juice is so thick for this little bitty coil it don't get hot enough you're gonna get dry hits you're gonna be tasting like burnt ton because the juice is so thick it's not able to absorb into a little bitty coil and give you the right vapor that's right there no juice for go right there is they will be t-coil thinner juice will go right through this coil onto your men you see what I'm saying any picker juice for a sub tank make sure you use the right juice now it's kind of like a car a car will run on chainsaw gas but it ain't gonna run right so use the right juice for your for your hickeys all right so now we've been here over seven years we got largest selection in the whole state so all these little tips and tricks I'm just kind of trying to pass it on and make your vaping experience a little better for you and easier all right so I know the problem we've had throughout the years you're a top piece I hear your 510 connector some people will have their tank on there like man and it's just my sub tanks just screwed what am I gonna do do you fix this no bro I do not fix this if every smart products they're number one in the world for reason smoke every smart product has a 30-day warrantee after that I mean you got wear and tear you got it fall in all this they can't cover it forever you understand but what's gonna happen here the reason your top plate keeps spinning is because you're putting your tank way too tight and then it's hard to get it off so next thing you know you're loosening this piece if you take this whole unit apart with these screws you're gonna see the only thing that's holding the center piece on the bottom is a little nut to tighten it okay so a lot of wear and tear the heat cool they heat the COO it's just gonna loosen up and your tanks just gonna spin when this happens don't try to fix it if it's over you know six seven months don't try to rig it replace it because now you got a mod that's not making a good seal next you know your juice has gone into that mod the juice could eventually rust that battery next thing you know you got a pipe arm in your face so whenever your mods acting up and not acting right replace it don't try to repair it don't repair replace we place replace okay you got this at your face safety first all right so that's one problem that keeps spinning around another problem is a lot of these have this micro USB connector and a lot of people when they go to charge it they end up busting that piece right there because they're not paying attention when they're putting their cable in there when that piece is busted replace you cannot fix it especially with like this beef and it's got the battery built in it's pretty much shot don't try to rig it don't try to say well maybe I could charge it like the USB no replace it replace it all right safety first people okay regular vape subtank thick juice regular juice but still stay away from convenience $3.00 Stonewall my juices they're watered-down junk okay so back to the battery so we kind of showed you how the coil works now let's see how the battery works all right this is a an old battery this is an oldie but it's been here like probably eight years seven eight years right but you can see it's still nice okay the reason is every night you take your tank off don't get your q-tip the ones with the point or just perfect these are for like make up whatever but anyway the ones for the point where actually get into that little creek where regular q-tip won't reach so you want to clean out your tank every night the bottom of your tank and also your battery very important always clean it out and don't forget to go around the threads just kind of put your q-tip there put your finger on it kind of press on it and spin it around and clean them little threads you can see it's kind of dirty this is one that has never been clean look at that you can see it's almost like rust okay look Russ very dangerous so if the outsides rust you could only imagine the inside because juice has gotten into there and how's it gonna do it in there DJ let me show you all right so this is one of the new vision spinner 3s is really nice battery says 16 hundred million battery it's adjustable top now old school you had the micro I mean the USB you screw your battery in to charge it okay and always be gone is whenever you're charging battery make sure it's on if it's off it won't charge so always push your button if it's on screw it in lightly if you screw it in you let's go turn red when it's charging when it's fully charged let's go turn green take it off there's no sense for it to sit there no more okay so here's this battery what makes this battery so cool is it's passed through what pass through means you can actually vape as you're charging it so with this on when your battery dies the only one you got pretty much is a blinking matter but when this battery dies you got to take it off charge it if you only have one battery where do you go do now while that's charging go smoke a cigarette so pass through no more smoking period guys so you could charge it as you vape microUSB but pay attention way this is designed and usually the microUSB cables we got I don't have one handy it's got a little heart in little smiley face and usually what I'll do is line it up with a button so when you put your cable in there if it's a smiley face showing out I say be sure you plug it in smiley face button smiley face button everyone's happy on the other side it's got a heart so I'm gonna be trying to push in the heart where the button is just gonna break your heart because warranty don't cover that part see okay so see whichever side your microUSB cable goes to where your button is if there's no logos on your cable take a little metallic marker some and mark your cables so no matter what you'll know you're plugging in right mark that cable if it don't have a logo on it okay so these batteries are built with just one screw just one screw so the problem we have with is is people's like man this thing's all loose and [ __ ] what's up with that sorry I'm custom but anyway it gets all loose and I'll tell you want because there's only one screw now the one screw it's pretty much swivelling like that so what can you do the best thing you could try to do with these new batteries is has a little screw let's take your little screwdriver and kind of let me see I can't see without my reading guys so anyway right there you can see a little screen okay so you could normally tighten that screw and it uh keep this nice and snug all right now what makes these batteries dangerous is maintenance maintenance be sure you take care of these because what I do with this when I took the screw off to kind of give you an idea all right so another problem we have is people's like it's just banking and they tried the thing that I said before if it's blinking if your battery's blinking I always check to see what's going on so what we do we take our tank if we push our button and stay solid we know it's something to do with our tank probably your coil or your coals loose or your coal is not sitting there so always check that coal first take it off make sure your your coil is nice and snug right there if it's sitting in there grab it out tighten it up here do that and then put it on there if you put it on and it stays solid you know oh it was my car if it's still blinking your battery probably needs to be charged or if you're like but I charged it and still blink and throw it away all right because it's just a bad battery or if you just buy the ticket back say look this thing ain't charging they'll normally replace I will so I don't know what other stories do but if it's still blinking and you charge it on it's a bad battery they just cannot keep up with the vape ORD man just about everyone in their mom vapes and I'm so thankful for that but every now and then you do get a bad battery every now and then you do get a bad cool I mean I've had a whole little batch every call and that pack was bad so it does happen okay so back to this stick juice for subtank regular juice or regular but anyway sorry I get ahead of myself and I'm trying to hurry up because I got a lot to do so I took off this screwed so just to show you inside the battery alright another problem we had all right I took the battery apart alright so as you see you kind of see that this wire was all kinked around if you see that wire kinked around like that what that's telling you is that little rubber piece there's a little rubber piece inside of there you see your wire is connect to your positive peace so this is your negative there's a little bitty washer in there it's actually keeping juice out of your battery so if you see while you're spinning like that what happened is putting the tank up too tight and whatever you've actually loosened that little bitty rubber piece in there let me see if I can get some pop it out to show you when I'm talking it bad people Thanks so I'm just gonna this battery is no good anyway so I'm just gonna kind of show all right let me just this battery is no good anyway so I'm just gonna pull this wire out alright so as you can see it suggests of all the charges there that's your negative that's your positive so there's a little bitty rubber piece in there a lot of times that would just spin that little rubber piece and what's happening see your coil is sitting there and that center piece and is spinning so what it's doing is spinning your wire it's very dangerous because wire that's telling you that your connection is not that good no more with that rubber piece so what that means is juice could go inside of your battery now so what you're gonna want to do replace it but if you're like me I can't afford it right now what I do is sometimes I'll just take the hot glue gun and now we just kind of put the hot glue around right here and what that would do is make a good seal and keep that rubber piece from spinning spinning spinning spinning okay you could do that but I wouldn't recommend it I recommend replacing never something's bad just replace it okay the safety first goes alright I can't really take this piece off on why because for when I can't see nothing but that's just a little rubber piece so that's always keeping the juice out of that battery is that little rubber piece is connected to this positive piece and sometimes the batteries [ __ ] [ __ ] blink blink blink and you take it apart and then you see that your wire is just sitting inside of your battery like that and this piece is not connected to nothing so what happened is that solder actually came out done off this wire to your positive piece quick fix you could just restart on that wire back all right but I would just replace it don't worry about it but yeah that's all it is it's simple positive wire to that centerpiece all right so that's the battery maintenance keep it coming look at this one see how rusted it is someone didn't take care of this better so I'm just gonna kind of show you I mean it is just rusted out so I don't even want to take this battery apart because I guarantee you it's rust you know what can happen eventually guys is that rust could get inside of this battery you could see it's actually becoming very dangerous that rest could actually go inside of this battery next thing you know lithium-ion batteries are made with pressure so rust could loosen that protection that batteries got next you know if it's a weak battery under pressure what's gonna happen Shh I mean this is a little Rokit little pipe bomb in your face replace it guys take care of your stuff and now these tanks these are a little different this is the iclear 16 this one is one you fell from the top where you juice you go around your coil alright if this one's going bad you're like oh what I throw it away some of them you do this III ease you throw away this is the iclear 16 you don't throw this from weight this one you actually replace your core this on your unscrew from the bottom unscrew your coil throw it away grab your new one what you see they all got these little seals so make sure you don't lose these little seals that's what keeps the juice from coming out of your tank and your air not being able to hit right now replace your coil chunk it on there now little tip I like to do with these coils see you could just see at eco room sometimes if you bake a lot a lot a lot what I would do is just kind of unravel you your ego will it's just a little tip unravel it's on then put it back in there and now when you put that juice in there you'll never get a dry hit so anyway same thing see positive negative those centers your positive now you see there's a little hole so with that is that's how you're able to get air okay so your coil the bottom of your coil is just a hole see so you juice your tank sitting there whatever no every morning I get it juice is everywhere pretty much what's happening is gravity is just gonna prove that condensation it's been in your pipe all day it's just gonna put it right through that little bitty hole in the bottom of your coil onto your battery that's why every night grab you q-tip dry it out real good because that happens that's totally normal but if you use like really really thinned out juice it's kind of dangerous because the juice will just go around that little rubber seal you see what I'm saying and then get into your battery safety first I mean there's just so much that involves vaping know what the hell you're doing if you go to buy a unit or something make sure they know what the hell they're doing they're selling it to you and if they're just like oh yeah here you go thank you have a great day I mean they expect you know

glad to answer whatever questions I can there's just so much to know about in the vapor add you got regulated you got temperature control you got you know nichrome can't all eco not but anyway you got camp chrome nickel stainless steel you got temperature control you got water you got all this but all you got to worry about on your sub tank is w-what watch watch don't worry about TC knowing that that's temperature control that's kind of do I don't even know why they still put TC on months cause very few people even use temperature control on their vape tanks because you ain't go fine just like temperature control Colin's everywhere so just stick with wide it's just the best hits that's my opinion I don't know but anyway there's just so much to talk about a vapor over there there's a whole big history behind it there's a whole big everything about it and it's not just something you're just gonna I want to open a babe store dude it don't work that way you got to have your heart into it you've gotta wanna help and change people's lives but yet you still want them to know what the hell they're doing so they can enjoy their vaping experiences same way you do they took you a while to get where you're at help them out you know it's kinda like if you see a little kid and he's about to you know fall off a bed or something you want to stop if not he's gonna fall well you'll learn the hard way what's that cool no be sure they know what they're doing and guys if you do a sub tank and you're gonna let a friend hit it don't be all like watch this and then turn it up not cool bro you know what I do to anybody that even got a sub tan or then once it hit or whatever I kind of show them how to hit it first look don't hit your button don't hit your button I want to hear you hit so before they even touch that fire burn I have them here they're like no no no listen and they're like no and then I made sure that they're hitting it right before I even tell them okay now hit that fire button but don't change a thing along state oh wow there's a way to hit a subject straight long hit long and steady hits don't be scared to hit it as hard as you should anyway it's long steady hits out slow don't sit down hold it in you will cough cuz that's a lot of heat on that coil right here at your face you know you got you got all that right here so that's a lot of heat you want to keep it cool anyway I could be here all day but I'm sure you got better things to do and I got to get to work so guys thanks for watching thank you so much you got any questions and Robin Bay for anything put in comments below I'll try my best to get back to you as soon as possible hope you enjoy Thank You DJ have a now babe", "I3ANWk8V6ys": "[Music] hi I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we're bringing you our latest kit which is a special edition two in one kit which you will have custom designs to choose from so a lot of people have sent us some email requests that said they weren't interested in the oil tank but they wanted more along the dry herb and concentrate side so we decided to put together these limited-edition kits which is your custom battery which you will be able to choose a design from which I'll go through later our hybrid kit hybrid wax and dab tank which you have a separate video on on the channel which goes through in depth the specs of the tank and how to use it and the ozone tank which is for dry herbs which you also have a video on the channel that we'll go through in detail exactly how to use it and how to operate it what the kit also comes with as a premium titanium dab tool which it's actually a very good dab to I recommend that you keep and it also comes with a plastic chamber for the hybrid so you can take it on the go and you don't have to worry about breaking the glass it comes with some removable mouthpieces which will drop in the place of your hybrid or your ozone tank in case if you guys are you know sharing the device with others and it also comes with your power plant which is our Defender Series 25 watt battery now I'm going to jump into some of the specifics about this so when you pick up this kit it is going to be your ultimate way that you can use your dry herbs and concentrates this is a very nice light transportable battery which is going to be easy for you to use and you are gonna have all these really cool designs to pick from so right here we have blue skulls the really nice metallic finish you have herb plants right here in kind of a Rastafarian color you have the guy I like to call the Herbal Shrek here keeps it natural mind stimulation you have a splash of color or a galaxy you're really nice rendition of Rasta skulls armie digital camo Arctic camo gray skulls desert camo that is in digital print as well as blue camo so each one of these batteries has a maximum of 25 watts let me jump into some of the really cool features about this battery so you have something here to where it will run all of your herb attachments and definitely any attachment that's 510 thread that you purchase from honey stick this mod puts out enough power that you're gonna be able to run that comfortably it's gonna last you a long amount of time between charges it's also it's it's pretty lightweight little unit it's not one of those real heavy mods and it just gives you what you need you can also use it has this cool feature where you can unscrew this top cap right here and you flip it over and as you see that's an ego adapter and you can use that as the port for your 510 thread prefilled cartridges that you buy and this can be your battery that you can adjust and won't have to charge so just a really good little battery to have around the house it even has a little lanyard port if that's your thing that you'd like to keep it you know carry it more on the go around your neck so it's lightweight enough to do that so battery as I mentioned before has a maximum output of 25 watts if you're using prefilled cartridges make sure you guys start at like 5 watts mostly operating ranges for prefilled carts or you know between 4 and 10 watts max so if you do put it above that you'll burn out the prefilled cartridge really soon and I don't think anybody wants to do that because then you have to siphon out what's in there and try to salvage it so it has a micro USB charging port right there at the very bottom of the battery and operating the battery is really simple you just click it five times on you'll see a little defender insignia for the defender edition battery and it has a maximum operating range of 25 watts you have a plus and a minus sign so you can adjust your voltage up and down and you can just simply click it and as battery also has a really cool feature on it to wear it has a locking feature so if you're carrying the unit around you give it to friends you don't want them messing with your wattage you can actually lock your wattage so the way that you do that is you push and hold this the plus sign and then you push and hold the power sign simultaneously and you see now once I've done that when I go to adjust the wattage you get a little lock okay so to unlock your battery you push and hold the plus sign for two seconds and then you continue holding that down then you follow it up by pushing and holding the power sign and then you should have a little unlock symbol there and then now you can move and operate the wattage freely so every time that you pick up your unit I'm going to tell you make sure that you charge your unit with the provided microUSB cable you can use your Android chargers their BlackBerry chargers they'll work just fine with this battery we also have a cable that comes with the kit you'll just simply plug it in get it onto a wall adapter that's not an Apple and make sure you charge it for about two to two and a half hours it should give you a full charge quick the unit five times you can screw on for concentrates your hybrid tank simply screws on and if you want to know detailed use instructions go watch the video about our hybrid tanks specifically they'll walk you through the ins and outs and the features of the tank but the operating range of the hybrid tank goes up to about 30 watts so you don't want to take it above 30 watts and also it has a replaceable coil which the kit does come with an extra coil now for dry herbs you have your ozone tank which again just simply screw on into the mod which has a maximum operating wattage of 28 watts on it and we also have a separate video on the ozone tank which you'll be able to check out the specifics the ins and outs and the how to's of the ozone to use so what's really good about this battery and this whole kit setup is you can run this battery full blast and not worry about damaging your auto miser this we give you plenty of power plenty of good use and it's gonna come all dropped in and custom cut into this amazing waterproof pressurized and air tight amazing little carrying case which will make it perfect for on-the-go and also look really cool on display at your house so for a new two-in-one kit and several other cool items please make

moments stay lifted everybody", "_MhSo7bfzjE": "[Music] hey guys how you doing today it's Evan down here at mellow babes Indian land coming at you real quick with a brand new product update we've got a lot of people that are coming in using our funky farms CBD cartridges or the mellow hemp farm CBD cartridges and you do need a battery for those and we always like to make sure you guys have plenty of options to choose from you know pens boxes all that kind of stuff but we went ahead and brought in a new box for you guys made by yocan it is the wolf mint you need keep almost calling it a wolf mini I'm sorry guys wolf uni it is a beautiful black and red or black with red splatter textured paint finish feels really nice in the hand it's got a nice little bit of grip to it I don't really feel like it's gonna go sliding out of my hand super easy which is convenient because I drop everything very standard stuff here you've got your micro USB cable there on the side to charge your device it does come included with a flat micro USB cable this is an adjustable device as far as your hit and how the cartridge is gonna fit not all cartridges are made the same some are a little bit thicker some are a little bit thinner some are taller some are shorter so this device aims to take care of all of that without having to have multiple magnetic 510 adapters excuse me sorry guys a lot of devices will just bring you like you've got one tall one in one short one for your how you adjust mean they might have a little rubber seal on the top this guy has a dial right up here on the top if you twist this that way it actually closes that up I don't know if you can yeah you can see it there we go back the other way to open it and that allows you to shrink around the top of the cartridge this way you don't have any of that wobble back and forth like you could get with just a magnet holding it in place at the bottom as well you do have a height adjustment here it has three levels this is the bottom top and middle and the LEDs from the device being powered on actually light up the inside as well so it will illuminate the car you can see exactly how much flu you've got in there even if you don't have light if it's dark or whatever which is pretty convenient actually you don't take out your phone shine a light on under nothing and it does have a few different settings here with the power five clicks to turn it on five clicks to turn it off to to activate a ten-second preheat mode excuse me this way if you guys have some CBD oil that is maybe a little bit thicker it's not firing correctly right away until it gets warmed up this allows you to skip that just preheat it for 10 seconds go ahead and puff on it and it should work perfect and then of course three clicks to change the power level just like that and then that's it pretty much Oh a couple of things my bad I don't know if I said it already so I'm going to say it again it is a 350 million power battery and it does have charging pass-through but that is gonna go ahead and wrap that up for you guys just wanted to show you that we had a new device in here for you guys if you liked the video go ahead and leave it a like if you have any questions go ahead and leave it in the comments if you can think of anybody that might really like this product go ahead and share this video with them and if you'd like to see more from us go ahead and leave a subscription and get the Bell on so you can be notified every time we post something new for you guys you guys have Worple day take care bye bye", "RdTC5g4B5Zw": "what up guys the grass skirt lounge boy fred and i am back with a new vape cartridge and vape pen review so this is a slim pen and thanks to the homeboys at the I'm sorry thanks to my homeboys at the UH at the grass ninjas for hooking me up with this now this right here is the cartridge that I'm smoking this is a half gram car cartridge this is uh let me see cuz there's a glare so I can't really see if you guys can see this or not let me see if I can put it in the focus and I cannot so um this is alaskan thunder this is a clear solvent free this is made by amber industries now I've been smoking on this all day and I gotta tell you some now I forgot to ask whether this was actually a I'm sativa or an indica but it seems to be more of a sativa than an indica I seem to be it could it could be a hybrid but I feel like I'm getting a sativa high from this because I don't feel lazy army is I'm feeling more of a mental high right now and it's real subtle to I'm not like completely like [ __ ] fried but as you guys can see the the actual cartridge the actual cartridge itself looks like looked like the Dyna puffs or the or the bloom cartridge oh wow oh no not the bloom because the bloom is different as the plastic tip with the with the wick inside but this looks like a lot like a diner puff cartridges though same type of apparatus got your arm your we tink string here and this is the slim pin now I still do have my brass knuckle even though I think I'm gonna need to replace that because I think the battery is bent has been dying a little too quickly but um this I actually like this um so far as price this is a lot cheaper than the breast brass knuckle um at least it would have been cheaper for me I don't know what the other the market value of it is but I know how much it cost to me but anyway now charging it the actual up can the actual connection for the for that for the kilt for the cable for the charge people for the USB plug cable is right at the bottom of this so you don't need an additional adapter to screw into the top like you do with the brass knuckles also this has three different settings also three different voltage settings so as is typical with which as standard with any vape pen or 12 battery you pressed it five times and it turns on I don't know if you guys can see the indicator light but it's glowing green I had it set to green green is the is the second highest voltage and you just basically press it three times I'm sorry if I'm not getting this in a shot like I said there's a glare so it's hard for me to tell now click the three times the blue it oh I turned it off actually now what's on my apologies I hope you guys sort of greenlight the indicator light so it's green now I click it three times and now it's blue the blue is the highest voltage at 3.8 so here the voltage rating readings on red is 2.8 green is 3.3 volts and blue was 3.8 volts so blue is the highest voltage and 1 2 3 and now it's so I'm red so I'm gonna take a puff from each one I've been hitting it all day from from each different setting so I can kind of gauge how big of a toke I'm taking which I actually like this is pretty dope so as you can see just a 2 3 second arm drag doesn't really unproduced a whole lot of smoke but I don't know how you guys failed with uh with uh with vaping but if it's some topknot some really good vape if it's a good strain you know I'm a gay you show me like I'm a choke off that [ __ ] but um it and I guess that's the same with uh anything I fit some good grass or whatever but you know anyway so let's go to the next setting I'm rambling cuz I'm high how bad figure out as the music for some ambiance now in the green as I hit it another two three second drag I get more of a drag I get more vape from that so that's so that's that's a slightly heavier hit then the red setting now let's go to the blue and now it's blue here's a little trick to my obvious keep water might be went out when i blaze man it cuts back on the awning on the choking off the grass whether it's bud or cut bait cartridges that you're using um because we we will excuse me we will make your throat dry I know it dehydrates the [ __ ] out of me so I keep water cuts back on me coughing and gagging and [ __ ] which is usually caused because I'm thirsty it's [ __ ] more than anything so I'm gonna go ahead and take this last pull off the blue give you guys a I guess my critique on that [Music] now I know if you guys can see the smoke but the blue setting with a much heavier hit than the green or the red setting so the blue is the highest setting and it's performing as its performing as it specifies on the battery let's see this is a 290 mAh battery a 10 millimeter by 92.7 millimeter battery I'm gonna see bottom micro USB charge adjust the voltage by quick pressing the button three times rechargeable battery for the use of vape cartridges fits all 510 thread so these are so the cartridge like that's explained before now everything is being Universal and standardized now so the batteries in the up cartridges you know you could pretty much intermix them you know you can use different cartridges with different batteries so on and so forth so that's the good thing about vaping nowadays and I'm the technology is advancing so what was for what was once you know top quality you know state-of-the-art tech so far this is concerned now it's becoming more moderately priced but so far I like the slim pin you know it seemed to keep a charge pretty well even though I went down to gardenia to meet my homeboy yesterday and we are we chopped it up for a minute did I lower exchange and stuff and I did just make some ice cream - man I posted it on my Instagram channel so follow me on Instagram the

"a9CEVz3wTUs": "hey guys my name is Joey we're here today at this kind of a pen I'm gonna talk about the key B D family lined up [Music] I know guys you definitely remember this bait from previous videos that we had the QED super famous piece has a flip top four cartridges and has a USB cable on his side well they just made it way better he's upgraded it instead of keeping the X which is same style new paintjob bigger battery and much more power and we're definitely talk a lot more about this in this video today alright guys so like I was saying new bigger brothers to the original key VD both variable voltage both of us be chargeable one like the original actually comes with a USB cable attached to it which was great but honestly I have seen these go bad and then once this goes bad like this wire you can't charge the device anymore so the reason why they upgraded is they put the USB port on the top so there's least chance of actually breaking it and you can actually charge it both flip top like the original and the new one you know they both fit all size cartridges twelve millimeter and bigger pretty nice and sleek the upgraded new QD x does have a 650 million battery compared to the original which was a 350 million battery so they basically twice the size of the battery longer they time actually for you guys and your going you know enjoy the Vice little bit more so guys we're gonna talk about voltage I understand in the comments I've been reading them people want to talk you don't want to hear more about the voltage always talk about them but now we're gonna pay really close attention to it so listen up three settings green and now which allows you to vape it at three point two volts now you press a three button three times it's no less I go to blue Blues won't give you 3.7 volts at the battery click it three more times it's gonna be red Red's gonna give you four volts fully for the cartridge right there so Ford vols is gonna be perfect for a lot of these cars that out there in the market today wow this a actually kicks pretty it kicks like a mule that for votes especially on this liquor right here it's perfect and the cool thing about this thing is it does have preheat mode so I need those little thicker liquids that you might have in there all you gotta do is press it twice preheat mode will kick in give you like a ten-second preheat you

kid's gonna come with everything that you need except for a cartridge so there's no cartridges included however it does fit all 510 thread cartridges that are below 12 millimeters in diameter so

the comments below alright guys so we're gonna get the arrow B right here nice little box let's bring the camera in close cuz we're gonna be taking it away from me and going more to the item so we're gonna have the arrow B box right here deluxe box just talks about the contents and some of main features it's a slide-out box it's gonna flip open and you're gonna have your instructions right here don't worry about the instructions we're gonna go through exactly how to use this you're gonna have your arrow be right here we're gonna take one out and then you're gonna have your accessories right here let's go through the accessories of what comes with each kit you know in each accessory package you're gonna get a deluxe USB charging cable and two 510 thread magnets these magnets are going to be used to screw onto your 510 devices cartridges or wax adapters to make an electrical connection with your air will be you get tool in case if you lose one there in case if you need extra and then you have your USB charger right here your USB charger comes with a little key chain holder very cool little device so you basically plug your USB in here you could be like a little keychain or a little lanyard hook just take these two buttons for the USB you push them to release the first thing you want to do when you get your arrow B is make sure that your arrow B unit is charged so take the device charging port is right there at the bottom plug the male end of the microUSB cable into it once you hear it click it's good to go then plug the other end of the USB cable into your wall adapter and you're gonna charge it if your device is off you're gonna have a readout on the screen that says charging and it's gonna flash and then when it's full it's gonna stay full for a little bit and then it's just going to turn off completely this unit does have charge protection so in case if you do leave it on the charger for more than it's supposed to be you're not going to cause any damage to the inside of the unit so once the unit is fully charged now for this one let's bring the camera in really close so remove a little protective film off the display case that's where the digital readout is gonna be you notice you're gonna have three buttons here this one's your power and fire button the small button closest to it is gonna be your plus button which is going to increase your temperature or intensity and the button next to it furthest away from the power button there's gonna be your minus which is gonna decrease your temperature now really quickly this mod is one of the only mods concealers that can do full temperature control on 510 thread prefilled cartridges so when you get a cartridge you pop it in here you're gonna be able to dial into the Fahrenheit or for all of our European customers degrees Celsius of where you want your cartridge coil temperature burner this can be very useful for certain types of oils and you can also really hone in and get a special taste on it we're gonna run through exactly how to function on the mod but there is not many batteries on the market that can bring you this kind of scalability until a lot of you guys out there you know who you are you guys want your vape to vape at a certain temperature and this mod can deliver that but it also simple watt controls so to turn the unit on we're gonna click the button five times and then we're gonna have a digital readout screen here that we're gonna zoom in on you guys see it says arrow B which is the Model D unit and then it's gonna click right in to watt mode that's what we ship our units on is it comes in watt mode and to increase watts you would just simply push little plus sign as you can see look at the watts go up this little unit will go all the way up to 20 watts that you can control in order to switch from watt mode to the temperature mode you take the power button and you click it three times consecutively within two-second intervals so you're gonna click it pretty quickly so let's go you see it clicked over and now it goes right into Celsius mode it's at a hundred degrees Celsius now you can either operate it an increase in celcius mode if that's your preferred temperature or if you want to switch it over to Fahrenheit just click the plus button and cycle up and once it goes through its maximum Celsius it will automatically switch over to Fahrenheit see how it's got the degree F next to it now and keep cycling and keep going up and down and once it hits its maximum Fahrenheit which is 600 degrees it'll automatically kick back down 200 degrees Celsius now this is a smart mod so when you turn it off once you have it on your setting it will remember the last setting that you had it on now that's pretty useful knowing that if you optimize it for a certain cartridge that you're vaping on you're not gonna have to remember that and reset it all the time so don't worry about remembering what your settings are because this will remember for you now how to get started on vaping let's just take a little sample cartridge that I have here it's empty but it's a nice gold thick cartridge looks real nice you take one of your magnet adapters they came with the kit and you're gonna make sure that the little indentations in the magnet adapter the little grooves are facing up then you're gonna screw it into the cartridge and make sure that you screw it on there so it's nice and tight don't want to over tighten it to strip the threads and make sure it's nice and tight because this is gonna make your magnetic connection then you're gonna take this and you're gonna drop it into the unit now when you drop it in it's gonna say whether it's a new coil or an old coil to have plus or minus plus if it's a new coil what you want to do is if it's a new coil to the UN so it's not the previous one you definitely want to hit the plus sign because what that's gonna do is it's gonna read the cartridge and what the ohm settings are and what the resistance is and it's gonna optimize if you click - Eska mean it was the last cartridge so it's going to use the same settings that you had on your last cartridge in terms of its electronics and its programming so in order to be safe whenever you drop a new cartridge in there and it asks you new or old cartridge hit that plus sign which is a closest one of a power key that it's gonna give you an OL murid out up there let's see what it says 1.2 ohms on the cartridge that's generally with these kind of high-performance cartridges go at it's usually between 1 & 2 the lower that the ohms are the higher performance and the faster heat of time you're gonna get in those cartridges and if you have a cartridge that starts creeping up in resistance in the ohms this is a good read out then you know either that cartridge might be close to the end of its useful life or you need to clean your cartridge so keep your eye on the ohms guys while you're vaping and then all you do is you put in whatever temperature you want based on what we went through and you push and hold the power button you'll see a little timer go up which is digital and then you push and hold inhale throughout the duration of holding holding the button down and you're off to vaping so there's also a couple other little features I wanted to go over with you guys here some people right or left-handed when they're vaping they want to see this screen read in a different way you can flip this screen over in case if you're right or left-handed or based on how you hold the unit when you vape so you can see the screen while you vape the way that you do that is you click the button four times consecutively you see how just flipped over there now that's flipped over you can vape and you can flip it back using the same thing and it flipped right back the other thing you could do is if you're carrying this thing and you're not a good person when it comes to always turning your unit off when it's not in use you can lock the unit how you do that as you push and hold the plus and the minus for two seconds consecutively and then it should say that locked yet locked right there and then push and hold for two seconds again and it should be unlocked yep see it's moving now I want you guys to see it so you could that's another cool feature so this arrow B is probably the most little sophisticated concealer unit on the market right now has plenty of big power lets you really hone it on your cartridges now in terms of size let's just show you here we got a beekeeper 2.0 beekeeper 2.0 is taller but the arrow B is wide and slim it'll fit into the grooves of your pocket the ladies out there will fit in that small little slit on the side of the purse it's a very cool transportable durable unit so I hope you definitely check it out and try it if you're looking to really dial it on your vaping really sophisticated put all the predictability back into it so for the arrow B and

"3ZgJBoZwj-A": "hey guys is dabbe connection and we are taking a look at the eureka vapor syringe and doing a review and i've been hitting on this for a little while this is actually the second one of these got two of these and about one and a half way through and let's take a look at the oil actually first so nice clear oil this is from colorado you can see a little eureka logo on there this is the ATF coming a 96 percent THC very strong very high I'm out actually tried some of this on the Hermes 3 and I tried it on seeso because I was actually I like to whenever doing a hardware review we like to do a comparison of kind of what the baseline is and a cartridge we're familiar with so see so we know it's kind of like the standard and let me compare to that so this oil very good if the 96% really mean anything not really because there's oils that have been in 80s that have been just as strong in fact I would say the AMA oils from Nevada are just as strong as this there's actually been a couple am am I've been been a little bit stronger but this is still awesome oil this is great it's really Rica and here's what it looks like all I'm saying is it seems like when stuff gets to the 80s and above I don't think that the THC helps that much more I mean I've I've had stuff that was 80% that has been better stuff that was 92% so that that's happened quite a bit actually but still whatever the percentages on this 96 it is strong it is good it tastes good and another thing I like about Eureka is it doesn't have that co2 II taste like some of the co2 cards might have like I think the the rhythm cartridge kinda had like a co2 much taste this they've gotten rid of the co2 is taste and it reminds me of w Bates because w of apes also has co2 oil but it doesn't have that co2 II kind of odd taste to it it tastes more like a distillate kind of thing so let's take a hit of it so you can see what it looks like I've been hitting on this battery it hits nice and yeah the oil stays consistent seems to vape pretty slow absolutely nothing to complain about it was 60 for a full gram which you know compared to Nevada prices that's a very good deal compared to Colorado prices it's probably about normal and compared to California prices may be a little bit expensive but overall Eureka ATF definitely we get it again I think it's a quality product and I can't wait to try more Eureka stuff definitely we'll probably just keep getting eureka stuff when I'm in Colorado so there's nab connection two thumbs up for eureka vapor atf syringe thanks for watching and have a great week", "EpwTd3oyJcg": "[Music] hey it's mad at roughout studios and welcome to my review of the eros Janus pod and 5/10 cartridge vaporizer I would like to thank the guys at eros tech for setting up and sponsoring this review if you'd like to learn more or to purchase their products please visit eros tech shop calm now let's get started and take a look at what comes inside the box with the Janus you get the Janus vaporizer self very small handheld unit and a micro USB charging cable and that's it the instructions are on the actual box now let's take a closer look at the eros it does have a really cool like minimalist design that I like a lot the single power button on the front along with the logo on the side you have a micro USB charging port very convenient on the one side you have a 5-10 thread adapter that will fit any kind of 510 thread cartridge and on the other end you have the pod attachment that will fit the standard sized pod like a jewel pod for instance and then it's got a nice sort of anodized look to the texture as well alright now let's take a look at the functions and features at first we'll charge it up this unit was already charged pretty much all the way so anyway the light turns on and it flashes green or it just holds green until it cuts off and then it's fully charged you cut the unit on with five clicks of the unit and then you press the button down to activate it while you're actually taking a hit and then you had it three times if you want to adjust between the variable voltage which is three point four or three point seven and four point two volts it has the preheat function if you had it two times it'll lightly heat the tank so that have kind of cut down on the bubbling and popping the amount experienced and that's it once you've preheated it you just hit it one time to cut off the preheat and it's five times it to cut off the unit just like to cut it on again like I said this unit features the adaptability of both working with the regular standard Joule type pods as well as 510 cartridges it has that flat surface you know it'll work with pretty much any size pot or any size cartridge and the standard size pods [Music] alright so that brings us to the fun part for me is the usage and testing I'm gonna be trying this with some each use that we made with some turps and rosin and I'm also going to be using it with a jewel pod and I was really impressed with both performances it worked really good both with the jewel pods as well as with the cartridges and with a couple of different cartridges it performed well across the whole spectrum so it's really happy with the performance of it and that brings us to the results in scoring with the pros and cons we have that attractive minimalist design that works great for our pods and works on all 510 thread cartridges excellent performance on both has variable voltage at 3.4 3.7 4.2 volts it's got a decent size 650 ml and battery which kid works lasts for a while comes in many available colors and is under $30 I had a little bit of problems with the power button just getting it the right number of clicks but I'm still giving it five stars a great that it works with both types of vaporizers and that's really convenient so it's one size fits all great job there on Eris tech you can visit Eris tech amor eres tech shop calm to learn more about their products I

authenticity so here's the device it's very classy as you can see it's really small and just one press the 510 goes out you want to turn it on and off just click five times now for preheat function just press two times and it will preheat your atomizer for 10 seconds if you want to adjust the voltage just press three times and if you want to turn yourself just press five times again and as you can see they use the charging port or do use people for charging and it doesn't come with an atomizer so there goes the yuki by database so what are my thoughts it's classy its elegant it's tell it's

"N42l2Op8rgI": "hi guys and welcome back to another video if you're new here my name is Korra and today we're gonna talk about the exes snap this is a cartridge vaporizer basically it's a cart battery for heat settings limited edition a unicorn Edition so it's kind of sneak and of course colorful when you open it up it slides out and you have the battery then you have the refillable cartridge so you can refill that with whatever you want and then you have your extender for half gram cartridges and you have your magnetized extender or magnetized attachment I should say so let me get all these little pieces out and I will show you how they work so here we have our cartridge that I just have a little bit of CBD tincture in and then or CBD juice and then we have our magnetized attachment and we're just going to get that on there yada-yada and then from there we're going to just drop it down into the battery so that is what it looks like very sleek very pretty charger goes right there which it does come with a charger five clicks on we are on and then you have four heat settings and it's three clicks per setting so three clicks one two three and you go to the next setting I prefer mine on the red with the CBD stuff so Cheers yes so um actually I should show you what it looks like once you pull that open you have your instructions I love that it actually has decent instructions so many of these do not this is very detailed it has some warranty information on it and once you open this up you have your charger and that's a fairly decent looking charger it's not one of those el cheapo 6-inch chargers it's a decent link so yeah I really enjoy this battery and I think it would make it great addition to somebody's collection or if you just really need one and it's very pretty it's classy I kind of like it I kind of like it a lot Cheers so yeah thank you guys for watching if you enjoy this type of video review and please like and subscribe down below I try to post on a

guys Texas dev slinger here with another officially official pin battery review today we're gonna be going over the five svv variable voltage I love this little battery it's a slick little concealable unit and I can find these in town a different brand of course for about thirty to forty dollars this one on eBay is 998 free shipping so it's a steal it's got all your information on the back the three different heat settings along with the colors for the battery charge and all the other different conditional information so let's open this bad boy up to take a look all right so we're all opened up here and I ran take a look you got your rear battery you get your cord and then you also have these two little rings which I'm gonna show you how important those are in a second as far as the battery goes of course you do your one two three four five to turn it on this one's already turned on you can't really see but there's a it does label you the heat settings so to change the heat setting of a one two three now I'm at the lightest setting then the hottest which I kind of do either made or hot and then uh if you do a double click one two it's gonna do a 15-second preheat one thing I've noticed that this is if you do have a cartridge in there during your preheat you can actually go ahead and hit it it is gonna like give you a pretty decent hit while you're doing that so I don't know if you lose any if you don't but I just do for a safe keeping is per se so now it's good to go and then one two three four five turn it off it's a slick little unit I mean I love this thing now with that being said you want these little rings they're super important I got one of my empty cartridges right here that I'm gonna film myself and I put the ring on it already what this does is with that ring it adapts to this battery slide it right on and look at that slick little unit right there I really like this thing it's a great piece to have in a super concealable and does well I've had an I had a silver one I want to eat this gold one but my so everyone lasted me year and a half nope and they just finally gave out so I'm moving on to this one for another less than $10 thanks again for your time I'm gonna show you how it works hope you like my video guys like subscribe comment below them you know when I can do different takes a stab singer one more pin review see you next time thank you", "11gN1jQ310s": "hey guys is dab connection and we're checking out the magic 710 battery and it's great little battery it's got a 380 mAh capacity it's tiny it's like a little mini version of the silo it has great airflow the other thing I like about it it has this little red light here so when you're hitting it you can see that it's getting activated uses a magnetic connector and as their magnetic connector looks a little bit different it doesn't have the same airflow holes but it works great and I was hitting this before in a routes cart now I'm hitting it on a one I filled myself and transferring makes this battery but you might see it under different labels I believe they were like an OEM so you're gonna see different names for this battery but you know we found the lowest prices online I'll link to that below and yeah say I really I really like this thing this thing really hits good and it's the smallest battery of I've had and it's probably one of the smallest batteries out there really a great battery for cartridges and you know easy USB charging and I'll give it a head so you can see how see how it goes and and one thing on this is I like about the hits is it's very easy to keep drawing keep that close ah and but not too hot you get strong ribs yeah it's little battery packs a punch the battery lasts long definitely two thumbs up so that's the magic 7/10 battery thanks for watching guys we'll have a link to the more in-depth review with detailed pictures below and have a great week", "bjcmwxz6QFU": "Shh this is vague that again and this time I have a fix for a common problem with Atmos vaporizer pens this time the problems associated with the battery of the device itself and it's actually really easy to fix so really quick let's go over the problem that causes it and how you go about fixing it all right so here we have what can fix the problem the packing tool and what can cause the problem the charger it could be any number of things but I think that charge is the primary reason so as you can see I have you know a fully charged battery it lights up and the coral is working fine so I think what happens is I'm going to learn a little bit about how the device works this connecting piece this circular piece of the battery touches this corresponding piece here in the chamber when those two connect has an electrical current that will helps the heating coil light up the same thing that helps charge the battery but I think what happens is you might screw it on too tightly you know when you first meet resistance you should really let your device charge but if you screw past that you could accidentally lower you know this piece of your battery and if it gets pushed down too low it'll fail to make the connection with your heating chamber I can demonstrate this problem pretty easily just by taking the packing tool and pressing it that connecting piece down I can be pretty rough with it too because the fix is pretty effective so let's go and hook it up to the same exact heating chamber and you can see you know I'm powering it and it's not heating up this time so to fix it pretty simple take your packing tool taking this end and wedge it between the opening around that connecting piece in the battery and the outer edge and just push it up slightly you know spinning it around to kind of get an even elevation you want to get too rough but you want to make sure you raise it more than it was to begin with so now my battery connecting piece is raised again I can take my heating chamber connect it back and you can see I'm powering it up and we're lighting it up again so it's that quick that took about 10 seconds and your devices is back in business so just keep in mind you know when you're screwing these things on don't screw them too tightly when you first meet resistance you really should go ahead and and stop but if you run into this problem you know just take your packing tool raise that piece and you should be good to go so I hope that helps out", "r7x9Y6f0p6g": "oh thank you for watching I'll support appreciate it if you haven't subscribed yet feel free to hit the subscribe button to stay updated with all new content and episodes scuse me out so today we're not gonna be rolling anything that you know I don't know if you guys been watching but I've been doing some reviews on different devices as you can see I just was hitting them this is the leaf buddy th for 20 and excuse me I must say that you know it's it's pretty sturdy you know it's actually a pretty good device I dropped it a few times so it's cracked a little bit but you know through and through you know it's been it's been doing a good job for the chunk of time I had it you know there are a few things that you know you need to know first you mess with your device know your device because if you don't then the smallest thing can happen to it and then you'll end up thinking that you know it's broke basically so know your device watch another episode I got one about a few hacks in there so check it out if you haven't seen it but um so today I want to show you guys a different device and kind of threw me for curve because it's not even one of these things like this which are this one right here which is the ooze by crews the recommendation I wouldn't it just too many malfunctions I two of them and they're both broke so you know the recommendation on that one after further you know spending more time with it there I wouldn't really recommend it but one that I would recommend and the one that I'm gonna be showing you guys right here is this little buddy right here and you know it's the m3 and this is for C cell technology meaning that if your cartridge is not C cell then it will not work with this one but if you have an upgraded joke bait game to Elise on the C cell level then you know you got you a cartridge and it's not working or something like the weird stuff going on then hey you know you got to step your game up keep bobble at the time if you got a wick in your cartridge right now then you really need to you know evolve but if it has a hole at the bottom of it then you know this cartridge this battery will work with it because this cartridge pairs perfectly with cartridges that have holes at the bottom with the airflow at the body excuse me so like I said this is the m3 and we're gonna go ahead and give it a shot right now so the more on duties of a Mabuse about these different devices oh this is a brass knuckle cartridge right here by the way gorilla glue number four so we finna get this one open right here for you guys and get that money go ahead so any of the cartridges that have the airflow at the bottom then it'll work with this one but I was I've been learning a few things since I've been messing with these devices and that is one you need to know your cartridge a little better because sometimes if you don't then you could even put your cartridge on wrong battery or something and it won't hit and then you'll think that either the cartridge or the battery is not working so it's just a few little things that you really need to pay attention to because these are things that I'm kind of learning as I go along as I'm sharing them with you guys who whoever's watching this hopefully issue and hopefully you subscribe hit the notification I'm just kidding but the links in the description so there's a bunch of little things that I'm learning as I'm going along to it and I'm sharing them with you guys too but since I lost my little I have me a silver one it wasn't this m3 but it was a nice one and I had it for a while and since I lost that one then this is the first one that you know I had other than like I said the crews in I had a bunch of them I had this one right here and these ones right here or a gamble they're really gamble and you know it's up to you sometimes they work sometimes they don't if you go to the smoke shop sometimes they have like no refund policy so you went ahead and bought you a device and it didn't work and then they didn't have a no refund policy and it just gave you a whole bad experience in about the vaping and then they left it alone so you know there's just different stuff but I'm going to show you guys a few things take a few and we're going to hit a few and then you know hopefully you make a better decision what you want to do when it comes to vaping so first thing I want to do is show you this right here because you know this shatter house right here which is an excellent brand but their cartridge is not the C cell so it has a flat head at the bottom so with this cartridge it does what this battery excuse me it does not operate now that's not a bad thing because you know the market is converting over to pretty much see CEL standard so when you get cartridges like these sometimes it could just the overstock or people just trying to get the cheap cartridges they can get them off because they have them before csail became so dominant in the market so also this is another push button this is air pool so you just hit it and it operates but as you can see see nothing so and that reason is because this little flat head there's no hole at the bottom because this is a different kind of cartridge this is a glass airflow and as you can see right there at the bottom this one has the hole at the bottom so that one's not going to work so now if somebody grabbed this in this cartridge and put them together and didn't really know wasn't up on the informational knowledge on Bateman then automatically they're gonna be they're gonna think that they got scammed the cartridge is no good the battery is no good they might get mad at run back to the where you see so there's a bunch of different things but that's why I'm making this video just for you hopefully you watching it all the way through so now this one right here it has a hole at the bottom and this one has the hole m3 so you just power that up like that there also I do want to say cuz um if you just put a fresh cartridge on to the battery this doesn't have a preheat so if you just take a hit and don't really get that big up hit then you might think that it's not really that powerful but trust and believe this bad boy is powerful so you know see right now all right let's get a little seat now now you see that's a nice little hit coming out of this little bad boy right here is 2 m3 this has a 10-second full time so you can hit it for 10 seconds as you can see me I'd like to get the multiple hits and when you get that full full full you know experience and a matter of fact you're gonna hit that that's that Gorilla Glue you know I appreciate you guys stopping by yeah so this is the m3 this is 350 mah I'm still learning a little bit about that but yes mili-amp free something per hour and that's what that means so this is this has 350 it's a 50 minute charge time full charge time to charge full this has 650 mah right here so that just gives you a little little grasp of it and as you've seen the cloud that came out it's pretty decent so let's see right here you see you see so it's not that bad recommendation always try to keep your device fully charged as much as possible for optimum performance so that way you don't wonder why the quality of the hits went down so make sure that you keep your battery charged up and go get you one moment before we go you know and then or not no I appreciate you guys the links in the description make sure that you watch some of them other videos I got some interviews coming up on the way with some new artists so make sure you guys go ahead and check that out man I appreciate our to support everybody especially the people who really watching and staying tuned in you know it means a lot more than you think make sure you go ahead and drop something off in the comments like subscribe anything look at that smoke right there told you no it it it", "tUko3-NG3SY": "how's it going guys I'm Ben this is gremlin aka Mason he's with stag vapor company and he's got some products to show us yeah fire quicker and brighter we fire for four and a half times longer than your average pen we've got a resin injected body for increased durability which makes our battery Danny instruct destructible USB pass-through use it while it's charging we're going to show you it what's cool about it my skillet kit this one was featured in the High Times major pen buyer's guide for 2014 we took fourth place in the standard pen category and the skillets pretty much what an oil pen it's actually yes so it works for any kind of oil crumble shatter you put it right in here and you press the button you can see how fast we we fire right up and then it goes for a full 45 seconds which means anybody who thinks that they can't get a full hit on a favorite band when they're shutting off in 10 seconds and taking five six seconds to get hot has no problem getting one up yeah that thing staying lit for a while now yeah definitely so that's cool and I'm gonna let that thing sit there well I just show this is our glow kit big difference on our globe is that our nails don't have slits on the side other ones leak out they're all laser engraved with our logo on it and they all fire up just like that so yeah the ones again they can take up to five six seconds to even get hot they shut off after yeah no splits and no leakage that's that's key nice assurance nice nice and see this has still been on the whole design about the flash off any second there's no way I could date a and that's the fat launch behind me that would kill me so we call the stag 45-second challenge this is our stealth glow kit and our stealth skillet kit surround the wick is all we use on this we have silica and surrounded wick on there quick point on those people asked which is the difference and which one's better silica is gonna be a bigger hit the ceramic is gonna be a cleaner tasting it so if you have like tabled abs you're looking just to get you like a really good hit you want to go silica because it's gonna be clean but it's also gonna give you a good distribution of all the surface area of all those fibers giving you a good pack on your punch you want the good clean hit you just kind of go with the ceramic because there's less any kind of residual left over between hits the ceramic stays clean you didn't enjoy the texture for the people that don't know what the silica is the silica is basically just a wick and the ceramic is the ceramic wick right yeah they're both they're both forms that we found know if you get those close enough to show between our stealth skill acute and our stealth cloak it however is the nails that come with the stealth cloak it our mag nails twice the size we we use them also for our flower and I'm gonna demonstrate that in a minute as well so if you want to get double the size hits on your on your batter you're gonna go with that so the pen that pen can work with both atomizers for flour and oil exactly exactly nice so the last thing that we got going on so again the the globe kit right there silica and ceramic wick skillet original is silica and surrounded we call them the skillet bowls stealth is just the ceramic wick only two of them a note to atomizers lanyard having tool charging cable all of them come 45 second battery USB pass the batteries or resin injected for increased durability which means that instead of it just being a hollow tube that pops open on everybody else's batteries there we've got a resin epoxy in there and it makes them silly they don't break I had a nice feature cuz I've had them in my pocket where they pop off and I hate that [ __ ] and yeah you tested this out the other day with me and I couldn't even break it off so I mean if you're really tried really hard you might but and we still have a good time when also our ports don't press down either and I mean super durable battery hassle free warranty if anything ever does happen to nature to it's pretty cool definitely our last and newest feature is our dab globe attachment this is direct inject for your vapor pen what's going on with this is instead of relying on the airflow from the bottom going through your pen you're able to now control temperature and air flow with your finger as a carb cap on top nice making it just milk up for super super super big hits and that's sweet we think we should get that testing to show people how that how that works so good feature I really like that a lot we're going to do the flower first because pretty much that dad loves gonna wreck me it is well I have live 40 grand with no problem so there I mean you just take I'm not even grinding this up I'm just broke it up into four pieces there's the first piece I put the second piece in there but you just put the plug directly - there's the third piece and fourth piece I just dropped with a piece I'm a parent at a little teaser here and we'll get that now so here's the big thing you can't twist it and pack it all right but you can press down and put the pressure on it no problem all right so that's cool you get it in there this is a dome I blew it's cool we have a whole bunch of custom hand blowing domes as well nice and yeah I'm gonna do press the button for a second is it - I mean I worked pretty good sweep decent yeah and that's all been on the same you do and that's on a regular pen size herb vaporizer which is pretty cool usually the herb vaporizer these days are a little bit beefier than and then you just blow it out and it's clean you don't have to get in there and tool also with any of our attachments if you just once a week go through and let them just soak in a little bit out all upside down it's gonna prolong the life of every single one you got explain the life entire atomizer you can just put right in alcohol um you can but a lot of people just you know just getting a little saucer that's you know got a quarter you know let it soak so yeah it's cool you want to make sure it's dry before you go and use it and be for sure cool so that was that that works great you saw that super simple none of that grinding spring chamber thing that you got on other ones so I mean if people are gonna ask - well hey you know that's not all understand vaporizing where the best burden or attachment on the market that's burner attachment it's going to burn a little bit on that flower but yeah nope sup nice sweet you're getting like full-sized dad out of this Pat yeah that's pretty sweet that's the hit you want to spew and that's the whole dad to be you guys that's it they're nice so that's everything we got going on stag vapor

"0TuLdvK6BTE": "VapeFully Presents Hi Guys! This is Emma from Vapefully.com and today I\u2019m gonna do a review of the Linx Gaia Vaporizer. The Linx Gaia is the latest portable dry herb vaporizer from well-known vape pen manufacturer, Linx Vapor. Just like all other products from Linx Vapor, Linx Gaia is a high-end, high quality and very well built vaporizer. It looks just like an e-cig box mod, so it very stealthy, which is great. The casing is made of metal, what makes it study, hard to break and very elegant looking. Besides the great looks of the Linx Gaia Vaporizer, what\u2019s more important it\u2019s performance and I have to say it\u2019s absolutely top-notch! It is the first vaporizer in the world featuring an all-quartz heating chamber. This results in the vapor\u2019s super pure taste which I absolutely love to be honest! The mouthpiece is made of glass as well and features a magnetic cap that protects it from accidentally breaking. The Linx Gaia utilizes a hybrid, convection/conduction heating system that ensures both great efficiency and even heating of your herbal material, so no stirring is required. The vapor quality is very good \u2013 it\u2019s extremely flavorful, smooth and potent. So if you\u2019re a flavor-chaser just like me, you\u2019ll be more than happy with this vape. The heat-up is almost instant \u2013 the Linx Gaia only needs around 20 seconds to reach the vaporization temperature and that\u2019s great. On the side of the unit there is a big and easy to read OLED display and 2 buttons that allow precise temperature control \u2013 you can adjust it in 1-degree increments, which is cool and allows full customization of vapor potency and thickness. At the bottom of the Linx Gaia Vaporizer you will find a magnetic packing tool, which is very handy and well thought-out. The battery life is good, too \u2013 you\u2019ll get up to 2 hours of continuous use per charge, so that\u2019s really impressive. OK, so what are the downsides of the Linx Gaia? It is quite easy to loose the magnetic cap of the mouthpiece if you\u2019re not careful, so keep that in mind. User-replaceable battery is always a desired feature, but in the Linx Gaia the battery is built-in and non-replaceable. As you can see, these are not huge downsides, so generally it is a really amazing vaporizer, especially for the price. So far I\u2019m loving Linx Gaia and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re gonna love it, too!", "X3tTjQeDblo": "hello everyone and welcome to my first ever youtube video now in this video i'm going to be doing a review of this here this pocket vertical now it took about three months to finally get this as they just released these and did the pre-order so it took a while for them to get the every single color out now to go here from the first go it is a very beautiful packaging as you can see for this one it is called the pacific for their color and i really love the detail they put into it i mean even though this is just a slap-on sticker i love the fact that each packaging every sticker on here has the color dedicated to which battery you got as they have different colors they have the midnight which is black the rustic which is kind of like a copper color the indico which is purple and a humboldt which is a goldish green now just looking at the packaging it's just it's just been amazing i love the way they went with it the triangular design to it i think they really put a lot of thought into this packaging as you can see they actually even dedicated the names of it to let's see if you can see it yep just right the color as it shows it shows that it's there says five power settings which we'll go over it's a usbc type charger it can take any type of cartridge i haven't had any problems it's a screw top so no magnetic and it's the thing that did throw it for me was the 380 milliamps but the way its design has been completely amazing and um i don't know how long it's going to last compared to other batteries out there but we'll give it some time and then i'll come back with a review to see how well that does now when you open it it is magnetically charged well magnetically clasped and so that's a really nice simple thing there i think they did and then you just see here how it just goes over the things to avoid and all that like don't leave it outside in the heat and the cold and so on and then you continue to open it and it's just sitting in here like this so i think the the way they thought with this packaging was a lot better for than their previous battery that they have released now it just goes over the main functions the simple stuff like most people know the five clicks on um and then it will show it'll bring up an led around the light that shows that it comes on and it is a manual fire so it is a push button you don't just draw and it comes starts going like a c cell silo or the the palms or the even their other pocket one plus um so there is five power modes it is pretty simple i do like the way they made it to go through instead of just having to double click every time to change the setting it's we'll see when we get there then one click does show if the back how well the battery is if it's load getting low and whatnot and then it's nice how they do have the color codes to each voltage setting now it's definitely easy charge most nowadays everyone takes a usbc so it's very nice now we'll take it out of here as you see it is nice and snugly fit into here with just using some foam padding on the top and bottom so they really made that tight and as you see this is the pacific you can see it really pops it's all aluminum it's got a nice weighty feel to it um the button i think is very responsive oh it definitely is pretty nice i it's very clicky it's very snappy like you would want it to be and there's the charging port one thing i haven't noticed is about standing but i don't know how many of you really care if you can stand up or not but then the inside there so and then the only other thing in here is just the cable which i'll show you as well it's just a simple braided cable with their emblem on from usb to usbc but put that away so here's the device i mean the size is really it's very great i mean if you compare it to like a normal big pen i mean it's pretty slim it's pretty small or even two let's see well here's another battery i've had from another company just from a local store and like the size of it is considerably better now great thing i also liked is as you can see it kind of goes in deeper versus having to just set it right on top so it helps with sticking the cartridge in more so it's not sticking out as much now let's see if we can do another size comparison to just a big lighter that's very or even here here's our old one this is the humboldt their oneplus and even the size-wise thing is nice like this one's very hefty it's i think 200 milliamps more than this vertical but it is a magnetic so you got to have these little adapters to do and i think it just gets confusing to have to keep count of all of them and track of them as you can see how much different it is it's a lot more sleek it's a lot slimmer i definitely like this a lot more so far now just turn it on with the five clicks one two three four five there we go sometimes now as you saw it showed the light coming on it blinked a few times now let's just see the power level your green there as you can see so that's nice now the way they do the power levels i like versus a lot of other ones especially this one like this one you got double click every time to go through and it only has three settings where this one you double click and then it comes up with a light and then you click it again and you can just cycle through the settings as the high low that is the second lowest the medium setting uh that's the 3.54 so the second to highest and then the purple now it says to hold down like this to do it i'm not necessarily sure i think that's right it'll go back yep that's right i did find another way you could do it is just double click again on it and it'll come up white because then once you go to hit it no it doesn't even do it so as you go to actually drive and i'll let you see what it does it shows what color you have full on voltage that you're at so that's really nice so you don't have to kind of think around like a what voltage setting am i at so when you go to hit it bam see it just lights up so now that is about it for this i mean it's a great quality aluminum i definitely highly recommend it if you are into the more pin type something very slim now when i got mine it was about 50 bucks for a pre-order so it was coming with some extra stuff with some of their new products coming out and now they're ranging about 59.95 so they are up there in price compared to other batteries out there but for the quality and what it has to give and the colors i definitely like the prints in here i i definitely think it was worth it now to go over some of their new products that came so with the pre-order it came with this new pocket smell proof bag versus their old bag which is this little felt bag which i definitely wasn't privy to at all i mean there wasn't much to i could do with it i mean stuff will roll around i'm kind of picky about my things i want them to be very nice and orderly so some of the other things that came with besides their new smell proof bag is they sent each one with a custom color each so this is one of their new wood drip tips and i thought it was pretty nice i liked how they packaged it up in the glass here put their emblem some design by you'll see it right of course the light wants to be fickle as far as ceramic and then as you see there's a velcro open fold over and then in here it's actually more velcro a little bit more secure you can kind of see in there so i think they did a good job with this i like it a lot i might actually use it and then here's the keychain apparatus piece to be able to put an extra cartridge in i've already tried it there's nothing in here right now but i like how it's got the little rubber tip so when you do put something in there it's not it's got a little extra cushion to hold it more tightly without like being metal on the plastic or metal or metal and ruin you your bit and it was nice that again that everything was colored too now the new snap tool as it's called is a little bit different color than um then the vertical as you can kind of see we'll put it with the background like that by the way i think it's a great job and i think it's amazing that they color-coded matched everything with and then it just also came which is one of their spark cartridges one of their new ones without the the magnetic adapters this one's supposed to be the black one i don't like it i haven't used it yet so i don't know how well they are but i plan to go get some stuff to try it out here soon but yeah if so that's about it uh all the all the new vertical battery that they came out with and some of their new other products that they did and i really do like these drip tips honestly they came out really amazing i think they all look different let's see if they'll do it oh there we go but you can see all the detail in it that no two is the same i like all the different little accents that it is it's pretty awesome i'll be trying that out here soon yeah um so i've tried this at every setting the i think the medium setting the 3.09 volts has been one of my more favorites this thing wants to be there we go and i think it's just a phenomenal battery so far the quality the build it's been great battery life i definitely will probably be buying another one i i like it a lot i've gone through quite a few batteries and maybe i'll just wait till there's another sale we'll see but i do hope you enjoyed this review and that helped you learn a little bit more about this new battery from the company pocket thank you and have a good day", "9DvRUBTDffM": "[Music] hi mark Johansson devices today I'm going to show you our new Tombstone 510 thread battery open the box up instruction sheet to be right there pull the device out and inside this little side here is gonna be the micro USB charger along with our little dummy ear plug and also an extra set up our rings alright let me show you how these contents work first first of all a standard micro USB charger this including hitting a standard USB port of home right here charge find some problems approximately one and a half hours all right these little rings these are seal their rings for all intensive purposes you'll never need to use them they go right around the bottom of the base where the cartridge is plug into we include some extra simply cos never know but doing that's a test and they've last really well and that's here this is a dummy put that we use when we only have one cartridge available you can plug this into any either ports and then you can go ahead and insert your cart and then you have one cart that you're gonna be using at the moment alright where the quick here when it closes right aside and we talk about instruction sheet there all the information will be right on the back here stand information battery capacity a voltage charge time all that stuff right here any questions please check out our website for the strategies alright as far as actually usage of the battery guys we already had that dummy plug-in so I'm gonna take another carts and I'll plug in this other port here I will then get the cover and slide back down when you're putting the cover on it has a little track system here so just make sure you get that lined up and it slider right there is an auto draw battery there's no on/off button or buttons to push simply inhale take a drug right at the top here and here and that's just with one card all right and open this guy up real quick and I'm gonna go ahead and kick this plug out here sir second cart so you can see both carts do hit at the same time so it'll vary just your levels simply depends what type of carts you're using if you're using same or different they do actually draw fairly even for the most part all right in the circuit cover back on again let me just take a draw at the top here you get a little larger hit now I'm gonna show you a little trick you're at the bottom of the device here microwaves be over here on this side little hard to see these are the air intake holes you can actually use this like a carb on a ball on this if you want a larger hit you're in a cupboard I like to cover it open and close a bit there we go thank you even larger hit out take the curt's out real quick here one go over some quick little maintenance they don't want to do with your tombstone battery and I do this probably about once a week simply cleaning the little base here with a thumb screw into standard q-tip a little bit of alcohol and then I'm just gonna clone these guys out some cartridges may have a little residual oil so this way just helps to make a good connection and keeps everything clean and running the way it's supposed to that Iraq's just insert my cards back in also when we're think a lot of times I actually clean the threads or the carts as well that's always a good idea to just keep everything nice and clean do cover back on the top again when you're back going again now as far as our packaging goes they come in a ten pack nice and close box here with a product on the cover it also breaks down to a nice open retail display like how many collections please check our website at www.cannainsider.com/itunes you", "ovHfSi35OmQ": "exes vapes newest addition is changing the way

been having time to do things you know and I'm just I'm just happy I'm contented there's no reason to not be content and let's get to it man this thing looks so sleek it's so nice alright you kind of punched number 72 make sure you guys are smoking along with me if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over whatever it is in your legal state man only legal patients only so cheers guys let's see if we get the raw garden logo right there all right so just to touch base on the battery real quick this has literally no airflow whatsoever so when you're hitting it it feels like you're heating a clogged car as for with the pocky battery yes sir holy moly first hit of the day got me no jokes it's already noon and I still have any anything this is my first card of the day but that thing I already got me fade I'm telling you man yesterday was a good video it was a good video but it was just too dark to give it to you guys meant to wait too dark so yeah pocket vapor ultimate airflow dude ultimate [ __ ] airflow all right now now getting into the review boys so right off that initial Wow dude right off that initial hit it did the same thing to me yesterday it tastes a lot like Barry's super super super berry like it I'm for sure it has to have a cross train of purple punch in it because it's super berry super super berry like I'm talking about this the first hit the first initial hit man you're gonna get a pungent in his super mouth filling of berries bro and it's not like artificial berries to it's like you know aftertaste after you drink like after you eat a grape in shading you got the aftertaste of like a grape it's kind of similar man so the taste is [ __ ] phenomenal off this it doesn't really have too much of a cushy vibe to it or too much of like a you know a tree game going but we're gonna hit it maybe we could get something out of it but before we do let's go ahead and switch it onto the king itself the pocket labor battery mint you get the ultimate airflow a nice ass temperature you know get the most out of your cartridge man you guys should be getting up a battery like this how you guys shoot because it makes your experience so much more enjoyable man I know got dry lips excuse that guys all right pocket vapor in now so I think off of this one we're gonna be hitting it off the orange setting I think is or in your setting so I think this is like the middle the middle setting so let's see what let's see how it goes boys just listen I don't know if you guys can listen to this I'm gonna try to get as close as possible but try to listen to the airflow I try to listen to the airflow Oh holy [ __ ] no joke that clapped me that got me boys that got you bought whoa all right that's it that [ __ ] smacked me for sure not gonna be using that setting that's the setting that you put when you want to kill somebody dude seriously are you looking to just get super faded and that wasn't even the hottest setting dude the hottest setting is red I'm about to show you guys one time man I'm about to show you guys one time all right not just let me talk over it so that hey right there you guys heard the maximum airflow right maximum airflow is so [ __ ] nice on a cartridge man like when you're hitting something on a restricted cart like battery it's so horrible man because it's you're literally not getting enough airflow so you're burning up the coil at first of all slowly but surely you're burning up so that's why you get like a weird taste - you're not getting like a super you know fruity taste or whatever your cartridge is supposed to be tasting like it's probably the airflow man you're probably burning up the coil you know and it's just gunking up in there so I do recommend going out and buy this man you already know the deal and if you don't want to buy it man you could be one of the lucky one one person one person is going to be winning one of these right here this color right here right now so I'm gonna be doing a giveaway by the time you guys see this video go ahead and click on my Instagram and go follow my Instagram and pocky vapor and my gaming team prophecy gaming so I'll put all three of those accounts down below and we will be choosing one person win right and we will be giving them away a shirt also so make sure to do that man and tag your friends tag your friends and more people the better and you the more people you tag the better the higher your chances are of winning all right so let's go ahead and hit this on the red setting man cuz that hit was so good so freakin good it tasted so pungent you got me like smacked they literally smacked me right in my face I still know tree like you know no earthy earthy taste to it so this is more likely on the fruitier side of raw garden mmm cheers boys whoo oh my gosh that red setting is amazing oh yes sir oh that thing claps oh you guys need to go buy this right now you guys heard it here first if you're smoking cartridges and you guys don't have this battery you're [ __ ] up oh my gosh that was amazing I'm nyan cat that was amazing this cartridge is sitting literally all right remember to use this this thing is sitting at 80 percent THC right 80 percent total cannabinoids and and all right so let me just do a little let me show you yes and then that last raw garden cartridge that I got was at a 90 right dojo cush it was super amazing so super super smacked but I was getting most of the feeling because it was a cush strain right so that means that this this right here this has absolutely no cush at all in it it's just a bunch of fruity strains that they had that rubber and made up and it's smacking me just as hard if not harder as the dojo cush so it's sitting that at 80 percent THC so doo doo TC percentages really matter is what I'm trying to get at do they really matter or is it what strains they mix it with because tell you the truth I've had [ __ ] 93 percent cartridges and they don't they don't do [ __ ] like I'm dead serious they don't do anything for me so and I've noticed that a lot of lower end TC percentage cartridges smack me like a little like boom like I'm having a session I'm just like out after like 2 to 3 hits so raw garden you're doing phenomenal job with this frickin ucae punch like they're doing such great jobs I know this week they release a lot more flavor so by the time you guys see this I want you guys to hit that notification bill hit that subscribe button because we if you got especially if you smell Kroger mmm because we're gonna be keeping you updated with the weekly flavors and which one you should be getting so let's get it boys I'm gonna take another one on rent and go ahead and end the video out here actually I'll probably take it on the lowest setting that way you guys can see the clouds on that and end it out here and then give you guys the full review on this and get to the movement you know so cheers boys if you guys are 18 over 21 over you already know the deal like I said earlier alright that was a low setting but as you guys could see there and switch to the rainbow colors right it switched to the freakin rainbow colors and that I think from when I remember is like sesh mode and he keeps going after like more than ten seconds that one was super light super light in clouds but the taste oh we super tippy yo I'm telling you guys raw garden damn regarding and pocky vapor or literally the best combination ever so go ahead and use that affiliate code go use that code semi G get 15% off it'll support your boy and it'll chip some money off of your pockets too so let's get it boys I hope let's get into the final review of the raw garden cartridge tell us is true this thing smacks your auger and definitely knows what they're doing I feel like what they're trying to do in order it like yeah they always release new strains but I feel like what they're trying to do they're trying to create a vault of like super specific streams that they like that are super like you know fan favorites and they're gonna be keeping those in the history of lineage of like seeds and stuff like that but you've got punch number 72 is a banger dude it's super berry no it's very very like note honestly no tones of earthiness at all it's more on the berry sweeter side but if you guys have been using raw garden you guys know what kind of like sweetness it is it's not fake it's super super nice like something you would get off of a flower and the hymen the highest phenomenal I would give it an 8 out of 10 tell you the truth like the only reason I wouldn't give it a 10 out of 10 is because I since I have such a high tolerance I feel like it's not hitting me in a full effect but and then also an indica is usually super super cash luck but this one I'm like I'm relaxed I'm relaxed but I feel like I can still function which is good you know I'm not really hating on that so overall quality I'll probably give this a 10 out of 10 I'm 9 out of 10 Man 9 out of 10 it could use a little work like I said on the indica putting you a little bit more to sleep but overall man the quality raw garden never fails so if you guys are legal and illegal stay somewhere where you can get regardin years no you guys should hit them up see where you can find it legally so we're gonna end the video here if you guys enjoyed today's video man like I did go ahead and leave a sub it helps way more than you think and smash that [ __ ] like button and leave a comment I like to interact with everybody tell you guys the truth ie I interact with everybody so yeah let's keep it going boys and we'll catch you guys later", "IzLl6UezmwI": "yo was poppy you too was cranky Excel today guess what got a [ __ ] review this is a review that's a vape yeah yeah yeah you know let me get I have to get over it they got all sorts of different types of colors but I want it red definitely let's unbox this beer I want it I want the black or like yeah I want the UH the all black boil or a little silver one order wouldn't tip one I was good on those yeah no ma'am anyways push it over so uh-huh get in the box you know basically is I telling you what the [ __ ] is all included oh look like almost I'm opening up bracelet or you know an Apple watch oh oh put a little fire maybe straight out the box review yeah him straight out the [ __ ] box Wow okay Wow oh my god the feel of my hand is lovely okay so as you see we got hard streets already in here but of course numbnuts can't smoke anything out of this you can't even put no oil in that it has no coils at all is just just efficient no I'm saying okay do none of that I so the reason why I bought did be is because I've seen a youtuber crunch for 20 he had in that beat a little grow so basically I got it looked at something musical I officially bought it and I'm like yeah I gotta get it um it was a little steep for this it was $100 but they got a payment plan where you could do like 28 34 for I don't like for payments who makes a pay at home for um another cool feature that I like is that there is no like you don't have that on twist [ __ ] you ain't gotta take your cart to charge it it's magnetic do straight in there like that straight magnetic I'm saying I like that I also like the fact that it has you see these little holes right there it has you know little airflow holes so when I'm taking a really deep pit I cannot get a pull through without crushing my lungs I got a cartridge right yeah I'm saying we're gonna take the bottom piece off okay and the thing about this the cartridge is so thin and not why I don't have to take the you know the airflow piece off that kind of like you know basically I would take this tip off too if there was a 5-10 cartridge so if it was like a thicker one but luckily me it was Clement this pen has three different types of settings which is low medium and high so you click one two three four five it's on one two three four five it blake's let me know that song all right tell them take a hit oh I could really taste the blueberry really okay one two three four five I mean not one two three four five times it on nothing clicking I turn it back on one two three changes the setting I want to the three chains as a setting one two three changes of setting so I'm a sole man okay so basically like I was pronounced on inside of this box are instructions on the power levels so blue ever the lowest medium is yellow you know and I have red or a little purple whatever you want to call it five times on an on-off three times the cycle power level okay what I also like about this pen is that on if I were to leave is in my pocket it wouldn't just stay on it would like you got this automatic shelf no I'm saying so I like that you know I'm saying I think that's pretty awesome yeah I think that that's dope I got a one-year warranty on it you know just in case anything goes wrong with it but yeah so if you have a cartridge that is a little bit thicker than this you would have to take this off because other than that it will not be able to go and see how easy it is to take the toys off it wouldn't be able to fit in there you would have to uncle did you know what's yeah other than that I'm already under the way you know I'm gonna hit and take a hit once a little 30 I don't want it high so one two three it's all medium one two three it's that as long as that's real love but I could taste the blueberry in this that I got I love it hey vassal I need you to put me on with some some more tea pens I'm already in love with you Thanks check me out", "RF9fMKHIKwg": "hi I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we're gonna be talking about troubleshooting your beekeeper vaporizer our team here at honey stick really strives to bring you the best quality products so that they work flawlessly outside the box and for several years to come to provide you with vaping pleasure but occasionally customers call in and say that one works or doesn't work as they had intended so what this is gonna do is if you are having trouble with your beekeeper you're gonna watch this video we're gonna walk through a quick checklist to make sure you covered all your bases to ensure that your vaporizer is working properly and if you go through the checklist and it still doesn't work please do email our support line or give us a call and we'll make sure to take care of your honey stick because as everybody knows we stand behind our products so you get your beekeeper in the mail the first thing that you should do is charge your unit charging your unit is really easy you simply plug in the charging cable provided into the little open port and you're gonna leave it on for about two-and-a-half hours I tell everybody to make sure if they use a wall adapter and not you know a laptop or you know power strips of that sort because you want consistent current I would also advise you not to use an apple power wall adapter because Apple specifically designs their units to work for their devices and cables the best so it's not going to give you a full full charge I suggest you use any other brand or just any off-the-shelf multi travel charger or whatever so once your units fully charged we get this question a lot I'm pushing the button and it's not vaping and I know a lot of you vape experts are gonna think this is a little elementary but you have to click the button five times rapidly to on your unit when you get it and when you click it you're gonna get a little blue light that flashes and you can also see it through there well with the light on it's hard to see but there's a little blue light flashing there so once the blue light is on and you have a cartridge in you have to push and hold this button down while you are vaping so if you're not holding the button you're not going to get any vapor and you have to push and hold that button throughout the duration of your inhale now next if you have purchased a prefilled cartridge that is already filled up you take your magnet and you screw it on to that cartridge now sometimes people say that it doesn't work a lot of times it doesn't work because you don't have the magnet screwed on all the way so it's not making a full electrical connection make sure you don't have to over tighten just make sure it's on all the way and it's hand tight before you drop it in and then you simply drop it into your unit and then you push and hold and you would be ready to vape now if you are filling the cartridge itself that came with the kit please watch our other video on our YouTube channel vapor store direct and it's a very detailed step-by-step on how to fill up your beekeeper cartridge okay so if you have this and you bought a cartridge and it still doesn't work what I tell people to do is to take that cartridge and if you have any other vape battery around test it out with that other vape battery several times you can buy a cartridge prefilled from a dispensary and it turns out that the cartridge itself is defective and the unit is just fine so if you try it on another of a battery or old unit or whatever and it doesn't work then you should go back to the dispensary and tell them that you have a cartridge that doesn't work and see what they can do for you and making sure that you get a replacement so if you have a cartridge and it works on another battery and it still doesn't work on your bee keeper or your bee keeper is not holding a charge at that point we want you to email us at support at vape honey stick comm and let us know that you're having a problem and let us know what your order number was from our website and what the symptoms are and he went through the checklist and what we're gonna do is we reach out to you and see whatever we could do to help you or get you a replacement part maybe your magnet isn't working or something like that but we will take care of you so please watch our videos read the instruction manuals that come with the unit and let us know if you're having any problems for this beekeeper and several other cool items check us out of a Pawnee stick comm use my promo code honey 420 for this and several other cool items thanks for tuning in guys to vape responsibly", "sypgugd6ODU": "what is up YouTube I'm back with another fire video we just pumped the last video out a couple minutes ago Wham we're gonna put the tombstone video

make a quick little video because honestly it's been a long day so I'm not really like in the spirits to make a video but I do want to make a video you know I want to have a video made for you guys tomorrow because I've been keeping it consistent so this is my attempt to making a video on a lazy day well even though it's been productive so into the introduction to the video topic today guys I'll be showing you guys my favorite baddie battery baddie for short [ __ ] and then we're gonna be show it we're gonna be going into higher def of the Alpine live resin cartridges we're gonna be hitting both the gorilla glue number 4 and the true OG it's just gonna be a chill sesh imma be telling you guys what I like about these products and why I choose the stick it was battery over other batteries because as you guys know I have had the opportunity to try so many batteries as of late and they've been great there's been a lot of great ones there's been a lot of bad ones so I want to tell you guys why I choose this one over the other ones that I've tried so far so since it is already gonna be night time I'm gonna go ahead and hit this with the indica first I shot my head with the hybrid first gorilla glue number four and then we're gonna go straight into the true orgy right after we're gonna had a piece of lint in my freaking mouth so right here guys you got the girl the glue number four not sure if that's focused in or not but gorilla glue number four and got the battery fully charged dude so go ahead and screw that on here and man it's kind of hot it's it's spring time already yeah like I think it officially hit spring and it's starting to get hot the worm is starting to kick in man and it's finally not cold which is cool you know even though I enjoyed the cold I definitely didn't enjoy the days that it was so so freezing to the point where I had to be covered in two blankets but if you guys are 18 you know where 21 over make sure you guys are hitting this along with me let me know what you guys are hitting in the comments below man it has been a long day my mind it's kind of like scattered right now like I said I didn't I wasn't going to make a video but here I am for you guys the dedication and consistency so whose battery my resident Alpine gorilla glue number four cheers boys ooh there's so amazing about Alpine vapora has to have by far the best gorilla glue number four in the world dude they nail it to the point to the point and for sure so when taking another hit and then I'm probably gonna [ __ ] do you know I'm probably gonna just turn the air on for a little bit oh sure I just cracked the window it is a beautiful little day-out pledge crack the window a little bit this one too and we're gonna take another hit and I'm gonna tell you guys why I like this battery more than any other battery that I've tried so far so I'm actually packing it closes because there's people playing music and I don't want their music to overlap mine so just gonna have to stick with the air on us can barely hear anyways man that is amazing right already starting to sweat man these summer days these spring and summer days are so amazing it's definitely one of my favorite seasons to smoke in by far I do not enjoy any other season than summer scene the smoking like just being able to enjoy smoking at any place like outside especially dude that was the biggest hurt of the winter and the cold season I was not being able to smoke outside so onto the importance of this battery man so this battery it costed me I think 15 bucks I bought this myself this isn't sponsored at all by use this was a hundred percent me I went to go buy to smoke shop when I was waiting on some other batteries survive and they didn't arrive on time and I had some product knowledge like you know what I dude I'm just even go out and buy a battery because I want to hurry up and try this so I never go into my local smoke shop and they had this battery and it really stood out because I have seen I had seen him around but I thought they were just cheapy batteries and then honestly this was this was the best quality one at that smoke shop and then I was like you know whatever just give it to me give it to me 15 bucks isn't too bad so I bought it and when I opened yeah I was like I was like oh wow like it wasn't as cheap as I thought it was gonna be so I looked in like I got it looked into it and then the material is very very nice the finish is the kind of has like a matte finish they have different colors obviously I just chose the green because it was the best one that they had and one thing that I like about this the first thing that really caught my attention was the variable wattage is on the bottom the turn knob so for $15 the fact that you're getting variable wattage with a turn knob is amazing dude bad batteries out here charging literally 25 to 30 dollars for something like this and they're ugly they're fat batteries and this one is just so thin and so like clean looking and nice and it goes up um it's from 3.3 volts all the way up to four point eight so that's pretty nice who is you really did a good job man they have the little holes right here that you could put any cartridge on this no air flow airflow restriction will be added on so like I said man this this is a very very nice battery and this is why I like it over other ones because you could fit anyone it's stealthy light not like the other ones you know it's nice having it's nice having the other batteries that you can do cool stuff like the preheat function but when do you honestly need a pre heat engine if you're using a cartridge you should always have it upside upside no matter what or else you are already like not taking care of your cartridges because you as if you do know you're not supposed to be having them upside down because you're losing oil so girl Lagoon report amazing dude it gives you such a heavy and nice high actually not even heavy just such a nice high the the notes on it is very very piney very very like a little bit hint of citrusy but more of the piney scent and it's very amazing if you guys don't know gorilla glue number four is my favorite strain by far so we're hopping into the true OG a heavy indica right here oh gee for sure so slapping on the battery and then the for the Alpine you're supposed to be hitting them at 3.7 I'm hitting at this one a 3.8 even because that's where the little dot is that and we're going to turn off the air and then when they see what kind of how massive hits we get at this so true oh gee live resin here we go boys Cheers Oh yup I don't know about you guys but obviously every og is an OG for a reason right so but I don't know if this is just me but or if you guys can tell me but I taste in every og I taste this kind of a similarity which is weird because I've tried strains that are like have the same strain specific strain in it and it tastes different you know you can barely or you can barely even taste it so the fact that they can consistently get this flavor across although g-strings for me personally is pretty crazy but true OG definitely a heavy hitter man whoa just those little hits right there you got me free a super hit highs right off the bat it's a little bit more of a dirty or high for me I like the girl igloo number four it's perfect for me true og is definitely like yeah an indica a nighttime because I'm already feeling down luckily I'm not gonna drive after this I'm just be chillin at the skate park right now for a couple hours go to and then after that just go to Target get some waters go home get ready for work tomorrow continue the grind that continuous grind guys actually have homework to do tonight so we're gonna be doing that also so grind it all the time so cheers boys this is for the people out there working hard every day to make [ __ ] happen I got the water man stay hydrated all the time I've really been taking health until like into more of like way bigger dude way bigger I've been enjoying it a lot more I've even thought about getting into bodybuilding because I've kind of been getting bored of just going and lifting weights just to look good you know I kind of want to challenge myself and do something so I might be getting into bodybuilding I'll see what the world like how hard it is because I already have a hard lifestyle as it is so but that would be pretty fun I mean I'm six foot one six foot two whatever I don't know double check that but six foot two I currently weigh 210 and I want to be honestly at a solid 190 so but just really lean muscle so we're almost there I've definitely definitely been seeing the results like coming in and it makes me happy no consistency is key guys so we're going to take this last hit and we're gonna finish the video because I'm already faded off my ass and then so cheers boys hi I'm not gonna let it go I'm gonna talk over it so I hope you guys enjoyed the video I hope you guys make sure to leave a like comment a sub don't forget to share with your friends do all that good jazz you know we keeping the positivity keeping the content coming the consistency every three days is kind of my schedule that I'm coming on right now which kind of works for me we got some big things coming up steezy big battery coming soon video moon rock coming video coming soon so imma ending here guys I'm faded I gotta go I hope you guys have an amazing day like I said again go make sure I hit that sub button if you're new here and have an amazing day lates", "TIFOZhLhOaI": "yo yo cheapest fave suppliers here today we're gonna be talking about our new promotional variable rate battery let's check it out and go over some things with you show you how it works so that good stuff so here's the battery right here it's available in black or silver what it does is to turn it on it's pretty cool because you actually don't have any kind of push button on this so the way that activates is you just hook up your cartridge to the 510 thread take a drag off your cartridge and you'll see that it'll uh it'll light up here so the way that you turn this thing on is ya there's a 5-10 thread on this side at the bottom here is what I like to call like a little heat sink button it picks up the warmth from your finger touch so you hit this five times real fast and you'll see that the battery is on you see that it lit up light blue that light blue is the lowest voltage setting which is 2 point 4 volts and then you can tap it three more times and now you see it just blinked dark blue dark dark blue is the medium voltage setting which is three point two volts and then we have one two three purple purple is the hottest setting which is 4.0 volts and then if you hit this thing four times you'll see that it goes to the preheat option and then it lights up for about or no 13 14 seconds to preheat your oil if you left it out in a cold area are you living a cold climate left it out in your car or something like that so you hit it four times real fast and you'll see now it's going through its preheat stage and it'll just slowly change colors there until it turns off and then that would warm up your your heating element for you on your cartridge and for plastic cartridges with wicks this is by far my favorite battery the reason I say that is because it's not overpowering where if you use the medium or the lowest setting your oil will not have the taste will not been changed it'll taste fantastic instead of having that burnt taste if you were to use it like I'm the red setting yeah this battery is really nice a lot of people are looking for batteries that they don't have to push a button on to inhale to get a vape cloud this is the battery that you're looking for this battery here all you have to do is set your setting take a drag off of it and it automatically activates when you're taking up I dragged off of it so one two three got to do that fast now we're back to the lowest setting there so yeah if you're into plastic cartridges with wicks this is the best battery that you can possibly buy we have also 280 milliamp per hour batteries also that don't have a button but they're not as strong and they don't have the variable rate nor do they have a preheat option so this battery is a few dollars more than those but it's well worth it check it out

damn off CEO of honey stick and today I'm bringing you what I think is the ultimate wax and dab adapter for small batteries so a lot of you guys out there love our honey stick adapters our hybrids or our aficionados but some people want to fly a little bit more stealth than that they want to go a little bit more under the radar scale their their wax and dab to smaller size because some people aren't exactly into the whole cartridge and oil thing so what options exist for you on the market today well if you want big box performance not many until today actually we just launched this honey stick atomizer it is called the silencer silencer being for two reasons well if you take a look at the actual unit itself it's strikingly resembles a silencer however it is so powerful that it will definitely leave you at a loss for words so let's just say that the reason that we call it the silencer is because after using it many people will experience a loss for words as to how you can get so much performance out of such a little wax and DAB atomizer now this little guy is gonna work really well with a lot of our units and we're gonna go through that when we go to a pairing section of the video where we talk about what its gonna be your ideal compatibilities among our product line but right now let's just jump into what makes this unit really special so basically you have a small atomizer it is leaved so you're gonna have a really nice quality smooth finish you're gonna feel the metal in your hand is it is well screwed together so you're not gonna get any type of wiggle motion it is not going to be that cheap or flimsy you know Adam a small wax and dab atomizer that you're used to with this thing you're gonna get something the feels of quality okay and we have incorporated a lot of performance metrics so next off the problem is that when you're using a smaller battery to power pool wax and dab atomizer generally they require more power so what we did with this tank is we're using a ultra low resistance heating wire that still has big power so you're going to get that more rapid heat up time that's gonna that's gonna allow you to take bigger hits throughout the ten seconds that these batteries normally timeout so you have a one point one zero ohm resistance wire which is very low for a wax and dab atomizer for small batteries so the less power that these batteries put out you're still gonna be able to get that nice fast heat up time and then you're wondering what is happening for taste for taste we actually have a unique here heater that the the wire gets wrapped around for a heat up time it is actually made out of a silicon carbide which is gonna heat up a lot faster than quartz and still offer you really good taste neutrality so you're not gonna have this kind of metallic taste or have this this taste of just a pure silica or silicon wick so this is gonna give you a nice taste and a rapid heat up time and this is all wrapped around the ceramic bowl now we're gonna shoot over and do a real nice little product close up and I'm gonna take it apart and show you guys the heater heater chamber here if you look it has a ceramic coating around the cover so that's gonna heat up as well so you're gonna use a nice large percentage of your materials even ones that aren't directly placed onto the heating assembly and then you have a nice thick but unique composition heating wire which actually is the heating wire is composed of a mixture of iron chromium as well as aluminum so it's gonna have a nice thick big power but it's gonna heat up very quickly there's a very soft metal so it's also it doesn't contain any nickel so don't worry about that the other unique feature is if you'll notice this bowl is actually relatively wide so out of the smaller tanks it is much easier to access with a dab tool and you can actually pack about twice as much into this human so you're gonna definitely have a better fill you're gonna be able to get more hits out of it and it's gonna be easier to navigate in there and also a lot easier for you guys to keep clean now let's go into the construction of the top so in the top you have a wide bore mouthpiece that's going to offer you very nice effortless draws and big big pulls from the unit however a lot of times with these wax and DAB mouthpieces is you'll have a wide mouthpiece and nothing to block the actual contents or eliminate any splatter well that's actually solved by the internal plate that is placed in there with the surrounding edge that will capture and catch any splatter or particles you might try to draw out of the device and prevent it from going into your mouth and having it just fall back into the bowl so it's a very low resistance electronically and also very low resistance in terms of what you're able to vapor that you're able to pull out of the mouthpiece and offer you some very nice sized hits while keeping the contents in the chamber and out of the the pull tube and out of your mouth of course so with this atomizer a lot of people when we had our development phases said oh it looks similar to something that that yocan has out you know we really don't like you know the the comparison we don't feel there's any real merit for it so I purchased one on eBay and brought along for us so we can compare here's the yocan one let's get a nice little close-up of it so you guys can see that's the brand the insignia right there and this is a compared to our honey stick now the honey stick is slightly taller we're you gonna get a lot of the differences is the feel and finish right off the bat when you put both of them in your hand you can tell if the honey stick has a much different feel to it it has a different polish different coating on the metal it's a different grade you're also gonna see that well the yocan one is significantly thinner than the honey stick one you're also gonna see that when you unscrew it the bowls are much much smaller so you're not gonna get much of a fill you could actually basically almost fit that bowl into the honey stick one you're gonna see that the heating wire is made of a different composition the heater is a different composition and the honey stick one is actually much bigger just much easier to navigate much easier to clean gonna be much more convenient now if you're looking for an ultra slim one the yocan one might not be a bad option but a lot of people are really looking for that medium and a lot of the emails that we've gotten that they want a slim stealthy wax atomize the works well with small batteries that has big box performance and that's what this does so let's now you know not mention the okay on one and just focus on the honey stick but because a few of our focus group testers did bring up the yoke in one I want to show it so you can see them side by side to see the comparative differences here so for pairings now because this has a very rapid heat up time before you break in the coil you don't want to ride a high voltage and you definitely don't want to dry fire it or fired empties so you always want to make sure that you have your bowl filled up before you're firing it and filling the bowl if we get a nice little close-up here it's basically just gonna be taking your dab tool and some concentrates and gently placing it on the edges so it's gonna lay on top of the heater and around where the ceramic area is now when you're poking around there be careful don't go poking your heating wire with your DAP tool because it is sensitive and it can shorten or affect the life and performance of your coil so make sure when you're poking around in there just don't be very gentle around the actual heating wire and make sure the concentrates can rest on top of those and right around those in the surrounding ceramic area which is a white area okay so now parents once you have it filled up start off using your coil on low voltage or wattage when you're running it on your batteries but we have several devices that this will pair with this device it pairs great with our minimax and minimax Pro and brought a minimax Pro here as you see it just screws right in folds over like it's your car key I mean I don't think it gets much more stealth than that you have three great power settings on the minimax Pro then when you're ready take a rip you just flip it open push your button and you're ready to go so it also pairs very well with the minimax minimax standard kind of does lift rooted silencer name when you put it on to the minimax but it's a very cool little device still very sleek very light just turn on and you're ready to go when it's paired with the minimax now another cool pairing that we have is this is our goldline battery and silver which will be available on our website in the next few days probably about the time that there's a video will launch so you can have it in silver or black but look at what a nice sleek pairing that is it's almost as if they were made for each other and this is just a slim totally stealth pen right here even the the Pantone's of the body of the tank and the atomizer basically just completely matched so this is a really cool discreet stealth little setup you can have on a lanyard or you can even slip in your pocket I'm super sturdy the other cool thing that sets apart this tank from the others is this because of its rapid heat up time and low resistance is you are able to use it with auto draw batteries generally wax atomizers require consistent current to get to heat up this one you can use with auto draw batteries and the one that we recommend which is a unit we're going to do a separate video on is is our bee box auto draw battery it is officially just placed on to the website and the video is right around the corner for this little unit it is a magnetic auto draw unit and it becomes very slick and stealth just to give you guys a little view here's our little beatbox unit which is a magnetic concealer screw the magnets simply onto the wax and dab atomizer silencer it drops right in I mean that is that is probably if you guys are Auto draw guys and have been missing out on your wax atomizer I've heard this pairing is just absolutely marvelous it works great it looks great as super sleek and slim I mean so that is pretty cool so in a nutshell that is your silence or wax and dab adapter that's your small-sized stealthy unit that offers you big box performance now because it is wider the one thing I will say is that it does not fit into the openings of our phantom and our elf and our bee keeper one it does fit and pair very well with the beekeeper 2.0 which has the wider opening on it so don't use it with the elf 2 doable or the phantom and the beekeeper one because if you purchase it it's not gonna fit down into the opening as it does with our bee box and our beekeeper 2.0 as well as our a minimax pros so just make sure to keep that in mind

mini take in the roken rage which we both sell here at the shop pretty much there's really miniscule differences they're both little mini tanks here and they hold a 5-10 cartridge which is the thread count which is the size of the cart and I will also go over those details as well so let's just get right into the video da disclosure representations regarding the efficacy and safety of restart CBD have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration we are not medical professionals and the information shared in these videos is based off of personal use and meant to be purely anecdotal please take everything we say with caution and do your own research before consuming CBD related products so over here we again have our broken mini tank and then our broken rage and there are two variations that roken sells as a brand they are used for vaping we offer the shock we also offer the cartridges that you can put into the tanks here the broken mini tank is what I'm going to talk about first so difference is to start out this one is the level two of the rage that I call a level one just a little bit of a step up on here you're gonna I'm going to show you guys a little bit closer eventually but this guy you can pop off the end of it so you can insert your card if you ever want to clean it just know that has a really easy pop on and off right there it has a USB charger that you can use and plug in with any kind of converter into the wall and computer makes it really easy the battery life on it is 500 which I don't know the exact terminology in that one but it is a longer battery life then your broken rage so other things for the row can be anything that you want to know is five clicks turns it on five clicks turns it off there's also a preheat function on this guy so with normal batteries you can preheat them with a few of the curses we have here the preheats like function is not as much needed but it is a really nice little tank that you your hand at pitching your palm people like it because it fits there and it's really discreet as you eight is that I've had a pen or a bigger rig so that one's the mini tank and now we're going to go over the broken rage in the broken range again it's really minuscule differences between the two it again like the tank has a USB charger and it fits a 5-10 thread count battery you can screw those in readily through the top on both of them on this one again you can slide off this cover and clean the bottom of it if you really want to the difference with this being the level 1 versus level 2 the mini tank is the battery life is a little bit shorter it's to 80 on the rage versus the 500 on the mini tank and then there's no preheat setting but with again most of the carts you don't necessarily make the preheat setting so it's a little bit cheaper price point for the same exact size same exact look and then again fits in your palm really really nicely alright and that is it so like I said there's really minuscule differences between the two it just depends on what you're looking for in your mate but they're both very high quality we carry both of them here at the store in tons of different colors as well at least for the mini tank they come in gray purple blue green black like you just saw and we can't wait to see you guys in the shops so make sure to follow us on instagram at research cvd you can shop online at restart see be calm you can come see us here in Austin Texas and all of this information will be in the description below and we'll see you guys at the next video", "N3Qw-otcvqk": "okay here's the second video on the second vaporizer battery uh i've got it plugged in i've tried a different a couple different cords here with couple different plugs same thing won't turn on doesn't have anything you know i'll even try to turn it on because i know it's in let's see and the button doesn't always work either oh here it goes good so it's empty let's turn it off of course there's no atom it's turning off i've plugged it and i've replugged it in it is not it's not charging just won't do it it kind of did it for a couple seconds um but it's kind of loose down at the end too so i don't know if there's something wrong with this connection um for this particular vaporizer because i did wiggle it around came on you know how it fluctuates and tells you the battery's charging it's not doing it so there you go thank you", "yVXsQRIBNuo": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] do [Music] you", "zZoVej5uAjQ": "Hi Guys, this is Julie from VapeFully.com\nand today I\u2019m gonna do a review of the Grasshopper vaporizer. The Grasshopper is an amazing device \u2013 it\nlooks just like elegant pen but don\u2019t get fooled with its\u2019 looks! The Grasshopper is a true beast \u2013 super\nstrong 45-watt heater allows 5-second heat-up and great vapor production, ever through the\nbiggest water piece, which is great. The vapor potency is second to none and the\nvapor quality is great thanks to full-convection heating technology. So basically the Grasshopper is a so-called\non-demand vaporizer \u2013 it heats up in no time and allows you to take just one hit and\nthen turn off the unit without any loss of efficiency. This means you can take a few puffs and save\nthe rest for later, which is cool. The look of this vaporizer is super sleek,\nsexy and discreet, so it is a perfect vaporizer to use on the go. There\u2019s no display or any visible buttons\nbeside the one on top\u2013 you simply turn the Grasshopper on and off by clicking it, just\nlike a regular pen. Lack of display does not mean any compromises\nthough \u2013 the Grasshopper features full-spectrum temperature control, you can adjust it by\nsimply turning this little knob right here. The temperature range is very wide \u2013 you\ncan adjust it anywhere between 130 and 210 degrees Celsius. The battery is user-replaceable, which is\nanother cool feature of this little vaporizer \u2013 you can buy a couple of spare ones and\nswap them on the go when needed. The whole unit is very easy to use and operate,\neven for beginners. Also, the Grasshopper works amazingly well\nthrough the water piece \u2013 the heater is so powerful it can produce more vapor you\ncan actually inhale natively, so using a water piece helps you to take full advantage of\nthe Grasshopper\u2019s power. As every other vape, the Grasshopper has some\ncons, too. The vapor path is short, so the vapor might\nbe quite hot, too hot for some users. As almost all convection units, the Grasshopper\ndrains the battery pretty fast \u2013 you\u2019ll be able to vaporize 2-3 bowls per charge on\naverage. Thankfully, you can swap an empty battery\nwith a fully charged one. Besides that, the Grasshopper is a truly amazing\nvaporizer and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re gonna love it. Great potency, great vapor quality and flavor,\ngreat efficiency, 5-second heat-up time, and swappable batteries \u2013 it really is an amazing\nvaporizer! So go and get your Grasshopper today!", "M6raoDxGlf0": "well what do we have here looks like 50 bucks to some people that's not a lot of money but for me i'll take it every time [Applause] so for anybody who didn't already know a couple of weeks ago i installed a chirai battery on my scooter but then i started thinking what if i need to charge this sucker and even though it says it on the box here that you can use a standard lead acid battery charger i figured i didn't want to change that but after looking up the proprietary shirai charging system and seeing a price tag of around 85 i started to have second thoughts see i was already in the hole 120 for the battery so to put 85 on top of that that's getting to be a little bit too expensive so i went on good old amazon and started looking up alternative battery chargers for lithium batteries and folks i came across this yep fox sir does it again and you guys know how much i love my fox saw lead acid battery charger but again i was not willing to trust this thing on that very expensive battery so for 35 dollars i was able to pick up this bad boy now i'm not going to go into too much detail because it's very much like the old unit you have your mode button here to toggle through your choices but if you look here your choices have changed not only can it do lithium and when i say lithium these are lithium batteries that have a bms installed on it and we'll get all into that in another video but as you can see it also does lead acid batteries along with gel and all the other type of batteries that the old one did and then we have the one that should rise under which is the lipo battery and then very much like the old unit a repair module now this one's a little bit different in the fact that it'll charge 12 volts at 6 amps and 24 volts at 3 amps i'm going to let you know right now it will charge the lipo battery at 1.5 amps where the surai charger charges it at 2 amps earlier i was able to test this charger on my chirai battery and it came through like a champ so folks that's where the 50 comes in we can either go with the proprietary 85 dollar charger that will only charge one type of battery or for 35 dollars you can open up your options a little bit as always i'll provide a link in the description for this item this is your boy kacchi's kid i'll see you all in the next one peace out", "aDtWK1L_Q0I": "Robert with 21 century smoking calm a lot of you may have come across this before you go into Hale your electronic cigarette the light glows but you don't get any vapor and I'll show you see the light lip and there was no vapor basically this is due to the cartridge and the battery not making connection typically in the center of the connections you'll notice here you see those two little buttons in the middle with the holes in them those are your center contacts and if those are just a hair off it will not make connection to each other and you don't get any vapor unfortunately there is an easy way to fix this and this not only works for the blackjack will that big slick but all the other electronic cigarettes on the market and I'll show you how to fix it all right so there's a magic tool that fixes your cartridges and that is a paper clip unfolded and just gonna separate the cartridge from the battery I'm using our big slick one of our most powerful batteries that we sell but in any case all the cartridges are the same right over here you'll notice your center contact with the hole in the middle and around that center contact is Valley and you'll notice the paper clip fits perfectly in between the threads of the cartridge and the center contact basically what you want to do to allow the center contact to make connection to the battery is just raise it upwards I'll show you the internals of a cartomizer in another video but for now the fix is just sticking your paper clip a met Valley which I get a better angle and prying against the outer part of the cartridge and you'll see that center contact raises upwards now if you pull this out too far it will pop out with our cartomizers push in very easily in 99% of time work again however try not to pop that out it shouldn't even be near the top but just raising it up I think we got least an eighth of an inch if not more all right so let's see if it worked catch our cartomizer to the big slick battery and that's it fix is what people think is a dead cartomizer just by raising the contact of the cartomizer and let it make connection to the battery", "OQ8orE1XmII": "this is train wreck

it includes a quick reference to help you remember the inputs your battery comes packaged in off mode you should store your battery in off mode when you're not using it to activate your battery tap the tip opposite the mouthpiece five times quickly the tip will light up either turquoise blue or purple for one full second which indicates the current voltage setting you now your battery is in ready mode which means it's ready to receive any of the five inputs the first and most common of these inputs is simply to inhale on the mouthpiece inhaling will activate the heater vaporizing the oil to measure a full dose inhale until the tip flashes which is about six or seven seconds when you stop inhaling the battery will automatically stop heating and will return to ready mode tapping or holding the tip one time will indicate how much of a charge the battery has green means the battery is fully charged and the colors transition through yellow orange and red red means it's time to recharge the battery you touching the tip once is also how you can tell if the battery is in ready or off mode if it doesn't light up at all the battery is off tapping the tip three times will cycle through the voltage levels your battery has three voltage level settings turquoise or 2.4 volts is the lowest voltage setting it will produce less vapor but more flavor blue is the medium setting at three point two volts purple at four point zero volts produces more vapor for a larger dose you for taps on the battery will activate preheat mode which means the heater will turn on without you inhaling preheat motives for thicker oils and B perks oils do not need to be preheated you'll know you're in preheat mode when the light begins cycling through all the colors of the rainbow just tap on the tip once to go back to ready mode otherwise the battery will automatically stop preheating after 30 seconds the fifth and final input you can enter in ready mode is another five taps to return back to off mode after tapping five times the current turquoise blue or purple voltage setting will flash for a split second before turning off you if you find it difficult to tap the battery with one hand or you're afraid you might drop it hold the battery in one hand while tapping with the other an alternate method is to tap the battery into the palm of your hand as always visit support beat

Kandypens Slim in that it is designed for thin\noils and e-juice, this time with a cartridge pod system to go with the\nbutton-free operation. Inside the box you'll find: one Kandypens Rub lithium-ion battery, one refillable 1 mL pod, one USB cable, and one\ninstruction card. To load your unit, first remove the pod from the Rubi battery by\nfirmly pulling on it. Remove the rubber stopper by twisting it out with your\nfingers and use a fine-tipped syringe to insert the oil or e-juice of your choice.\nReplace the stopper, place the pod back onto the battery, and get puffin'! There's\nno temperature control to speak of with the Kandypens Rubi; you'll get around 30\nto 50 pulls per charge from the 280 mAh battery, which indicates\nthat this vaporizer is probably running at a somewhat lower temperature than the\naverage wax pen and e-juice vape. That said, you'll definitely have enough power and\nheat to vaporize the thin oils and e-juices that are best suited for the\nKandypens Rubi's pods. To wrap this up, let's talk about some of the key\nfeatures of the Kandypens Rubi which make it such a stellar device. The first\nis the refillable pod style cartridges used by the Kandypens Rubi; this makes\nit easy to switch between oils and e-juices and encourages people to keep a\nfew different pods with different flavors and materials. The second is how\neasy the Kandypens Rubi is to use; with button-free operation and super-simple\nloading and drawing, the Rubi is a good choice for those just getting into oils\nand e-juice. The third is the premium construction; this is a surprisingly\ndurable device for how light and airy it is, and it's managed to be totally leak-proof in our travels so far. The Kandypens Rubi is a true gem for those\nseeking a convenient, high-value vaporizer for oils and e-juice.\nI'm Mike for TVAPE TV, we hope you enjoyed this video and found it useful, and for\nall

some cuz I'm always smoking the [ __ ] buns I'm always smoking the flower probably took a dive in one of my videos after I got that [ __ ] during that hammer box [ __ ] but today I want to bring you carts carts straight up carts and that's what we have here today that's mine let's get right into it I'm explaining right first off we gonna start with my actual battery this battery is from dab Dick's labs costed me $25 but I bought it when I was in Pennsylvania which is not legal there medical but gotta be half bad anyways I liked it because of how conspicuous it is cuz like I mean look at my hands and look at the size of this [ __ ] I mean this is a 1 gram cart so I mean look at how I mean you can [ __ ] set this in your [ __ ] pocket you can put it anywhere I mean it's so conspicuous like I was in Baltimore ripping this [ __ ] just in the bay just [ __ ] tripping it nobody [ __ ] knows [ __ ] oh yeah davic slabs they come in different colors I just like the blue and yeah I really like this I've been using this for this cart though that I bought it's from rocking extracts want to get a close-up of this this is gorilla glue number 4 dollars in milligram court from Moroccan extracts and I have had some of this as you can tell this is not a full cart I did not just slap this on there is my mom's so if you don't have it ready get it ready if you have it ready get it ready yeah get it ready Cheers it's all yours goddamn very good tasting cards I mean I've had so many different cards before I have had $10 cards I've had $35 cards you know what I'm saying weak-ass ghost you can definitely tell I mean you pay for what you get you know I'm saying that's always sometimes you get really good deals for good [ __ ] but most of the time you're paying for what you get what I'm saying is like a $10 card you're gonna hit that you're gonna instantly tell the difference of a $35 card you're gonna taste that [ __ ] you're gonna taste like the butane they like for the higher cards they're gonna use higher-quality butane to treat their [ __ ] [ __ ] rather than [ __ ] cheap butane and your tape I have I've had cards we were hitting it tastes like straight butane it doesn't taste like it seems like I'm hitting a [ __ ] lighter if I just go that's what it tastes like but this [ __ ] [ __ ] smooth man now I got this from this one dispensary I go to but these are from like I said he's from rocking the extracts so they're made by somebody else at my dispensary some of them my dispensary also has their on their own carts like that they make at the dispensary like customs [ __ ] but I haven't tried that that's gonna be the next one I think I might go ahead and do that blinker challenge see if I can wreck myself for y'all with the one of those cards get the ones that are in house made I found a [ __ ] new dispensary - hey look find it yourself like I did and it's not gonna be on weed man I'll tell you that it's never on weed Maps Sammy when I was in Washington State there's always as cut the cut spots that are not online that have the best [ __ ] prices and that you'll find good as [ __ ] membership pricing oh no there's no membership you can become a member there if you want to but all the [ __ ] prices are the same always not even gonna say but I mean I would say I searched a lot of it to a lot of different dispensaries I'd be [ __ ] but I mean I've been here who knows how long and I finally found I finally found like I have [ __ ] felt like I hit the jackpot with this place and it's too late cuz I'm [ __ ] moving soon moving about probably like less than a month maybe a month but yeah man I'm so glad I found that new place man and it was literally my mom told me about it like my mom never would it'd there but like somebody else was in there for nice like yeah I wish I would have found it sooner it's really cut like it's if it's in the middle of [ __ ] nowhere like you don't you don't go to this place unless you're just driving on some back roads and [ __ ] in the Colorado Springs and you just come across this place like Oh cut a spot small simple as please fire ad deals that's why I got this card they got keep colas if you don't know what keep colas are those are basically sodas with weed in it like root beer [Music] [ __ ] like that they probably have orange [ __ ] cream soda and everything I said that'll really get you going but if you're looking for a [ __ ] conspicuous as battery I'm going back to add a big slabs WWD slabs this is not a [ __ ] paid hey I ain't getting paid for that [ __ ] but hey just [ __ ] if you do one window just know that my words good for this shit's fire it's good the only thing is if you're bad with like losing [ __ ] if you misplace [ __ ] a lot do not get it because it's too [ __ ] small like my mom for example she missed places just a lot and she just finds it somewhere else some random-ass bad just oh there it is but they also said you another piece with this Babic it comes with these two things right so this screws onto the car I can't just throw this car in there like that it won't smoke so this little adapter it comes with two of them two different size ones I think my mom wants one our idea but it just screws on and it's like a little magnetic like that's magnet right there so like and it's a pretty strong man you like it holds and just charges like a little like um what is that microUSB [ __ ] like an Android charger I guess it has three settings on there it goes green blue and red and I think if you hit it three times it'll like preheat but I never do that I just [ __ ] straight just get into it [ __ ] preheat let me preheat my cart before I hit it no Gorilla Glue dubber for all got here good you guys got here good damn hide - man taking

I'm going to show you our new vaporizer pen v3 this is a three in one combination pen it's good for oil wax dry herbs or liquids so I'm going to go through the pen show you all the different attachments and everything that comes with the kit and then I'm gonna demo it for you okay so it comes with this is the wax attachment right here set that right there this is the dry herbs attachment and then this is the oil attachment right here re liquids I'm sorry okay here's the battery right here it's a variable voltage battery it's got three different options what's low medium and high basically I'll show you how to use that in a second how to change the voltages on it most of them have the little spinner on the bottom of of it this one doesn't have the spinner so it's digital the spinners will get stuck in all kinds of issues but this one's digital it's all one button okay so there's the battery also comes with this little pen holder right here it's also pen stand stick so anything you also get an oil container as well as these two little atomizer pieces the replacement coils for the dry herb atomizer so they go right here then you get this oil container you also get this charge or the way the charger works is just basically screw the battery in just like that and it'll turn red when it turns green it's done charging it's basically a charger you also get these tools right here this is just a dabber to put your oil on your oil atomizer this big fat brush is to clean the just atomizer right here from try herbs and this one is just to clean around here with alcohol or whatever if it gets oil or sticky okay so let me set these up here and you also get this case alright spraying the case v3 of puff nodes and it's nice case a lot of them come just come with a box that this one comes with a case the box is no good after you buy it but because keep using this so anyway the way this battery works is it has three different levels it's got low medium and high five clicks of the button activates it or changes the voltages low voltage is three point two mediums three point seven and high is four point two so first of all to turn it on I click it five times and it's going to illuminate red right around this part right here see how it's a red right there so now if I push it it's running on three point two volts so it's low if I want to boost it up to medium I hit it five more times and see how it turns purple now it is at three point seven volts and then if I only kick it up to high which I prefer hit it five more times and it is on blue now if I were to hit it five more times it would turn off and then it just cycles through every time every five times you hit it it turns up or turns off at the end so it's on blue so it's on the highest voltages so first I'll just show you that the e-liquid chamber just basically you just screw it on there and hit the button and you're good to go sit here and just hit the button inhale the way the fill this e-liquid chamber up is you just unscrew it unscrew the top right here and put your a liquids in here and basically it right there so that's the illegals chambers it's good for 10 chairs or like each cigarette juice if you want to use that or flavored liquids okay next I'm going to show you the this is the dry herb atomizer okay the way this works is you unscrew it right here you put your dry herbs down in this little hole right here and basically here let me let me screw this since I can show you how this lights so you can push the button right there and you can see it lights up really bright so when you put your dry herbs in there you screw it in like that you push the button and inhale another cool thing about this one is when you're done after you hit it four or five times you've taken undone and then the way to empty it is you just push the top of it right here it's spring-loaded and in there herbs or whatever you're smoking comes out of here and you just repack it but this is definitely the best dry herb atomizer that I've honestly ever used and we just got in and we're really excited about it so that's the dry herb atomizer it also comes with these two extra coils right here this is how you replace let me just unscrew the bottom right here there's a little coil right there just unscrew it and then you just pop a new one in just like that they're good the last four three four months each it comes with two extra one so okay screw that back in there so that's the dry herb atomizer and then here's the wax atomizer this is the same one as that comes on our vape saver this is probably the biggest wax atomizer that I've ever seen as far as how big the coil is you can see right here you can see how big my finger is you can see I think the coil it's almost as big as a dime but it's got um its wound really tight and it's really heavy-duty the coil in it I'll show you how bright it gets screw it in here battery okay push the button you can see that thing will burn any kind of oil BHO wax half melt pretty much anything you put in there it'll burn so that's the wax atomizer all right so basically you get all three of these you get all three of these atomizers dry herbs oil wax and eat liquids you get this charger get the battery also of this battery this little gauge right here will tell you it's a battery level indicator so if your battery's going low you'll always know how much battery you have left let's just turn this battery off he's hit it five times you know the safety modes on so you want to put in your pocket but won't start vaping without you okay so put that there comes with the rubber holder comes with the three tools the two atomizer replacements and the case this is J with puff nugs please please like this video and subscribe until next time thanks a lot", "qfXbm3Z9Nys": "hey guys logan here from o2 vape and today we're going to show you how to charge your battery now I know this sounds simple but there is a wrong way to do it so what I'm going to show you is the right way in the wrong way to charge your battery so first thing we're gonna show you a couple wrong ways to charge your battery so what I have here is a buttonless OH to vape battery and a three point seven volt charger what we don't recommend doing is screwing the battery on to the charger first what you can do is you can tighten the battery too tight which in turn pushes the connection plate down and you don't get a good connection with your cartridge therefore making for a bad experience if you get experience at all the other thing that we don't recommend doing is using a fast charger or a rapid charger indicated by the lightening bolt or tablet chargers as these put out too much power and can fry your battery the correct way to charge your battery is to use a laptop or a standard 5 volt black charger that you plug into the wall and what you're going to want to do is you're going to want to plug in your USB charger first green light comes on and then you're simply going to screw the battery on after what this allows you to do is see the light turn red right when you get a connection so as you see it didn't take much to tighten it on there and we can even tighten it a little more but we have a good secure connection we know it's not going to damage the connection plate and we know it's gonna be ready to go when it's finished so thank you guys for choosing o to vape and have a vape filled day", "FVVKvVeIaMw": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoffman officer honey stick and today we're gonna bring you a real informative video on how to build your perfect dab pen and tank basically your wax pen or dab pen is made of two components the first component is going to be your dad pen battery which we can see lined up here from very simple to complex so you need to have a battery which is essentially your powder plant for your dab unit then you're gonna need to pick out a wax tank which is what you fit the wax into that is actually going to vaporize your wax and what I mean wax or dabs we can talk all the way from you know oils that really hard enough to be to go into solid state all the way to your crumbles your shatters and things like that and you're pressed waxes then as you can see I've also arranged them from simple which is in this term small and then all the way up to big pro size over here which is gonna be more complex now I want today's video not to be too long but just to give you a really good basic idea of when you're trying to put together the perfect wax or DAB vape set that you pick out the perfect dab pen battery and also your wax tank so let's get started if this kind of mix and match is foreign to you at the very end the last two minutes we're gonna run through that we've already paired some and put together some awesome kits for you so if you're unsure you can always pick up already a pre-selected kid that is meant to work for your wax and vape pen needs very very well so let's get started let's start first with the power plant the wax or dab battery so for your wax pen battery or your dad pen you it depends on how big of a tank you want if you want something relatively slim and sleek you can pick up one of these stick batteries right here like this is our elf battery it has three different voltages and you can use any kind of slim wax tank or wax atomizer as a power plant just note that you're gonna want whatever wax atomizer you get should be skinny to match the circumference or the diameter of your battery so if you pick up an extreme tank never mind that this isn't powerful enough to power it you know let's this this would look pretty odd so let's say that for thin batteries you definitely want to pick a slim atomizer so out of our slim batteries we have a whole slew of colors for the elf which is a simplest least expensive buy in here that gives you good power and then you can step up to the twist batteries the twist batteries are one step up which you can twist adjust the voltage this is our phantom carbon fiber twist battery but we also have some twist batteries and other colors in our honey stick line so for the stick batteries you can really step up to two of our slim atomizers which is our phantom wax tank or our silencer both these tanks there's slight differences the phantom wax tank has a dual core power plant the silencer has a slightly larger bowl with a proprietary silica carbide interior both of them do have ceramic bowls but they do use the internal power plants this one's dual ceramic this one's silica carbide I can take it off and show you just so you see here go so here's a little side-by-side let's get real nice and close you can see the inside there here's the silencer just slightly larger bull diameter and then here's the phantom wax ink which is a dual core coil so these are slim these will work real nice with your stick batteries you can pick out the color you want the texture you want whether you want it to be a twist or a variable voltage stay away from Auto draw stick batteries when using your earwax tanks because push buttons generally do give you more consistent power output which is required for the best wax experience so moving right along in our dad pen batteries here if you don't want to stick battery because it might stand out a little bit or it might be kind of tall like this combination you can always go the concealer route and pick up one of honey sticks awesome concealer units which a concealer unit basically means that the unit gets hidden inside of the actual atomizer so let's take our beekeeper 2.0 multi dab pen battery or wax pen battery here and show you what it look like if we paired it with our silencer all of a sudden it is concealed in a small and compact you have more capacity you gonna need some less charges when you go with these bigger batteries and it's gonna keep your wax atomizer hidden it's gonna look really really cool this is also about the same size as a phantom tank this isn't a phantom tank but they're about the same size that's about how it would look there with if you've got the Phantom tank you can do that or you can upgrade to our if you want more features like digital functionality and concealment you can get our bee box Pro which is fully digitally adjustable screen here as you can see to really let you hone on power and this is one of our little flip units so now all of a sudden you a concealer that is all like a key fob real high quality flip and is an awesome little dab pen unit now so you can go with one of the concealers they're digital we also have our our arrow B battery which allows you full temperature control on your wax unit you see it's paired here with the silenced or it fits and real nice if you want something that's luxurious and has a real luxury feel with a few temperatures but it's still simple if one of the digital units is a little too complex I mean if you pair it with our Phantom's signature I mean look at this pairing this is just gorgeous right here this is a luxurious wax pen you get about thousand milliamp hours I mean you're this thing you're gonna be able have about two charges worth of a stick battery two to three charges a stick battery to one charge on this thing that's how much capacity it has it's got the carbon fiber feel and handle this right here is an awesome pairing for the concealer luxury route so that pretty much covers the slim the slim lacks tanks here that we discussed now when you step up to larger wax tanks you're gonna also need a larger dab pen battery which lets get into this section here so what honey stick has is we really have three offerings we have our stinger battery we have our defender battery and we have our sport battery the sport battery and the defender battery are both digitally adjustable and very high output the sport battery has a little bit more sophistication with different temperature wattage and voltage controls and it also goes all the way up to 50 watts of power our defender carbon fiber battery is what powers up our Cannabis Cup kit it runs up to 36 watts you can adjust the voltage or the wattage and what's cool about is you have a little ego adapter so you can actually run slim tanks off of it just as well so if you flip this over you can still put on a slim tank or a 510 prefilled cartridge just make sure that you have your wattage or voltage turn way down because this battery does have a lot of power with our defender option you have several really cool designs that you can choose from to make this battery customizable those are our digital options or very high power but if you're getting a slim tank you might not necessarily need all that power and they're also a little heavier and a little larger as you can see for example compared to our phantoms and concealers you know they do carry a little bit more heft but they put out a lot more power so if you don't want digital adjustability but you want some high power our stinger battery that we sell here has three temperature options as you can see which should be indicated by the different color in the LED it has a good high capacity but again it's very simple charge at the bottom three temperatures but you would need one of these batteries if you want to get into let's check out these these wax tanks now that we just went over dab pen batteries if you want one of these tanks starting with our aficionado tanks which we have a ceramic and a dual quartz in you need more power and the more power can only be attained with the larger dad pen batteries you have a doughnut option as well as a dual quartz and these are thicker so that are going to require some more power but they also have the larger bowls so these are gonna work well but you're gonna need at least one of these stinger batteries or defender or sport batteries to power these babies up now we also have our stinger battery which is a ceramic doughnut coil this is for those taste aficionados it's a standard ceramic doughnut ceramic body all around this pairs very well with our battery as well as these other ones but you don't want to run this one over 12 watts so it does acquire more power than the stick batteries put out but you don't want to overpower them with any of these big batteries that I had over here so you have a stinger then if you want to step it up we have our dual chords very popular tankful last year or two is our hybrid it's a dual quartz bull and it has this open chamber so you can really see the vapors really good taste purity has a very large sized bowl and dual quartz this is a good unit in that 15 to 20 watt range to really step up the power if you're hooking it up to a bubbler I mean this thing puts out a lot of power but you're gonna need more than just your slim stick or concealed batteries to power it up so again that limits you into the stinger the defender of the sport battery then if you really want to go extreme pun definitely intended you can go with the extreme tank which you can run on a triple course as you can see here I mean these are monster triple courses in the bull this is our most powerful tank I mean people compare this thing to a pocket rig because it really puts out rig style power you can have the triple course or you can have the big ceramic doughnut we sell both coils and both options do come in the kit for this thing you are actually it is so powerful that you're gonna need more than a stinger battery to power this thing up this thing isn't even going to give this the power that needs so you would be forced into the defender or the sport options for this so I hope that this part was informative on showing you what you can kind of mix and match between the dad Penn batteries and the wax batteries and also the wax tanks dab atomizers that you have here that are offered on honey stick a la carte so you can mix and match if this video was confusing for you you can always pick up one of our ready kits like our cannabis cup kit which pairs our stinger battery and our hybrid you can pick up our plasma kit which we didn't go over because it's not 510 thread so it's not mix and match this proprietary it has a cords coil that doesn't actually touch the concentrates really cool unique new pen we have our stinger which combines our stinger battery and our stinger atomizer for a perfect little ceramic donut kit for on-the-go if you're looking for something convenient and disposable we have our rip and ditch now for the environmentalists we aren't promoting running through these things these are for a matter of real travel convenience should be kind of a last resort from there if you're looking for a pen that you want to dispose of so we're not promoting throwaway culture so if you're looking for something small caliber check out our name Dabra kid it combines our silencer and our twist battery kit fully rechargeable awesome little kit so very inexpensive - so you could definitely step up from the disposable to that and the small caliber kids if you want a little bit more but don't want a lot of space we have our aficionado kit which combines both these nice atomizers that I showed you earlier let's take a little look which has a ceramic doughnut as well as a double quarts large sized bowl this is actually a 5/10 battery high capacity it even has a place for an apple charger on it for a rapid charge very small slim sleek very cool pen but it is wider than the slim tanks then the slim batteries that we went over so it's gonna put out good power so real good end between unit then if you want to go extreme you like that that pocket dab rig kind of feeling that gives you the max power that's kind of the cream of the crop the Best of Breed we have our extreme wax kit on our site for a really good price of 129 it comes with an extreme tank a sport battery the two coils and the mouthpiece and are in a different mouthpiece here which two mouthpiece options from the extreme which is really really a beast it comes in this awesome hardshell case for your on the go it is probably the best large you know still pocket-sized large caliber large output wax pen kit you can get super high quality the combination as you can see here is really really like they were made for each other I mean just look at the silvers and stainless as complementing each other here I mean this is this is a gorgeous kit and you're not going to find something that can fit in your pocket your purse or whatever that is more powerful and hits like this thing then if you want something really unique the reason we didn't go over any of its parts is because again it's not 510 but you want to be concealed a Ripper 2.0 has a beast of a wax atomizer in there it's a large bore large output dual quartz wax atomizer in there that is full concealer that is subohm caliber so as you can see this concealers this big butt has basically the same power as these larger batteries it's a unique proprietary blend looks just like a little lighter even clicks and flips like one buttons right there only one temperature little extendable mouthpiece if you unscrew this just mouthpiece the wax atomizer comes out you you don't screw it take a look at those dual quartz coils we're talking about monster concealer hits in here very high sub-ohm power those are thick coils and they get very very hot you'd fit a good amount of wax dabs into there and it's gonna be really good use but it's not a 5-10 thread it's its own proprietary magnetic bottom so I hope today's video was informative about getting you guys up to speed on wax pen combination options dad pen batteries wax atomizers hope that you guys will subscribe

vaporbrothers dabbler vaporizer pen is not working it doesn't work at all and they get their vaporizer in the mail and they open it up screw the heater on to the battery base press the button but there's no light so the screw off the top look at the heater coil here and it's not eaten up well don't panic here your dad lives working just fine when we ship the dabbler we fully charge it and we also put it in lock position and lock position helps keep it from turning on so what you want to do is press the button at least six times a row and it might be one or two clicks more and then you'll see a flash like it just did now when it flashes that means da Bueller is unlocked and you'll see by the coil there that coils are glowing nice and hot so again don't pack your tablet just in lock mode and to lock it you do the same thing just repeatedly press it until it flashes and there we go now it's in lock mode and you know this features comes in handy for if you've got your dabbler stash somewhere and you don't want to accidentally set it off like a purse or a bag or I'd say pocket but always put it in this handy carrying case rather than sticking the dabbler in your pocket to prevent any pocket breaks from happening so there you go the vapor brothers dabbler lock and unlock", "5tnhmwGSn6w": "[Applause] absolute extracts is now available in C cell technology experience the full

days out in California and today we are very excited to review a Willys reserve distillate cartridge this is Mountain mist this is the flavor and we were super lucky enough to be introduced to a woman that basically gave us these and donated these products here to us from Flo Canada and we are very very excited to try this Willy's reserve as a Willie Nelson brand and of course everybody hears about that and they want to try it out and here today we are about to so let's just go ahead and get in on it so we've got our warnings of course this is awesome packaging I really like it local farmers you can check it out online recyclable packaging that's cool yeah this is nice packaging everything's nice I like the colors really stands out they did a good job they're got Willie Nelson in the background right there that's cool 81 percent THC again this is a distillate and then you've got 0.33% of CBD so oh I like that big packaging there I've never seen one like this now okay but you take that out like that wow this is this is a heavy-duty case right here [Music] okay that was an extremely long horn blow again we are at a beach so it's probably the get in or get out of the water call so here we go this cartridge is very high-quality we've got like a stainless steel feel here on the mouth tip it's a very large hole this is uh it's heavy too it's got the WR right there on the right there on the logo and so we're gonna just go ahead and try it out here see what happens okay here we go mmm that's good lemony hmm Wow mmm that's got everything you're looking for I mean it's got the Terp tic it's got the back of the throat choke it's got the whole tickle in the nose it's got pretty much everything but it's not bad in any way shape or form because a lot of the times that all those things can go into a bad you know they can be too much term tech too much choke throughout all them things that you don't want but this is pretty much all that you do let's try this again just get one more try see what really happens excuse me I didn't expect that okay who's that my friends excuse me all right so you want to be careful with this this is no joke this is not a joke this is the lowest temp a lot of times with your vape pens you know you can take the whole hit sometimes maybe even two you can time out the pin to really get the flavor saver going but this one here no this is a one I mean you can barely get through one time out with this and yeah I feel I feel a little on the road again so yeah I definitely appreciate this this is an awesome pin I give it pretty much a 10 let's give it a 10", "wNDxMFl3_0o": "what's up squad what's going on I got another review for you guys today told you guys I was gonna go get the micro power and I did it's by Atmos the same company that makes this pen I actually had this one charging at the moment I'm gonna go ahead and plug that one back up but so far I love this pen it is small a small little battery as you can see it's very concealable you can put it in your hand is very easy the if you're wondering how the bait goes in it just slides right in after you connect the little magnetic piece that you screwing in the bottom and I say magnetic because some people might think oh if you just pulled it out and you just put it in this they're just gonna fall out no it's magnetic all right so let's get into the review also there are temperatures that you can set it to as you can see it's already on second notch I like it to be medium but not too hard so it doesn't burn this the oil is fast and you actually can stretch it you know and you get a nice strong pull every time you see I've got a little bit seeping out that's nice it doesn't burn or anything everything goes down smooth and clean but uh if you're ever looking for it if you're not on my Instagram already the link will be in the description below you can check out all the pictures I'll be posting a future reviews or items that are vaping related so uh one more time for the camera this is what it looked like in the box micro pal this is what she'll get inside luckily everything's metal so wouldn't break and also when this drops I feel like it'll reduce the chance of it actually smashing as opposed to this because having this without a complete lanyard set I can't find mine on hand sorry but having this without the lanyard you're just begging to just drop it just like people who have smartphones with no cases you're just begging for the drop oh I'm careful I'm careful on California they'll call accidents for a reason we don't expect them and it happened all of a sudden out of the blue also you get a little instruction manual on the inside guess not me you start going through it figure out which temperature is which all right guys thanks for the views now check you on the next video stay hi guys", "-xVtB0znqY4": "the true leave silver button battery pen can also be used to vaporize our bit cartridges both ceramic and wick to use make sure it's fully charged using the attached USB charger you want to unscrew the charger just set it aside next if you want to insert your bait cartridge into the pen we turn it on by clicking five times within three seconds this pin has various power controls so that you can control the heat and the voltage of the pen if you want to adjust the temperature in the voltage you can do that by pressing the button with three clicks the read is 4 volts if you want to lower that click it three more times Green is three point 6 volts you can also do a third setting by clicking three more times blue that's three point eight volts it's recommended to use this at the green setting because it will prolong the battery life again three clicks for red three clicks for green which is the approved and recommended setting then to begin vaporizing hold down the button and draw on your vape cartridge once you've gotten your recommended dose you want to click the button again five times within three seconds and the pen will power off so let's talk about price on these two accessories the reason they're sold separately is because the truly true pair warming chamber will actually fit into any button battery bait penned by screwing in it so if a patient already has a button battery stick pen they can buy this separately and still be able to warm their true clear the price of this is twenty dollars the true leaves silver button battery pin is also twenty dollars again this can be purchased individually to use with vape cartridges or together to use with the true clear warmer they're both priced separately at twenty dollars but if patients need to buy them together because they don't have the button battery pin already they can get both for $30 so again the warming chamber is twenty dollars individually the pen is twenty dollars individually but if patients purchase them together it's thirty dollars", "JLvw59l_hZ8": "hi everybody unhealthy and I'm the director of operations at one release today I'm going to talk to you a bit about our baked article to have oil of course so our big cartridges are all glass and stainless steel they are 510 threads so they should connect to any 510 thread push-button battery now the push button is important because the way that our cartridge is designed they will not work on a pull-through battery so all of our cards come with a silicon cap here on the top I recommend twisting clockwise to remove this Jack now that is 2 times if you twist counterclockwise you can potentially loosen your mouthpiece if you do that you run the risk of leaking some of the oil out on the side if it gets warm and run to the top so just twist make sure these guys are clamped on nice and tight we connect these guys to any push-button battery again ah I just screwing them into the top here on the base plate now Arbus push button batteries take 5 click to turn off and 5 flicks to turn on then you know that the battery has a good connection with the cartridge if when you push the button you get a solid steady life on these batteries we change the voltage by clicking three times and for each different voltage you'll get a different light to indicate where you're at for our batteries we right usually recommend vaporizing around 3.3 volts to 4.0 volts depending on which matter you have and what all you have I personally prefer to vaporize about 3.3 volts no higher than 3.6 now our cartridges we do not usually recommend for refills however if you are going to refill our cartridge you unscrew the mouthpiece let that guys side and with your syringe you're going to want to fill around suppose into the area that you see between the the metal post and the glass tank do not fill directly into that post and it's because if you do you'll actually clog your mouthpiece and will be able to draw if your cartridge is leaking chances are that it's leaking from either the bottom gasket or the top gasket we've actually replicated 14,000 feet at 100 reads Fahrenheit without any leakage out of the bottom so we're pretty confident that one and if that is happening then chances are you've accidentally unscrewed your mouthpiece a little bit so all that you do screw that back down nice and snug and make sure that your cartridge remains upright as opposed to buying it on slide or upside down if the oil flows into the post and it plugs your mouthpiece all you need to do your unscrew your mouthpiece okay take something long and in like a paper clip and just run it down through the mouthpiece now you should be able to clear this guy right up if the oil is a little too thin you can actually refrigerate your mouthpiece for a few minutes taking that all up and it should push out nice and smooth but you can see now you're getting a lot of that oil out you're just going to drop that back down into your change if there is an air bubble that builds up around the hole all you need to do is you need to keep the oil in order to get it to settle again you can use your body heat just hold it in your hand for a while put it in a pocket that's close to your body or run it under warm water either I personally for your life all you do one the lighter over the black part of the tank and then hold it upright to allow the oil to settle again now this is perfectly safe because our cartridges again are made of glass and stainless steel and the gaskets inside our high temp resistant silicone so you're not going to be putting any bad chemicals into your oil", "Ay7k1EcTYFk": "I mark here with Hamilton devices today I'm going to show you our new cloak 510 thread series battery first of all packaging here at the very bottom here to see the color we got our red device here we'll open the box up here and inside you will see our instruction sheet second the device itself and then a little side box here so we'll pull this guy out actually unit here then I'll token this little compartment here and inside here will be the micro USB charger along with an extra set of toe rings I'm gonna tell you about this guy really quick here comes the battery the charger works of course standard micro USB at the very bottom insert into your any kind of you know see that you have at home and charge it up takes processing 1 to 1.5 hours of fully charged also here on the list of cover up and at the very bottom here hard to see here it's a little overing that's the actual sealer that's the air sealer so we do include two extra for you but for all intents and purposes you'll never need to use these through our testing we're still using original toe rings after nine plus less I'm just gonna put this aside here and when it actually close this guy for a little bit about the battery on an instruction sheet here first of all it has 650 milliamp hour battery what 650-million powers mean that's the capacity of the battery so generally speaking if one person using the clothes but you're not are using it as their love it lasts perfectly 7 to 10 days between charges as a regular thing I do charge mine maybe every seven eight days this is because I'd like to use all time all right also it does have a ten-second max draw time on its own you are pulling on it you can go for 10 seconds before having an auto-shutoff and as far as your voltage of the battery it actually is a technically a variable voltage battery but it's not adjustable the way it works is your first draw is at 4.2 volts it immediately starts all into 3.2 then it will start to hover right around 3.4 3.6 for rocks filming some of the medium heat settings for most of your cartridge boils ok let me show you on the device actual works once again just lift the cover back up and I work with any 510 thread back I'm cartridge generally speaking a half gram for gram whatever you want it's no work this insert this guy in and spread all the way till it stops then we slide the cover back on and this is an auto draw battery so there's no buttons to push no on/off switch you simply draw it in handle that's how he'll be activated you will see a little light will come on as well here we go another little trick powder device here at the bottom next to the actual charger isn't a little air intake holes to acts like a car black on a ball so you can actually open and close this as you're pulling and you get a larger hit uh-huh first hits of the day too by the way so anyways also my shitty power packaging comes it comes in a 10 pack nice enclosed box and it is a cut out box so for retail display comes in red white and blue and black and our set soft touch series and we will be having more colors coming out send - thanks again for watching please feel free contact us directly yet debuted w hamilton devices comm with any questions you may have thanks a lot a great day you", "RAeT8HTlew8": "hey everyone we're back again with another how-to video today we're gonna take a look at sushi babes brand-new first of its kind battery the suit you squeeze it's a really cool unit sleek portable and comfortable with the added benefit of making it look like you own a Maserati it's packed with a lot of helpful functions like visual haptic feedback lurtz and a 15-minute auto shutoff function let's go charge it up you can check your battery level at any time while the device is on by squeezing the trigger one time green means it's fully charged blue means 75% tio means 50% and red means 25% battery life when squeezed is on low battery the LED light will flash red five times including the boxes of course the charging cable wall charging the LED lights will remain red and then when fully charged they'll turn green okay so now this 500 mAh battery is fully charged let's power it up and get started like you'll see with most batteries click the car button five times to turn it on in this case you're gonna want to squeeze the trigger on the plate sided with guide bumps you'll feel a vibration and then see the LED light up to indicate the current voltage level adjust your voltage level by squeezing the trigger rapidly three times LED light will flash green for two point eight volts blue for three point two volts teal for 3.7 volts and red for four point two volts the squeeze also features session mode a ten-second preheat cycle that gradually warms up your oils attack you eight the cycle squeeze the trigger two times you'll see the LED lights cycle colors for 10 seconds before blinking three times and vibrating that's when the session ended but if you want to end session mode early click the power button once at any time during next you want to take the included magnetically adapter let's screw it to the bottom of your cartridge before inserting the cartridge into the squeeze when the cartridge successfully connects the unit will vibrate and play a light cycle to get a draw push and hold the power button the unit will allow you to inhale for up to 10 seconds in a one single drop the squeeze is very easy to troubleshoot the LED lights will blink two times if there's no cartridge detected or it'll blink red three times to let you know that the battery is trying to prevent a short-circuit this usually means that the cartridge is bad but in any case it's always good to clean the bottom of the cartridge and any connecting points before trying to connect again I don't suggest charging the battery overnight like all batteries too much heat will damage them hey you should monitor the squeeze by the LED indicators like I said earlier you can always check the battery level at any time just push the squeeze one time and it turn it off squeeze the same trigger five times the device will remain on standby mode for 15 minutes before automatically turning off keeping it safe for next time we hope this video is helpful what are your thoughts on the citrus squeeze if you have any other questions leave them down in the comments below subscribe to Sutra vape for more videos like this and we'll see you next time peace", "i_zb0hnBi3o": "is going to have to work it's gonna have to work what's going on guys it's Dave on Raymond so the other day I was at my local smoke shop and I was thinking you know what I think I should probably just buy a new vape cartridge battery just because the two cheap ones that I had prior they did their job and they're good but there was just some problems along the way that I felt that you know I just wanted something else something better so I had been buying these cheap vape pen cartridge batteries ten bucks $15 here you know buying charge was separate and after spending all this money you know in small increments I realized why don't I just buy something that's worth the money you know okay guys so today we have the open vape 2.0 variable voltage battery I picked up the rose gold just because I'm classy like that it's a variable temp it's got four different modes so I just skimmed this here and the open vape 2.0 is actually pretty awesome with the four different variable temperatures here also including a wax one which seems to be the same as the high but that's interesting though they have a mode for wax not only that but actually it also comes with this rapid charger which is really important if you're gonna be using vaping as your main source of consuming cannabis well let's open it up it's what's inside that counts whoa it's got a stylus on the end that's pretty yeah yeah and nothing else in the box nope okay cool ingredients done and honestly you know I I thought I killed the battery last night I plugged it in put it on rapid charging mode for like five minutes I turned around and it was done charging so I don't know if it's exactly gonna be done in five minutes but if that is what I should come to you know expect from this open vape tooth and I'm definitely going to keep this piece around okay guys really quick I just wanted to go through the different types of batteries that I have just so you can get a better idea of what type of battery you might want to buy for your vape cartridges and I picked up this cheap ten dollar battery nothing too special about it's the 510 thread like most has the 5 click button this one square has a matte finish and a plastic stylus tip on the end so it's pretty cool also turn it on the light actually glows with the different temperatures that you choose so that's pretty cool look at the blue and it also features red so that one is pretty sweet however it charges with one of these and that is kind of an inconvenience whereas this one that I have a plastic a little bit heavier round button still the similar 510 thread but it has a USB mini USB port on the bottom so that's extremely convenient for anybody who happenin for anybody who happens to have like an Android phone and you know wants to unplug their phone for a moment and charge their battery so getting to the man of the hour here the open you vape to what's totally awesome about this pen is that you don't have to push any buttons to draw it's just a natural putting it to your face and pulling and guys that was on the low setting so it's pretty decent pretty decent flavor just like the box says oh were crooked oh [ __ ] so cool ooh and cool sitting crisscross applesauce is really really hard for me the groin pain uh anyway I'm really really really liking this pen they just feel so natural to draw without having to push a button it's just so much easier and somebody said you don't get fat rips off of a pens you definitely do and I would say the open babe - definitely aids in that [Music] [Music]", "JuOEONyNkDo": "hello my name is mark this is my channel Prince of puffs you can also find me on instagram at Prince of puffs I wanted to let you know something else about our tombstone that we make here at Hamilton devices let's say you only have one cartridge or let's say you had two and then one one was a little bit less that's perfectly fine because it comes with a dummy cartridge right here so you can smoke one at that time same thing you put it right over here in it good puffs doing well but let's say you have a friend that comes over and they want to start blending and give you some of theirs very easy take this off insert the other cart cover now you're bleeding now you give me twice as big a hit thank you", "HPeCUvEf2XA": "I have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made my opponent it's just like alright you won't turn it so I have to do it like this I got to hold it that's gonna be the video guys I hope you all enjoyed make sure to check out all the links in the description make sure to share the social media do all that [ __ ] like the video comment a subscribe do all that [ __ ] I'll see you in the next video we're just gonna be on I'll see you in the next video which is gonna be on Wednesday maybe even sooner [Music]", "UI5d1o2oN1o": "greetings everyone I am back with more bad news okay this story all begins last November November 14th of 2 7 2017 I ordered one of these not this one a different one a click unit this is a click thick oil vaporizer from randy's this burns up in the 4.2 plus voltage range so your thick stuff like Rick Simpson oil can be vaporized and inhaled it was exactly what I needed so I ordered one cost me $30 plus shipping and I also ordered a what's known as the ve 8 atomizer now I didn't know it at the time but the ve 8 atomizer had a little design flaw everything about it was made out of stainless steel and Pyrex except for where the pole piece is isolated from the ring on the outside where the electrical conductivity gets into the coil that pole piece was mounted in plastic and the pole piece folded over and shorted out my click unit now I didn't discover this until they replace that click unit and I continued using that thing not realizing that the pole piece had folded over at one point but anyway I continued using the second click unit they sent me this is a warranty replacement unit and that lasted all the way up until August third of 2018 so I got almost a year out of heavy use out of this unit I am really impressed I love this unit it's sturdy little design I especially like the fact that it's got a magnetic attachment point where you can just drop your cartridges in this presents a problem later you'll see know when that quit I decided to take it apart and find out what the failure point was because I love this unit and I wanted to try and preserve it and if I could simply replace the battery and continue using it then that's exactly what I was planning to do I made a short video where I disassembled this unit and I could determine that the lithium cell was what failed due to a short circuit and I posted the video and that same day I got a message from Randy's offering me both a replacement click unit and a charm unit if I would take that video down now I didn't want anyone to be able to hold anything over me I didn't want to I didn't want to set a precedent where anyone who offers me merge can just silence my voice on YouTube so I said you know what I'm happy to take the video again there's nothing about the video that says it's anything other than my favorite unit it's a well engineered little piece of hardware it just suffers from a fatal flaw if you short-circuit the thing it'll pop the battery so the answer is don't short-circuit the thing correct I mean easy peasy nothing no skill no one needs to get their feelings hurt they insisted on sending me a charm unit which failed after nine days so the original video I took the original video down okay that one's it's it's still out there it's Fred been put behind the privatized pay wall but the original video where I just simply disassembled a click unit that was taken down they sent me this in compensation for removal of my video this is a charm unit this is a it's got three different voltage ranges whereas this one only has one so this is more useful to the people who you know have interchangeable cartridges until until this one failed and the failure mode was not the same as this one the failure mode on the charm unit acted as though it had simply broken a solder joint it would still light up it would still interact when you push the button and click sequences it would still behave exactly as if it were fully functional it just would not heat up the oil which tells me that it's basically a broken wire and that's when I took this one apart that's was exactly what I found was the blue wire that runs from the circuit board to the center pull piece on the base of the coil screw in adapter okay that wire had broken off at the solder joint and I can show you exactly why this happens right now okay bear with me there's a point to all this okay here's the charm unit I'm gonna try and get this thing up where you can see right down inside there I'm going to take this in empty cartridge and I'm going to screw it into place now watch this edger when I'm screwing this thing into place that sitter electrical pole piece is not locked in it spins freely it's not keyed within the plastic insulator ring and that is what breaks these cheap monofilament wires these things are no thicker than a single hair and this whole piece spinning back and forth every time you screw or unscrew a cartridge you are twisting this little tiny hairlike wire against that solder joint and it will break it always will break and the way that I know this is this was the first one they sent me it lasted for nine days okay this is the second one that they sent me this is a warranty replacement for this one that they offered me free to take down the video okay this one is also broken and now right now on camera we're gonna take this [ __ ] apart put this in the bag so I don't mix up any parts all right okay charm number one is begged and separated over there with click unit okay my cartridges away and now we're gonna start taking this thing apart first gotta take off little lariat lanyard thingy I'm gonna hook this there we go I suppose I probably could have left this on it's just gonna make things neater if I don't have strings attached so to speak the lanyard is off let's get my screwdriver and we'll start taking this thing apart now I'm gonna put odds on the fact that what we find inside here is that same blue wire going to the same center pull piece on the connection to the the screw joint for the coil and I'm pretty sure we're gonna find that that blue wire has disconnected from the solder joint because you're twisting that thing back and forth every time you screw in a cartridge in you're twisting that pool piece I apologize if this is going slow I may at some point decide to make this go faster with wonderful YouTube effects in post all right let's see here unscrew unscrew these are tiny tiny screws I have to use eyeglass screwdriver in order to do this and I can barely see what I'm doing come on here we go okay I'll get the ones out of the bottom do this so in case you're wondering no I have not taken this one apart this is this unit has been untouched from the factory all I have done so far on this thing it's charge it up and use it and charge it up and use it in charge up and use it okay there's all the screws are out let's slide the case apart kids behave yourselves over there alright here we go slide the case apart and the blue wire is completely hanging loose so there you have it folks the same failure point on both the charm units is the twisting when you screw the cartridges in the twisting strings and eventually breaks the blue wire on the centre pole piece this is absolutely a design failure and randy's is putting their good name behind bad merch and this could take your company folks I don't know how to tell you any different don't do this this is not smart all right so I'm gonna go find some real wire and I'm gonna Reese are these and make working units out of as many of these as I possibly can I don't know that replacing any of this is gonna work you know if if you're just sending me more of the same then you you know you okay if we're just talking in retail terms here Randi's has now sent one hundred and twenty dollars worth of vaporizer units for a thirty dollar investment a year ago okay this is a losing prospect you've got to stop throwing a good name behind bad merch you go and fix this stuff at the supplier or else you're gonna take your company okay and here's the other thing guys these I love these units these are powerful little units but they're designed so they only fit this sighs cartridge or at this size cartridge but this is a larger diameter and this is a larger diameter still these are the tanks that come with the charm unit so you're actually vending tanks that don't fit in these units you can't cross over because of the diameter of the tanks in the new units so I'm a little annoyed by that what I what I think I might do is take the guts out of a a quick unit and stick it inside a charm so I can use the lighter tanks and still use the magnetic attachments because this this is something that I want to point out the guys you're not gonna have the wire breakage with the Kliq unit because of a magnetic attachment point you're not stressing the MEI you're not stressing the solder joints underneath the screw the screw pins the the the the screw joint the coral screws in that's that's the weak point is the soldering and the the thin wire and these were these wires are ridiculously thin I mean I don't even know how they conduct electricity this stuff now no significant voltage would ever travel through those thin gauge wires but anyway so that's who is I love the magnetic things I just wish they made them you know so they fit the newer cartridge systems anyway so that's a whole lot of complaining and not a whole lot of fixing next video will be a whole lot of fixing cuz I will get I've got a new soldering iron on order with nice fine tips and I'm gonna fix as many of these damn vaporizing units as I can because I'm just sick of having a whole pile of junk that's not functional so there we go folks end of story I know this is long-winded and tedious and I'm sorry but this is this is my life now buying crap that doesn't work", "Fl8NWhtyndg": "hi I'm Dan huff CEO of honey stick and today we're very excited to launch our new item for in our 2018 lineup of vaporizers the elf ultra compact auto draw concealer ok we're really really excited to bring this item out because it's actually the first in the industry to be a magnetic concealer that is a Auto draw so it is completely buttonless so the urine is just on standby and all you do to activate the unit to vape is you would inhale the unit what sets this unit also apart is we've been getting a lot of emails from you guys that said hey you know I love my bee keeper can you guys make the hole a little bit wider in order to fit some more cartridges so what we did with the elf unit is we made sure to make the hole wider so it's gonna fit a wider range of cartridges and that a hole size is about 11 millimeters so let's give us some specifics about the unit so when you get your unit it's gonna come in a nice box like this and what its gonna have is it's gonna have your elf unit and your USB charger and some instructions so basically the unit is gonna come with the body with the cartridge already in it and you just simply pull the cartridge out and then you're gonna have your magnetic adapter that you can either use with the cartridge that came with the kit or you can use that and just simply place that onto a prefilled cartridge that you pick up you just simply screw it on make sure it's on there you know hand tight let me just drop it in you hear the click in the unit is rate of V again it's completely buttonless so this unit is an auto draw battery which can actually fire some of the ceramic cartridges because that's the main problem with pull batteries that don't have a button is that when it comes to ceramic cartridges or cartridges that are wider and require more power or current it won't actually fire them our elf unit will fire those cartridges the cartridge that it comes with has a ceramic mouthpiece so it's gonna feel really good and have that kind of purity on it when you when you're inhaling on it and also it has a glass premium glass body also a ceramic heater core so this cartridge already is a very nice high performance cartridge if you choose to fill this this unit up yourself and not buy the other cartridges so then you have a microUSB port right there you can just simply plug the cord in just clicks in there once it snaps in use a wall adapter I always recommend use a wall adapter don't use your laptops or your computers to power up to make sure the battery gets good current and then when you're ready to vape all you do is you inhale on the unit and the units gonna light up in the body right here you see how a little green that means that the battery is has ample power and so with our elf units once you start inhaling on them and that light either fades flickers or it will turn to red that means you need to get your you need to get your unit onto a charger and it's very clear to see some people with our beekeepers said hey guys sometimes I have trouble seeing the light on there we want to make sure the light on this unit is clearly visible so how does this one compare in terms of size to our other concealers because we have a very nice lineup of concealers so we have our beekeeper which is very similar size also a magnetic adapter drop in but it's a push button and that's for you guys who like the push button you guys like to push and hold your draw or do any preheating here's how it compares the size again both very awesome units this one no button you just pull this is you know effortless draws and everybody who knows me knows that I am more of a push-button person ever since we've started honey stick we only have one other push-button unit which is our V pod this is really the only auto draw concealer that I personally could get behind being a push-button guy but the performance is really up there the drawers are just absolutely effortless the heat up time is very quick and you really really get everything that you can get out of the unit and then we have our other concealer unit which is the Phantom just to show you how to stack stuff this is a variable temperature ultra high capacity thousand mah it's a squeeze action activated and also has the ability to do wax use a wax cartridge use a concentrate cartridge with the coarse adapters but here's basically how they stack up size-wise now what is cool about the El is that we heard everybody's cries that you guys wanted some more colors so we gave some cool colors we have a blue we have a nice nice high gloss white which is kind of like a like a snow color we have a pink for the ladies and we also have a green and also we have the classic black so if you want to pick up a good auto draw concealer unit there's really revolutionary check out the elf if this little elf was one of Santa's helpers I don't think anybody be getting their Christmas presents on time but that's a good thing in our case so for this and several other cool items check us out on vape honey stay calm

worth it one of the interesting things about pods is with the tax area you get pods that are licensed out to processors like abstract here in Washington but Stevie actually makes their pods under their own brand of Stevie but is working with local processors and flour I'm sure you guys want to figure out which one is best for you so let's just jump into it first up we have the steezy this brand started in LA but has started growing rapidly to other states I purchased a prefilled cartridge for $30 from a local dispensary and the battery was free with a pod purchase after you get through the one-page instruction booklet and the micro USB cable you get to the actual Stevie which is a little bit more difficult than it looks to get out with bigger fingers yeah the battery again is very basic no buttons no visible indents just their logo on the side and a place to plug in many people have issues with fakes TZ pods and batteries this can be extremely harmful to your health but as long as you purchase from a trusted retailer and not your plug on Instagram you should be fine but they pride themselves on labs tested premium quality concentrates unlike their packaging which is not so premium due to their childproof compliant packaging but if you're a rebel like me you can open it differently you can also spot fakes TV pods by they're slightly different packaging including black trays holding the pod I did have one incident where the gold pins on the bottom of this easy pod didn't allow it to connect to the battery overall the stevesie is a great option for taking your concentrates on the go it's a simple and discreet device that makes even seasoned divers think twice about pods now let's take a look at the PAX era my dispensary didn't have any deals on the battery so I paid the full $30 the packaging on this is great and really makes the product feel premium and hey the even has a cutout for a big ten people longer instructions for all the features they packed into it and a sticker to wrap the brand as I mentioned before I went with more of a premium concentrate with AD abstract cartridge local processor you sell pods for around 30 to $75 each this can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the quality around you the packs has this useful feature on it that shows you the battery life and you can use to change settings on-the-fly the packs instantly became my everyday carry and is the one I would prefer having out of these two I really do enjoy the airflow and the strength of a hit from a cz but the smooth reliable hit from a packs and the customization of your experience along with a beautiful design and a feature-rich device the packs also connected via bluetooth to control temperature hit size and even play games if you want me to

guys take a", "tYK-ZC68CjI": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "UrJJjwEnSeI": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today I'm bringing you guys a video that is based on special requests from a lot of our viewers that want to know exactly how to pick out the best oil tank now this is normally not a video I would do because out of all this assortment of oil tanks that I have put together is basically comprising of about everything on the market on our website we probably sell about five or six of them now I have these in our testing lab because I'm always testing them we do have a lot of extractors that we private label for that we might be making this these cartridges for that might not be available but one of the common questions that a lot of our users are having that really wanted to see this video up is I have a honey stick battery when I go to dispensary and I have an option of picking out prefilled cartridges how do I know which one's gonna be good or how it's gonna work you know so this video here is gonna go through from you being able to eyeball an oil 5-10 disposable cartridge and being able to tell bass have a good reasonable estimate of how it is gonna be able to perform what it will kind of features it's gonna have so that you can pick out the best oil vape tank for your battery now what is a disposable 510 thread cartridge so there's a lot of people out there who purchase these 510 thread oil cartridges to fill themselves and they say but if it's disposable can I only fill it one time so the short answer is no most of these tanks you can take if you're buying them empty you can fill them up four to five times without a problem however some of them you can only fill once and we'll go over that other times when you go to dispensary most of them already have oil in them so just because you have an amazing cartridge if you're buying a bad extract not even the best cartridge can make a bad oil taste good so however you can have good oil where the whole vaping experience gets dulled down or made bad or taste burnt from a bad cartridge so what this video is gonna help you do is it's gonna help you make some educated decisions when it comes to purchasing and selecting either the cartridge you're gonna fill at home or the cartridges that you're gonna pick up prefilled to know how they're gonna perform so let's start off by starting from the very top of the cartridges of how you're gonna be able to start making some identification so let's do a close up here and start off with when you look at the mouthpiece to see what the hole size is gonna be let's start at the tip and work our way to the bottom okay guys so here we have a close-up view we're gonna start at the very top of the cartridge so we can go in and start making some determinations so you can see I put together what I thought was the best assortment of pre fillable disposable tanks so the tops let's go to the very top first things first generally the wider bore you have on mouthpiece which is the part that you inhale through the more vapor you're gonna get the smaller that hole is you are gonna get either less vapor or it's gonna have a smoother easier transition into your mouth so let's let's take a shot from the top here just to show the differences in the size of the bores so basically as you could see from this basic stylus plastic tip car it has a very small Inlet hole even these stainless steel ones here right they have relatively small and some of them are larger when we work our way down you have these wide bore mouthpieces which have very wide inlets if you're a person who really likes to vape like this one is probably the widest if you like to get a big cloud and a massive hits that you can really draw air through with minimal amount of resistance you probably want to get a cartridge that has a wider bore hole at the very top as opposed to having one of the smaller tips that are more focused on smoothness now some people have said that the wider bore the mouthpieces sometimes you get a little flavor loss because you're just going straight mouth to lung instead of kind of mouth to thrill to lung on your inhale it kind of focuses more on just going straight to lung however you probably get better activation and more of a hit now once you've figured out what size borer you want there's a whole multitude of mouthpiece materials as you can see you start off with the basic plastic mouthpiece which is very lightweight and then you have stainless steel and then you have ceramic which you can see here you even have wood and kind of an acrylic resin and then you have not stainless steel but more of a aluminum coated metal so I can tell you right off the bat if you are at or if you like tattoo on your cartridges like in high school I wouldn't want people to see what my pencil number two pencils look like but luckily I grew out of that but you know people sometimes chew on their cigarettes chew on their cartridges if you art or you know you have the plastic option that's not going to break your teeth but you don't want little plastic particles getting into your mouth so you're probably best off going with a natural wood cartridge so this is a natural wooden mouthpiece it's very soft wood it's not even sealed with an epoxy for coating however if you're gonna be refilling this a lot do get new tips because when you chew on them they are gonna get beat up and the moisture sitting on wood does not bode well you also have the acrylic and the metal ones if you chew I would stay far from the metal ones you're gonna end up breaking your teeth the ceramic what's a really unique offering with ceramic style mouthpieces is that they say that it's very clean very easy to get clean it also feels sturdy like the metal ones however doesn't feel heavy in your so it's it's very natural on to the lips and it offers again it's super easy to clean off it's much lighter than the stainless steel pieces and it just feels overall more natural to wear as a stainless steel one you know you are putting a little piece of metal into your mouth and what's unique let's say about the powder coated ones to where it's not like a shiny stainless steel and thick metal it's a much thinner metal and it's coated so it's never you know really gonna be cold to your lips if you pick them up if it's been in the AC or whatnot so when selecting your mouthpiece you have your the bore of the inlet hole and you also have the mouthpiece material now mouthpiece shape also makes a difference generally as you can see you're very wide bore ones are very cylindrical and that is to just allow maximum vapor to come up through them these flattened mouthpieces that look more like black and milds are gonna dull the vapor down condense it and make it a smoother transmission so again we're going back to wide bore more vapor flattened is gonna possibly be smoother if you're undecided and you want in between the two you have these kind of hookah style tips that have a relatively wide wide bore but they don't get flattened too much to restrict the vapor so mouthpiece shape and size definitely the first point of contact with the cartridge in kind of a first way that you can determine it now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take all these cartridges out and we're gonna talk about what the body of the tank brings to the game okay guys now before we move on to going over what the differences are between the body of the tanks one more notable thing about the mouthpiece is if you are buying your cartridges to refill whether you buy to a dispenser buy them from guys like us to refill the one thing that you have to know when you're dealing with tops is there is a new type of top which child safety is really big in the industry right now so there are compression tops that once the extractor or you fill them up and you basically crimp them down right you see there's no screw here once you crimp this down this cartridge is not coming back apart for you to refill so then once you go through your initial extract right on a childproof crimp lock here there's a pop top you're not gonna be able get back into this cartridge without breaking it and so you're not going to be all refilled so if you're looking for more than one use out of your cartridge don't buy the crimp tops this is also crimp top as you could see there's no threading and you can see this is one of the newer resin cartridge is actually very popular cartridge so once you push that down you're not getting back into it now let's talk about the body of these things now you have generally two types of outside bodies or reservoirs which house the oil that you're gonna be filling you generally have plastic and you have glass now things to look for is plastic cartridges generally they're not as popular anymore because people you know they want purity when you fill up a plastic cartridge it sits for a long time I don't know if it's true or not I'm not a scientist but they say they could alter the change the oil if it sits in there because the THC can react with the plastic and also the components in there so they say a glass is much better to store things in because it is going to be medically neutral to reacting and if you are going for a glass especially the Pyrex grade of glass is going to be perfect because it's also not sensitive the temperature changes so if you're going plastic tank where are the advantages well the advantages are is you're never gonna shatter your tank and they're super lightweight so they're gonna be much lighter so if you're taking it out hiking or sporty and you don't want to carry around the tank plastic tank weighs about half of what a glass tank does and plastic with a plastic mouthpiece it does not get much lighter and but if you're looking at already a plastic tank you have different grades of plastic and you can tell that from the clarity you see this is a little bit foggy this a lot of people would think is a glass tank but it is actually an upgrade plastic tank it just has a much higher quality clarity so this is an upgrade plastic tank that just has better clarity and among plastic tanks one of the most popular ones now is you have actually resin tanks which are like this generally they come in mouthpieces like this set up right here this is actually a resin tank you really can't tell the difference between the glass and the resin except the difference is is one will shatter if you hit it hard enough and one will not now if you are buying glass there are different grades of glass you know the company that does cartridges like this I'm sure you guys are familiar brassknuckles is a prime example of somebody who focus on cartridges like this this is a very thick grade of glass and you can tell that by touching it and honestly you can probably eyeball it to tell how thick the grade of glasses so you look at it it's gonna be thicker glass this glass this tank right here which is our cloud tank actually uses a very thick Pyrex certified glass so this is actually a very expensive good glass it's very hard you don't really have to worry about it breaking or shattering it's a very thick and sturdy and other tanks are thinner glass for example this one you can tell generally tell if the glass is very very shiny and it almost looks like plastic basically that is indication without touching it that it is a thinner glass so those are just some things out the body you want to be careful of now when also looking at the body center post that has become a big Arian debate within the market because generally plastic tanks don't have center post so we'll just move those over here if you look at a center post you can see some of them have wide bases some of them don't have a base some of them have rounded bases right they all have a different structure now what's the significance basically if you have a center post that has there's very thin it is more likely that the tank if you are refilling it that the center post will not be secure when you're securing the top piece down to the center post that it could wobble go out of place and possibly leak the downside so then people put in a wider base to make it more stable take up a little more space make sure that you can screw the tank down and you're not gonna have any areas of leakage the thing is with a bigger center post is sometimes oil gets caught on the transition areas or on the hills of the center post so then if you do have a wide center post base you want to make sure it's nicely rounded so you're not gonna get oil or any wastage caught up there that would make your tank less fuel efficient for example our ELF cartridge here in pink as you can see it's a wider center post but there are no slopes in there that the oil can get caught on so you're gonna use a much larger percentage of the oil that's not going to get caught in the center post transition however going right from center post talks down to the heater okay let's talk heaters most basically you have your wick cartridge as you can see it has a wick that stays up that is wrapped in a heating element wire usually those wicks are made of silica and what happens is it absorbs the oils and it burns them and these happen just fine however it's not going to do you justice and accentuating the taste of the oils and especially if you have thick oils that dry up around there you can actually taste the heater and burn the heater before you burn the oil so if you don't have a pre heat function you have a wick you could run into some issues with taste there so a lot of upgrades have moved to wick list cartridges this is a plastic those are beekeeper replacement tank it is same concept however it has no wick and it has a ceramic heating element a lot of cartridges that say they're ceramic and you can see they're ceramic generally with seeing a little white block through the inlet holes so you could see some of them have a little white block that means they are ceramic powered generally ceramic heaters mean that you're gonna get better taste better flavor notes better flavor accentuation now it's become really popular lately is this what a lot of people have coined as si cell style technology in heaters which means that you have a ceramic block inside of the actual heater itself let's find a nice example right there that is a perfect example of a cease tell it's a coated ceramic block they have good heat up times and right now they're probably considered a very nice performance tank on the market however your problems with these are is that once you've run through a filler to the taste can drop off with thicker oils if you do not have a preheat function they can fight they can heat differently so generally you want a more viscous oil with your C cells and if they don't have a wide enough Inlet hole which is the next area that we're gonna talk about you could run into some clog \u00e4j-- issues but these have a coated block it's not no rocket science abouts just a different take on a ceramic cartridge if you look this has a ceramic block however it is forced down so this is gonna use oils very efficiently this is actually an updated version of the cloud tank and half mil so that is a ceramic block heater you get good taste notes on these and then you have units that are wickless but they don't have a ceramic heater that have different sized Inlet holes now since we're talking about inlet holes what's the general rule of thumb on Inlet holes you go to dispensary and see different sizes and shapes of inlet holes as we showed the C cell had a very wide end lit hole and other tanks like a cloud tank has a relatively wide inlet hole but not overly wide so the general rule of thumb is is that the thicker your oil is that you are putting in there the wider of an inlet hole you're gonna need so that the oil can properly have access to the heater and vaporize if you have a thin inlet hoyle a hole a small Inlet hole and you have very thick oils it's going to be very hard for that oil to come in contact with the heater and actually burn so you are gonna want if you have thick oils to have a large Inlet hole so that that oil is always having contact with the heater however what if you have a large inlet hole and you have thin oils well your your possibility of leaking down through the post goes up exponentially so if you have very thin oils don't go crazy and get tanks with really large Inlet holes because then you could have leakage you could have wastage or the oil is gonna burn up very very quickly so I think that about covers what we would talk about with the inlet holes now air flow control air flow control is available on some tanks we have our cloud tank it has an air flow control here at the top this all ceramic tank right here has air flow controls at the bottom this tank has air controls atop certain tanks have this and what this is for is to allow you to control your hit when you open up the air hole it allows you to bring in air it allows you to bring an air from the outside to kind of dilute and aerate your hit if you have it closed then you can concentrate your hit to basically only draw the vapor out of the tank and out of the little air holes are located around the tank but if you open it you can draw more air so you can take a bigger volume hit but it some people like to concentrate their hit and not allow you to do that so what is the downfall of the air control the positive is you can control your hits and really tune in on what intensity of a hit you want the downfall is if you leave it open like it is partially open now then you put it on its side and it's tilted well that's an area where you can experience some serious top leakage out of the tank a lot of measures are there to prevent that but it could happen so if you're somebody who gets airflow control and you don't use it just make sure to always keep them closed now since we've basically covered all angles of how to evaluate a tank how to eyeball it let's go over one more piece that is about the bottom air holes so some tanks at a dispensary you're probably not having to see the bottom air hole so this is probably the least important part of our oil tank analysis here but an important fact for you to know is generally the larger the bottom air hole is okay a lot of these run on a ball bearing system so that when you draw or you vaporize a ball bearing moves out of place and allows the vapor to pass through and when it's not being used it goes down and creates a seal so no oil comes and down through the the tank however if you do not have an air hole it is not going to work with auto draw units and a lot of you guys have Auto draw batteries a lot of people have elves out there so if you are buying a tank for your auto draw battery make sure with your dispensary that you have an air hole at the bottom of the tank and that it is compatible with auto draw batteries we tell people this all the time it's one of the most common mistakes people buy a tank they have an auto draw battery or an elf they say my unit or my tank is a dud it's not it's just not compatible with the two so if you have auto draw make sure you have an air hole make sure that it's a decent air hole as you can see this unit does not have an air hole so it is not going to be compatible with Stylus batteries it's not going to be compatible with our elf you could see our elf replacement cartridge has a very nice pronounced air hole with even some side vents so you want to make sure that you're picking up the right cartridge now for the very last part of this because we now gave you all the tools that you're gonna need to keep in mind when you're out tank shopping now I'm just gonna run through these tanks and basically give you the rundown of what you can expect out of each one of these tanks so that if you see one of these tanks on the shelf you basically know what you're getting into so hang tight while we get back to this final shoot all right guys now we're gonna run through each one of these tanks and just give you a very brief description of what you can expect for usage and the pluses and minuses of them so that when you're out tank shopping and you see one of these things you have a good idea of what you're gonna get so starting off with really the basic plastic stylist tank with the flat head tip you're gonna get this cartridge and it has a wick so you're not gonna don't expect a big boy taste or big boy hits this is really meant to be a light on-the-go reliable non leak easy to fill tank these run on the blue plug fill system very easy to fill very easy to mass fill but if you have thick oils and they get coagulated around there you can get burnt silica taste if you're not preheating properly in here so this isn't really a flavor tank or a monster hit tank but what it is is really an Old Faithful tank that you'll fill super light is gonna take a beating so if you're into extreme sports this is probably your tank if you want to upgrade from that stay plastic but go with a wickless something that has a ceramic heater or beekeeper replacement cartridge with a metal mouthpiece same very reliable top blue plug fill not gonna get any leaking the ceramic heater is definitely to give you much better flavor notes and more smoothness over the traditional wick system and the stainless steel mouthpiece is a similar shape but it's a higher quality fit and finish and feel then we have basically the upgraded glass version this is a childproof tank it will lock in place after it is filled it has relatively smaller inlet holes meant for more viscous oils and it is ceramic so you're gonna get about the same taste but you're gonna have the purity of glass that your oils are interacting with over plastic basically same thing except it is refillable you can unscrew this top okay a lot of flavor rx cartridges come in come into this style it is not ceramic you have some decent sized Inlet holes however not too wide and you have good center post support so there's going to be a good reliable glass tank however the mouthpiece on these things is heavy and it is flattened so it is more focused on smoothness not hits you have our elf replacement cartridge full ceramic very lightweight ceramic mouthpiece that you have in different colors it's gonna feel good on the lips and it has the unique design center posts that is wide so it's still gonna give you good support however you're not gonna have any oil that gets caught up sitting on there you're gonna use a big chunk of oil really fuel-efficient nice power awesome flavor tank then you have basically a gold finished tank that is somewhat popular out there similar square tip design nothing really special ceramic heaters the one problem is is you have this really big flat top ledge a lot of oils can get caught up there that you might never be able to vape so this is kind of an old-school design but it does have good seals it feels good in the hand and its relatively light basically here's the updated version this one migrated actually to a CE cell style so you're gonna get a good heat up time it is light however still not a hundred percent feeling the center post because you are gonna get oils that get stuck up there now this is a more modern C cell with a bullet-shaped battery we sell these along with the ceramic mouthpiece style as our elf replacement cartridge you're gonna get some more performance out of these because they have wider heater holes they have that C cell Center and you're gonna be able to get good flavor hits off of them they have you have a nice air inlet hole so they'll run well with Auto draw batteries you're gonna get some good power out of this tank actually this tank right here is a brand new tank I haven't tested it yet it is a fully ceramic interior so it's good to put its advertising that it's extremely pure taste it also a ceramic heater I'm not a hundred percent sure on the bottom air flow generally to me bottom air flow could leak so I haven't tested this tank yet but my team does have samples these because some of our customers are requesting a full blown ceramic tank this is basically just a 1 mil version a different mouthpiece version of this tank that we were talking about so difference is you can have a ceramic mouthpiece it's gonna feel a little bit more natural and this one no air hole not going to work well with Auto draw batteries here and I can tell you from holding it it is a little heavier than I would like to see a tank this cartridge right here generally you'll see them filled in brassknuckles cartridges very good cartridge works with most auto draw batteries as well as battery-powered these have one mil fill size I like the bowling pin style tip it's not exactly a wide bore but still definitely wide begin nice hits and it is thin down for some elegance the gold finish that these guys have done is pretty cool so if you're looking for a good prefilled cartridge I mean these have generally been pretty reliable I haven't heard any problems of leaking they have good taste they don't really excel so much in taste they don't excel so much in vapor but it's one of those tanks to where it does do a lot of all those right it runs at about 90% ultra reliable I've heard here you have the resin and resin tipsy sell style batteries as you can see really improve the the groove there to burn up more of the oil and again our elf replacement cartridges are similar with the ceramic mouthpiece I like the see-through tops it's really cool when you're drawing vapor out of them and also they're easy to clean they're light in your mouth you don't feel like you're gonna break your tooth if you incidentally bite on them and it's a cool little reliable tank this one however it is a child seal once you push it down you're not getting it open so only buy these for the one-time fill unless you see it's got a screw top so ask him to specify same exact thing just a wood mouthpiece for those people who like the the natural wood this one is the same as the wooden except it has a different has a little air flow control here at the top it's kind of unique you just swivel the mouthpiece and that opens and closes the air flow if you want a little bit more control on your mouthpiece these three cartridges all come from the same factory it is I mean the same family it is basically the cloud tank here and they have adjustable air flow for these two the half mil and the 1 mil versions these are probably one of the tanks that I endorse the most i love the wide bore mouthpiece I like the ability to adjust especially for connoisseurs they have a nice ceramic heater with decent size inlet holes so you get nice big hits but you're not gonna lose out on that flavor I think the center post sloping on these were done right they're very stable I haven't heard any complaints of these things leaking this is the same thing half mil except it has a hookah style tip on it it's kind of like the top of a bowling pin it's like half flattened half widened tip and this is the glass version of the cartridge we showed you with a lock top not a thread you push it down and it has also has a resin reservoir this is not glass I have not tested this tank yet but it is very similar to the the other ones that we went over in that facet so it should be a good one so anyways guys thank you for tuning in I hope some of the pro tips and some of the analysis tools that we've given you are gonna help you make better decisions when you're out there looking for your prefilled cartridge to buy at a dispensary or looking to fill your own now one question I know is gonna be a follow-up is which one of your batteries basically fire everything so let me just come out and tell you our be master battery you buy one of those you're gonna fire 99% of what's out there the way that we designed it check out the separate video we did on that our minimax original with the smart chip the electronics and this thing it is I basically want you to find me a tank that this thing doesn't fire and I want to know it exists because so far I haven't heard one really nice powerful check out the separate video on that also our Gold Line battery these two batteries are variable temperature they're a little different in size and capacity however both really awesome should fire anything that you give it both these tanks three temperatures both have preheat functions easily charge work awesome with all these tanks minimax your definite go to so you buy one of these three batteries you can rest assured that basically whatever you pick up at the dispensary you're gonna be all fired so for this and several other cool videos make sure you subscribe to our channel make sure if I miss

video stay tuned stay lifted and I'll see you next time", "U1RWoqpFZ4s": "hey guys it's Deb connection we're taking a look at the vessel base and it is a base charger basically its instead of being the standard one that they normally have like this it has this base and kind of like on phones and stuff remember back in the day they had those cell phones that would like to become a computer and you can throw it on the base what I really like about it is first off its USB see I always and out to get another quality USBC cable if you have a crappy USBC cable you can know how frustrating those can be so it's nice it's USB see I've been waiting for USB see charger to come out it's not direct to USB see but it still goes in there and it charges fast I'm not really unsure if it charges faster than the other one there other charger is fast anyway it is fast but this is just easy it's nice it looks nice it also sits the cartridge up top up and down so you got a cartridge that's kind of low it's going to get oil to the bottom and be effective it's actually similar like the cart buddy or the card streamer lat if you've seen our videos on those they're just things that hold the cartridges up and down you know and this just holds your cartridge up and down with your battery in it and it's ready to go and basically that's using that same interface down inside there that charges for the vessel buts convenience got the USB see you know so if you got a any other USB see device to it'll plug into this and double this for your phone or whatever you might else might have with the suc so vessel base not sure on the pricing yet but this is just yeah it's really nice product and vessel batteries they're expensive yes and some people say oh it's too expensive but the quality in the airflow especially on seeso carts is excellent you really hit get a great hit out of it so this is a m60 select elite uses this and a lot of other popular brands and then the other one is a glass tip which is th2 so I think that the vessel actually hits better then see cells on batteries on sea sell stuff the next best ones for sea sell cards would the palm and the silo but the vest won't actually outdoes them just because the airflow so smooth it has a really nice smoothness to the hit - I've had some of the cards batteries it hit super hard this one it's super smooth so overall this review is more at the base you can check out our vessel battery view but like the base very convenient very easy and well know exactly what the cost is coming out soon but I couldn't imagine be that expensive and I think it's gonna be end up being good value just because it's just really nice you know it's a nice feel it's a premium product so everything really goes nicely with the vessels here and like how it doesn't really it's not gonna fall over easily with someone really knocks it alright thanks for watching this day of connection and have a great week", "Wol5nGBpSnY": "this rolled up into bloom early in the certified pot smoking on one of my daytime Bloods I got super flaky they put it all spin move baby look at a battery pack for broken so now further ado please tell me close up hi Burke

and get on out of here all right then till next from my friends key bro", "sBX0q_GZnz4": "okay I'm going to show you a little vape pack this is the I taste MVP three vape machine which I've hacked I it's got a decent sized battery in this thing it's also got the battery bank charging point for your Samsung or microUSB you've also got a USB charging point there as well charged by USB a little control panel there so you can see your controls and normally you'd have your fate boil in there and you'd be puffing away on it but I've changed it for a soldering iron tip and intend to use it for soldering so now when I press the button press and hold I should say you can see on the controls I've got it currently set to 10 watts that's another useful thing about this it's a soldiering iron that you can adjust the wattage level that will already have got hot so let's have a look at that there you go so if you needed hotter are you very outside or you're soldering heavy-duty cables you could increase the wattage no doubt you'll burn out the the soldering iron tip eventually but using it on about 10 watts you should be absolutely fine and I'll just give it a bit of a tinning here for our American friends I'm soldering but I've noticed there's an L in the word solder so I tend to say soldering well there you go little soldering iron heck very neat", "VRdDjiYRlZA": "what's good you guys and welcome back to another video uh basically today my new battery got here it's a silo battery c cells i ordered it like two days ago and it just got here so i'm pretty excited to try it out i actually just took it right out the package um i haven't looked at it yet but i'm about to slide it open and as you guys can see i did get the blue one but yeah i actually got this for 30 bucks i was wondering what that was i think that's the charger or the little magnetic little magnetic things you know but yeah basically this is it [Music] honestly in my opinion it looks pretty nice it looks pretty cool um it looks it looks good you know it's it's actually really small it's perfect to keep in your pocket and i heard that it's also touchless so you won't have to have you won't actually have to press a button in order to hit it all you got to do is inhale and the smoke will come out but yeah basically i'm gonna be using this raw garden cart i have it's already like halfway through the flavor is bahama mama number three i think um but yeah i'm gonna be trying it out first let me get the charger out and the little magnetic things that it needs okay so this is the charger charger right there and these are the little magnetic themes this is basically the c-cell silo battery um it looks pretty cool i'm pretty curious to try it out i've heard a lot of good reviews about it so you know let's just get right to adding the card on it so i guess you're just gonna stick it right here you're ready to go so i'm gonna hope it's charged i'm not sure but yeah cheers make sure you guys are smoking on something too on whatever you guys got let me know if you guys are smoking on raw gardens too if you guys are let me know what flavor but yeah cheers [Music] so it's really smooth i'm not gonna lie now it's actually kind of a fat hit but it wasn't a blinker though i'm gonna try to take a blinker for you guys the light is actually right there i don't know you guys are gonna be able to see that but i'm gonna show it to you guys as quick as i can so you guys can see but yeah cheers okay so first off i'm loving how it hits i love how it hits actually my opinion it hits way better than this one [Music] this one actually hits a lot harder like stronger i feel like this is good for uh thick kind of oils you know but i feel like for the less thicker ones this battery will probably be perfect it doesn't feel like you know it's going to break right away it's actually kind of a little bit heavy it has a it has a little bit of weight to it um and yeah other than that charger port is right there i'm gonna just take you know like my last two hits this battery and i'm gonna end the video right here so if you guys end up buying this battery let me know what you guys thought about it too and let me know what color you guys end up getting i was actually going to get the black one the all black because it looked pretty cool but it was out of stock they only had this one and i believe the white one but i just went with this dark new one you know it's all right but yeah i was saying [Music] cheers [Music] all right guys thank you guys for watching like i said if you guys end

"HNdH2iYg6Jc": "[Music] hello friends welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find fine fine fine fine fine folks make sense of your dispensary and guys we're about to enter a new era here on weeds a pax era because we're talking about the pax era today that's right guys we are talking finally reviewing the pax era system this is actually the second time I have reviewed the pax era system that's a little insider knowledge I lost it the first time in the middle of the review so coming back around to it a little a little bit later um okay so we're talking pax era again today the third of the sort of very popular pod line of vaporizers I think that's what we're gonna call them is the pod vaporizers you've got the most popular steezy and you also have plug and play in this space and then I'd say probably the second biggest is gonna be your pax era behind it steezy so this is made by pax who started off as a herb vaporizer I herb vaporizer company I own a pax one and two and I love them quite a bit and they have now gotten into the portable vape game they have they're sort of different than steezy and plug and play in that they partner with different farms and different companies to make pods for them they make some themselves but you'll see pods from like select or you know a bunch of different companies making packs era pods I assume packs gets some kind of cut today we are going to be looking at specifically the island mango haze from pax I believe this is a paksas own brand or one of their own brands I believe yes yes this is from PAX themselves they come in a very interesting so little package here you've got this shelf tag and then a little plastic thing that I guess has the pot in there very handsome packaging a little bit you know there's a it's not too wasteful but it's very colorful very vibrant I like that and then it says up to three times the vapor of compared to the original packs pods cool so this is one high-intensity cannabis vapor and then on the back we have got our lab and batch testing and all that neato stuff this comes in at seventy seven point five two percent THC which is medium high for cartridges or in pods out there without any further ado let's go ahead and open up our little box here I have already opened this and went ahead and charged it I've made that mistake in the past so here it is the charged packs here is our box comes in a little sleeve and then right in here is the pax era that says insert era pod and underneath we've got you know your register your safety information nobody ever reads another microUSB cable a sticker I like stickers and photobombing at a desk and then this thing imploring you to download the new pax era app on your phone which is pretty cool pax has an app I think that syncs through bluetooth I'm not sure it's downloading right now and I'll be sure to get in this in the second half the review in which you can actually change the temperature and intensity of the hits that you get which is really neat when you with just easy and plug-and-play it's one setting and that's it so this allows you to sort of mess around with different settings which is pretty similar to the PAX dry vaporizers themselves I believe this is what is the size of the battery I'm here I think it is also a 500 milliamp hour battery the same size as steezy it doesn't say for sure I will try to find out and let you know that as well um okay so let's go ahead and take off our stickers both of these have these little the packs itself and then the little pot has these private or piracy stickers on them I'm sure they don't work but you know I definitely purchased this from a legal dispensary and that's a good time to go ahead and talk about the price um I got this from the website the weed website is calm the pax era actually came free or it cost a dollar with the purchase of a pod which is pretty good the pax era itself I believe is a little bit more expensive than both the steezy and plug and play it usually retails for about 30 bucks but there is that little added extra tech in there that the others don't have and then the pods themselves do seem to be a little bit more expensive than steezy but less expensive than plug-and-play I think they only have half grams this one was 42 I believe so runs a little bit more expensive than steezy but not outrageously so I am having trouble figuring out how to open this maybe not through any fault of their own but only because I am a doofus I don't see where it's telling me what to do to open it and I feel like I'm just gonna break it if I do that okay I can figure this out you know I'm a real boy oh they're a ghost it was just pulling open got a pull pretty hard to get that thing open and here we go here is our packs pod it says Island Mingo right on it there if that'll focus okay wow it is I assume a lot of the oil is hidden under that mouthpiece but it looks like not a lot of oil in there doesn't look like half a gram to me but I'm sure somewhat quite a bit of is obscured by the packaging so let's go ahead and insert our pod I think it either way works and it was supposed to give me a buzz it says I didn't feel it but let's try it oh my god wow that is tasty as a ax [ __ ] holy [ __ ] my god um Island mango what a perfect name for it this tastes like you know a Caribbean vacation and your fourth to fruity drink you know with its massive piece of fruit that you take out and never actually eat this is what that tastes like Wow okay yeah that is that is excellent tasting oh my god um easily one of the best tasting cartridges I've ever had if you like them sweet if you like them fruity uh-huh wow that is absolutely incredible absolutely love it and then the oil itself that hits themselves great man they hit super super hard I think it hits a little bit harder than it's easy you get bigger drawers then steezy and the as I said the taste is amazing and its really potent it it feels may be stronger than that seventy seven percent that they're advertising which you know fine with me I'm sure that's what it is but it feels quite strong I'm really really pleased with the potency here young Wow I I mean I like the taste of different strains in weed and I there's some that I really enjoy but this is one of the few that I I mean even if it didn't get any high it's just it tastes so good it's really quite something um okay so this first part of this packs Arivu really great we'll take a quick review here so this again the packs itself is about 30 bucks at different places and the pods are a little bit more expensive than steezy certainly more expensive than your normal 510 cartridges on average but you are paying for that sort of pod premium experience now one thing I have noticed just holding this negatively is that I am a little oh you can push down on it guys that is a tip that I'm gonna give you right now it'll work just fine like this but you can feel it and it will just come right out be sure to put that extra little pressure and insert it all the way in you'll feel it kind of not really click but sort of slide in and now it's quite stable so be sure to do that it's not like steezy where it just sort of magnetically clicks into place um first impressions super positive love the taste love the potency really like this system on but we have some stuff to get into here we'll talk more about the little problems that might arise like the cartridges being easy to fall out I'll dive into that app and let you know how cool that is being able to change all that [ __ ] I mean I'll let you know Oh does this pod really seem like half a gram does it seem like you know you should pay this sort of slight premium over cz well all those questions are going to be answered I'm going to be using this system until I have this half grand pod depleted probably take me to two and a half three days to get through and as soon as I do I will come back here give you all the notes on the battery life give you all the notes on the whole system let you know about that app experience but for right now if this is all you're ever gonna see I'm really really pleased with the packs era pod it seems to you know make a case for itself in the already crowded pod market place so that's gonna do it for this first half I am really looking forward to working on this and I will see you guys right back here as soon as I finish thanks for watching [Music] well friends I am back and it has been three days since I started on my pax era journey enjoying this island mango strain there and it has been a beautiful wonderful incredible journey oh my god um so there is my empty little pod right there first and foremost this thing is deceptively large it kept delivering over and over and over and over again it it lasted a lot longer than a traditional half gram for me it's probably the way it was metered out its maybe the drawers are smaller than I thought but it wasn't like I felt like I was lacking on a decent good high these past three and a half days not at all this is this is really strong stuff and I hit it just as much as I hit anything else I just kept noticing like the the pot itself wasn't depleting wasn't depleting and even when it those levels started to lower it sort of kept going down at a slower pace than I imagined which to me is great I was not expecting it to provide as much oil seemingly as it did again there's probably a half gram in there it just seems to be the way that it distributes it and that delicious delicious oil that it distributes as well again one of the finest tasting oils I've ever had super super tasty um another thing I want to bring up is actually how cool the app is the app is actually pretty neat I don't think you ever really need to mess with it if you don't want to but there you can as I told you before you can adjust the temperature you can adjust how long you want your drawers to be like it'll auto shut off after a certain length of time that you've determined and it also has games that are one it's crazy that they're there and two I don't think I'm ever going to play them because they're dumb but you know it's cool they're they're really this is worth the premium of the the pot itself I'd say you know runs about five dollars on average more than a cc half grand pot or $10 more on average than a normal 510 half gram cart but it is a really great experience if if you're not on a tight budget and you're looking for one of the best vape experiences out there the PAX era is not going to disappoint it certainly didn't with me I'm glad I didn't lose it this time because I anticipate using it over and over again in the future oh one thing that did remind me again be sure to really push that in there I know at one point during this past couple of days I passed it to somebody who's wanted to take a quick dragon he wasn't paying attention sort of flipped it up and the things shot off into the air so a slight design flaw just make sure you really put that pod in there so it doesn't you know you don't lose your precious oil like I almost did awesome great great great great stuff totally love the packs and the packs era system if you're looking for something to do you can totally give those games a try if you're bored of every switch game and iOS game available you know you've got your pax era to dip back into cool alright guys but before I bounce I want to share with you a little cherry on top I liked this pax era so much I'll share with you guys a little something extra just because I'm feeling real generous uh and I'm sure a lot of you have already heard of it because it seems to be doing pretty well man the boys on Amazon the new Amazon Prime series about a group of guys who are trying to take down a very grounded sort of superhero world where there are superheroes that are sort of like corporate mascots that also have superpowers and are also terrible people and there's this rogue group that wants to teach them a lesson it's extremely violent extremely funny and it is written at least the original graphic novel by one of the best in the business Garth Ennis also the writer of the incredible preacher that's a cherry on top for another day if you like ultra violence if you like your super hero e stuff really give the boys a shot I am super pleased with it it came out better than I could have possibly hoped just like this pax era and that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this pax era and mango island pod review extravaganza thank you so much for watching guys I really look forward to seeing her right back here on her next review la vie tha's Ain", "bFkZyoat2RM": "so why do we like pin batteries so much I think it's because these of use well today we get to know a new pin style battery with a little twist her the XS twister IX this vape see what I did there [Music] this 350 mAh battery has great battery power output which means that stronger hits with every draw I noticed instant response the moment I push the button to get my draw even at low voltage to get started let's charge it up the twister comes with an attachable 510 threaded USB attachment for the pin itself when it's charging Dalia D light will charge and hold red and then transition to green when it's fully charged after you screw in your oil cartridge click the power button five times to turn it on repeating this process will also shut it off when you're done to activate the twister you must press and hold the power button down in order to get your draw to get a proper draw you wouldn't hit it all the way to a blinker how would pulse the power button instead hold the power button for about three seconds then release it for two seconds continue to inhale during this process and then press the power button again for another three seconds to get your draw if you want to get a large draw then go again for a third time but this time hold it for about five to eight seconds before letting go this is the best way to get heavy vapor production but I've always been a fan of sessional to get my draw sesh motors also known as a preheat function press the power button two times for 15 seconds of uninterrupted no button press heating this feature actually heats up your oils gradually allowing your oils to break down and bake in a timely process once you get your draw press the power button once to end session mode early or wait the full 15 seconds for session mode to end on its own this is also a great function to use when sharing with friends or breaking down hard and distillate that's been sitting for a longer periods of time one thing I really love about this pin though is the voltage range going all the way from 2 volts and 4 volts and plus everything in between it's a great way to know where you are on the voltage scale easy to pick up for beginners and a good spectrum for advanced users just twist the wheel at the bottom of the device all on all the twister is a great device to keep in your collection it's smaller than most pin style batteries and it doesn't take up too much space it comes in a variety of colors for anyone who's looking at that little personal touch if you want to step away from magnetic cartridge adapters then this is the pin for you it's definitely my go-to pin for the fall the all-new XS twister by the always reliable X's vape we hope you found this video helpful what vapes are you excited for for the final quarter this year if you

to three parts here we take a look at this alright you open up the bottom here this is the adapter for this specific tank the specific wax tank okay so by default this is designed or wax although we can use as eternity for your swimming tank or your GC cartridges all right open this up this is your dual coil quartz glass wax atomizer here along with the mouthpiece okay that's all this is just a mouthpiece goes on to the top now this goes on to the bottom magnetic piece remember without the magnetic pieces just your tank won't work so this here could be this bottom connector the best compared connectors small connectors designed for 1 gram taller connectors designed for half-grams tanks okay I'm gonna open up a 1 gram slim tank this is the plastic body here alright now we plug this into the smaller cartridge this is a 1 gram let's show you how it looks on the kit here on the mod drops right in there you go that's a 1 gram with the small base small base connection now remember without the connector the tank won't stay like this is coming right out that way you guys know now here's the one ground with the tall base [Music] notice how it sticks out a little bit more you can still use it but I prefer you use this with the half a gram cartridge okay now let's take a look inside the mod here it's a basic on and on and changing temperatures okay there's a magnetic handle here pretty strong nice and sturdy pull that open you can see here gives you four different temperature settings turn it on in the v button on one two three four five it's gonna blink that's how you know it's off or one two three four five that's how you know it's awesome okay depress it there's some light there's a light up here there's a light down here letting you know what color indication of temperature you have a setting off okay so you don't always have to open up the handle to get a reading so the press appearance green you know it's gonna be hit at three times at that tempo one two three you can see it cycles through three preset color temperature settings okay it goes through three point four to three point six to three point eight to four point zero however I do always want to make a disclaimer here that anything above three point eight is semi dangerous to your oil tanks okay that is going to be dangerous with that so just always keep that in mind micro USB charger is right here so you have to remove the door to charge it as well okay that's pretty much it I hope this helped you guys out if you guys have any questions in the comments below if you guys love this device leave a comment as well and if you guys hate this device please also let us know what you paid about it as well okay so next time you guys have a great day", "E1vjUPha7gE": "hey guys his dad connection and we're reviewing another arrow pro cartridge Sumatran sunrise now this is sativa comes in the 80s and it's great it tastes great tastes kinda like a tequila sunrise it's very similar flavor to that but with with no alcohol tastes like it's just the sweet part of it and the effects are good you know it's an energetic sativa there is no energy loss with this pretty much gives you a good amount energy when you hit it and you know uses all the same arrow Pro hardware arrow Pro some people don't know is actually made by C self you can tell the similarity when you look at it it's just a different bottom but it's a Cecil hardware and overall yeah I give this cartridge two thumbs up and be honest with you have never had a better Oppo characters all the arrow Pro cartridges have been excellent so far and this one particularly is from Nevada essence Tropicana West is where I got this one and I'll take a hit of it so you guys see what looks like yep it's good the AeroPro battery another tip on the arrow pro battery you know I've heard people complain oh there's $35 for this battery but what you can do to get a cheaper is a lot of dispensaries carry it without the case and if you get it without the count the case is only 15 bucks so if you didn't get an error for a battery say hey you guys got the one without the case and then it's only 15 bucks so two thumbs up for pro great effects great taste great hardware and good quality oil great quality oil so two thumbs up thanks for watching guys there's dabbe connection and have a great week", "00Qmvae7gLk": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the cannabis sommelier i'm your host andrew friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of product reviews today we've got a cool new 510 thread vape battery and it's from my favorite team my favorite vape battery the mont blanc of vape batteries it's the vessel this one is the vista the vista is a new one to their lineup which is super cool so now they have three models and the vista i believe in now being a more price effective version of their original and there's some key differences too which is really cool so we should pop this open and start talking about it but the first thing about the vista is really light package beautiful package love the shrink wrap i got this olive green color bad ass it fits most 510 thread carts performance air intake that's the big part the airflow of these vape batteries is incredible they make your carts taste better they make your carts last longer your smart battery always doing a variable draw and your variable pull on how hard you're pulling because we don't all pull the same soft rip it real hard some do it light and so your smart battery is really gauging that draw and making the most of your cart so you're never cooking it you're also preserving the most battery which is incredible i am such a big fan of these batteries they last so long they look so sharp there's three power settings in this one this one's got a badass 320 milliamp battery compared to the original expeditions that was a 240 milliamp battery and i often finish a whole cart with this battery so this one having 80 more milliamps of being 320 milliamps means i'm just going to crush carts and not have to charge it but we'll talk about the charger in a bit because i do love the charger in this one so we got our tight shrink on there bust into this there's a nice six month warranty with this it is designed in california anything else from the moment you pick up your vessel you'll obsess over its signature design and character we're in the business of making every experience more intuitive and personal delivering the best design and performance in our line of products the collection is an honest demonstration of your relentless attention to detail and craftsmanship badass welcome to vessel and this one's very sharp i love the color of that isn't that handsome very good looking battery love this one gonna be a great addition to my arsenal of vessels so let's bust into it the packaging is a little different oh that pops off okay that's you know that's we don't need this this is the dummy cart wow the battery is really nice and it feels great i actually thought it was going to be plastic for some reason but it is it's metal and it is very sharp very light very cool see what else we have in our package oops the proprietary charger these are great snaps right on with magnet super easy super efficient charges nice and fast it is proprietary though so don't lose it i would massively suggest getting one of these desk chargers the desk charger is just awesome it sits in there just like that it looks badass it's a great presentation piece for a really cool accessory and then your battery is always charged and ready to go so check out if you are thinking about getting one of these i would just 100 add in the charging stand right away because i love the charging stand a really really cool accessory to a really cool accessory so the button is a little bit smaller but it does protrude and it has a nice click to it where you can really feel if you activated it so let's turn it on one two three four five boom we have it on easy always comes with some power which is great it's fully charged out of here i'm gonna put it on medium and we'll do a an exact contrast to the other one you just press it three times to change it one two three and now i'm on green super easy it's just like any vape pen five clicks on three to change your power you have three different power settings so i'm going to take a pull out of the original one quick just so you can see five seconds great airflow again airflow is what's most important and comparing these two vista just a little bit bigger [Music] a little bit different shape airflow looks about the same this one might have a little bit skinnier longer let's pop this in and now you can see also your amount of oil you have in there one thing i did like about this was that i couldn't see that it was a cart but it looks really slick with that green top on it and let's give this a puff for five seconds the vista actually i would say it tastes better and pulled better i think the airflow felt lighter to me it felt like it was whistling more and i really liked the vista i didn't think i was gonna have a difference of opinion [Music] but the vista is killer nice big puffs easy to use button very reactive this is a tighter draw with a bit of a thicker cloud where this is a bit of a looser draw but the cloud feels just as thick nope less thick bit more airflow bit less thick of a cloud it's lighter it's got 80 more milliamps the flow is great the color is great the sheen is great i love vessel um the only thing that would make these better for me is if they connected to my phone i could dial in cart specifically i could change these to a extremely specific temperature um the only thing that would make all of these vessel products better is just if i could hook them up to my phone uh past that you know in my opinion best battery on the market and if you smoke carts you should go get one i appreciate you watching please make sure to like

have used that it has a battery capacity of 500 milliamps instead of being a square like the old palm it's more of a rectangle shape so and it comes in black blue and gray and pink which I do not have pictured here it has a quality circuit board with multi-part ection a micro USB charging port aluminum alloy housing the unit is in hell activated and it has the magnetic connector with a built-in 510 thread which is basically what all cartridges are using now so it let's see it comes with the normal stuff the palm came with which is a warranty card to metal magnetic adapters a charging cable and of course the battery and I'll pull one out here the black one is kind of hard to see so I'll set that aside and that's the box and everything I'm just pretty simple box shows you that shows you what comes in it of course and then just slide it out blue one of course if the charging port on the bottom the microUSB there you can use any of your phone charge or anything like that you have a little viewing window for the cartridge here I'll put a 1 ml cartridge in there or full gram cartridge to show you so you can see and then there is the 0.5 right here that's the 0.5 ml so it's a little bit smaller with that there's another style the same point 5 ml or 1/2 gram cartridge just so you can see that is right there and then and then another style of a full gram or 1 ml cartridge which is right there with the straw tip there there's that viewing window and then so it's it's all about it's just different size basically it's a rectangle instead of a square this is the Cecil palm and of course this is the new Cecil silo you know both charging ports on the bottom like that and let's see the indicator light is up here I'll see if I can show you I might be a little bit difficult but let's see I don't know if you can see that but that's pretty you know discrete and then of course you screw these little magnetic adapters on before you put the cartridge in the unit so it's magnetized in it goes in there and stays in there you know stays put pretty tight just tap it in there you know it's not going anywhere so and then with it comes in the box here comes your charging cable micro USB to USB and then your two magnetic adapters with our adapters for 510 cartridge and your warranty card and instructions which I'm not going to take out because you know pretty much know what that is so I think that's about it I'll show you the different colors real quick so you got the blue there and then you got the black here this is the black and then we've got the GREs right here there's also a pink but I do not have that in stock right now but I will shortly and that is the gray and that's pretty much it thank you for watching and if you have any questions please ask the

gonna talk about the cush box this is a little portable battery very little that I think you guys will like so stick around and we're going to talk about it okay guys so the cush box is a variable voltage bait cartridge battery I really like it it's very small very small you guys know that the exits snap has always been my favorite well this one is much smaller even and not much bigger around as you can see so another thing I really like about it is it screws in it is not magnetic magnetic is that's convenient but this prevents it from wobbling around and from you breaking the post I have broken two cartridges I believe now because they bent or they moved around and it it caused the little post in the center to come detached or something I don't know but I've had to break and I think that's why this is a low medium and high let's see it's two point eight three point four and three point eight volts five taps to turn it on it's already on so five taps to turn it off it comes with a USB micro cable you tap it twice if you want to preheat it if your battery you know if your concentrates cold it has the viewing window that I love it's a really nice and it supports the cartridge so if you drop it it's not going to destroy it here is where you're going to plug it in and charge it and then here is the button after you push the button there is a light see those three lights that come on there that's your battery indicator that's a full charge and then it'll go down to two lights and then it'll go down to one night that is something that none of my other batteries do and I really like that for this battery this one is very very small I mean you can't see it at all I think it would be more suited with a half gram cartridge I think I made by a half gram cartridge just for this battery I'm all about small and convenient and discreet and all that and this came in different colors it also came with a with a lanyard if you wanted to you know if you were out you know on a hike or someplace where it was recreationally legal recreational ain't legal you know you can hook this to it and you wear it around your neck or you know if you were I don't know any situation you can use that they came I believe in four different colors and I really liked it so let me show you how it works now um you're gonna hit the button and that's on the low that was the low setting and that was very smooth 1937 Candyland cartridge I'm so tasty love it love it love it I bought this excuse me guys guys I got this battery excuse me all right guys have made me coffee a little bit um I got this battery at vapor maven like I said I think it came in four different colors I paid nineteen ninety five plus tax so probably like twenty two dollars for it just had it a couple of days it feels durable it feels like leather on the outside structurally it feels like a fairly decent little battery and I'm going to keep using it as of right now it's the smallest battery I have and my favorite just because of color and it's got the indicator light for the battery what I mean what else do you need it's very small it's very simple and it's cute all a girl that can ask for so yeah if

I feel differently honestly Auto draws no button that you see as the Jupiter and a variable voltage with a button I am preheat so I'm I got it I got an optimize the features this is going to be technically some type of music video there's music in the background ok finally smoking yeah so I'm finna it user feature I'll preheat this one does hit hotter for maximal taste and you know family my favorite I'll put this around 3 3 they went through bullet I think this base is 3.7 so I will I'll compare the blinker just so y'all know honestly they say that yo can't go 15 but this one might still be 10 I know but these ones oh my god they're 15 seconds ladies I mean I enjoyed [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] the target behind any Jack do what you want to do I just wanna put banana get back be a dumpy all that you see nope again go on my door I see this little [ __ ] even with the 3d maze in this my preferred temperature for flavor which was 3.3 volts this one without a pretty deep got it free was made a bear claw [Music] my target behind em najaf do what you wanna do I wanna lose my ending in it alright if my advice if you were to only get one gotta get this one preheat adjust the tempo I put this at 4 volts they will hit harder than this one you have more option with this some battery with their bottom thing I have an error hole cannot auto draw you're gonna need a button this is more color universally compatible I think this this is ethically more can be acting a holds a bigger charge it hits harder faster no preheating nothing I think this within being

them that lasts about a week they're made out of anodized aluminum housing so they're pretty sturdy they have an LED indicator on top which lights up when you charge and when you use it let's see I'll show you the box and what's inside it so on the box you can see that it says there's the palm battery inside the microUSB charging cable to metal thread adapters and those will fit 510 threads this does recommend ac cell type battery I have used it with others but I'll definitely make sure it works before if you're afraid to not on the back it says it's Anil activated stealthy breathing LED indicator quality circuit board with multiple protection the battery size again and the Magnetic threads included and like I said they recommend the C cell cartridges for the best performance so it comes in gray blue and pink and as the microUSB once again I stay up pretty good oh yeah and the size is about the size of a chapstick would say a little bit shorter and a little bit skinnier where the battery is so they'll fit in a small pocket definitely fit in a palm of your hand which hence the name so let's see I'll show you what's inside the box here so you open it up and you've got the battery and then you've got this little cover with an instruction on the back it says to put the cartridge and thread adapter and then you put it in the battery and it seems simply stays down with the magnet of course it's in hell activated so you don't have to press the button you just inhale and it will provide vapor so in here you have the two thread adapter x' right here you're the micro USB cord and a battery itself also I believe there is a warranty card underneath and I think it's 180 days but I'm not positive on that so here's the battery that's where you'll put the thread adapter so here is a C cell this is a C sell em for 7-7 you take the thread adapter which I already had one out and you throw it on there like so pretty simple you guys can see that just threads on and off so you throw it on there and then you just simply place it in there and it'll be held by the magnet and then just to get it out you just pull it and then it will simply come out and there and it stays in nice and tight and then it's pretty discreet you can just put it in your palm if you don't want anybody to really notice and let's see if I can show you that LED indicator so I don't know if you could see that and it produces pretty heavy vapor as well and you know it's not too heavy or anything like that so and then I'll just show you that it works with the other types of cartridges as well here's the hop gram one that one was a gram one simply place it in there see if you can see though what led so it's pretty good it's very good actually and that's the blue right there what else it does have a ten-second time out when you're inhaling which is about normal most have like about a seven so it will start producing vapor at ten seconds but then you just stop and you can keep hitting it again if you still need to and I believe that's it if this was helpful like and the purchase link is in the description below if you'd like to buy one thank you have a good day", "6MFXU81HUzg": "[Music] hey it's matt at roughhouse studios and welcome to the product spotlight for the day pipe from appleton devices episode is sponsored by hamilton devices you can find their really cool pipes and vaporizers and much more at hamiltondevices.com now let's take a look at what comes in the box one thing i really like that box it's sort of like a torpedo looking for a missile silo or something box the way it splits up so that's really cool it comes with the day pipe you get a custom cleaning brush a owner's manual and a warranty card definitely one of the most interesting looking devices that i've gotten the chance to review so really looking forward to checking this out now let's take a closer look at the day pipe the daypop it's made out of anodized aluminum the devices itself and it's a weed smoking pipe and you see when you twist it it opens up the chamber that's inside of there the cool thing about it though is that there's eight chambers inside of that and we'll get to that in just a second so we can screw off the cap on the end here and this will let us be able to pull the device apart and see the guts and see what's on the inside of it so once the caps off you can push the inside through and then that reveals the smoking chamber and then the mechanism inside and you can see the chamber is at the bottom there and it's it's got eight different compartments in it so you pack all of those and then you can smoke them one at a time there's one single screen that's a a cylinder shaped screen that slides down inside of the chamber there i really love this and unique design that's out of the box of anything like i've seen before so i really think that's awesome and uh so there we're going to slide it back together and you can see that the there's one hole in it that'll line up to the different uh chambers that are beneath there and you rotate it to get to four of them and then you push it forward or backwards to get to the other four as you can see it slides forward it slides up like that and reveals the upper or lower set of chambers and then you rotate it to close it if you don't want any ashes to fall out in your pocket really neat i really love this design can't wait to try it out [Music] so this is not an electronic device so there's really not that many features and functions so we're going to the features and functions are basically going to be packing it and i found it easier you could pack one at a time by sliding it open and packing it that way but i found the best way is just to pull it apart and then you can easily pack it off eight chambers in no time and i found it was best just to pack it pretty tight into each one so that it stayed put as you turn it and uh pack it all the way around nice and tight like that it's got a 0.2 grams capacity on each of the chambers so with eight of those it's a total of 1.6 grams nice hefty load of cannabis in there so with eight chambers like that that's one per hour for a full eight hour shift or something like that so i think that's really neat and then you can cycle through each of the chambers as you're ready to smoke them [Music] and when it comes to actually smoking the day pipe you just use a lighter and then you just access your chamber and then you hit it light and hit just like a regular pipe except you get to do it eight different times uh the hit's real nice it doesn't get hot at all although it's a metal device it's got a real nice amount of air inside there it doesn't get hot around your hands and it's a metal mouthpiece that's available in graphite as seen here but also in red i found that the ability to be able to stick it in your pocket between the bowls was a real big plus and once the your device is already smoked it's not very hard either to empty the chambers you can empty the chambers one at a time as you smoke them if you want uh the little cleaning brush that comes with it makes it a lot easier to get the ashes out of the chamber but you could also smoke all eight of them and then just pull it apart and dump the ashes by dumping the screen and cleaning the screen all at one time so however way you decide to smoke with it it really works excellent [Music] so let's look at the highlights the features are that it's available in red and we have the graphite version here but there's also a red version uh it's got 8.2 gram bowls so that's 1.6 gram nice capacity excellent portability it's made of top quality materials and it's excellent construction it feels really good and it works well the performance is top-notch it's easy to pack it's easy to clean and at under 50 i think it's a really good deal for a unique and innovative pipe if you'd like to learn more about hamilton devices the daypipe or some of their other products be

good supply this is a THC heavy vape cartridge coming in at seven hundred sixty four point one milligrams of THC less than five percent milligrams CBD today about seventy six percent THC in less than a percent CBD so as I said heavy-hitting hybrid THC cartridge coming at you from good supply I'm very excited to try this out pineapple Express is one of my favorite strains of all time probably one of yours too it's classic its legendary they make goddamn movie out of this thing one of my favorite movies probably one of your students hilarious I was very excited to see this in my own cannabis shop even more excited when I found out this thing's going for 40 bucks 40 bucks for a 0.5 gram 510 thread vape cartridge that's the best I've seen in the Canadian market personally so far so I snapped it up right away very excited to check you know he's gonna show you here on the side of the package I'll hold it up for the camera hopefully it doesn't bore but it does let me know what is let me let you know what it says it says our oil what's inside cannabis distillate plant-based terpenes no additives our product the cartridge premium ceramic or anti leaked technology direct airflow system you know I appreciate this kind of information being put on the package I like to know that it's plant-based terpenes not artificial I like to know that it's cannabis dislike to know what's in the cartoon you know more information is not a bad thing I would like to see some other companies follow suit on this good job good supply I like that so without further ado I'm gonna break the seal on this bad boy and figure out how to open it again you know it is some kind of heavy little feels thick cardboard packaging here feels a little wasteful but yeah it's a Canadian market let's open it looks like you pinch the sides and push yeah there we go so here comes the reveal for y'all and there we have it um it's nice-looking let's rescue it from this package yes some heavy thick heavy-duty cardboard packaging for a little item this has got to change um yeah this is a nice-looking cartridge let me hold it up for you all there oh it's got a nice metallic finish on it silver I see a THC logo there I know as it said pineapple Express on that green band and good supply I think at the bottom hopefully that's not blurry for you more importantly though I know it looks great check it out that oil is nice and clear it's a good color hopefully it's coming through clear for you because it looks clear and good that looks smokeable I'm excited that mouthpiece condom and rubber nub oh look we dropped it and yeah it's a nice looking cartridge let's get it on the old standard 510 battery here and the excitement grows as intensifies as we screw it on I'm really looking forward to this everybody I talk know it's tasty hmm yeah that's pretty good you know his little plug there but first John just came out of the package tastes really good kind of a citrusy sweet taste on the intake there and kind of held up on the way out mixed with a little bit of a herbalist herbally kind of taste there kind of herbal and citrusy sweet wouldn't necessarily say pineapple but let's check it out again yeah it's yummy man yep so sweet citrusy taste he definitely tastes that on when they first take a drink and then the exhale it definitely holds up and yeah it's kind of horrible I like it kind of tastes like smoking flower you know it's not too bad it's a good taste in the vape cartridge you know a little distracted here because I've noticed you know this is only 1/2 fault here it's kind of a big cartridge it's dawning on me here that this must be a 1 gram cartridge because it's a point 5 gram you know this lid in there they must be making one gram cartridges in the future that got me excited so yeah breaking news one gram cartridge is coming up looks like from a good supply but you know back to the flavor back to the taste this is pretty good to get a pretty good vapor I see it's not harsh pretty smooth yeah very good vapor production and yeah that's a good flavor I'm really good to enjoy vaping this over the next couple days and as always come back but you know what I think then all right so the final verdict on the old pineapple express some good supply here you know I've been vaping the hell out of this thing the last four days I've run a readout and tell you what I like he didn't like about it I liked a lot about it to be honest favorite thing about it was a taste flavor was great out of this world spine Apple Express baby from the first drag to the last flavor holds up never waned and never weak really good really strong you nailed a good supply you did a good job I can't always say that about all cartridges the flavor held up throughout the whole thing we really get and the flavor that was there really loved it I'm big fat it's pineapple Express it's great you're gonna love the taste the effects really nice effects you know it's a little milder than you might think at a 76 percent THC level so it's not a super heavy hitter you're not gonna get blitzed big stoned out of your mind but it's a good all day strain it's a great way can be extreme it's a sociable strain very conversational motivate you get through your day really happy up with the kind of feeling throughout your day that's a good strain you know what I mean I love it it's a good strain of having a pandemic you got to keep your chin up your spirits up there's a little tank of getting your spirits up that's for sure so you know I really enjoyed it's a little milder than some people might like but I thought it was great really good all day straight it's a hybrid strain I find it to be a lot more sativa meaning like I say it's all day long stream it's not going to let you know you're not gonna feel really tired it's not gonna burn you out really good strain three four hits on this thing lasts about an hour hour and a half before you kind of feel like you might want to have another pull fantastic good job good supply I really enjoyed it only downer to this thing oh you know another thing I really like is I like the look of this I mean look at that it's just nice right it's really shiny really metallic nice look I'm a sucker for a good look looks good but let's get into the only negative I have here well I got one small negative this little green band that you got down here kind of blocks how much oil you got left in the cartridge that's a bit of a bombing event it's alright it's not that big a deal the biggest deal that I have with this is it doesn't seem to last too long it's four days later in a mountain you know what I'm saying I mean like I noticed it moved around real easily in there it's kind of a thinner oil and a thinner oil is gonna vape alittle bit quicker so might want to take that into consideration with your value proposition with you know hey it's 40 bucks 4.5 grand cartridge but it doesn't seem to last that long I don't know personally I still recommend it it's alright I mean you know I was vaping it a lot you know not as much as I have other ones that have lasted longer but you know your mileage may vary out there as always but for what you get I recommend it I'd buy it again if I saw it in a store I'd buy it again I really liked it really impressed I enjoy the price enjoy the effects enjoy the taste I enjoy

kit the kit consists of an aspire CF 900 million battery and a spy okay on glass oh my sir USB charger and five replacement 1.6 BVC coils there was also supplied UK three pin wall plug the USB charger can be conveniently plugged into a computer USB port for charging which can be plugged into the supplied wall plug when charging your battery it is important to always ensure the connection points on both the charger and battery are cleaned regularly as condensation will accumulate here do this with a piece of kitchen roll or similar gently screw the battery onto the charger until the LED light on the charger turns to red do not over tighten the battery onto the charger when the battery is fully charged the LED on the USB will turn green this may take a couple of hours the spy okay one tank is from Pyrex glass mouthpiece simply pulls off and is interchangeable with most 510 size drip tips the bass section simply unscrews allow access to the coil and to fill the tank with a liquid you the 1.6 owned BVC coil will need to be replaced every 5 to 7 days when used frequently the flavor and performance will deteriorate over time and this is the best indication of when to change it simply unscrew the coil from the base and replace with a new aspire BBC coil you unscrew the base then eliquid needs to be filled to the top of the post to fill hold the tank at an angle and aim at the side with your bottle or pipette continue to fill until the e-liquid is near the top of the post you ensuring the coil is firmly attached the bass back onto the glass some Iser rotate the tank upright and you'll see some bubbles come from the coil the coil has a wicking material this needs to be fully saturated before first use with a brand new coil leave the newly filled tank to rest for at least 10 minutes to allow the e-liquid to soak into the coil you the battery is currently turned off press a button five times within two seconds to turn it on the button will flash pressing the button now will show that it is active press the button again five times within two seconds to turn it off the button will flash the button will no longer luminate when pressed you to attach the tank to the battery gently screw them together the aspire battery has a spring-loaded connection point allow the tank to sit flush with the battery never over tighten this spark a one kid ready to vape turn the battery on by pressing the button it is now working you'll hear it crackle till our time for the steam to be produced always press and hold the button for a second or so before ensuring you continue to hold the button throughout your puffs thank you for watching this quick start guide for the aspire k1 starter kit", "uDbxaFZJZJ4": "hi there this is a battery for cartridges this is how it's gonna come out of the box what is attached to is the charger so when you do insert this your lights can light up red when it's fully charged is going to blink a few times and then go dark so it doesn't mean it's not working it means it's ready to go take it out it simply untwist it so that fits right in there and you'll attach it to whatever your preferred cartridge is mine in this case is a jetty cartridge this is a green goblin sativa cannabis so in order to turn it on you're simply gonna pressure button five times mine was already on time you see I have a red blue light I'm gonna hold down my button and inhale I would personally warn don't hit it too hard get comfortable might say one of those you don't really feel it at first we will choke yourself pretty easily now if you do press the button three times it will change colors [Applause] I feel like it changes the power setting as well not 100% but as you see each time I rotate three times [Applause] and then when we're all done you can turn it off 1 2 3 4 5 let's you know it's off because when I press the button nothing happened [Applause] and it's ready to go back on its charger", "bNVUwKI1PFs": "[Music] hey is Madden roughhouse to do is welcome to my review of the Uni pro cartridge vaporizer from yoga I would like to thank yo Ken for setting up and sponsoring their review you can learn more about their vaporizer products yo Ken techcom [Music] now let's take a look at what comes inside the box with a yoke and a uni Pro you get the Uni Pro unit itself underneath the packaging you'll find a micro USB charging cable an instruction manual as well as the little magnetic connecting piece now you'll need to connect your 510 cartridge to the Uni [Music] [Applause] now let's take a closer look one of the things I really love is that little spiral like grip at the top so whatever size cartridge you put in there 5-10 size cartridge it'll grip down around it with a little spiral there then there's a window where you can see how much of your oil is left there's a little thing - a little hook on the side where you can put a string if you want to hang it off of something there's also at the bottom there's this little switch it's really cool where that allows you to adjust the depth of the connector inside so if you have a short or a really long cartridge you can use that to sort of compensate for the length of the cartridge there pretty interesting haven't seen that on a device like this the bottom is smooth it's got a really cool sort of boxy looking box mod design we've got a micro USB charger on the bottom of the front side the up and down arrows to control the voltage and OLED display and a power button now we're going to look at the features and functions powers on with five clicks when it comes on the OLED display will tell you the last voltage setting that it was set at use the arrows up and down to set the voltage the low end of the voltage is two volts it goes all the way up to 4.2 volts you have a battery indicator on the left side there and then one cool feature I found is that if you hold both buttons down it'll invert the display so if you're lefty or whatever so that's kind of neat if there's no atomizer it's a kind of intelligent circuitry so to let you know if there's a problem with your atomizer if you don't have one in there otherwise when you connect your 510 cartridge you will need the little magnetic clip or the little adapter that you have to use to sort of connect and then you can use the top there to circular little thing to squeeze down around your cartridge if you have a smaller cartridge to hold it into place if you want to use the preheating function you click it two times and it'll preheat for 10 seconds that's sort of a low heating before you hit it and kind of avoid the little popping and snapping after that it's ready to hit and you can just avoid the preheating if you want and just hit it straight away another thing I really like about this is that it has that adjustable width inside or an adjustable height so if you have like a really tall cartridge like this here you can adjust the end side dabs and also because of the top is also adjustable if you got a real fat cartridge it'll also fit and that brings us down to the usage and the testing this is the fun part where basically I just get to take big hits off of it enjoy it these are really simple to operate it was a really easy to use device I was using it with some rosin a premade cartridge that I filled myself with some homemade rosin ecig juice it was delicious and it performed perfectly and now for the pros and cons the pros are it's got that really cool looking retro boxy design I love that it's got the innovative cartridge adjustment where it goes up and down and then it'll squeeze thing at the top the variable voltage from 2 volts to 4.2 volts cool apple 650 milliamp battery and it's a really good deal at under $35 the cons are it's got that magnetic adapter that's required if you lose it you're kind of screwed I don't really care for those and it's a little bit of a lightweight plastic feel to it performs great though I've given at 4 stars it's an excellent entry-level cartridge vaporizer from Jochen again I would like to thank you Ken for setting up and sponsoring this review please visit yocan techcom to check out all of their vaporizer

the phone and these go for $20 here at mr. Weather Center they are always in stock and come at this great case and of course the battery plus charge", "_Zl3JFrkz2Q": "[Music] hi my name is Peter I'm with air vapor systems and we help businesses select source fill and ultimately find packaging for plant-based essential oil vaporizer pans so today we're gonna address a question that has been coming up for one of our new product lines what is C cell C cell very simply put is probably one of the most disruptive technologies to hit the vaporizer pen space in quite a while what C cell is is actually ceramic coil technology it is based around a ceramic coil that has been specially designed to absorb and vaporize plant-based essential oils at a high rate producing large clouds of vapor a lot of flavor and a really intensified user experience now how does C cell do this how does what makes C cells so special makes it so important and how exactly does it accomplish this kind of disruptive performance well C cell has a ceramic corn rather than a fabric wick based core what that means is that it's able to vaporize much higher viscosity essential oils without any problems and what it does is it pairs this coil with a high performance battery this is a high discharge lithium-ion battery that allows the coil to heat up quicker then most other coils do thus producing much bigger clouds of vapor upon exhale what this does is this provides two huge benefits for businesses who are looking to engage the C cell platform for their own use number one it provides a very standout user experience meaning that when you place your essential oils into a C cell your users are gonna notice they're gonna notice that the vapor clouds that they're producing are much bigger the hits they're taking is much bigger and to follow on the heels of that the second huge benefit for businesses looking to engage the C cell platform is the rate of consumption of the oil meaning that once you put your oil into a C cell cartridge it's gonna get consumed by the user at one point five to two times quicker than in a normal vaporizer pen this is because C cell has designed their entire pen for optimum performance I really like to compare C cell to a Ferrari and most other normal vaporizer pens to a Honda there's nothing wrong with a Honda I have a Honda love Honda but Honda is meant to be efficient and it's meant to be friendly to the normal everyday consumer but if you're looking for performance if you're looking for really high performance you're not gonna buy a Honda you're more than likely gonna buy a Ferrari right if you have the money for it Wow what makes a Ferrari special well a Ferrari is built from the ground up to be for for performance right everything from the tires to the suspension to the chassis to even the seat that the driver sits in is all made for performance that is what makes C self special everything on the C cell platform is designed for performance it basically allows you to vaporize your oils evenly without burning them while also pairing that with a high discharged battery that delivers more power thus allowing you to have larger hits so C cell from the ground up is designed for performance in a way that normal vaporizer pens cannot match so let's begin by taking a look at the entire C cell lineup before we drill down into the individual components of this lineup so that you as a user or as a brand are familiar with the C cell platform as you engage in it now it's worth noting that C cell likes to keep its lineup very sleek and minimalist there's only about five different C sell products however with a combination of different material finishes as well as branding options there's really a lot of ways that you can begin to express your brand through C cell now to start here on the cartridge side of things Cecil offers two different cartridges their first cartridge is called the th2 cartridge it is we refer to it internally as the c2 cartridge so when you call us and ask for this cartridge you can refer to it as either the th 2 or the C 2 cartridge however it is a glass cartridge with a ceramic tip onto it and this is really CISOs flagship cartridge when the user puts their lip on the their lips on the ceramic tip they instantly notice the quality and how this is a much heavier as well as better built cartridge than they may have be used to engaging with and what it does is it really makes any plant-based essential oil that's placed into this cartridge stand out from the pack now if you want to have that same sort of performance in a more cost effective packaging Cecil offer also offers the m60 which we refer to internally as the c6 but also available in a half gram as well as a 1 gram size but the entire body is made of plastic so that is a plastic body as well as a plastic mouthpiece even though this provides a slower price you still get a hundred percent of the performance because it has the patented C sell coil technology on the inside so there is no difference in performance between the glass cartridge or the plastic cartridge just a difference in material finish as well as cost now let's move on to the batteries very quickly you have two types of batteries for C so both of which are Auto and Hale batteries it means that they are not button activated see cell likes to have a user interface again very Apple like that is very easy to use and easy for a customer to learn to you so with both of these batteries once you put your cartridge on it you simply inhale in it that battery will automatically activate now first is the m3 battery which we refer to as just the C cell battery internally when you take this battery and you connect it to AC cell cartridge you end up with a very ecig like appearance that allows for a lot of description of discretion without any loss in performance this is a 350 mAh battery which means that it will last the typical user about a week before they have to recharge it now the newest battery to the C cell lineup is actually the palm battery here and this is a very interesting battery this actually has a drop-in design with a magnetic connector which means that you can drop in your cartridge and it won't fall out even though you don't have to screw anything in it allows the user to then also place it in the palm of their hand for maximum discretion while they're using it so that no one can see really what they're inhaling and this is a great option if you are really trying to express maximum discretion through your brand or for your users now lastly here we have the C cell disposable pen this is really the penultimate in terms of ease of use there's nothing to recharge there's nothing to refill you simply place your oil inside this disposable pen use it until it doesn't work anymore and then you throw it away and buy another so if either you as a user or as a brand you're choosing to engage this platform just know that if you really want to be able to convert users or provide an experience that it's extremely easy the disposal pen is the way to go because there's just no it's it's basically a proof there's no way to mess this up there's no way to not recharge it correctly or not fill it correctly so that is the entire C cell lineup let's drill down into each of these products individually so that you can learn a little bit more about the finishing and custom branding options available [Music] you", "O5XMZBaUJCo": "so before we start this review I like to say my Chado has no room for racial anything if you racist please don't subscribe to me if you're racist please stop watching my videos if you're racist please just don't even say anything just exit the door this channel has no type of room for that kind of [ __ ] if black lives don't matter that no lives matter at all I've always been that advocate I've always been this type of person I'm not just jumping on a bandwagon like a lot of other people are I've always stood up for racial and just about always I've been through this I know firsthand how the police treat them and Spanish people we are treated just like them and I just want to send my love my blessings and my condolences to everybody that has lost their lives to our authorities [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome to wavy vaporises I'm your boy early today we're gonna be doing a review on the pocket one color is royalty this is a THC cartridge battery my vaporizer was beautiful I mean it's still beautiful okay but I've dropped this so many times from my lap you know I like the vape and drive so a lot of times I put it on my lap and I forget about it when I get off the car it's the ground it has so many Nick's it has it's war scars already I will show you right now as you can see mine has so many Nicks and bruises I've dropped this so many times unfortunately straight from my lap it's never fell out my hands I've never dropped it from my hands it's always on my lap I get up and [ __ ] falls and hits the ground so you can see the back is beautiful no scratches no Nicks this is how the front looked when I first got it okay when I unbox this beauty there was not a blemish on it look beautiful not a scratch not a blemish once I turn in front boom war scars I must say though it has held up it still works here's a free idea why don't you guys make a nice little silicone glove that fits right around it so that way when people drop it it doesn't damage nothing happens to it you see this big eyes back they gave me with it I wish this was cut the same size as this because I would have put this on this and it would have protected it perfectly fine please make a silicon glove something that goes around this to protect it so it doesn't so people's $60 because these are $60 by the way some of them are 49.95 but this one was 59.95 we need something to protect that investment guys please work on it I have a regular cart in here carts almost done it has a magnetic piece that you put onto your carts the for the Grahams they have a smaller one for the point fires or the point tools or some [ __ ] like that and this is a cart that it comes with okay it doesn't come filled so please don't ask it did not come feel I filled this up okay as you can see at the bottom it has a magnetic piece on it all you got to do is just boom Rhett's to go charges in about two hours comes with a nice manual comes with an authenticity card to magnetical factors and it comes with a micro USB cable does have three modes three heat modes i got the the low mode which is blue then i got the medium mode which is yellow then the red mode which is high mode ok one of the good things I like about this battery that not a lot of I've reviewed a couple batteries for uh THC cartridges and I fell in love with the Swan I used the Swan for the past three years I've loved it I've never thought anything else would be better than that until I got this in my hands I don't even use my Swan anymore um one thing I do like about this a lot is you know when your battery's dying because all you have to do is press the button in the front and it'll glow as you can see mine glowing green which means is fully charged if it's halfway charged in a glow yellow if it's about the die or dying at a glow red when you press that okay another thing I love about this vape it has Auto inhale mode so you so not only do you get the choice of pressing a button to inhale you get the choice to not press the bun and just inhale get me but I love that the fact that they added that is so cool gives you the best of both worlds you know at the bottom is the Micro USB charger has a little dot right there when it's charging it's red once it's done it'll glow green so cycle through the mold you need to click it twice to go to the next he's heating them like they would like you to clean your magnetic pieces once in a while you know some alcohol stuff get rid all the residue please don't leave this in direct sunlight or heat okay that's like one of the things that they tell you to avoid in the manual don't leave it in direct sunlight or heat same thing with cold leave in your pocket in excess cold weather with a cartridge will take longer for the cartridge to eat okay if you put a bad card in there that let's say the car just doesn't work this is gonna tell you a red light is gonna blink and it could be caused by multiple things but mainly it is your car that's my stuff and in a blink read and it'll shut your device off you would have to turn it on again that's how you know if your card is bad if you put it in here and when you inhale it turns red and shuts off there is no save in that car you're gonna have to put that use that oil and put it into the one they have where maybe you have some cards I had to do that one of my carps was bad so I just replaced it and put it inside here no big deal it's battery supports top air flow cards and bottom air flow cards and if let's say your car itself doesn't support auto in hell it won't Auto inhale you will have to press the button keep that in mind if you put a card in there and you inhale automatically and it doesn't work and the light isn't blinking red meaning your card is [ __ ] up press the button that means your card doesn't support order right now you're just gonna have to press the button set this bad boy I have it on the second mode which is the yellow one medium taste this phenomenal one one good thing about this battery that's amazing you can pull on this for as long as your lungs can take it and they don't always taste the same it will not burn it will not burn the car it will not burn the oil it maintains the taste no matter how long they didn't have when I used to use the Swan I would have to make sure I don't pull for that long before the car starts to burn with this one you can inhale for longer than seven seconds and the cart won't burn you won't taste no burn you're gonna taste exactly what you have in here I have watermelon og in here right now build up their cartridge that came with it I filled it up with some wild very cush so I'm out the stick that one in there and did it for you one thing I did notice I mean I don't know if it's because I overfilled it or not the card it came with it seems like it's a little bit harder to get vapor than let's say the car I already had in it just Cheers it's free-flowing it's not tight as you can see it just feels like the clouds are coming out less you know but like I said I don't know if it's because I overfilled it too much but other than that it tastes amazing amazing as you can see I took over a five-second head still taste like wild berries nothing burned there goes a cloud but I think that's more because I in hair longer this battery is amazing unfortunately they are a little bit expensive and I know a lot of people you know I'm not paying $50 $60 for a battery I'm gonna paint 10 20 bucks the most half those batteries at ten twenty dollars are trash I'm being honest with you okay when the when the swan first came out it was $40 matter of fact there are still certain websites that sell them for $40 but now there's on the websites I sell them for 30 25 even 20 I wouldn't trust it though they might be bootleg I don't know all I know is that the original price of a swan was $40 I would rather pay extra 10 to 20 bucks and get this baby this battery because it's a hundred times better than a swan it kicks the Swans ass all day if you want to get this battery please head on all over to the

little here see I like tiny little", "7DOTUsHM41w": "today we're gonna talk about the AI minis BAM let's go check it out okay everybody today I'm gonna do a little review on a mini it's super mini it doesn't say who it's made by RoHS that's what it says 500 milliamp battery you can see that down there 15 wattage super small if you can look at it it's palm size you can literally hide it you can't even see it so one power setting it comes with no instructions in the box literally no instructions it's just this piece alone micro USB charging okay now it fits any slim battery where there's a one gram or half a gram just right now what I'm putting on is a one gram to give you a visual on how big it is if you're using a 1 gram cartridge okay should be a 3.7 voltage just like the standard mods here and the great thing about this i mini why I'm picking it up and decided to sell this at our retail shop is because it fits the other CBD tanks other slim tanks that are slightly bigger on the bottom now some of you don't may know or may not know that not all slim cartridges are made equally because if you look at the bottom base this one here it's much bigger in diameter on the base of it so therefore it doesn't fit into hives like the old school eyes you're the older highs you notice it doesn't fit in there because some of the dispensaries that are putting oils in these they come a little bit thicker on the bottom and and that's just the way they're made I don't know why but just know that these are the two general slim cartridges that the industry has made so just to give you a visual there now the eye mini comes should be a 1 power setting someone told me is a variable voltage I couldn't seem to figure it out if you guys figure it out leave a comment below that way everybody knows about it same thing 1 2 3 4 5 to turn on you can see a little blue light 1 2 3 4 5 ok you see that blue light there and to give you a visual on half a gram cartridge boom gives you a visual there and take a look at the cartridge that comes it's just slightly bigger in diameter so the great thing about the I mini is that it's it's a smaller modular device plus it's able to fit pretty much all realms of slim cartridges now okay I seem I seem to find this much more proportionate you can also still use the half a gram slim cartridges instead of the 1 gram because it's a little bit smaller you see that's not so like this is stick out like a sore thumb just to give you a visual on that there ok so overall between the two the hive and this if you look at it it's a visual side by side I love to hide it's a 650 milliamp battery the I mini is 500 milliamps it's much lighter it's not so heavy as the hive here ok but the hive it's definitely a better quality there's a little glass you can see through this right here is definitely exposed both microUSB at the same time should be both 3.7 volts so you guys choose and you guys comment below and tell me which one you guys like better I'm using the hive currently I just got these in our retail shop so not entirely sure how this really works but I think you should work just fine is a standard three point seven volt 500 milliamp battery the only thing I'm really worried about is this getting caught on something and sort of bending something bad at the end of the day if you just keep in your pocket it should be just fine you can throw in your duffel bag you can travel at the end of the day you know we're really just doing this for convenience purposes and efficiency I love it I will recommend it just some general rule of thumb here when it comes to slim cartridges I want to remind you all do not use any Twist batteries or any higher voltage batteries because you can blow out the burners in these tanks here and if you do you're pretty much [ __ ] out of luck there okay and if you have a glass tank luckily if you do have a glass tank you can somehow get a lighter put a lighter directly to the tank and extract it out if not if you have a plastic tank some of the manufacturers make them in plastic slim tanks then you're pretty much out of luck there you're gonna you're gonna lose all your oils and they're trying to extract it out it's pretty tough depending on how thick the oils are okay so just keep in mind do not use high power sip slow the harder you draw the more potential you can open to leakage because these atomizers aren't designed to burn at high power so it doesn't vaporize all the juice that you're drawing in so sip slow and long if you want a bigger hit if you want a softer hit just sip normal okay thank you", "bNgADHl6O0Q": "okay hi everybody I wanted to do a video on this battery 7:10 kingpin battery it's got a button on it it's the it's the kind that you push the button to you to turn on and off I think it's about the same voltage and capacity as those the other battery that has no button and just the light on the end but i guess i guess i do prefer this one a little bit since you can you can decide how long to to leave it on there's no there's no limit or it starts blinking like those other lights or like those other batteries do so I guess I guess I prefer those just because you can or I guess I prefer the 710 kingpin battery because you can leave it on like that but like I said I don't think it has any higher voltage I think it's still at 3.7 volts I almost think the capacity is the same as those other ones even though it is a little a little bit thicker than those other batteries I don't think it has any more capacity because you can you can run the battery out pretty quickly if you hold this down a lot or take you drips like I do yeah this is that that Girl Scout cookies from Alpine vapor that's what this one is but yeah I just wanted to do a quick note on this yeah just to show you what they were because I think they're a little more expensive than the other batteries I don't know if that's worth it so just wanted to share still charges the same way you know even little USB plug yeah there you go thanks for watching", "5qinAvsp3gY": "[Music] this is very similar to the same type of this is the testing either so four times yeah and I think in this right now we're hitting yeah it is yeah cuz actually has two barrels you're right and it's I think we're hitting on the loose soils on this one yeah the only thing that could be approved it is not pods in general is because they're plastic it's not always as efficient I think it's a glass and all the pods and this is with the Geo pod the the steezy pods a little bit of oil just gets left over in there it's not so I think it's still more efficient this Buster right see this coming out in the future that's a nice fish alright thanks", "-B59CLiTv4w": "Let's have a look at the Linx

cartridge review this is another episode of chronic chronicles thanks for tuning in the wiser Minds television and yeah let's go ahead and jump on into this today I have here a bloom Farms highlighter cartridge this was actually one of the first cartridges that I've ever tried here I have the hybrid as they call it there in any time cartridge I know they have the nighttime daytime this is at any time the first time I tried the indica grade no let downs but this was when they had wick cartridges and they they evolved from the whig this cartridge here is going to be weighing in at 67 percent THC with 1.4 percent of CBD so we do get some of those you know medicinal effects I'm gonna open this guy up all you do is really just slide up the top but it's still childproof um now they put them in like these little you know little silver thing I don't wanna have to use my teeth but I might have to I mean it happens it happens I don't want to be that guy today just might have to be that guy bear with me you guys I wish it was like a little little thing I could rip off like a ketchup packet or something a little start here sign but uh maybe I should have pre-cut this but hey I'm a bee imma be a UH okay this isn't working I'm just gonna have to be that guy today I'm got these big teeth for nothing oh yeah they definitely upgraded these cartridges man comes with a little cover at the bottom and yeah man they have the holes in here I don't know exactly what those are called what the system is called in these pens but a it's it's the new and improved no more wick you don't get that wick taste some of my cousins like they can complain about the they complain about the metal taste but I only get that metal taste usually when I'm at the bottom of my cartridge that just means time to get a new one man time to step it up and get a new one I'm gonna go ahead and link this on to my bloom Farms car I mean my bloom Farms battery sorry all right and I got a good story about this battery here first off when I first tried the anytime cartridge glass I was door dashing I'm at the mall I kid you not God could strike me down right now I'm hitting my pen that I already have mind you I already have something something like this and I looked down some just tells me to look down I look down by the car next to me and I see see this pin a brand new cartridge also and I'm like come on now somebody somebody come on is this am I getting pranked is this Punk'd but anyway I grabbed it I remember I cleaned it out four days cleaned out the mouth mouthpiece it hadn't been used but I just had OCD III didn't want to use it even though it was brand new I examined it and everything I remember my girls like like you know it's nothing it's clean it's nothing wrong with it I clean that thing for days but anyway when I did get started using it I remember men I fell in love with it I had both pins at the time one indica and this was my cartridge I would use like you know anytime of the day I would use the indica more at night just to try to balance out you know balance the medicine let me quit all this jibber-jabber talking and I'm gonna go ahead and get into this review if you're 18 and up um if you have blunts bongs balls whatever you have been vaping you dab and whatever you doing go ahead and spark up cheers big hits one thing that I like about this cartridge it still it still hits it's still hit I like this cartridge in this battery it's not a button or anything you just hit it like a regular whatever you're smoking you just hit it and you'll see the light at the bottom you know it'll oh my bad jogger y'all gonna have to excuse the ash eNOS on my lips and bring the chapstick out here oh I did bring a water though even though this is an edible review go ahead and watch that on kirova interval but like I said edible watch the kirova edible review that I'm also gonna be uploading with this video along with the vlog that I'm uploading as well I know I was slacking but I'm back and better than ever baby they like this nerd ass [ __ ] but anyway the taste that this ping gives off to me it I'm still coughing the taste it gives off it's not like a waxy damp it to me it gives off it gives off some herbal taste of marijuana taste and my select cartridge the last one that I got um pineapple Express a matter of fact the one that I just held up my as you can see I'm done with this it's done is it's gone but anyway it I could smell like it's more of a wax hate to me the Select but I couldn't as I bring it across my nose like you know I cuz I can smell the urn saying it same with this but this I could just I could taste and I can smell the herb and and I like that taste really natural reminds me of that taste of the kirova cookies are like you know just that tree taste period it's that type of taste when I first bought a bought a cartridge I know they let me know they donate every cartridge um and I'm not sure if it's just every cartridge or everything that you buy from gloom farms you donate a meal to the homeless so that's dope like you know shout out to all my people with a good heart out there like you we might be eating good but everybody else isn't eating good out there so you know you look out for everybody else too and why not you know you you copy your medicine you might as well just look out for somebody else to you know god is good he's been good to me and I know he's been good to y'all so you know let's try to bless everybody else big hits big hits you guys can't say these aren't big hits I know I know I know I said selecting heavy hitters were my favorite brand of cartridges but I cannot I cannot exclude bloom Farms I started with bloom Farms a and they still haven't failed me still they're there they're obviously they're evolving and you know they're they're looking out to see what's new they're evolving I love this cartridge right here this is gonna stick with me for a minute if you know you're going to be coming to the Bay Area anytime soon and you know that you're for sure gonna be stopping by some cannabis clubs be sure to ask about bloom Farms if you wanna you know take a few stalks on on the under you film you might not want to be all out in the open you know blowing trees might be with your family chilling you might want to run to the bathroom wherever run off to the side

them out man they like I said I've indica sativa whatever you like whatever type of strain is the strain for you I know everybody you know everybody likes like something a little different not

"V2zZQ0HR3_c": "hey what's happening guys what's going on YouTube so in today's video we're gonna be doing a review of the lope see t fob vaporizer i love this style of 8 this particular one the brand is loki it's got kind of a hawaiian kind of polynesian mask on it so I'm guessing it's kind of a play on words this is a Loki device to use like discreet but also low-key sounds kind of Hawaiian and how this works you simply just press this button it flips up it takes these 510 thread vaporizers something just like that just like these and why I like this it fits in your pocket nice and concealed very similar to this style although I think the Loki or these key fob style beeps have a few advantages so one it's a little bit larger you can find these a little bit smaller I've been unable to find this particular Loki brand on eBay or Amazon but these things are all over Aliexpress you can find them on eBay Amazon you'll find these popping up on Amazon although Amazon is pretty quick to remove them so I will drop a couple links in the description box below to some similar vapes to to this style may not be the exact same brand but I mean essentially all these things are coming out of the same Factory people are just private labeling them and making up their own name so I've seen this same one called the BB vaporizer what's kind of cool about this it has a couple different voltage settings one thing a lot of people find with a lot of these vapes is they're kind of underpowered they don't really heat the the oil up to the temperature that they need to be as far as this pen I mean this is a nice pen but it's a little bit bulky in your pocket I could see it getting broken more easily and it also it's a little bit underpowered I used to love this style of the cartridge a couple problems the one you need this adapter piece or it won't work this thing's very easy to lose and I find a lot of times it doesn't make a good connection and it's hard to get a good off of it another thing that I dislike about this tie and I used to love this tile I think this is super discreet it hits pretty well but it won't take the fat cartridge and so I don't think eyes can see that but that won't won't fit inside there this will only take the skinny cartridges so that's one downside of this one like I said the low key oh and here's another problem too this thing takes a up see if this one's already broken I can stuff that back in there but this thing the charger screws on to here and it's got a USB so there's another part you have to carry around this one it's a little bit more convenient it takes a mini USB you know I know most people have a USB somewhere you know in their car in our house but as more phones start going to USB or is it USB see as more phones start to get away from this type of charger you maybe are less likely to be carrying around that kind of charger with you here's what I really like about this is the charger is built-in so that piece flips out we plug it into our car plug it into our phone socket whatever and when we're done we pop it back in there you don't have to worry about carrying around a charger you don't have to worry about losing a charger it has a little clip here if you wanted to make this like your keychain and put your keys on it and again if we wanted to use it we simply flip it up hold the button in and take a pull off of it if we wanted to change a heat setting we simply click there and it changes the heat so and we got kind of a sensor here so yellow is three point two volts and if you guys can see the yellow is three point two volts blue is three point seven green is four point oh and red is four point two so this is that the highest setting say quick pull off and see if it pulls better at a higher setting oh you know I think my battery just went just went dead on me this actually needs a charge but that's kind of how you flip through the different heat settings overall this is kind of my new favorite bait pen now on Aliexpress you can probably pick these up for eight or ten bucks this one at the head shop they had it marked as $29.99 the guy gave it to me for 19 let's see features pocket-sized built-in USB charger 350 mah battery keychain hook 510 thread which is like the most popular and variable voltages inside you know this is pretty much all that that comes inside just kind of diagrams what this is but like I said you know if you don't mind waiting maybe two weeks to four weeks for shipping you can find these on Aliexpress really cheap if you want it faster Amazon is pretty quick I don't think you'll find these on Prime's you're probably looking at about a week ship and you have to pay for shipping if you buy it off of ebay you can probably get it within like three to seven days and I've seen these anywhere from $8 to 50 bucks on eBay but uh I will link to a couple of these different styles in the description box below if you guys have used these and want to drop your own comments or commentary go ahead and do so if you have a recommendation for a brand that you like if there's any tricks life hacks etc with these that you want to share go ahead and do that as well if

customize each session with the battery life now around 2 hours of continuous use is one of the best in the portables market backed by convection style heating the flavor of the mighty is arguably some of the best on the scene even the third or fourth draw tastes exactly the same the draws smooth and does not compromise vapor thickness if you're willing to drop a couple of dollars this is well worth it third in line the absolute unquestionable workhorse of the vaporizing marketplace the solo 2 built upon the successes of the first solo and addressed some of its shortcomings adding a digital display precise temperature control and improving air flow the glass tubes are still a mixed bag providing excellent flavor and simple cleaning but can easily be broken with the bulky design you might want to keep the solo to at home but the three hour battery life won't have you tethered to the wall much the ability to change your session time is another excellent feature of the solo - overall I definitely recommend the solo to highly to anyone who will listen if you've been eyeing the mighty but can't pull the trigger because of the price the utili and 7:21 coming in at number four may be right up your alley a 721 offers similar convection style heating utilized in the stores and Bickel products but offers it at a fraction of the price this unit is incredibly easy to use with one button operation for preset temperatures and an enhanced heating mode it can take on your wax as well and does so quite nicely as the temperature goes up to 215 degrees Celsius convection heating makes for wonderful flavor excellent vapor production inside the 7:21 is a 2300 milliamp hour lithium polymer battery which will last most users roughly an hour of use it is much smaller than the mighty making it more portable and convenient on the go the utility and 7:21 is the world's most affordable convection vaporizer and it delivers every time coming in at number five another of the Storz and Bickel line the crafty is slightly smaller but every bit as powerful as the mighty sharing the exact same convection heating chamber the trade-off in sizes of much longer heating time and half the battery life only two temperature settings are available at your fingertips but the app allows for full temperature control and custom presets like its bigger brother the packaging has been updated to include dosing capsules if you're looking for exactly the same performance as the mighty but in a slightly more pocketable version the crafty is just that but it does carry the premium price tag of the Storz and Bickel line this year's top budget goes to the 421 for those on a budget or who want something more affordable to try for the first time the utility in for 21 sets the standard for what a budget vaporizer should be the 421 has six preset temperatures airflow control and more impressively a digital display 60 minutes of battery life and a glass mouthpiece luxuries you rarely find in a budget device the display will show your set and current temperature as well as your battery life the glass mouthpiece and ceramic heating chamber provide great flavor for a budget-friendly unit perfect for a budding connoisseurs first unit or a seasoned vet looking for a backup showed up for best two and one goes to the focus vape tourists for its rig likability to rip killer wax sessions or slow things down for a nice water filtered session with your herbs able to handle most any concentrate the tourist has a wide temperature range for both herb and wax the herb settings range from 90 to 240 degrees Celsius and the wax settings range from 260 450 degrees Celsius you can also use it in herb mode without the glass mouthpiece and the unit turns into a very capable portable herb vaporizer perfect for quick trips it features USB charging and a removable 18 650 battery which can be easily swapped to keep you going all day for the price there is no two in one out there that Trump's the tourists on the cusp of its 20th birthday the volcano is still hands down the best desktop vaporizer with the option between the digital or classic versions the volcano

settings and it has a long lasting battery as well as a magnetic charging port which is really cool so i have the charging base as well that i'm going to open up and it came with a really cool carrying case so i'm really excited about this i've never even heard of this brand so that's pretty cool wow very fancy welcome to vessels put a little insert start with the the lowest setting or your oil to find your optimal setting device turns off after 15 minutes we recommend you fully charge your device before the first use so i'm definitely going to do that remove the back cartridge black cartridge and replace with your choice of cartridge enjoy wow very cool all right so here's what it looks like on the inside i like the wood grain it's very earthy wow okay cool so how does this work it's like i'm gonna break it no okay oh there it goes okay so this guy goes around the cartridge it just looks like a standard screw-in and this is just the stock cartridge or the cartridge placeholder interesting yeah this isn't a cartridge this just holds it in place in the case i guess that's cool i'm gonna put that back in so we'll lose it all right let's open up the base oh the chargers in the bottom the charger is one of those screw-on ones which i don't know how i feel about those those always get gunked up you guys like that i brought my plant friend with me today oh [ __ ] pretty fancy it's a lot smaller than i thought wow so this is the whole charging base look at that that's cute and then you still obviously plug in the charging base so it's just a usb cord i'm gonna have to plug this in at some point but then oh yeah so your battery just goes right in there oh kind of clicks in that's nice very cool and then the carrying case organize and carry your vessel experience in this protective case pretty cute it matches my wood grain my mom says that i like mid-century modern earthy that's my vibe which i don't know that means but apparently that's a style wow awesome so you have room for two of them and then a couple extra cartridges and you can put some stuff in this side oh it's probably upside down i probably did that upside down yeah that fits a little bit nicer there you go so there it is my carrying case awesome looking forward to doing some really good cartridge reviews with this guy so stay tuned for those ah amazing have a great day guys",

you're needed in your life this is like the best battery I cannot think of anything better for compact portability for a cartridge like I've seen I've seen the dark which is a like a pod system that you fill up with distally I think or yeah the dark you fill it up with distillate and then what else is it what else is it scratch that [ __ ] capacitor but there's like so many of other devices that like this this is just so good I'm very impressed I'm so impressed I don't know why that impressed but like like even just how it feels like it's so simplistic but it works so well and that's what I

without further ado man hope y'all have a go on man peace", "UG7wVgg6jI0": "what's up guys it's bond and today we are doing a review on the Loki so this is a key fob right and the the cart sits on the inside but right now I'm just gonna show you some of the settings so right over here on this side you got three different options to point 7 volts three point one volts and three point six volts and they are color-coordinated and when you hit this button three times one two three it changes colors to match what volts it's on so it tells you what volts you're getting and then you can also hit this five times and then it should blink red and it turns it off put it five times again and then it turns back on so the Loki is a really nice device and it's a key fob it's it fits the car on the inside like this is so great he protects the glass right so instead of like most batteries having the glass stick out like that or even like the tip sticking out you can still hit it on things you can hit on tables it can break really easily if you're not careful but with this it sits on the inside so when you are not using this device you just put you pull it down let it sit on the inside put in your pocket whatever on your keychain because it's a key fob it legit looks just like a key fob has a built-in charger some lets get a hit off it let's see what setting it's on now it's on blue let's go for the high setting three point six volts let's rip this so like with any battery takes a couple hits to warm up there's no preheat on this but it's like like if I hold it for like three or four hits it's already warm enough it does come in color options you got the full goal this is if you're trying to like pimp out this is like not low key even though the device is called low key it doesn't really make sense why you want this one unless you're just trying to like flex on somebody you got the the one I'm reviewing the black and gold with the gold bar and then you got the black with the rainbow there's also like an all-black one and a black with a silver bar we're gonna start doing more reviews we're gonna be coming out with a lot more new stuff lately we'll be your number one source we'll get stuff in really fast and we'll do really good reviews for you so check out our last video then the miko i don't know i called the micro it's the miko by Smok i don't it's not smoke smoke yeah you call it a team huh you bought at a dream huh I happen to be my I've been moving faster climbing up the ladder playing noddies man trust getting nahdi's answers my mind over matter okay it's never disastrous [Music]", "e1nIQyuNDe0": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] and what's up stoners my name is Loomis is this not a corner that's gonna thicken on the video and today we're gonna be talking about the pocket one plus it's a nifty little battery for your distillate cartridges this thing is this is my new daily driver this thing is super rad this is a 660 milliamp battery for your oils that's all I have to say man it's got a magnetic adapter for your carts boom it has an auto inhale boom I can't really demonstrate that because this is a faulty cart it's not really working but it does you know has three temperatures low medium and high you turn it on by pressing the button five times cycle through the heat settings by pressing it two times and if you want to check out how much battery you have expressed one time and they'll indicate you with a little flash it was green so that means it's near 100% when it turns blue that means it's at a 50% and when it's red its 25% this thing will ask you about two cards then you'll need to recharge it but hey man my old battery left me friggin half card and I'd have to refill everything recharge you so this is a really use a step up madness and step up this is a very nice product it has a one-year warranty which is also nice it's made from a CNC block of aluminum I believe I could be wrong on the materials used for this product but it's nice heavy it feels like a very nice product kind of reminds me of a pax but for your pens and a smaller level got via the OG packs this thing is phenomenal I've had that thing for like wow five years almost six I can't I can't even remember and they'll work son so yeah quality good stuff good stuff yeah oh it also has a chip inside of it so it will not burn out your cartridges so you'll never have a burnt kart taste with this battery they do come with proprietary cartridges that you can get off of their site they will run you about seven to eight dollars maybe about ten dollars including shipping and handling I don't know I haven't checked out the prices on that fully but you know around that price range they say that they will outlast any other cartridges that you buy so hey I think I paid for it they also do have magnetic bases so they're not 510 thread they already come magnetic so you can just like refill it and just pop it in you don't need to like have magnetic adapters which is pretty cool I've never seen that done in any other company so I'm definitely gonna buy some of those cartridges and review them in a later video because that does interest me but I'm gonna take a hit of this I 95 on the pocket battery duder know what that but I'm going to show you that Auto inhale feature so I think when you prop it and you gotta like get it going first like inhale [Music] that's really cool I don't know why doesn't work with this cartridge I don't know what the deal is but I think it's just that specific cartridge like I just came out faulty but I'm pretty sure if I buy another one of these it'll probably work I hope [Music] [Music] for a meeting [Music] am i super discreet you can barely tell I have anything in my hand if you want to go even more low-key and you don't mind it kind of being a little bit more hard to reach you could use that gram adapter and then it's like more more hidden I guess seriously but all in all this battery this battery is what you gotta buy brow BAM at the pocket one plus this thing this is the [ __ ] man [Music] cool really cool batteries but anyways guys that's the end of the video hope you guys enjoyed it yeah really considered very interesting I haven't been sponsored by these people by the way but hey pocket if you want sponsor me yeah highlight the boy looks good but I'm not as definitely consider picking one of these up because you will not be disappointed you probably spent let's say 30 40 dollars on disposable batteries anyways because those batteries are asked I know I've personally spent about 30 to 40 dollars on like those pin batteries they they will eventually die it's not a matter if they will it's a matter of when they will because cannot really build to last but I honestly do recommend this this battery probably save some money in the long run and I promise you you will not regret but anyways I talk too much have a good one mmm enjoy draw responsibly and kill it today bro and three dead oh that's not a real words but it came out of my mouth so whatever later [Music]", "Ja1BHyYu2mY": "what's up YouTube back here again with another video and keeping with my gear change today I recorded another vapor view this is my other fate of you that I got today I'm not sure what order these were coming out in whichever the case doesn't really matter let's dive into the views mmm 0 Cairo Kiro 0 0 key row Cairo I don't know I have no idea how you would say that I mean this it looks very simple and you think I don't know 0 I'm thinking Siro is what it's supposed to be so any which way I probably could figure that out or find that answer somewhere but now who wants to do all that this is a new east cigarette from views this is now gonna be a product that sits in between the original views which is more like a cartomizer type tip a more authentic sigil like and between the vibe which is a larger style it's got the ego style battery bigger battery bigger tanks this is gonna sit in between it's gonna be the smaller size but still have the tank style cartridge instead of a cartomizer which is like a polyfill not really like a you know just a tank of liquid here so let's dive in a box this guy first take a look around alright the tanks are 0.9 milliliters is a 260 million power battery it is us be chargeable this is the tobacco kit now the starter kit I have only seen in tobacco alright you get the tank the charger and the battery now these kits are 10 bucks I got this for 10 bucks I don't know if that's gonna be a special or if it was on sale whatever the case but this kit cost me $10 at my convenience store so you know take a look for it so you slide it out your battery is here in the back pull this guy out battery we can take a look here to get started charge unit attached cartridge vape and enjoy so you actually peel this off here's your cartridge and here is your charger now this kit actually has a couple cool features that I like a little different than all the other ones that you'll see out there look at the tank it's clear which is kind of cool so it's like a small size right but it's clear so I think that's kind of cool I do like that I think that's neat looking now I am a views vibe fan right now using my vibe and pretty much everyday so I figured hey these look the same they got the same flavors figure the taste would be the same now from what I can read on here if we pull this up it says that where did I see it these have what I understand this has a ceramic I think it's on this so these are replacement cartridges it's gonna come in a box like this and there'll be three of these attached together just kind of stuff in here but I've already baked through them but I believe it said somewhere where did I see prefilled cartridges mint somewhere that this is a ceramic is it like a ceramic element in it not the not be like a silica wick inside or a cotton or anything like that I believe the other ones are a silica where did I see it oh there it is okay sorry offers a refined flavor experience with it's clear cartridge and innovative ceramic wick technology so the flavor is a little different okay the flavor on these tanks is muted it's a little more muted than the views vibe okay surfer used to a vibe and you use them in okay min is my favorite it's not as minty the flavor is still good there's nothing bad about it but it's just not quite as minty as the vibe it so there's that so the cartridge is clear here's a battery let's take a look again 260 million power there's no light on the bottom you see we got views same coating that's on the vibe so this is gonna chip off over time the paint doesn't last very well there's your little indicator light right there all right you're threading area you know very simple to roll and enjoy so you take your little caps off and this is your cartridge you're just gonna literally screw it on it's very simple and there you go so I'll show you the light now the drawl is good okay it's a little looser than some of the other ones but it's very comparable to a vibe flavor is good and clean I never get a dry hit I've never had one of these types of tanks these prefilled tanks not be a little dry in the beginning you know you might have to prime it up a little bit or whatever the case this thing is good from first year all to the last drawler tank which is very impressive for these types of devices so that's a very very cool thing so that's pretty much it that's how you use it now no charge it here's your charger now this is the other cool feature about this so the clear tank I think is cool the other one is we got magnetic charging not only do they give you the magnetic charging which can also screw it into the bottom like an old like the old-school way so let's plug this guy in you get a green light simply you just push it down in now you got a red light let's check our amperage 0.2 3 amps now again I this is I think this is pretty much close to charged so whatever doesn't matter but it'll go green when fully charged now you can also plug this in this way and when you plug it through this way you're gonna get also the light that light will go out and this light will go out when fully charged all right so not much to it I guess yeah that green light the green light is gonna be for the magnetic the lay up here and the light on down here is gonna be your indicator for when it's charged when you thread it in so there you go and wow look at that it's charging a lot faster through here so we're getting half an amp through the thread half an amp through the thread and we're only getting 0.25 about 0.2 amps on the thing so what that's going to tell you is it's going to charge way faster through the threading so keep that in mind if you want charge a little bit faster thread it in but the magnetic charging is cool and that just works by the two contacts on the bottom so you know they give you both options if it does go bad guess what you have another way so final thoughts on the views cero the kit was priced right I believe okay so ten dollars gets into the kit only tobacco is all I seen now here's where the interesting thing is do you replacement cartridges for this this was fourteen dollars so you get three tanks for $14 did liquid in these tanks goes fast for I think what they should do is they should give you four of them for about ten or eleven dollars and that's gonna keep it on par with the use time and the vape time that you get it out of the views five you get two tanks for $10 on the vibe but if you get almost four mils of liquid here you're only getting three mils of liquid for $14 you're getting less liquid for more money you know that's kind of your call do you like the smaller device do you like the bigger device either which way you're not gonna go wrong but I do still recommend oh the vibe I think that's the perfect mix of all the things still a pretty good vape so there you go there you have it that's how you use it that's what I feel about it thanks for watching see you on the next one", "hhFxOvnDZuM": "hi guys it's Matt dizzle here I know you've missed my face it's gotten fatter but

to 20 dollars plus tax in Northern California they're also a Californian brand they come in blend in the strained version but we got the blend person as you can see it's very child resistant it also has the California symbol on it it doesn't say that it's easy so but the packaging is very sturdy and it's also made out of plastic and stainless steel it pairs with and you five-10 threaded battery and it's very easy to use it's really good on a number of - setting the oil is white amber the flavor is very mild and it hits very well as you can see overall it gets you high into hits that's a very good smoking experience in my opinion", "LV-kkMZjGJ8": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and just in time for the holidays we have the latest elfs jumping right out for your holiday

battery special now the elf battery is a standard stick battery very nice high-quality metal casing what we did was we offered a couple matte colors and we're also doing some metallic colors so externally this thing is gonna look really really sharp now it doesn't have a twister but it's still a variable voltage you're gonna have a push button operation which is standard five clicks on five clicks off you guys see the light turn on there and it's gonna be the color green you're gonna click it one two three times and it's gonna change colors to blue then you click it again one two three and you can see it change the LED changes to red now this is gonna indicate the three different intensity settings so you're gonna have your most intense setting which is blue come in at four volts you're going to have your middle which is the green come in at 3.7 volts and then you're going to have the lowest red come in at 3.4 so you're gonna just the temperature setting and do on-and-off functions through the push button operation then as you remember push and hold throughout the duration of your inhale when you're vaping standard 510 thread screw gonna work great with all your prefilled disposable carts and even mini slim dab tanks and then for charging this was a request that I had gotten several several requests for people didn't want to buy standard 510 thread chargers to screw into the top of the battery people wanted the micro USB convenience we saw on our higher-end batteries and mods so this one is an actual pass-through battery with an LED charging indicator here at the bottom you're going to take your provided micro USB cable you will get one in the box that the elf comes in and you're simply going to plug it in to activate your charging functions so this is gonna be a really good little battery it's gonna be a good capacity good performance really good basic entry-level but still hit like a honey stick still be a champ and those who are familiar with elf products are alpha twist and swells our elf concealer know that these things are not only gonna be stylish but they are gonna pack a punch and be ready to rumble so now let's get a real close-up and go through some of these really cool colors so the one that you guys saw before right here was this really nice kind of metallic red I mean we're talking like a strawberry metallic this is a gorgeous little color as you can see I'm just gonna do a quick 360 on it you're gonna have the elf insignia on each battery right down here that runs parallel to the fire button so you print it on there really nice high quality look so that's our metallic strawberry color there then we're going to this metallic it's a it's a copper color I want to say it's almost like a you know I've seen some cars made in this color they're really nice high-end you can actually see the little metal metallic sparkles and it's got a wonderful little copper finish on it it's almost like a deep like a rusty orange just metallic and shiny then you're gonna have your I want to say kind of like a sparkling champagne color right here which will just do a little quick 360 on really nice little battery there there's some standard elfs and even off of the elf twist in this color the concealers this is a very popular color then we have one of my favorite colors which is this which is just like metallic lime green I don't even know but I can't even quite name it but if Shrek were to vape I think this would be his battery right here and I love Shrek so this is an awesome little color probably my favorite color in the elf metallic stick batteries here we have a real nice standard like a nice like midnight sparkling metallic and blue real nice and dark but the metallic sparkles are are there with the white insignia nothing like a little white and blue really nice colored battery here do a slow little 360 there then I mean this is just such a popular color now this is like a matte slate gray with the white it's just it's just cool you know you see like two hundred thousand dollar cars in this color so why not throw it on nice high quality vape battery looks really nice the 360 right there and then of Cour oops there goes the blue and then of course you can't make a vape battery without making a classic black with the white elf logo it's a real nice it's not a matte it's got a glossy finish but it's not sparkly just a really nice clean high-gloss black 360 there so that in a nutshell is our elf entry-level battery that is a stick battery that's passed through also variable

to fix your pen if you're not getting any vapor off your draw so you can see here it was a nice slow steady draw the battery will light up but we're not getting any vapor trail so in order for your cartridge to work this little paddle on the battery has to come up and make contact with this little paddle on the cartridge alright so as you can see the little paddle on the cartridge side has been recessed so in order to get that paddle back up to the top of the threading we're going to use a little bit of arm spin take the sharp end of the bloom Farms pin to fit in this hole and just raise it up just a little bit very delicately so that it's even with the top of the threading alright so now that we've leveled the paddle off and it's nice and flush with the rings of the threading I'm gonna attach it back to the battery let's give it a shot", "7GyU4_Dcm7I": "hi i'm annie from vapefully.com and today i'm going to review the latest portable vaporizer from xvape the aria come on let's check it out the aria is very solid yet a compact and discreet vaporizer unlike many other budget devices the aria is plastic free the metal casing is very sturdy and it's covered with leather-like pads that are nice to touch and give the vaporizer an elegant sophisticated look the ceramic heating chamber has an oval shape that ensures very even heating of the herbal material therefore no stirring is required during the session which is cool and allows discreet use in public the magnetic mouthpiece is made of ceramic as well that means less heat and better flavor thanks to the all-ceramic vapor path the vapor tastes really good especially for a full conduction unit the vapor output is impressive and the vapor itself is smooth and pleasant the temperature is fully adjustable in a wide range of 100 to 240 degrees celsius this enables use of dry herb as well as concentrates there's also a dab tool hidden at the bottom of the unit and a concentrate pad included in the kit so you're all set the heat up is rapid it takes just 15 seconds to reach the vaping temperature which is awesome it's a pity that the battery is built in as we all like swappable batteries but it's the only downside of the aria that comes to my mind on the other hand the battery is very powerful and there's a pass-through charging function as well so it's not such a big deal summing up i really enjoy using the xvape aria it's a rock-solid vape that provides really good vapor and a great vaping experience in general taking into account its affordable price the value is awesome i highly recommend the xvape aria to you get yours today at vapefully.com", "6ZI73u2J39g": "[Music] hey guys it's Stan and I'm here today to talk to you about how to know exactly when your lair needs to be charged have you ever noticed yet when you inhale on the Allaire the pen glows along with your draw white on our newer models and orange on the older ones now when your battery is completely dead the el air will flash three times when you draw at which point you need to remove your current cartridge by holding on to the two scenes and unscrewing the black battery find your lair charger screw that back on to your black battery and plug that into any USB device once plugged in the indication light will again glow for the entirety of the charging cycle and when it's fully charged it will turn off you'll get on the screw the

VapeFully.com and\ntoday I\u2019m gonna do a review of the Flowermate Swift Pro portable vaporizer. This is the first full-convection vape from\nthe creators of the critically acclaimed Flowermate series. The Flowermate Swift Pro is quite small, you\ncan almost fully conceal it in your palm, it also fits in almost any pocket. It somehow resembles an e-cig box mod, so\nit is quite stealthy to use in public. The Flowermate Swift Pro features a 100% convection\nheating system, so your herb is only heated with hot air, not the chamber walls. This results in amazing efficiency \u2013 you\nmaterial is heated only while you draw so basically you don\u2019t lose any active compounds\nwhen the material is cooked in between the draws, as it would be with any conduction\nor hybrid vaporizer. From a practical point of view, this also\nmeans that you can split your vape session into two (or more) without any loss whatsoever\n\u2013 you can take a few puffs, pocket your vaporizer and finish the bowl later. Convection heating provides a much better\noverall vapor quality, too \u2013 the vapor is very smooth, super-tasty and not scratchy\nat all. Thanks to the design of this vaporizer, the\nvapor is very well-cooled as well, so inhalation is very comfortable for your lungs and throat. The chamber is rather small \u2013 it holds 0.1-0.15\ngrams of your herb of choice, so it is really herb conserving. What\u2019s interesting, there are few types\nof chamber walls included in the set \u2013 you can choose between quartz and one of three\ntypes of wood. Each ring (chamber walls) provides slightly\ndifferent taste, but to be honest it\u2019s not any sort of major difference. The temperature can be adjusted with 1-degree\nincrements, so you can easily craft your vaping experience according to your personal preference. The heat up is super-quick \u2013 the Flowermate\nSwift Pro reaches the highest temperature in around 30 seconds, which is quite impressive. I have only two major complaints about the\nFlowermate Swift Pro. Firstly, the battery life \u2013 every convection\nvape needs more power from the battery, but the Flowermate Swift Pro allows only 25-30\nminutes of continuous use per charge and that\u2019s enough for 3-4 bowls. You can charge it with the powerbank via USB,\nhowever you can\u2019t use it while charging and that\u2019s a pity. My second complaint is the battery indicator\nthat is totally unreliable \u2013 just after the charging is finished is shows only around\n20% of battery life, when in reality the battery is fully charged. This is quite confusing when you start using\nthis vaporizer. Besides that, Flowermate Swift Pro is a great\nlittle vaporizer that utilizes full-convection heating and provides superb vapor. It\u2019s no too expensive, so if you\u2019re looking\nfor reliable convection vaporizer that won\u2019t ruin your budget, I highly recommend to you\nthe Flowermate Swift Pro! So go and get yours today!", "3TxFpfmAmH8": "introducing the phase complete vaporizer kit this kit is a great option for anyone looking to get into vaping or a more intermediate user looking for a

from eros before we get started I would like to thank the guys at Aris Tech for sending out the tick and for sponsoring this review if you'd like to learn more about Aris tech products please visit our stead calm now let's get started here's what comes in the box with the tick vaporizer you get the tick vaporizer unit itself there's a little accessories package in it you have the two brass rings that couple it to the cartridges and also the micro USB charging cable the instructions are on the back of the box right now let's take a closer look at the tick unit itself it's a really nice elegant design you can see the bottom plate is metal plate with a screw on so you could access the batteries it's a micro USB charging port on the side and then there's one single function button on the front it's got a hinged top like a Zippo lighter and it flips open like that inside you have the the port that you put your cartridge down into it fits almost any size 510 cartridges that's like ecig type cartridges and there's a little slit and the sides that you can see the the cartridge and fill level and then we have these two brass rings that are magnetized and these are fittings that will fit various size cartridges into the tick now keep in mind it does not include any cartridges it's just the vaporizer battery itself and the fittings that will hook it to various size cartridges and then it has a magnetic fitting inside and as you can see there the little slit lets you see the quantity of your a cartridge and then it's got that swing top that completely conceals and protects the cartridge now we'll get the tick charged up and take a look at the functions and features you can see that there's a little red light there that will stay on while it's charging and then when it's fully charged the light goes off you power the tick with five clicks of the button it has three different settings that you can access with three clicks of the button Green is 3 point 4 volts then the blue is 3 point 7 volts and red is high at 4 volts so nice variable voltage function it cuts off with 5 clicks and that's it is really simple to use as far as the functions and features but my favorite part is always it's that usage and testing is it going to load it up with cartridge F some Lauzon made whacks there and my EC cartridge I'm gonna put it on high cuz I like to get the big puffs especially for the camera there if they're small puffs it looks like the vaporizers not doing a good job so you have to get the big puffs and it did not let me down it got really good nice puffs off of it really good flavor and it was really nice to have the variable voltage I left it on high pretty much the whole time because I'm a bit of a hog but it is nice to have that lower voltage if you have different kinds of cartridges or if you just want smaller smoother hits I really did like the performance of it I loved that swing top that covers up the cartridge you know so you don't break it in your pocket but let's look at the pros and cons it's got that perfect size 650 milliamp battery the compact elegant design that I really like with the cap that protects and conceals the cartridges the varial voltage which is really nice if you want different types of cartridges or different types of hits and it fits almost any kind of 510 cartridges comes in three colors red white and black and I really had no cons to mention on this when I grown it five stars Aires tech vaporizer is a really cool it's innovative and nice way to do your cartridges without breaking them and it's really discreet so if you want to learn more about it and Aris tech products visit Aires tech comm and again thanks to those guys for setting up this I hope you enjoyed this review of the era's tactic if you did hit the like button and subscribe to roughhouse studios for more cannabis culture videos made just for you this is Matt for ruff out studios thanks for watching [Music]", "BiReZW3gXiY": "hey dumb guys my name is Joey I'm here at this kind of a pen and I'm here with the I'm in e3 again [Music] so guys the I'm in III uh we had a lot of questions about it on our YouTube page and for some reason you guys don't understand that well about it so I'm doing a little refreshing so I'm gonna talk slowly and you know exactly what I'm talking about and hopefully you understand by the end of the video so five clicks will turn on the device and turn off the device three clicks is going to change the voltage so right now it shows red that's gonna be the highest setting which is gonna be a four point two volts and then if you want to change the voltage all you gotta do is click it three times one two three it will go back down to green which is a two point eight volts so right there click it three more times one two three now it's blue blue is three point two and then click it three more times one two three yellow yellow three point eight and then again where I usually vape my cards one two three the high setting for point two so guys the I'm in e3 this thing is awesome you like the gold color by the way that a Rabb money it's pretty lit so it does take different cartridge size right now this card is a 10 mil cart and it has a little bit of wiggle room you can fit 12 millimeters in there easily and not have any issues the way it works is magnetic so there is a magnet that it comes with and that's the ring you see these plenty of times you know probably be in your juncture at this point yeah they this device you should come with a tank before but now they do not come with the tank anymore reason why you never used it that's why why you gonna put more waste into the ocean I mean I'm gonna use it these might as well just have it just how it is so guys this little baby does hit at 15 watts max and it has a 500 milliamp battery how do I know that I should tell you ready to bottom so it's pretty cool that actually tell you like some information so charges in the back when you charge the device it will turn red and then upon finishing charging it would turn blue max charge our max charge time he's gonna be for like an hour on asleep but it most like it's gonna be 45 minutes but no one ever hits this until the debt so we do have a lot of questions about some troubleshooting so here's here we gonna go anytime you see blinking lights on the actual barn right there it can be multiple things one usually means that the cartridge that you have in it's not working anymore it's not properly you know place onto the magnet piece we actually try to get like a little cartridge on the you know on the side and try to break it or try to torque it so we could show you the blinking lines but we can't do it unfortunately we don't know how to break things but sometimes it might be the magnet this one's actually loose you could tell pieces is not is this very loose you need to be tight make sure that's tight if that works and you press a button in vapes you're good if it doesn't still blinks then you could be the pin so the pin inside the bottom of the cartridge sometimes might be a little bit pushed in so we can do is you can pull it out ever so slightly and what it does is still make the connects a little bit easier for the device to make contact if you still have any issues charge up the batteries honestly some people would come here with the questions about like my device doesn't work and Linn was less time you charge and say I didn't know how to charge it so charge the battery simple so guys that's the I'm in e3 right now I'm gonna take some hits sounding yellow which is three point eight volts so anytime you hold down the button is going to show the indication of the setting that you're on you wanna you know go up click it three times one two three now it's red which is the highest and 4.2 volts so I'm gonna hold down a button you'll see the red color so that's how it works guys that was the review for the I'm in e3 hopefully you understand this time I tried big time so you know be patient and you know very steady with my explanations so that was it remember or this little you know chukka from discount vape and calm before three o'clock eastern time you do get same day free shipping just me that was the I'm 83 discount of a pen piece [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "ApPMvT8Ax14": "hey guys it's me Tara I'm gonna take these off didn't realize that your sir still on I feel like this is kind of gonna be a live video because I'm not going to edit it whatsoever so I woke up this morning and if you know I just recently had a birthday so now I'm a 32 year old lady um shoot that really does suck though you know like 32 I mean it's not bad I'm gonna hang on 32 I'm just saying that like anyways on with what we're talking about here I wash this in the washer and I wish I could tell you that this thing is still living but it's not so if you're anything like me you're in a frantic and you're like what are you gonna do because right now there is none at my store very sad like I waited until they open and I was like ran in there real fast was like I know exactly what I want so I went shopping at different places today and that's what I'm here to show you and give you a review on what I think all right first off I want to show you this let me get this ready first this is a G Jean it's a mesh oh no it wasn't ready okay this is how it comes I'm going to put it back in there how it is okay and then yeah and then this this goes in there and then I've already been using it like I said this is a review like I've been using it and I didn't think to put it back in the box show you what it looks like when you buy it all right it's going to look similar to this right here great the color is purple and it's 1999 this is this is what I bought just a quick fast in a hurry because I thought okay this was the store to come to I went to cloud nine here in Durant comes with one of these refillable cartridges which is really convenient because I don't have one of these so amazed dolls so I really liked that that was a good selling point now this right here I don't know if you're focusing good on that or not but that's what I'm working with at first I was like cool its little that was my first thought okay and then like I was like buy it wrap it up really fast I get it I'm thinking at first it's a magnetized one it is not I don't know why I keep looking over here so I'm sorry guys that just looking I need to look everywhere else okay but it's a twist on now okay okay now I've found which is really nice let me just say some good things about it okay first off one two three four five like everything else and then you're gonna push to do it right oh [ __ ] no I wait one two three four five make sure it's quickly not starting off on a good foot I'm smoking right now I can't breathe okay don't hit it as hard as I did in the reason why I hit that hard is because I didn't think it was working isn't it when I saw the smoke I was like oh so I'm talking [ __ ] so what'd you get my mouth is numb that's how hard I hit it I probably killed my lungs just now but it goes off by itself that's what the good quality I found out because I was hitting it and then I set it down for like a second and then I picked it back up again to hit it and it was off and I was like it's a nicer hit even though I'm still dying inside like really die anyways if you're wondering I got some tattoos on my berth not real they're not real but um I just wanted to tap my body up for my birthday I don't know why me and my son actually I say me and my son but it was really like after he went to bed I did it to myself I'm still a little kid inside but really I'm a 32 year old lady anyways um it's really good I just want to show you when it goes off I haven't touched it I've been waiting for it to go off still hitting really good I'm gonna set it down I'm gonna keep sitting it down because I want to make sure that you know that like I didn't try anything I want you to see that it goes off on its own and then we'll in the video what's going on with my life a lot of things are going on but like interesting I don't know I'm fixin to harvest that's interesting I don't know my freaking Atmos broke and then when I went to go when I went to go replace the Atmos I was telling about I need my micro pal at most like I need another one and they're like those are costly and I'm like I know can I get one like stat and they were like we don't have any of those you know like where did you get yours at and I was like at a store like my store and I like don't have any like it was terrible it was completely terrible still working if anybody's wondering this is a fog from Oklahoma it's a gorilla no it's strong Nana I'm still not strong yet I'm I'm babysitting that sucker I've been really doing more dab hitting and that's another thing as I was wigging out I was like oh god is this gonna work that's another thing I need to figure out so let me take this off this magnet because it's not magnet all right this is what I need to know right so I just twist this one this one is let's see if there's any dad in here first that would be Lauren Lily booth with smart you just go smart oh this is full you should never like ever have it that pole like ever like as a no I'm sorry I know that's annoying I can hear myself but you know what whatever I don't care yeah this is a really bad angle but you know what I don't care I'm living for it it's just my bills down low and I'm not gonna upward angle so you're getting all of this and I see that to Mike but it's okay it's okay all right I don't know if this thing has a preheat but usually a double-click is a preheat so I'm going to double click oh it turned to red and I swear I've not tried this yet you guys what just freaking happened oh my god oh my god alright that was [ __ ] crazy Oh Mike excuse my language I'm so sorry I'm just tripping out cuz I'm because I did something eyes I did something alright I didn't think that this was gonna preheat honestly I don't know why didn't try it in the car when I tried this in the car like just didn't dawn on me and I was still out looking for something that I can hit my dad's with because I'm on the go type of chick like I need something I need my at most like why did I wash it like on my birthday I was like really I ate like a a Corolla five like 5150 bar and it's like a cookie slash brownie and like I ate it and I don't know like I don't know what happened so listen I did something guys I'm gonna might as well just go ahead and make this a double video for I went out and I went to another um it's called Red River tobacco and I saw this and I thought this thing could probably do my dabs okay I know two machines I thought would have to replace my mouth okay anyways this really sold me because okay the feel of it it's metal its colorful like myself how did you turn it on see this is a tutorial in itself because bro I ain't even got this one charge just won't even come on but it's digital so we'll come back to this we'll come back to this and that's the magnet so it does it is magnetized this one is magnetized and that was another thing I was like oh but you know what else but you know what else like it's magnet right so when you put it in there it's gonna pop out like it's gonna be this tall poking out for a full gram so a half gram it like this is a half gram right and it will be low I thought was a half gram so this will do really good 1/2 grams but not full grams because the full grams are gonna pop out you can't lower it but same with this one you can't lower it it but this thing the reason why I don't like it and I just kept looking buy one head and bought it because I was dying to hit my cartridge if anybody knows when I'm saying put your hands oh cuz it was me I I totally needed to hit something I was driving it my co-workers crazy I was like I need to hit something you know what I mean anyways um so I can't believe that this is gonna hit a dab like I thought I was gonna have to I'm gonna put this down right here I'm gonna leave it right here in this box because this is another tutorial another day I just thought this was probably gonna be the one that I'm gonna have to hit my dad's with so that's another thing that I did get but this is what I'm using right now this thing right here and this is double click to preheat like everything else so I've ever read turned red and I like to hit it on a pre because it slowly heats up and that's how I take my dad's it's so freakin good this thing is a I was I was literally ready to rant okay y'all go out and get one of these this is freakin good let's look it and see what it looks like oh yeah this isn't Magnus see how's about to yank it out that's what I hate about it though for real like it's not magnetized you have to twist it in there and I'm afraid that this thing is going to break oh I'm doing something it's going to break it didn't burn it up it didn't turn black let me just it's like clear still you can still kind of see down in there I don't know if you can but I can down in there to the coil so winner winner chicken dinner awesome I'm excited so you just got a little sneak peek in this thing let me just tell you how much this sucker cost me thirty $2.99 and this thing was only $19.99 so like it was like twenty nine bucks or something bad are so what tax everything I don't know yeah it was 20 not 29 it was 20 186 at cloud nine for this thing right here so um cred and you got a cartridge this one didn't even come with a cartridge but we'll do it we'll do a box for Bill later when I figure this one out but right now I'm just gonna hang out with this one this one's pretty cool it came with the cartridge so I can play with that and then this the only the only issue I have is that it's not magnetized and when you put stuff in here I'm afraid that this part right here is just gonna break my cartridge because there's nothing holding it right here you see that that's the only issue I have with it that's why I went looking now I'm I'm really pleased with it so thanks for watching my crazy box reveal because I was also revealing it to myself that things weren't going it really I'm just upset that I washed this and it doesn't work and this metal piece came off and this that was attached to it one of these is now ruined and you know how full that one was just imagine how that one was full so everything's just run but now everything's a little better and I hope everybody else gets a little bit better oh and I also want to mention that I did do some commercial bills for work and I just shot a bunch of them out and I thought you know it would be really cool just to go ahead and bunch them all up and just and just show you guys it's I know it's a lot I watched it and I was like this is so stupid to share but I hadn't shared

32 look at this so look the part girls I'm gonna sign off by hitting my little pipe here this is the only part that'll change color and that crazy just the piss is the mouthpiece and I thought that would be really cool I found this at my I found this at my job I bought this at my job I was like oh my god there was only like a few of them so it was like pretty much limited edition for our store

and boys it's terabits from happy him in Durant Oklahoma", "XNhtRXU65js": "what's up guys today I'm going to be doing a little unboxing video and first impressions on the kind pen personal vaporizer so this is what the box looks like it's pretty sleek I like it tells you the features on the back the voltage it's got two point four two point eight and three point two so it says the kind pen on the charger it is really small it's got a little button right here so five clicks turn it on there are two kliks preheat three clicks changes the temperature I'm sorry I'm gonna see how how rips screw a cartridge on here real quick nice nice it rips yeah I would definitely recommend this pen I hope it holds up um it's silver so I'm sure it's gonna scratch a lot but yeah that's pretty much it guys I just want to do a little unboxing video you should check out the rest of my channel like comment subscribe appreciate it alright", "yKFhVKfEhxY": "hey what's going on youtube so it's back with another video today we got an unboxing for you today check it out we got the dank tank which is pretty dank and it looks like a little tank look this is what it looks like i got two of these a blue one and a black one i accidentally ordered the second one i wasn't even trying to order this until i got in the middle i was like oh [ __ ] might as well make a review on it so yeah before we get anything started let me get a hit off of this so i can see how it is or whatever yeah [Music] so yeah it's a pretty nice battery that was medium temp and before further ado let's unbox this [ __ ] content is being legally recorded in the state of oregon under measure 91 however this account is intended for mature audiences only thank you [Music] yeah it comes with this little leash right here or collar not a [ __ ] leash collar and then a charger and it comes with the battery of course which is nice look how small that is where it fits in your hand you can like hide that [ __ ] all right what's going on y'all see i saw the unboxing and i was going to show y'all everything right there but let me bring it back to this area so first of all what you got is the battery which is pretty small it's like the size of my [ __ ] palm as you can see and then it comes with a card and then you don't need to use this card you can use anything you want it doesn't matter but i just had a [ __ ] metal piece i was going to show you when it beat with that [ __ ] don't you run from me now yeah what the [ __ ] oh it's right here so it comes with this card it comes with this little magnetic piece that you put at the bottom of the cart and oh [ __ ] i didn't even realize that so the car actually comes with a another magnetic piece itself this is where you would put it boom hey yeah boom all right so check this out once you got your little battery you're gonna have this collar and then this basically goes like inside that little piece right here if y'all can see that i know y'all can see that so it would go in here right slide in through here and then once it's in through that little hole you put the collar thing into there voila so this is a dispensary battery let me see yeah it says truth truth dispensary and then we're gonna get a little comparison actually before we do that comparison let me take a quick little hey off of this and this car barely has anything that's like a little bit let me take a quick little hit off for this turn it on you press it five times one two three four five and then it's gonna be on red the red temp is the lowest you click it three times purple temp is medium and then three more times and blue is the hottest so let me see oh and then you sometimes you want to preheat it so you click it twice and then right now it's preheating you wait for that to finish it takes a couple little seconds that just gets the battery going gets the cart going yes already you can hit it while it's pre-hitting too but you should probably let it pre watch let me take a blanket if i can [Music] [Music] let me compare it see i can see the comparison between the thank tank and then a regular dispensary battery and y'all can see on my eye so this is on red temp okay a red tap on this one this is the hottest one so let me take a quick blinker off of this [Music] let me take this [Music] okay it's like so i couldn't even make this one blink on the hottest temperature so this definitely is more powerful but yeah overall this is a pretty good battery man it's not that expensive it's like 40 for this no 30 for the blue one and 40 for the black one i believe and it's a pretty good they're not like paying me or anything i'm not sponsored by them so if they would suck i would tell you they sucked but they don't it's pretty [ __ ] good y'all saw that for yourself the first blinker out of the box and it was all right this one it was not fully charged so it did not produce that big of a hit this one on the other hand is fully charged so we won't put that to the test one more time i was like is that ain't gonna blink god damn so yeah there you go man this car is passing by i'm high as [ __ ] yeah i can see this is a pretty good battery and i'll catch you in the next one make sure y'all stay tuned for my next video i'm pretty sure it's going to be the 4th of july video and excuse me for my [ __ ] nappy ass hair i'm gonna get a haircut soon my next video i'm having a nice very good it's gonna be dope video for the 4th of july make sure you stay tuned make sure you like subscribe comment you'll have a blessed recipe", "AU9xCInDxsY": "that's the way it should be charging you got the red light here and you at the red light there so if you ever have a problem with that's not charging correctly Kate up your fingernail or something or a small screwdriver and go in between here so you don't want to go in between these two here make sure it's unplugged and just loosen up the terminal a little flat spot in the middle where you put two connectors connect going to have to pull that up a little bit don't pull it too hard but gentle with it and hopefully that will actually loosen it up so let me contact don't start charging again like this if you're having a problem turning this battery on go ahead and tap it four times real quick or five times real quick and that's the code to go ahead and turn that back on this battery has an on/off code with it that I was in the web and what I did was I pushed it real quick five times more so that the battery died completely it will turn itself off so you have to turn it back on so to turn this back on hit this part right here you just fully charge it and then tap it four or five times really quick and then push it and should work and should come back on that's the way to turn these vapors figure it back on the batteries hope you've enjoyed this have a great day enjoy bacon", "qykLlHIbX3c": "hey what's good everybody jay ping here checking in live respectmyregion.com wanted

is all about the bug so I have here today the bug by Meg vapor this is a little sig alike battery you can get this whole kit for around $35 and I will leave a link below to where you can check it out if you're interested after I take a look at it here and it does come in a whole bunch of different colors of course I've got the pink one but it also comes in yellow black silver blue as well as purple that box is kicking my ass ok so here it is and it comes with just a charge port it has the micro USB to USB cord and here is the device itself it is a 22 watt device and it has a 1,100 milliamp hour battery it's a stainless steel construction with colored paint over it here is the fire button here is the charge port this is the tank which is top fill and holds 2 mils this is a cap that prevents leaking and it's great for your purse because then you don't get dust in there and I think that is magnificent it is magnetic so the coil that this comes with is a point 8 ohm coil oh my goodness look hi so I left the door open again like you guys suggested and look who's come to visit this has a couple of protection features actually quite a few it has low voltage protection charging protection short-circuit protection ten-second cut-off protection oh my gosh ties over temperature protection overcharge protection just to name a few tabs come on what to do I'd kick them out right now but you guys would like no let him play so so I'm gonna go ahead and fill this up it is a top film my god I can't hold you I can't watch right now baby also to fill it you just unscrew the top it's super easy oh my gosh Tess is back and you fill right in there so I'm going to fill this up with some milky cone vapery e liquid I love their vanilla bean and TAS is back on my lap this is a 510 threaded tank and it does come off of the battery like so I'm seriously like I'm not even gonna do like he's just gonna have to keep interrupting the video so you guys can see like exactly why I was more wanting him to be kicked out but then he was crying this is this is what you guys wanted all right okay so I got Taz down for a second got this filled up I'm gonna let it wick up five clicks turns it on it does have a few small airflow holes on this side you can hear it but it is not adjustable be that circle and that circle those are where the airflow comes in I think besides the bag goes pink and small my favorite part about this is loop that cap to keep all the funky stuff in the bottom of my purse out of the drip tip I love this I'm excited I haven't had a signal like a small one like a good one in a long time I think still to this day my favorite is the makes it clear fusion little sig legs because I haven't had new ones that were great except for that one and V 2 and halo they make some pretty good signal like batteries to that I tried in the past but this one came out a few months ago super excited so here we go ooh also to mention all those other siga like batteries that i've tried were not sub owned this one is the first sub ohm sit alike that I'm trying I mean that's a pretty big cloud for such a little thing but see that was like I was taking big drags like I do off my coupe D and stuff if I had this battery I'd probably be more of quick tighter drawers because it's a galactic I don't know I can't remember how long I used to take a drag of a cigarette but it was probably a lot shorter than the inhales that I use on a vaporizer and this is sub-ohm so you can't really you can hit it like that but you know you got a lot of airflow for this little guy these two holes like if you wanted more siga like feel you'd have to maybe have like one blocked like I said it's sub-ohm so you don't really hit it like a single egg but even still that's me hitting it like a cig like it kind of feels weird the airflow is so huge but that works either way really but it is something like you're gonna want a cellphone but like I would this is what I would recommend to a smoker looking to switch because it's just you know it's newer technology and then a few years ago for my old favorites and it comes in awesome colors it does have a bigger battery than those super small signal lights I think like the largest one was nine hundred million power and but this isn't a very big battery compared to like you know when I use my coop do within 18 650 in it but still I think that this would be a great for a beginner or even one step up from like a sigil like I can definitely use this for a month and let you guys know what I think I'm pretty sure this one is just gonna go in my purse regardless of the one with the update or not but I will leave a link below to where you can check these out for yourself if you've tried the bug let me know down in the comments and I'm pretty sure it's like the bug cause it's just so little right so that's it for today's video I hope you guys enjoyed if you did give it a thumbs up and feel free to

and sticks this little devices of the newest oil pen from China based manufacturer y'okay inside the package you'll find one yoke and sticks to load your unit first unscrew the oil chamber mouthpiece from the top then be sure to unscrew the base connector the base connector is simply for storing extra filled pods so keep it in a safe place load your oil into the chamber and then screw back directly onto the coil we suggest doing this upside down for obvious reasons once you have completed this you are ready to go the sticks has three temperature settings that you can cycle between by pressing the power button three times rapidly red is low green is medium and blue is high to wrap this up I'd like to tell you about some of the key features of the yoke and sticks that make it a great oil pen the yoke and sticks is incredibly discreet the pen shape allows you to keep it in a pocket or bag and use it stealthily when you're out and about it is tiny and entirely concealed by your hand the second is the sticks design the pod design is great you can fill up extra pods and take them on the go I also love the charge report on the bottom it just makes this budget unit look really sleek the third is the yoga and sticks ease-of-use one button operation and easy loading make this a great starter or stealth unit all in all the oaken sticks is a great oil pen that is perfect for any stealthy on-the-go connoisseur I'm Alex 40 vape TV we hope you enjoyed this video and found it useful please like and subscribe if we helped you out and for all you connoisseurs out there keep vaping [Music]", "pWC_z5Xt3J8": "[Music] bro yo what's going on everyone it is your boy max our true in today people today what I have for you guys is I'm going to be doing a product review I was gonna say and we're doing I'm proud of you but I'm gonna be doing a product review on these dispensary pen sonica these are the there we go these are the rx green dispensary pens it's just like you're just like your typical dispensary wax pen you would find whenever you would walk into a dispensary or an extremely cheap Waxman you can find online I think they run for about like twenty five thirty dollars forty you know somewhere around there and then I know if you are buying them in the dispensary they run for about like twenty-five dollars at least that's what I got these for were 25 bucks but yeah so anyway I thought I would do a little review on these rippln tell you know give you a little bit of a pros and cons about these so yeah let's turn these on so it's your standard 5 clicks on and honestly you don't have to wait for it to heat up or anything like that as soon as you hit the 5 clicks you can start ripping these leaks buckets smack man now let's move into that pros and cons list so starting off with the pros because there are a lot more pros and cons with these things so starting off the pros is these things [ __ ] smack did you guys just see that [ __ ] cloud I did em Plus this is only on the second temperature because there's three temperatures on these which is another pro there's three temperatures on these even change the temperatures on though but there's green blue and in red I really don't know the temperature you know exactly but there's green blue and red I have mine on blue because I feel like red is just a little bit too hot for me produces big-ass clouds I'll do a red for you guys they produce really fat clouds I have it on red I think yeah yeah I did it so let me let's take a rip on the red [ __ ] hitting y'all see this oh I forgot to tell you what I'm smoking on my bed am but I'm smoking on this pan the one I just ripped I'm smoking on some the chroma plus and as well as your little cartridges and hens sometimes they will come something like this you know this is just it comes in then it has all the stuff on it on the back and whatever so there's that and then on the other one that I'm going to actually rip start ripping thinks you have my bed damnit I just changed the temperature to right but whatever and then this one is the OG Kush both indicas this one is like the additionally really chirpy enriched I really like this one what one do I like more I would have to say I don't know flavor-wise I really like the chroma plus a little bit more but I have to say F X Y is the OG Kush definitely um I don't know I just like to feel him a little bit better it's like it's it's like the chroma pluses is like an indica hybrid you know well the OG Kush is just an indica you know what I mean do [ __ ] with them hybrids but I don't know I'm just runnin like more like a heavy indica right now so let's get rippin on this OG Kush yes telling you these these puppets not so they produce really good clouds I mean they they're cheap they well what are some other pros come on max I literally just had a [ __ ] list of pros and now that I'm getting baked I'm starting to [ __ ] forget them and [ __ ] struggles they are discrete too so I mean if you're just looking at this you know you're just hitting that [ __ ] out in public or whatever I don't think anyone's gonna be like my god that's a [ __ ] wax pen like you smoking we wait like like people are gonna be doing that [ __ ] I honestly think they would be a little bit more sleek if it did come in like a black or whatever or in like different colors I feel like that'd be cool bubs I mean they only had the [ __ ] graves when I went to go and get them so I mean nonetheless they are still pretty nice I really like them they're extremely portable fit in your hand easily fit and like a [ __ ] pocket or some [ __ ] like that you know like you know put two of them in there got my sweatpants on but yeah you see that like super discreet so and I can even like their own [ __ ] booty pocket right there so you know what I mean like they're definitely discreet I [ __ ] with these pens I really like them they're cheap and they work so [ __ ] well another thing what had to be umm the [ __ ] battery life on this [ __ ] it lasts for so long I forgot to charge these things you know a few days you know or some [ __ ] or whoa a few days no I forgot to charge these things like a few times my bed and honestly if I forget to charge on one night I can still go through the whole day you're not smoking in and just because I'm trying you know what I mean but I mean it's just when you start getting to those like consecutive days of forgetting to charge it then that's when it will eventually you know it'll run out of power eventually but they do have a really lasting battery life you know so that's what's up [ __ ] with these things let's take a double rip because of that cheers guys let's get it double rip [Music] fat clouds you see fat clothes so now let's move on to the cons with these things these dad pens there are there aren't really that many cons you know so let's just move right into them so one kind of this thing is that if you are using it a lot back-to-back you know just keep on puffing that [ __ ] it does get really hot at the mouth as you can see it's like [ __ ] metal or whatever so that shit's gonna get hot if you're using it a lot you know so that [ __ ] sucks I wish I had like a rubber like attachment you know or something like that that you could put on cuz I think this thing screws off no but looks like it but it doesn't [ __ ] screw off so anyway if they had like a rubber piece on this or you know something that just didn't get hot work a lot better another thing is that the [ __ ] charged life so when you are charging these things I know I kind of said it before but it does take a hell a long time to get these things charged do you feel me so I don't know but those are like the only cons I could really think of this thing to cons out of all the both all the - yeah - cons out of all the pros I gave gave gave blood blood let's push it tell you guys get yourself one of these Lisa where do you get the cartridges from I got them from the dispensary I know you can get them from like smoke shops I know they have like CBD cartridge shits you know so you could use that so yeah damn I'm feeling hella good low key can't feel my body that's the Sun I hope you guys enjoyed this video I hope this video helped but thank you guys so much for tuning in I appreciate that [ __ ] stay in the clouds guys oh [ __ ] actually don't forget to leave a like comment and subscribe there we go now stay in the clouds it's hot as [ __ ] in my room I'm sweating so therefore I'm out", "Xgp2C3GJTY8": "introducing the

got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "WwUKzRggkSI": "introducing the phase Genesis series vaporizer this vaporizer kit is a great option for anyone looking to get into vaping from beginner to more advanced users the kit is offered in a

button five times you will see the batteries powered on by the flashing light once the flashing light has come on the user can then set the voltage to the desired level for their particular ejuice by twisting the dial on the bottom of the battery once the voltage has been set the user can then go ahead and press the e-liquid power button and go ahead and vaporize that liquid to recharge the

that's complete the user can then just unscrew the battery put the tank back on ice cream on counter clockwise and the pen is done ready for you sir", "DLEvtmGGWsg": "hello my name is tom from b2 squared and today we're gonna be looking at the you can't sticks it does come in five colors you have red black silver blue and orange which is the one that we're gonna be looking at today very simple packaging little information about the device a breakdown of the product and some quick instructions so let's take it out it is very small and light and as you can see it in my hand here and it's not very large either on the bottom it does have the micro USB charging port and the charging light indicator you will have to provide your own micro USB charging cable for this it does come with an atomizer and a oil cap this is a ceramic atomizer and this top piece is in glass it is plastic but what's nice about this when you unscrew it first when you get it this cap is sealed off so you could fill up a couple of these and take them with you and they wouldn't leak but to fill them up and to use it you would have to unscrew this plastic cap fill it up and then screw it on top of the atomizer and you just need to kind of hold onto this cap to take it with you on the go but looking at this the nice thing about this is it's inexpensive and it's a great battery for prefilled cartridges so I have a prefilled cartridge here and it is 510 threaded so just screws right on to power on the device you press the fire button five times rapidly so one two three four five and it is flashing you let it know that it's long this does have three voltage settings so you have green which is the lowest and to change that you press the button three times rapidly so one two three and now we're on blue which is the middle setting and then we're going to turn it on the highest setting by pressing the button three times rapidly and we're on red which is the highest voltage setting so that is nice that it is adjustable depending on the type of oil that you are using in it but other than that it's just a nice light inexpensive battery if you need something quick to take with you check the description for a coupon code and have a great day", "d-CQWkbLw-o": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the cannabis Somali eh I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of product reviews today I have a wonderful product I've put it to the test I've been using it relentlessly for the last couple of weeks and I'm really excited to unbox and show you another one what is it it's a 510 threaded vape battery and it's from vessel the people at talk belief were nice enough to hook me up with two of these at lift and I am absolutely in love with this unit to be very honest with you I've been looking for an upgraded 510 thread battery for a while I've been using the classic C cell battery for quite a bit of time now I have lots and lots of them lying around lots of different carts doing R&D and I'm gonna tell you all the benefits of this because it is really quite great so let's get into the unboxing you can see this is custom branded four top leaf and it's really nice nice packaging 20:19 vessel brand powered by vessel dadada performance air intake smart battery plus LED indicator three power settings two point eight volts three point two volts and three point 6 volts long lasting 240 milliamp battery we'll get back to that magnetic charging port all fantastic designed for people who know built by people who care the craftsmanship and performance of your top leave vessel is obvious from the moment you pick it up fits most 510 threaded vapes there's a one-year warranty and again this is made for top leaf sundial so let's cut into it it's got the shrink wrap on it which is really nice and these batteries are 79 to 100 dollars on their website I think they're on sale right now got the handy dandy corkscrew knife go [Applause] Thanks packaging sleeve vessel that's our actual vessels this is the you know custom branded one here's the box they all come in this is the black and gold and that's what it looks like as soon as you open it underneath the lid underneath the lid we have the warnings 5-volt or they're only press the button five times to turn off three times two cycle power levels for additional information visit vessel brand but there's really nothing more than that it is a simple ease of use piece of technology which is great get started charge we recommend fully charging your device before first use blinking red lights charging no lights fully charged low and remove the black cartridge and replace the you choice of top leave 510 thread cartridge you not overtighten the cartridge you can use any 510 thread cartridge enjoy power on and off with five rapid clicks press and hold the button your inhale three times spree rapid clicks helpful tips start the lowest setting with any chalk leaf oil your device will power down after 15 minutes charger that the duck tada and that's French because we're in Canada nope our neighbor will say even though I see it absolutely every single day here's our unit really really beautiful unit I really like the color scheme of this one the talked leaf black and gold is really slick you can see that they put the top leaf custom branding on it so a really nice piece of technology it looks very handsome this is the black and gold to me is very manly I really really like this piece it's like a nice pen for me it's like holding a bought Blanc pan or something really really slick so sitting in here just like this this is our unit behind there we have that piece and then we have the charging cable let's check out the charging cable first there's nothing left in that box there's nothing under there that's just a piece that's our box nice box so our charging cable is proprietary it's a magnetic charging cable and what's really interesting about this is that it actually attaches to the bottom because if you've experienced any other 510 threaded cart the only way you can charge these is by twisting it into this port I'm looking for a charger on my desk somewhere like this you have to take your card out now with the vessel there is no taking your card out you can actually hit it while it's charging and you have this nice magnetic port and you can twist that down and it locks it in pretty good not all the way I haven't found a complete lock with that to be very honest with you but I like that aside from it being proprietary which is always a hard thing with charging cables I personally hate proprietary charging cables but this one's pretty cool yeah I hope you won't lose it it's nice and magnetic it's pretty slick and that's how it charges now on to the rest of the unit this is where your cart goes it unscrews do not use this one it's just a burner in its place but what you can see about the unit and what I really like is if it focuses that's probably best there's air holes there's one two three four air holes right down here and these air holes allow for a really really beautiful pull absolutely beautiful to be completely honest I told you I had two so I have one right here I'm just gonna turn it on five presses let's see if this comes charged oh box yeah and it's on the lowest setting there you can see and I can do one two three you know change colors one two three now we have it on green and let's just uh you can see how nice the clouds are and the rip is so nice there's so much air coming through it so what I love about it I'll take this off and we'll put it on the other one just to show you what's going on and how great it works so I'm really a big fan of this unit not a paid endorsement at all just love the unit there it is with the fresh battery right out of the box you know it comes charged out of the box which is nice big things that I found with this battery with this with this fantastic unit is even though the C cell battery claims to be a 310 milliamp this battery actually has it claims to have smart technology and it's a 240 milliamp battery but it's battery-powered that's more efficiently being used and I really have found that with this battery I've been able to smoke a half car at half you know probably 75 puffs if not close to 100 puffs maybe 75 I don't want to exaggerate too much out of the pen before it needs to be recharged and it's really great what I've also noticed is the cartridge itself is not getting hot I often notice with this battery if I have two or three puffs if it cartridge gets really hot and the unit itself shuts down this unit I can rip it over and over again well I wasn't too big of a pup and it doesn't get overly hot the flavor stays great stays consistent and big thing about that air is it actually is really giving me a much better flavor it's not getting as hot I'm getting more air and I'm finding I'm getting bigger vapor clouds I really really enjoy everything about it so the airflow the design absolutely beautiful the way that the battery works that technology and the battery is fantastic but it's because it really is making everything last longer from my cart to the actual battery life love how slick it looks what else can I say about it I think it's a great unit the only knock is the proprietary charger but I see why they did the proprietary charger so that you could use your vape while it's charging and that you didn't have to screw in and screw out your vape dealing with all that nonsense just to charge really really cool really cool unit for a hundred bucks if you use carts all the time 510 thread carts this is the thing to get they have lots of different styles very feminine looking ones very masculine looking ones really enjoy this unit that's my review you know what 9 out of 10 haven't found anything wrong with it yet the way it would be 10 out of 10 is if it had and app and I could control to the exact degree what temperature the car was being vaporized with and seeing all of my data and my analytics behind the scene that's the only way this would be 10 out of 10 is if it had Bluetooth and it was connected to my phone 9 out of 10 loved the vessel battery if you smoke a lot of cards I definitely think you should get one thank you so much for watching I hope you make sure to LIKE comment share and subscribe and until next time Cheers what's my name what's my name the cannabis Somali yay", "JcIEk6hKpww": "yo hey guys and welcome back to my channel it's your boy real matty smokes and today i got

very very confident of and like I said it's the wolf another little fact that I found out is that this actual device right here is also the manufacturer of lomar device so not only do they make this one they actually was making the famous first and then they took off into this game right here in came up with this handy device and on the back as you can see steals the motorcycle rollin professionalism or you know to keep it live anything less but on the package says it fits any cartridge so that means that you could put a seashell or ceramic oil or any other devices onto this little bad boy right here and also it comes with actually will see sell cartridge right here in the packaging which I'm going to show you and you can hook this up or fill it up with your oils or whatever and

let's do that spin test oh this is tiny and I should probably be doing this earth unboxing with tweezers nothing we did on the back there nothing on the side let's just open this box up see what we're getting and that's it that box is empty in a little bag it's got the yoke and lo going down there and the bomb it's got your free light indicator it's got the cold o at the top there nothing on this side nothing really at about just a bit of pen nothing on this side there you've got a little we can put a little lanyard for etc little strap holder there's that on the bomb you've got your micro USB charger it does not come with a micro USB but I'm sure you've got 152 of the line and there's the top that is a little spring-loaded pin there I believe is yeah that's a little spring-loaded pin just there and there's the top of your little tiny modern he's absolutely tiny look just for example he's a big pin that's a big is too a big pin it's absolutely tiny and so free clips you can change your voltage on this click it three times you get one so you've got it on a week setting three times again you've got on two three times again you've got it on free you don't just come in ready also comes in black blue and white [Music] [Music] there you go Saudi unboxing a disco dude just just do a quick size comparison because I only did it with a big boy I mean that unboxing this is locking everyday more this is like you revenge assault or sighs yeah your smock what's it called alien escapes or sighs look it look it look at the size look at the size of it that's just showing you air small this is this is just a tank a normal sized tank it's a tiny little mod is one getting that it's absolutely tiny obviously you don't get that you have to buy it you have to buy something that's got a 510 at the bottom but just before anyone asks it won't work like this you can't put a big old tank on it and use it like that it would be pretty cool if you could use it like that you can't well just I'm just go it just flashes it it's too much you can't buy a big tank on it I just want it to show that but you can if you buy diesel II all sort of tanks that you can do you can vape your oils with you can put just normal a liquid in you can put high VG low VG little tiny I don't know what these things clear and Wiser's are they called something like that you just need to buy these this have a quick vape it's giving me a really nice fight I don't know what the voltage is but you can adjust it so you quickly press it three times and you're going to medium mode you've quickly press it in you're going to didn't do it three taps you're going to you get a free thing slashing you're on full power I've turned it off five pigs turn off did I say that but with one one full power mode you can pre warm the coil you can do all that sort of stuff that was just pre-warming the clue so I'm on two or three you on three now I like it you can pre warm the coil perfect for CBD oils vite vite CB deals and all that sort of stuff let's go over a few things I like about this not one it's 400 mah battery that's got 400-mile in it that's pretty impressive in a tiny little thing like that that's got 400-mile batteries I like it you can adjust the power was sitting on it you don't get USB in the box but we've got loaded in so they're trying to cut costs it's all made of plastic and they're trying to cut cost we don't get one of them in a box but you don't really need one you are nice spring-loaded top of the thing it's tiny it fits it's smaller than my finger looks my little finger look it's smaller than my little finger I think it's really good I can't fault it is faked on me it's worked and faint every time I press the bun they puff the vape it's not failing this quite incident when we press the bun I don't know if you can either button being pressed and then the vape it's quite interesting at a vaping it's good it's good yo Ken well done on this little tiny minute just still faking modest and absolute tiny one but I like it I love it they're colored stuff coming you've seen all the colors they're quite bright and bold colors but at least just the standard white and is the standard BlackBerry's a bluing is of red no Jochen pretty good the logo looks a little bit like YouTube as well did you see the logo it does look a little bit like YouTube yo Ken thanks for sending these out I overcome in this get one if you asked a little tiny one like that it's not much better you can buy for that and these are these are the reasonably priced off the top made of can't remember the price but they are really reasonably priced this they're cheap I said they're really cheap quite a little few things that will point out even though I was joking about you don't come with a USB cable you have to put that down as a con it don't come with a USB cable people might buy this some people might not have a USB micro USB cable it don't come with them you need a cable to charge it so without a cable it is a bit pointless because it runs out of charge when it runs out of charge if you ain't got cable but I can see why they've done its run it cut costs you don't get a cable resuming everyone has a cable I think everyone has a cable when an USB micro USB but I'm just putting it out it has to go down there's a con because you don't capable also you've got to put your own tanks on it you've got find to these tanks you can buy these saw thanks I'll put a link you can find all these sort of tanks on Amazon literally vape shops dese or tanks perfect for CBD oils a liquid I've just got standard mini liquid in that just a standard mean and it's vaping it absolutely lovely I've know folks would a vapor look at the vapor production for Miss Li or fee you may have to lung it you can direct along it but that all comes down to the little atomizer finger or clear and wise or wherever they want to call that on there it all does come down to that no it's pretty decent it's a decent little tiny mod and I think yo can you've done well with that you've done will join me later on in this week for more yoga and products you can put a lanyard finger on it as well they didn't come with that ba has got the little wall so you could hang it from your neck etc there's not much really I can say this bad about it and it's not much really I'll comfort to be honest with you like I say you have to point out a bit so I don't come with a USB cable I don't get but you have to point it out it's got light on it you can adjust the power at the wattage very decent tiny little mod if I can think of a member the price it will be on the screen there just so you can see I can't remember there will not be no link to yo Ken's website unfortunately YouTube won't allow me to put one but there

silo okay I start by sliding this box open inside here will have the silo battery pull this guy out under this little cover here is gonna be the micro USB charger that's included along with the cartridge battery adapters and inside here we'll have an instruction sheet ok I'm just going to sit this guy side here alright we're going to start with the micro USB charger that's included it'll plug into the bottom of the back better here plug into any standard micro USB adapter you have at home generally speaking it takes approximately our to fully charge the silo silo does have a 550 milliamp battery and usually lasts about 5 to 7 days as a right one of thing all right so this aside here and these are gonna be the cartridge adapters will be scripts to the bottom the cartridge pop one out ok so this guy over there next one alright the silent does work with either a full gram or a half gram cartridge it does work with about 90% of the carts on the market even the ones have an extra-long tall fluted mouthpiece not the only ones that won't work with this it has a large decorative ring around the bottom collar here ok now we're going to go ahead and screw this little battery adapter on get that guy until it stops and all we're gonna do is simply drop this cartridge in and then all we to do is inhale the silent is an auto draw battery it does not have an on/off switch or a press when activate all you do is inhale and go here we go sila does come in six colors pink black blue gray electroplating gold and and ice red if you have any questions you can reach us on our website our website is www.seannal.com", "MtycvhOOWjw": "hello today I'm going to be showing you guys the hit boom Plus which I'm going to tell you more about exactly what that is enough the viet boom plus is the new generation of electronic box this is a dry vaporizer that would be a hit in a group setting or individuals it functions like a steamroller and helps conserve dry product in addition the viet woman comes with accessories like an additional water filtration system and more two cups besides it's solid construction and also comes as a ten-year work so i have it um pitched out here in front of me because it comes in pieces when you first get it and i'm going to show you guys how to put it together and use it in two guys what i think of it so the first thing you need isn't a battery i'm using an mi are 18 650 batteries and the batteries don't come with this they come separately so um you put in your battery and then close it and if your batteries put in right this button right here should be flashing at you and then the next thing is your full piece that looks like that your focus on chamber and that you just fill with your product take your other chamber and put it like that that way you're a lot because if you get the other people close it and then the next thing is this your carburetor and other filter just push that right on top and then you push this one which is your water filter right on top and then you take your plastic covering and on top of that and then it's all set up and then you to turn on press this button five times and it's going to turn right and when it's white it means that it's cooking and heating up your meat inside and green means you're ready to go so go ahead and start hitting it and then the clear is your carburetor filter right here and in quick big hitter okay so what I love about the video booth was that it gives you a fat it and it's like it's a vaporizer it looks exactly like a bong hit so you're not going to get the full harshness if you were to like smokeable with a beating bladder like a regular boss you get really smooth vaporized hit I'm sorry I'm so dying this however it does give you really bad ah alright okay okay um the other things that I don't really like about this though is that there's so many pieces too and I don't know if I was like having to take it all apart detectable like all the time I don't know I just think it'd be kind of annoying but honestly the high from it's amazing it's it's basically a wrong and I just think it's almost a little more convenient than a barn because they so many pieces even though I just had a good mind off but that's basically in about this and i would recommend this product to anyone who is a bong or vaporizer lover even I bet vaporizer on people who are in the baby would love this house so you guys shall check it out", "SI8Tu9-wh6g": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]"}
