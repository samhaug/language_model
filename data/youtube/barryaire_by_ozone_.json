{"F09aZ2QNEp4": "[Music] what's up everybody welcome to another cannabis critique today we are talking about berry air this one is from ascend wellness off the ozone line it's a hybrid and from my research it is a cross of blueberry and white widow it comes in at 15 thc let's get in to the breakdown on the berry air ah the look of this one is kind of exotic it's got like a lot of colors going on and it's more on the darker side of things it's got some like greens some some dark greens some light greens uh it's got some orange hairs of course and then it's got like purple and black uh running through the buds there was one bud i had that was basically solid black i've never seen a weed like that before but i have heard of it and uh i think overall the look was relatively good this was another very very dry strain dry batch from ozone unfortunately uh the buds were brittle and kind of they were brittle but they were they were nice and dense so take that for what you will i gave it an 8.6 out of 10 for the look the smell of this one has like that weird like baked goods type of smell like it's kind of like vanilla-y a little bit and it's kind of a little bit funky as well it's not my favorite smell in the world and it wasn't like super pungent either i gave it an 8.1 out of 10. uh the breakup of this one not too much to say about it very dry buds so it's very easy to break up you put it in your grinder like take like a quarter turn and the whole bun is just disintegrated into smokeable material uh i gave it an 8.5 out of 10 on the breakup the high on this one i'd describe as like a mild indica it only comes in at 15 so obviously it's not super super strong it kind of makes you a little bit sleepy it definitely makes you hungry you will be munching out when you smoke this stuff but it is a very mild high it is one i'd recommend for beginners uh if you're a seasoned smoker like myself you might find yourself smoking a little bit more than usual to achieve your normal results so for those reasons i gave the high a 7.7 out of 10. the taste on this one is pretty much non-existent i think that has to do with uh it being so dry i was a little bit painful to smoke but not like super cough inducing which is good for a dryer bud and you got a little bit of that like vanilla sweetness going on uh with the taste but it didn't really like smack you in the face or anything you had to really go searching for it i gave the taste a 7.5 out of 10. so overall that will bring the score of the barrier to 8 out of 10 and even 8 out of 10. i think that's a an accurate score for this one i'd say it's a weaker indica hybrid uh it's not going to overwhelm you so it'd be good for uh a newer user a new new user to cannabis and i think it honestly would be good for medical i think a lot of people get a report pain relief from this one and it will definitely help you sleep so if you're looking for that check out the berry air from ascend wellness and i gotta give them a little bit of credit because while their flour i don't think is as good as some other cultivators they do put their flower actually on sale i was able to get this eighth for 45 bucks so when you factor that in maybe it's worth it for you guys to pick up the berry air if you enjoyed this cannabis critique be sure to like comment and subscribe for more", "xYY7VHpgzWc": "how you doing welcome to dan's buddha bodega where today i'm gonna rip ozone a new [ __ ] let's just get right to it [Music] that's right folks today we're gonna be going over ozone's berry air popcorn now let me get the one good thing out of the way barrier popcorn is an indica heavy hybrid that crosses blue dream with girl scout cookies and that's about the end of the good [ __ ] now why am i so pissed off well let me try to explain it so i'm about to get metaphorical up in this [ __ ] okay i want you to imagine that you're an acrobat except instead of a regular acrobat you are an acrobat that only has one eye because we can't really see what we're getting and no arms because once we slip we're [ __ ] and you're getting ready to walk a tightrope 500 feet in the air now stay with me a tightrope that is our quality product and we're forced to navigate you know what we ignore more force to navigate you know this this very thin slice of of good dependable product and to our left is the pit of [ __ ] quality and to our right is the bottomless pit of bankruptcy just as you think you gotta handle norms and just as you think you got a handle on this tightrope thing here comes a 600 pound pissed off silverback gorilla climbing up and he starts to shoot the [ __ ] wire like he's [Music] that pissed off gorilla represents cultivators like ozone okay ozone that just take good strains good solid strains and just screws them all up man just turns them into agricultural abortions now back to barrier popcorns when it comes to odor with this one there's a very very faint scent of citrus almost no smell at all and as far as looks go it looks pretty good i mean light greens dark greens purples red hairs large resin glands and you're saying damn this looks good what the hell is your problem and you'd be right this looks amazing but as with many strains looks aren't everything because this is what i got from three miniature buds gross all right guys here we go with the jilla because i can't get rid of this stuff fast enough uh nostrovia slanted cheers salute prost wish me luck oh oh barrier more like derriere because it tastes like i'm sucking an [ __ ] oh so right up front i'm getting wood like uh i just walked into home depot picked up a 2x4 and just took a big bite seriously wood and this time it tastes more like charcoal and fire but man this is just not pleasant it's harsh it tastes funny each hit is an increasing level of nasty this is a nasty mess let's give it some time and see if i get anything other than a headache nope headache central but it's not a surprise with the amount of seeds and pollen sags in there a headache was unavoidable overall barrier might be a good strain maybe from a different cultivator or even in full cola but ozone's barrier popcorns is a really good indicator of how they feel about patients and their standards well guys that just about does it for me here i'd like to thank all my friends family viewers subscribers lovers haters thumbs uppers thumbs downers i'd like to say thank you for all of the uh the comments likes dislikes i i love it all um thank you for the steady increase of in subscribers which is awesome thank you guys and as always thanks for the view", "46tz5r2Hi2E": "[Music] what's going on guys keep calm back with another video and in this one i am excited i haven't seen anything like this in my dispensary and it's pretty much a chillum pre-packed with 0.3 this is some berry air it's only testing out at fifteen point four nine percent fifteen point six percent but it's looking pretty good i'm excited to bust this open go ahead and crack open this seal how are you guys doing today hope you guys are having a good day so we open up comes in this tube all right first thing i notice this comes off the sticker and there's weed all on it but uh all right [Music] let's go ahead and unscrew this i guess that's how you're supposed to do it all right i'm not getting really too much of a smell so let me know these guys are smoking on down below and uh go ahead and give this a taste test [Music] cheers [Music] okay it's pretty smooth i like how the smoke stays in there it's not just pouring out like it should or it usually does normal ones um and one thing i forgot to mention these are 0.3 and the chillms these retail at 10 so it's one of those price points to where it's like it's not that bad to throw out ten dollars if it doesn't work out you know but at the end you do get to chill them glass chill it's not super thick but it's definitely not you know china glass so that's good we'll go ahead and rip this again yeah i mean it it's smooth it doesn't have too much taste it almost has like a berry a fruity berry like almost like a wild berry type of how that berry very matter of fact it's almost more like a blue dream how has that blueberry [Music] i would say blueberry with the with the hint of hazy [Music] yeah it's not too bad you know if you're on the run you're having a walk you're on the drive anything like that i feel like it uh definitely can be a quick little smoke you know instead of getting a pre-rolled this or that is something that you can get very convenient easy

"yj2Yj1kID2w": "hey again everybody this is cannacentric films and i'm back at you with another flower review today i've got my hands on some candy og from ascend it's part of their ozone line now most of you probably are aware that at least the word on the street is that ozone line products are actually ascends rebranded cookie strains because ascend is the cultivator here in illinois that has a partnership with cookies from on the west coast there's definitely a lot of hype that surrounds that brand i'm not saying it's not a quality brand i just don't have any experience with it but it's definitely hyped up for sure that's all to say that i don't know the genetics on this candy og unfortunately there's a lot of people that speculate which uh ozone line strains are equivalent to which cookie strains i don't know which one this candy og would be if you happen to know please do let me know i'm curious but yeah without further ado let's get to the categories and check this stuff out i will say i'm doing my darndest to be completely objective in this review um not have too many preconceived biases going in despite a lot of negative publicity that has surrounded ascend and ozone understandably because someone apparently found a moth in their sealed eighth it was an ozone line eighth i saw the picture on discord and reddit and it got very very widely shared and so with all that considered i'm doing my darndest here to provide you good people of youtube a super objective review of this ozone flower and not going to have any preconceived biases to the best of my ability this stuff looks better than most stuff i come across from a majority of cultivators here in illinois dense nuggets and a nice trim and manicure you can see i have a pretty hefty nug here which is a treat to see given the trend of very tiny nuggets in most legal medical aids these stays it felt sufficiently squishy and moist to me i'd honestly give this stuff a 9 out of 10 for looks not too much to complain about it's tricky fairly colorful and very structurally hefty nugs if this was indeed intended to be a cookie strain it would kind of make sense it has that sort of exotic look to it a very strong doughy aroma to this stuff pre-breakdown honestly some of the stronger initial aroma from stuff i've seen or i guess i should say smelled in a while it's not particularly sweet or savory smelling but it does have the dough and yeast smell of a lot of gelato cuts usually this kind of external smell is met with a really gassy skunk type aroma on the breakdown but unfortunately the aroma doesn't go there in this case kind of an herbal and grass-like smell which ultimately let me down this was a rare instance where the bud smelled better and stronger before being ground down all that considered to give the smell a 7 out of 10. home curing was definitely helpful with this stuff in terms of improving the quality of the smoke initially all i was getting was hay terps just a nasty burnt grass taste that didn't necessarily feel like a super harsh smoke but just tasted so bad that i developed an aversion to it but a week of home curing when i would open the jar like once a day or so you know just check it out um it really brought out a more tolerable flavor but ultimately was a very earthy and soil like flavor at the end of the day and one of the less impressive smokes of 2020 for me to be honest just because of the taste it wasn't a super harsh smoke but it was just not good tasting to me at all i'd give this stuff a 6 out of 10 for flavor sometimes a foul tasting smoke can really overshadow my enjoyment of the effects and admittedly that occurred a little bit with this stuff i'd say in general though the archetype of my experience was smoke a couple bowls worth which a couple bowls is a little more than it normally takes to medicate me if i'm smoking really good wheat but anyway smoke a couple bowls worth be grumpy about the bitter grassy flavor for about five to seven minutes then gradually feel decently medicated this buzz was a slow onset but once you get there i personally felt a sort of stony sedation that was not very overwhelming because i also got a mild cerebral and mental boost this isn't an in your face high but it's one where you ease into a pretty solid overall state with minimal added anxiety this is not a strain for supreme relief but it's one i'd recommend for people more prone to anxiety when smoking for people that want a more gradual and less dramatic onset i'd give this stuff a 7 out of 10 for its effects didn't quite meet my pain relief or insomnia needs but it's certainly a high that can help you unwind without totally knocking you out after a long day of work that'll give this candy og a composite of 7.25 honestly some of the less desirable smoke i've had in the medical program so far but i wouldn't go as far to say this strain is a total letdown it does provide a subdued and relaxing buzz that like i said i think less experienced smokers and those more prone to anxiety will get more out of than i did to be honest this stuff honestly does look the part but like i say often on this channel looks is honestly the least important category at the end of the day to me and the foul flavor and underwhelming effects were just not ultimately satisfying for me let me know your thoughts in the comments as always everybody and stay safe", "5VtO5QZKo58": "[Music] today we're going to show you about canister grinders and why it's good to spend the extra buck on a badass grinder but then we have semilla

uh the ozone line from ascend wellness this one comes in at 22 thc let's get in to the breakdown i got a lot to say about this one uh the look this is another one of those weeds that looks very very exotic visually before you get your hands on it it is very very impressive it has a ton of external trichome coverage i mean it looks like it's just covered in like a powder almost and it's got a ton of different colors going on it's like a yellowish green and then a bunch of purple throughout the buds and the buds are very uh pretty relatively dense uh i i would say very very dense actually uh but they're not very big so overall i gave the look only an 8.6 and that was because this stuff was one of the driest buds i've ever had but uh i recorded a clip of it so you guys could hear just how crispy it really was but that's why i took off a little on the look so i gave it a 8.6 out of 10 in the looks category ah the smell of this one was pungent it was a weird smell uh my my my buddy dan over at dan's buddha bodega if you haven't checked out his channel definitely check it out he described it as fruit and ass and that is exactly how i would describe it it's like super stinky weed it has a this is a weird smell to it and you get a little bit of fruity notes but it's mostly like this very like funky funky smell i gave the smell a 9 out of 10 not because i enjoyed it just because this weed actually had like a pungent odor and most dispensary weed that i'm picking up lately just doesn't have much of an odor so i gave it a 9 out of 10. now the high of this one it's kind of one note uh if you don't like indicas that make you sleepy definitely stay away from this one because that is exactly how this one is it doesn't hit you right away it's kind of a high that builds and builds and builds but it gets pretty strong towards the end and it will have you feeling uh pretty tired you also get some mood boosting effects from it but it's it's kind of just a one notor but if you're into like the real heavy indicas which i sort of am uh you'll you'll enjoy it so i gave the high a 9.1 out of 10. uh the breakup not too much to say on this one i broke up pretty nicely not too fine and it had a lot of keef on it from those frosty buds so i gave the breakup a nine out of ten it was very good uh the taste was kind of a little bit disappointing and i think that was because this bud was so dry it was so crispy it was kind of a painful smoke not as painful as i thought it was gonna be by how crispy this weed was but it uh overall had kind of a a faint sweet and then you get like that funky note from the smell of it it kind of tastes kind of like it smells okay you get a little bit of sweetness and a little bit of funkiness going on but mostly tastes like pain uh because this stuff was so so dry so i gave the taste a 7.8 out of 10. so overall that brings the score of the cake mints from ascend to an 8.7 out of 10. i say it is a good not great indica strain but i think it would be great for pain relief and sleep if you're looking for that and watch out for the dry mouth on that on this one it will creep up on you so 8.7 out of 10. and if you enjoyed this

that we just started taking around with here this is the big blue ozone generator what you may or may not know about ozone is actually pretty fascinating it is capable of eliminating odors inside of your growing space as well as sterilizing the air that passes through it the city of Los Angeles actually has an ozone generator that they use to purify their water with and they do about 600,000 gallons a day there's a few things that are important to know about ozone before we get into this one of them it is that yes exposure to ozone can be very harmful to humans your pets as well it can even kill your plants at high levels so be careful follow the instructions never exceed more than 0.5 parts per million if you're going to be in the room with the ozone generator that is the level that the FDA has set as a safe level to be around ozone ozone is present all around us it's in the atmosphere helps to shield our Earth from the sun's harmful rays and it also has some really beneficial characteristics as well one of them being sterilization hospitals used to sterilize operating rooms before and after operations to ensure that there are no microbes germs pathogens present in the room before or after surgery takes place this helps to minimize level of infections very great you may be asking yourself what do I need no zone generator for well if you're going to be using it on your outtake which is what we recommend the ozone generator is going to eliminate the need for a carbon filter but if you're one of those guys who just wants to have a fail-safe and be double sure there's absolutely nothing wrong with using an ozone generator in tandem with your carbon filter a little added tip and you might not know an ozone generator has actually been shown to help improve the life of your carbon filter if you're noticing it that it's not mitigating the smells as good as at you students get kind of stinky in there you can actually hook it up to an ozone generator and if you've been pulling this whole time through your filter what you want to do is you want to push through the filter with your ozone generator this is going to help to reactivate the charcoal so let's go ahead and take a look at this thing here you can see that there's a couple of bulbs inside there and that's actually what's helping to generate the ozone they use UV light to generate ozone with this particular filter so how is that different from other filters on the market well other filters use essentially a short they use an electrical short which generates ozone you've ever plugged something in and it shorted out or there was a maybe a for a in the wire and you saw the pop and you smell that smell that smell that we're smelling is actually ozone in small concentrations like a little pop you get from they're not harmful to you but in higher concentrations it can kill your plants they give you a nice set of instructions here and it's really important that you read these and familiarize yourself with the product before you use it they actually recommend that just to err on the side of caution that you do not enter the grow space when your ozone generator is running for at least 30 minutes and after it shuts off so you want to wait 30 minutes before you go in ozone has a half-life of about 30 minutes and that's when it converts back to harmless oxygen important thing with something like this is that you're going to want to have it on your exhaust fan blowing out of the room if you do have it on your intake fan this is more for you big warehouse size gardeners for a small person growing and say a 10 by 10 space or an 8 by 8 or a 4 by 8 or 1/10 let's say the ozone levels inside that environment can very quickly grow to levels that are both harmful for you and harmful for your plants ozone well kill your plants plants do not eat ozone plants make oxygen they eat co2 the roots oxygen but no part of the photosynthetic cycle involves ozone so it's important to know that it can hurt your plants and you and your pets so be very careful where you exhaust the air into you don't want it's just going into another room you want it to feel completely out up into the attic or maybe even up outside this is definitely a good way to cover your yourself if you're already using a carbon filter or maybe you have a really really stinky variety of flower this is definitely going to be your friend when you go to break down your grow room you actually have the added benefit of being able to sterilize much the same way that a hospital does you want to seal up the room that it's in completely you do not want to be inside the room at all during this time period but you crank it up to its highest level make sure the room is sealed off real well and you let it run for 24 to 48 hours and this is going to allow the ozone to penetrate into all the spaces all the areas all the cracks all the places where eggs larvae dust fungus mold spores pathogens all those things can and do hide in you may think you're doing a really good job you're using bleach or maybe you're using what I prefer which is hydrogen peroxide you may think you're doing a really good job but you would be surprised what you find when you use one of these and obviously if you've ever had a spider-man infestation before that's something you never want to happen again so if you let one of these run for 24 to 48 hours between your cycles and then you wait 30 minutes before you go into the room you should find that everything is perfectly sterile as sterile as an operating room you might say because that's exactly what and operating they actually recommend that you put it on some sort of a timer because it doesn't need to be running continuously unless you are running it as an exhaust you're running it just for exhaust you can allow it to run continuously because any time that the bulbs are not clip it is not going to be producing ozone which is what's sterilizing that air that goes through it killing those scent molecules this particular model has five lamps in there as you can see it is polished aluminum all the way around that helps to reflect light from those bolts you may look at these bulbs and think hey that looks just like a regular old fluorescent bulb it's not it is a far cry from a normal fluorescent bulb or even a CFL I've been told it's a little bit closer in its spectrum to a ml ha light bulb but we're going to plug it in and then we're going to see exactly what it looks like in action we're not going to let it run for very long obviously because we don't want to be exposed to harmful levels of ozone so let's go ahead and do that now I can smell it immediately once you've smelled ozone it's one of those things it's really hard to mistake so I'm going to actually turn this thing off because this is the biggest one that they make and I'm actually worried about the level of exposure that we would get in just this short period of time the big blue just has these lamps inside of it there are about $50 a piece to replace and they last anywhere between 14 to 18 months unless you are running all of them at the same time you will not need to replace them all at the same time you may not need to run all five lamps at once you might just need to run two or three to the other settings or four even so the other important thing is that you'll notice that this thing is very very shiny and polished on the inside that is something that you're going to want to maintain with this unit throughout its lifespan in order to increase its effectiveness keeping the surface clean and free of debris z'n dust is going to keep it producing maximum levels of ozone which is what is controlling or mitigating the smell inside of your card much much lighter than a carbon filter you're tired of having to change those things out every eighteen to twenty-four months you may want to take a look at one of these it will end up saving you some money in the long run over cost I believe as well as the fact that it only plugs into 120 so not a big energy hog even though in five lamp model like this one right here this and many other astounding products are available at monster Gardens com you", "BkeH_S98ys0": "what's up everyone can can grow here in the garden with another episode thank you so much for joining me so we're going to talk about this contraction a little bit later this is a bit of an impromptu video I hadn't planned on doing one but I just did a lot of work in the propagation area of my grow so I figured you know what let me just let me kind of share what I've done here so there's a lot of really cool things that are happening here these are some of the mother plants that I have these three on this side and that one there these two and that one there are Gorilla Glue for this one is a blueberry that when this green crack and that one back there is a rock star and then when I turn around over here I have these four which were white widows from my first three grows definitely some price vinhos and then we get to the new stuff so right here we have my just I just watered these and these eight one two three four five six seven eight these eight are 23 days from seed and they are published gift from Humboldt seeds and then right next to it these eight and actually this one over here these are Girl Scout cookies from BC pod Depot they are I think there are ten days from seed and I literally just transplanted them from the rockwool or placed anyways the rock wall into these little these tiny air pots so these are obviously these are potential mothers when I say potential what I'm doing now is I'm going I'm growing these out and once they're old enough to produce viable clones then and big enough obviously I'll be taking three or four clones from each plant and doing a run and once that run is done I'm going to keep any of them that produce you know price Reno's so okay so Bubba's gift Girl Scout cookies and right down here I just started germinating these I think four days ago these are wedding cake from Canuck seeds so I'm excited about those and finally in the propagation area we got these which were literally just just planted so what I went and did with these is I didn't even put these seeds I germinated these seeds to two days ago I didn't even put place them in rockwool I went a little bit old-school for me and I went straight to straight to the dirt so I just planted these there's for what just look at the tag on the one thinking white cookies and I should say three of these strains so the white cookies there's four white cookies two of these are enough three a crown Royale to our blue dream and then the five in the back there are Sour Diesel so the Sour Diesel crown Royale and the white cookies are from crop king seeds and shout outs to crop king seeds because these were freebies from them they're not that sponsor they weren't payment for anything but they were more of a thank-you for those of you that follow me on Instagram and maybe follow High Times Magazine rockin rockin crop King seeds did a just a small little campaign to mm-hmm feature their white widow strain and they reached out to me because they saw some pic so they put of my prized white widow Fino on Instagram and asked me if they could use some of my picks so I sent them they use them on the high temps High Times Instagram just a couple of stories if you want to check those out they're gone on the High Times but I have them highlighted stories under my Instagram which is ad can can grow so they sent these to me as a thank-you so you know hey I got those cool shoutouts to crop came for doing that so anyways that's what's going on we got a lot happening in here but let's get back to this little contraption year so this propagation area was kind of a bit of an afterthought for me I was focusing I focused a lot of my time and effort into setting up my flower tents and the hydroponic system and what have you and this propagation area was kind of just put together one step at a time but not really planned out right from the beginning so as I was kind of putting it together and still am working on fine-tuning it I mean we just got I just got this you know these standing here for better circulation I'm gonna get a humidifier in here because this is obviously not in a tent and my ambient air here humidity is quite dry which you know obviously contributes a little bit to some slower growth in these in these mother plants unfortunately but it is what it is I'll get a I'll definitely get the humidifier in a year but I ended up running into a bit of a problem well not a bit a big problem in my opinion unfortunately I had some powdery mildew show up on some of these now I'm not gonna get into a debate on you know whether it's systemic and you know with these mother plants clearly I have an issue I understand that and I'm gonna address it and deal with it best I can at this point first thing is to get it on the wraps now I've been using some night RIA and spraying these and kind of kept it at bay so it's really only affected you know this blueberry so my three oldest mothers in here so the blueberry this Rockstar and this green crack sorry anyways it actually did kind of fact a couple of these white widows also unfortunately so anyways I've kept it at bay but the first thing I need to do is powdery mildew is a Spore and I need to eliminate it so one of the things I'm going to do is I'm going to sterilize the air in here by using this this is an ozone generator and my like I said this isn't an intent so it's a fairly large it's a larger area with my five by ten and so on and so forth it's about this area in my basement is about 2,800 square feet so we're gonna try this out now obviously I understand that there is potential harm that can be done to the plants if it is used too much and turning extreme I'm fully aware of that so we're going to be vigilant about that we're going to use it in spurts I have it on the timer and I'm actually doing this video to kind of document that both for myself and for anybody else who might be interested in using you know I know zone an ozone generator themselves to tackle the same issue ozone generators are also used to clear odor before the advent of really good carbon filters this is actually the technology that we used to remove odors from grows it does a very good job at that but the ozonated air is also sterilizer it's used in hotels it's used in hospitals it's used you know in many many different places to sterilize environments now you have to be mindful of when you use it because it is harmful if you breathe it in so you need to make sure that you're not present in the room when it's running and you need to make sure that you allow it to dissipate which it will do in 30 minutes to an hour after use so anyways I'm gonna run this to eliminate at least the airborne powdery mildew spores that I have in this area and in my in my garden at this point and then I will and then I will start to tackle more specifically the plants that have been affected not all the plants have and we're you know we're moving right along it is not an outbreak that is out of hand we are being proactive in handling this and again I'm sharing this because you know problems happen and you can't run away from them and you got to deal with them and in case anybody else runs into this issue then you know hopefully this information is helpful to them and whether I'm successful or not can help them decide whether they go the same route or if they choose not to so I'll be documenting this and sharing how we do but that's what's going on here and yeah that's it so thanks for tuning in to this update hopefully you enjoyed the information that I shared I know I've reached through that a lot there is a lot to talk about when it comes but I'm not going to go into a ton of detail here both on powdery mildew potential fixes and also the ozone generator and its pros and cons and what have you I've done tons of research on it I'm fully aware of what what it can and can't do whether they will or won't do and or else I never would have invested in it so anyways if you have any questions though feel free to comment below because I'll gladly answer some questions you know maybe you're saying oh you know you can burn sulfur and you can do you know you can spray with water in h2o or baking so then these are all great potential fixes you know so this is just what I'm doing okay so thanks for tuning in thanks to everyone's you subscribe if you're new and you like the content hit the subscribe button turn on notifications so you don't miss any of my videos I do put out by the bit and you know I love you all and till the next video can can grow sunny no Cheers", "_joJY39u5Ws": "welcome back to dan's buddha bodega where today we're going to be going over cake mints so let's just get right into it [Music] cake mince is a well-balanced ozone brand hybrid that crosses cushman's with lemon pound cake now when you open this jar and just let it sit for a few minutes like you opened it and then went and got a drink came back when you came back the room would be skunky but if you put your nose straight up against the bud it's fruity but like fruity with ass or sulfur it's sweet it's i don't like it the smell is i mean it does have a little bit of citrus on top of it so it's not all bad now this isn't a bad looking flower either it's got your dark greens it's got little purple spots some orange hairs and a really good coating of trichomes the only thing that i didn't like about the look of this flower was that it was really really crunchy i really don't like it when it's that crunchy because it means it's going to be harsh as hell but let's give it a benefit of doubt and go ahead and take it all right well here we go nice trovia slanted cheers salute [Music] okay i get a little bit all right so right off the bat it has this little there's a little pain feeling it tastes like pain with a little bit of a bloody finish so yeah pain with a little bit of a bloody finish the flavor is i don't know it's just pure fire so i am getting a head rush um what do you say we go ahead and let me get back to you with the effects all right guys well i've given a little bit of time and let me tell you the effects of this flower are more leaning on the indica side i find it to be a little more cerebral and relaxing slash sedating than i do seeing it's you know energizing now that doesn't mean that i got the couch lock and i do have you know somewhat of a boost of creativity i think but not to the point that you know you're you're jittery or you know you it feels like you just can't slow down you know whatever this is really pleasant it gets just keeps building and building and building and building the peak wouldn't be for another i'd say half an hour 35 minutes and afterwards it leaves you with dry mouth and the munchies so if you're looking to eat this is a great strain for you if you're looking to not eat i'd say skip it and find something with a bit more limey but all in all this was an enjoyable flower i was a little nervous with that that awful smell but um you know the the gas ass or ass gassy smell but it really turned out to be a nice experience i'd say go ahead and check this out if you're smoking to relieve anxiety depression and stay relaxed throughout your whole day this strain is for you that just about does it for me here i'd like to say thank you to all my friends family subscribers viewers haters lovers everyone elsers and also last but not least thanks for the view", "qK9p7iUIHJo": "hey guys this is Matt with four hydroponics calm and today we're going to be talking about ozone generation so first up we'll talk about what ozone actually is it's sometimes referred to as activated oxygen that's because it has three atoms of oxygen connected versus the standard two this allows it to have a chemical reaction basically when it comes into contact with pretty much anything of oxidation oxidation is what's going to actually kill the mold virus past's anything that can briskly touch this is found in nature you'll find it after a rainstorm or during a lightning strike anywhere around you you'll smell and feel that extra ozone layer so it's not like we're producing something that's not found out there already and that your body's not already exposed to there's also the UV layer of a sorry ozone layer above the planet that actually protects us from the sun's rays so once again it's it's all around us already now there is safe levels and unsafe levels and we'll talk about that here in a second but as long as it's used properly it is one of the strongest sterilants in the world it's about three thousand times stronger or better than bleach when it comes to broad-spectrum microbial sterilization so first we'll talk about using it as a sterile end because it's the best used for it if you wanted to sterilize a basement or a space that you are going to start putting plants into and you were worried about any kind of mold or mildew or pests it's a great tool to go ahead just sterilize a large area cheaply and effectively pretty quickly if you have a bunch of equipment that you'd like to sterilize you can pile that equipment into a space and put your ozone generator in there turn it on and it will sterilize basically all your equipment without having to go through and touch every single piece with a piece of cloth and bleach so it's also great for just effective quick sterilization of equipment and spaces one of my favorite ways to use it and when you're using it that way we can get a little bit higher on the levels as long as you're not going to be going in there you can pretty much crank it up I'd say 400 to 500 mg or milligrams for per is pretty standard for an average-sized room and if you were doing sterilization you could probably go a little bit higher than that don't go in there until it's dissipated and that's the other beauty of ozone is that even if it doesn't really come into contact with anything it has a half-life of about 30 minutes so half the ozone that was there when you started will be there in 30 minutes if you still can smell it it's too high give it another 30 minutes and a half the ozone will now be in there and so on and so forth until you have safe levels to go back into the room if you can ever smell the ozone especially strong it's too high of a level the safe zone they say for ozone is 0.1 parts per million it's not very easy to test there are testers that will just basically give you a safe and an unsafe reading but if you can smell it you're getting close or above to that safe level ideally in the garden if we were actually using it with plants in the room which is debated whether you'd want to do that or not you would only run it to the tune of not being able to smell ozone and not being able to smell plants that's what you would be shooting for if you could smell the plants we need a little bit more ozone and if you can smell the ozone we need to turn it down a little bit but the debate would be that using ozone inside of a garden could have some adverse effects on your flavour and aroma and overall quality which leads me to the next use of ozone generation which would be exhausting if you are using ozone generation mainly for odor you might want to think about using it in your exhaust line there's a couple ways to do this and there's a couple different styles of ozone and you won't would be better for the exhaust than the other UV sterilization once again uses a light bulb and this is UV ozone I'm sorry uses a light bulb it creates a wavelength and this is what does the sterilization and the ozone generation this is what's recommended for indoor use for sterilization of your house of your spaces of your equipment of like I said vets or hospitals use this it's going to be the ultraviolet ozone generation for exhaust generation only ozone generation only and we're going to recommend the Corona discharge I don't have one right in front of me they are an inline style ozone generator and the way they do that is they basically have a fine metal grid that's connected and to the machine and it makes believe-it-or-not very small little lightning strikes theoretically inside there creating I was on a separate way oh the only problem with this is that it makes nitric acid as a by-product which is something we don't want in our house or near our plants so that's why Corona discharge those our generation is only going to be recommended for exhaust systems because of that they actually come in a lot stronger and make stronger machines they can make a lot more generation a lot quicker because they're designed to handle fast-moving air with a lot of smell for big commercial gardens so once again getting back to the amount that you might need for small gardens we're looking at about up to a hundred or less mg per hour milligrams per hour for medium to average-sized Gardens were shooting for 4 to 500 milligrams per hour and then they forego in up to commercial spaces we pas to be at one gram per hour or more but keep in mind I would say the majority people are using them for sterilization or for odor control and exhausts if you are going to use a UV ozone generator for exhaust odor control think about building some kind of ballast ballast box or some kind of extra ducting that you can wrap around to give the air ample time to mix with the ozone to kill the odor if you don't give it enough time to mix with the ozone you'll end up with you know still having odor molecules coming out of your exhaust system so about 25 feet abducting or so should be safe if you wanted to put this per say 25 feet and then into your ducting that extra 25 feet would give you the time you need for that odor to mix with the ozone and to completely oxidize it that people have also built boxes to allow the air just to circulate inside there before it moves through there it's another way that you can use the ultraviolet ones to help kill odor on the exhaust mount that we need in our Gardens that's gonna dictate quite a bit about which one we purchase the ozone generator Bo z1 does about cubic feet an hour they do make quite a bit smaller models the souvenir comes in a thousand I think three thousand and five thousand cubic feet per hour so really the paint on the space that you have we want to make sure you picked the correct model and then we're going to run that on a timer to make sure that the amount that we have in our space doesn't exceed healthy levels and is doing what we need to do whether that's sterilizing or killing odor so keep that in mind all the stuffs available on our website we also have the corona discharge models on our website and various sizes for all your different needs come check us out there's some more info on ozone generation there thanks for watching the video and we'll take you next time", "3cES6ue0gEk": "hey y'all EQ here just got back from the dispensary and they had blueberry headband the first quarter that I've been able to buy from there but it's popcorn but I don't really care give me a second I'm gonna open it real quick as you can see it's unopened from the dispensary and I'll be right back all right I'm back got her open finally so beautiful and this is that blueberry headband I just wanted to in mine the popcorn of the eight that I got the other day so I figured why not why not try the quarter since they're letting this out like I said it's the first quarter empty bag that's a nice little pile right there I'll take that all day look how pretty oh I'm in hog heaven right here guys that's just beauty will I don't even have to pick that up don't even have to pick it up so creating anyway beautiful day outside a lot of work to do out there so gonna get really really really stoned and go use a chainsaw there's no Smurf adieu Andrew guru so guys are you good are you happy

"hey y'all eq here uh just got back from the dispense and uh picked up some uh glazed and confused it's uh from the clinic in effingham uh it's sorry dogs were going crazy we got uh 22 and if you look at it through the bottle um you talk about pretty my i mean that's just the most beautiful thing i've ever seen in my life so give me just a second i'll get her open and we'll take a look at her all right we got her open let's see what this goodness looks like oh wow now that's beautiful so pretty let's get it out of the bottle and see see which looks like [Music] wow i gotta say that's really pretty weed my dogs are being crazy they're being insane but yeah this is really pretty weed it's got a like a gassy earthy smell and uh we'll taste one real quick just so we can see if the taste is like the bud or like what it looks like so very awesome very good looking weed ozone does it right so you know sometimes i mean i've seen some good i've seen some bad but i like what ozone does and i just lost my battery so i just lost my flash still looks good and uh really frosty can't beat that if you notice just so pretty that's definitely a a gas earth i mean real smooth draw tastes just as good going in as it does coming out so um very impressed with this one my wife did really well she picked this one out and as always like and subscribe i'm eq same brad time same brad channel later y'all", "yx0xh7FKCCY": "it's math going from one Stephanie and clear from gasps okay in this video we're just going to talk to you about grow room odors how they're a bit concerned for the customers and what you can do to control them and a little bit of troubleshooting towards the end if you've got all this stuff in place and you're still suffering so first and foremost carbon filters carbon filters do 99.9 percent of odor control and what we need is various brands out on the market but he was going to explain about what makes a carboy a better so we Jewish cowboy air into the market round about two years ago this filter got a lot of pedigree it's been manufactured in Holland for the last thirty years that the manufacturer manufacturer has multiple different brands but this what we did we went to a manufacturer and said right with certain things we need to take and we want to make sure that we get everything we need in a carbon filter so basically we started with a pre-filter make sure the pre-filter it's not really thin aren't really thick so it doesn't let any air flow through so we chose this pre-filter material which is perfect for allowing air flow through but collecting dust so as a dust basically penetrates a filter it's collected in the pre-filter and not damaging the cabin then we alter the mesh basically if this mess looks slightly different to the mess you've probably seen on other filters it's a really fine mesh but basically by having this fine mesh we actually managed to get more surface area we've got about fifty five point five percent service area mean fifty-five percent of the whole surface let's air travel through it that coupled with the cabin that we use which is a larger poor carbon it's like a four eight and a thief or eight which basically means it's an inch divided by four which is the biggest piece or an inch divided by eight which is the smallest piece we don't get any dust in these filters because we was a very large carbon also we look to the size of a carbon carbon bed we do a fifty sixty a hundred mil bed normal use is around about 50 ml if you've got a high-pressure fan like a revolution fans then we suggest always use a 60 mil if you want to scrub the air or using really really high pressure fans we do other hundred mil bed but basically be hungry well Betty's best for scrubbing rooms so they've got a funnel filter combination sat in the room bringing air flow through a filter just basically scrubbing the air game we'd have any orders that you don't want leaving the room so then we basically sent every single filter air to system air system is a massive fan manufacturer in Germany and they tested every single fan and filter combination so that we know every single filter matches every single fan all the next sizes match every single fan I on the market so basically putting all this together into a filter gives you in my opinion the best filter on the market over time it's pressure tested its airflow tested the cabin is batch tested so we know what cabins in here it's basically putting everything you need in a filter and I want it all I want to go out though it's for best fool tumor market by mile the nice thing is as well as experience Ian and his team has made it really really easy no matter what fun you've got they've got recommendations to the correct size filter to use it's on our website have a look at these guys but literally it's what family got what filters do we need banged on jobs young cool the next thing to talk about is ozone generators though there's two different types that you know generally on the market I'm not saying is different there's lots of brands as well but there's basically in line and in room and the obviously this well you would just plug into a room and turn it on ideally stick it on a timer because obviously there is no real control about this we would recommend to him it off a little bit before you go in the room as well just to let the concentration of ozone dissipate a little bit yeah then we've got in the inline ones which I'm going to hand over to Ian to talk about yeah to two versions of ozone generators it's in room and inducting so what what you do with this one you basically connect it after the fan so you have a filter fan and then and then be the ozone generator and then at least five meters of ducting after the ozone generator this is so busy also that's times time to mix in with the air destroy the order before it's released outside so that's ozone I hope we've explained roughly how they were we relate any fears on that one we have also been gots little deodorizes like honor this brand it's basically an odor neutralizer literally all you want to do is take the cap off expose it to the air it's got agents in there that do a similar job is what I was a noise bonbons Australia they're not a replacement to me an extraction they're not they're nowhere near as good as these you know most people I know by these I've met in a hallway outside a grow room or something like just to catch any sort of leakage smells of things like really good cheaper alternative to water so basically the next one we really need to talk about is negative pressure because that's going to be important more than anything else oh yeah a lot of people are we do all this they put the fans of filters the oars on they honor that we do all this in in the rooms and he's still gonna be still gonna smell still get an order escaping from a room yeah there's quite a lot of reasons to this but one of the main reasons is pressure negative and positive pressure you're always trying to create negative pressure so basically a fan and filter combination he's taking more air out of the room then you're bringing in then you bring it in yeah so you've basically create a vacuum so that means that you've got a vacuum within the grow room nothing can escape our grow room unless it comes through a filter first it's really easy to see in a tent if you've got positive or negative obviously in a tent you can see the if you've got negative decide to come in a little bit if you're positive you psycho out like that yeah I've seen it in a non tent room that's gonna be harder to see normally you see that we were door so basically could find it a little bit harder to open the door means you've got positive pressure yeah if you've got negative pressure when you open the door you can open the door a little bit easier yeah so that explains sort of negative pressure for you guys out there you weren't sure about it it's there is other ways of controlling it simple ways is a larger outtake than an intake yeah and then there is a fan controllers with balances that allow you to actually manually control that and set it up yourself yeah you can actually allow for the fan just to bring airing nationally integral we don't always have to blow air into the room yeah you can open the flaps or open these vents and that will allowed and naturally to come into the room and then basically after the fan and filter combination or where don't worry if these are open because you're going to creating negative pressure so you're always going to be soaking out rather than boy", "WjOHmW5xtAo": "hello and welcome to the series webinar series today we will be talking about water treatment for cannabis gross if you're watching this webinar you may be wondering if you need to make any adjustments to the water that you are using to feed your plants let's start with two major water quality misconceptions misconception number one all water is the same this could not be further from the truth water quality varies tremendously from location to location and all of these variations in water quality have different effects on your plants misconception number two potable water or the water that you drink from your faucet is also adequate for plants this is also not true plants and humans have different water quality needs to thrive this is why a cultivation facilities incoming water regardless of whether it's from a well or from a local municipality should be tested by a trusted analytical lab once you have tested the water and gotten the results you can begin to assess how the contaminants in your water might affect plants contaminants will commonly be measured in parts per million or ppm for short which is equivalent to one milligram of contaminant per liter of liquid important measurements can be categorized into general parameters in organic organic and biological contaminants pH is used to measure the acidity and alkalinity of a fluid and is measured on a scale from zero acidic to 14 basic EC or electrical conductivity is the ability of a water to conduct an electrical current salinity and total dissolved solids or tes are used to calculate the EC of water which helps to indicate the water purity TDS is measured of total total dissolved solids and as an indication of waters hardness level which is measurement of dissolved minerals such as calcium and magnesium in the water the main concern with high levels of hardness is the scaling that will occur on the exposed infrastructure it is also important to consider these concentrations of minerals in the development of your nutrient recipe chemicals which are often found in municipal water for disinfection purposes can build up in a soil and create browning yelling or sports looking leaves that will eventually fall off completely Dixon disinfection by-products pesticides solvents and volatile organic carbons are all organic contaminants that exist in our waterways that can have unknown effects on plant health in last microbiological x' they're not only dangerous for human consumption they can have disastrous effects on plants in the form of disease such as root rot groundwater and surface water sources often contains a range of biological contaminants like bacteria and viruses now that you have a better idea of what unwanted contaminants you have in your water you can begin to evaluate your water treatment options there are many water treatment technologies that can be considered some in combination to create the optimal grow system the two main water treatment options found in the cannabis industry include reverse osmosis or RO and ozone treatment RO systems are currently the most popular for cannabis cultivators these systems work by pushing water molecules through a semipermeable membrane filtering out most contaminants ozone is an unstable gas comprising of three oxygen atoms and is readily used in domestic and industrial water treatments but has recently been used to benefit many grow operations ozone is generated when energy is added to oxygen breaking apart the o2 molecules into unstable oxygen atoms these oxygen atoms combine to form oh three molecules which destroy the unwanted contaminants here's a sample of what you'll commonly find for a water treatment system in the commercial cannabis facility incoming water will go through some sort of sand or carbon filter water softening to reduce the hardness and ro to remove all other constituents for storage the purified water will then be dosed with nutrients according to the specific grow recipes before going to cultivation you'll notice this diagram there is an ro or waste stream coming out of the RO system this is one of the major drawbacks of the RO system our purified water often called the permeate is the product of the desalination process the byproduct is the brine also called concentrate reject water or waste stream this waste stream can be up to 50% of the incoming stream so ro systems are not water efficient additionally this stream will be highly concentrated with salts nutrients metals and other inorganic materials municipalities often consider this stream of toxic liquid because of this discharge of this stream can be very difficult for example discharging may require permits further treatment or additional infrastructure require a lot of space all of which come at a high cost additionally this Brian can wreak havoc on the local environment and disposal infrastructure in addition to these burdens ro systems have a very high operational energy demand in comparison to RO ozone does not have the bride' disposal requirements has a much lower operational energy and has an added benefit of increasing the dissolved oxygen in fertigation water most growers understand the vital importance of do in the root zone of plants beneficial levels of Geo started around 8 milligrams per liter the saturation point of oxygen water depends on the temperature and salinity of the water but mostly does not exceed 15 milligrams per liter ozone and water allows us to exceed this level by super saturating the water with oxygen because ozone or o3 is 13 times more soluble in water than Oh - we we are able to pump much greater levels of oxygen into the water in the form of ozone which quickly reverts back to Oh - but at a supersaturated level in addition to the higher dl levels ozone systems can be used to clean the lines which will heavily reduce maintenance costs and replacement rates of components here at Ceres we believe a water treatment system should be designed to produce optimal water quality for your plants while also reducing costs and environmental impacts here is a sample flow diagram of one of our innovative solutions this system not only treats incoming water but also treats and reuses the nutrient waste and condensate water from the facility in a zero or minimal waste solution thank you for listening to this presentation if you have any questions or for more information please see the link to visit our website in the notes below thank you and good luck", "3KRuhc9R5FI": "damn i really wish i had some weed is that really there it is hey you welcome to my course review a juvenile stuff this is what i do i smoke crush hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them all for you by the time i'm done we'll be on the moon now let's start the show thank you for the view yo what up world welcome to juvenile styles today i got mirage so i got a gram of it here i'm going to open it up right now in front of you to show you exactly what comes in a grim and then i'm going to roll up a nice joint pack a bomb take a nice hit of the bun and we'll give it a nice thorough review like we usually do so i want to pull it out take a nice look at it like usual roll it up get high that's what we do so it's not a bad grip i'll show you the close-up and then by the time i'm back after the close-up we'll have this joint rolled hundreds of different strands of smoke there's no joke breaking up the big puff and choke if you've never seen my show now you know we get so high that we fly the globe told you i'll be back in a jiffy with a spliffy but now i got it let's light it up and give the mirage plus a review so it didn't look like the biggest account for a grim but it's not that bad of a count it seems to be pretty sticky we'll take a look at it here in a second just trying to get a nice taste of the flavor before i rate it but i'm going to throw it in the bong too before i give it the rating so but the taste so far it has like a nice sweet taste to it but i kind of taste like maybe like a bit of vanilla it tastes nice and crystally though it does have a very nice taste it's not the strongest flavor i've had but it is nice and smooth so that is a nice smooth puff so let's take a look at the buds jesus christies must be child proof i'm just playing just playing so this one ain't a bad size one let's hold this one up as you see it's a nice color green it kind of got like a bit of like a darker like brownish kind of tent to it because it's got a lot of hair on it but it has a strong smell to it it has a stronger smell than it does a flavor but this smells really nice i can actually smell like the vanilla to it quite a bit more and the smell but the flavor is really nice i like that it is smooth you'll be able to smoke a nice big hit in the bun so we'll pack a nice bowl up here in one second we'll take another look at another one that's just another little bug it didn't come in that bigger bud but what do you expect it's only a gram you know so it's not bad the gram was 12.50 i think it wasn't at the nslc which it ain't too bad if you didn't notice check it out i hadn't worn in a while i decided to wear it for another video do you guys if anybody's around from back in them days when i first made this let me know in the comments here i'm going to show you a little side by side i got a little bit bigger since than a tune this is a gram of moon rock so came in two nice hard like pieces so what i'm gonna do is break some off and try it in the bond for you not trying to flex or nothing but when i first started i was just recently getting clean off of our drugs and alcohol so i am a little proud about how i look now because definitely a lot healthier looking now than i was then but yeah i made that i think it was my for 100 sub special i think it was and i don't know if i made this one for special but i had to go with it so i'll give this a rating for taste right after the bomb just one second my dumb ass forgot to grab it before we started so yeah let's pack a bowl up take a nice taupe we'll take this bud and throw it in got to get high so high we got to get high so high taking hits from the bomb you know save yourself back in the day you gotta love that song all right let's light this up and try it out in the bone pretty good pretty good so i can taste it a little bit more in the bone but it tastes pretty good either way so i'll give it i'll give it a nice i give it a 3.5 for flavor it's not that bad definitely had a lot worse so i have a 3.5 this is definitely not the one of the best i've smoked either but it is pretty good so for flavor i'll give it a 3.5 for a count i mean can't be too judgmental on a gram but for account i'll give it i'll give it the same and i didn't mention this is 24 thc and it has 0.79 milligrams of ocb or cbd my bad not the papers cbd but a total cbd is 1.35 milligrams so it is an indica and it's from skoshka it's from that one scotia scotia anyways it's from it's from that [Laughter] i'm going to give the mirage plus an overall 3.5 i think it's a pretty fair rating and i hope you all got some good [ __ ] to smoke i got some ak-47 white widow and cherry blast fast grow are supposed to be coming from bulk seeds i'll put a link to their website in the description of this video so you can go check them out they got all kinds of different scenes [ __ ] like in like all kinds of different strains pretty much whatever you want they got so kind of

know what as cannabis patients here in Illinois we have to play pay almost double of what it is on the street okay 60 bucks for an aide 120 or more for a quarter and you know what's pissing me off about that it's recently the quality of the flour has been going straight to hell let me show you what I'm talking about and this is the reason why I never get makers grace to begin with but you know what I mean this is supposed to be good news stuff here guys good that's a lot of [ __ ] Brown there's a lot of brown and a bunch of seeds I'm looking at right now I can see a bunch of seeds that I missed on top of these seeds okay it's a plant I understand that seeds happen yes one or two here and there is fine but wouldn't you find it like this just a whole eight just just I mean inseminated with with a hundred seeds I mean it's just ridiculous okay the price we pay the not being able to see what we're buying it you know the news Matt against us putting in these [ __ ] fancy containers like this and you know like this and have it be complete garbage it tastes like [ __ ] it tastes like ditch wheat that somebody grew hide your pilot oh no they won't tell the difference you know what you do have some cannabis patients that don't know the difference and that's [ __ ] wrong do because that is garbage nature's grace and wellness you know what when I first started off I loved your flower I your room rocks but since then it has gone straight to [ __ ] straight to [ __ ] and I'm very sorry to upset you you work for them or whatever but if you do work for them tell them okay they're their flower sucks okay I used to think that's a little Egypt here in Illinois had though had the worst flower no no not by a freaking long shot not by a long shot now when you're paying 120

yeah because it'll go out but yours hasn't gone out so i'm glad it hasn't i will tell you that it's a creeper and that you will think that um you are at a certain level but it will creep on you what fun [Music] do [Music] hey everybody welcome to high rollers i'm your host derek gilman and together we are going to explore the world of cannabis connoisseurship the tools the techniques the rituals we're gonna get into the nitty-gritty we're gonna geek out on all these details and have a good time and consume while we're doing it uh joining us today on our journey it's a good friend of mine mr niels anderson niels is joining us today to discuss old school techniques old school genetics neil has been consuming uh cannabis since the mid 70s and he's just got a lot of great stories to tell and some techniques and a few hacks uh welcome to high rollers neil it's good to be here so good to have you man so um just let's i'm gonna describe to the audience how you and i met because i think it's a fun little story effectively we both here live in ventura county and we were trying to lobby the county to be a little more progressive in its uh and its cannabis regulations unfortunately as we both know ventura county is a little bit uptight when it comes to cannabis regulation and especially here in the state of california where it's supposed to be legal now right very conservative yeah and so uh we both belong to uh the vcca now defunct vcca which was the ventura county cannabis alliance and this was an advocacy group that was trying to lobby the county board of supervisors effectively into doing the right thing and while we weren't successful in that one of the great things that came out of this was getting to meet you niels you i think had approached me initially to say hi um and then we just kind of started chatting a little bit and one of the first things that you mentioned meals that just perked up my attention is you said hey you know i've been growing cannabis now since uh you know early mid 70s i've been doing it all to myself you know niels goes on to tell me how effectively he had gotten a hold of some tie stick back in the 70s amongst some other genetics as well and had been replicating those genetics keeping them pure unlike most breeders over these last few decades who have been crossing this with that niels the purest here uh kept the thai stick pure kept the malawi pure kept the hawaiian pure and uh and as soon as he mentioned this i was just blown away man and i just knew i had to get to know you better it was a fun interaction when we first met i think it's not an area where i've had the opportunity to socialize to do what we're doing now to to share our experiences but also i didn't realize at the time how unique that i just happened to grow up in santa monica happened to be at the right place at the right time and got to experience uh i believe the finest of all the the cannabis that came in imported and the reason why was because it was really consumed not only by the musicians and the rock bands but really by the groupies and they would they wanted the best and they wanted as much as they could get their hands on and i just happened to be lucky enough to be there and you traveled in some in some unique circles that actually granted you access to some of the finer herb that was flowing through southern california at the time right i was very lucky i had family friends whose parents were entertainment attorneys that seemed to acquire the product and this was a whole other time you know this was 40 50 years ago you go on to you know start collecting these different varieties as you're sampling them right you know i named a couple like the thai and the hawaiian and the malawi um and you're and you're saving these seeds through the process right i am but what also is unique is that it's always sativa most people do not want to bother with growing sativa first off it uh does not typically yield the large dense buds in that uh also it takes much longer to flower maybe even upwards of a month so it's just not attractive for somebody that's growing for product i never was i was growing always to supply a medication for a condition that i had that cannabis worked beautifully for and i was raised in a very conservative environment so i grew in a little two foot by three foot closet or actually a metal cabinet and when i got really brave i got two cabinets and then for 50 years now okay half a century you've almost you've effectively been an island unto yourself needed to be uh my work uh my thinking was very conservative and it just wasn't smart to seek out companionship in that dealing with cannabis at that time it was still misunderstood by the really the masses by the general population it was specifically a medication for me but a very important one because without it uh there was no medication and to this day there's no medication for a condition that i have um you were also highly involved in the scientific community um you were involved with some uh some amateur rocket uh research i believe right very much so in 1940 almost every state had an amateur rocket society but then they kept combining going out of business and that or losing interest whatever membership and there was only one reaction research society that stayed active and i felt very strongly about it to the point where when i joined there were three members when i left as president there were 700 and some odd amazing few of those members are some names i think our audience might recognize as well right well let's just say that there's quite a few people on spacex that will smile when they hear about uh this wonderful organization which is still in existence and you're a little modest and you don't like the name names but effectively uh elon musk uh was was part of your group right the guy he came to the rrs and we had a course uh where people would come out and build solid propellant rockets and they were all part of this course and now my interest is in medical cannabis because so many family and friends can benefit from the municipal medicinal properties of it [Music] you brought the tie you brought the hawaiian and you brought what's this third one you brought um this is um acapulco gold and this is a whole nother story uh it is a fascination of mine and the only thing on my bucket list that's how good my life has been my one thing on my bucket list is what is it that changes acapulco gold to gold and i was looking forward to isn't the genetics because you've been growing this out now and it's not turning gold absolutely in in fact this is my theory it wasn't unique to acapulco gold i think it's unique to any sativa grown anywhere in the right conditions first off the acapulco gold both santa marta both of them were mature perfect buds in other words that's one thing we don't talk about nowadays and if there were anything to learn from today's conversation it's in harvesting they never cut the cannabis plant and hung it up in a barn or anything like that it was always dried in the ground in other words they waited until the stock would rattle or whatever their nuance was when they walked through the field and then they would individually pull that particular plant up because it would be dried and i think it's the sitting in the ground drying out under the sun that's kind of bleaching out some of those chlorophylls that might be residual in there and i hope someday to learn what it is because several times i thought i was going really close there i i was almost sure i even remember calling derek derek i think i got it i think i got it i got he called me up on the phone real excited i've solved the code why don't you tell us a little bit about some of the tools and techniques you've learned over this time because i know you've got some stuff you want to share here with us well if i may i'll get into it kind of quick and then maybe we need to have something that i can show these tools how they're used i'm getting ready to start smoking here myself and if i may real quick uh marishum is uh sea foam it is a mineral naturally occurring in turkey um it's this white material and it's like mineralized it's like fossilized sea foam exactly so exactly so but what's really what drew me to this origin originally and and made me stick you don't use screens i never liked the idea of metal i never i the less the best and so if i could uh take my medication just by smoking it or vaporizing it that's what i wanted to do and these are actually toys uh these are key chains and most people would throw them out or use them just for that no they are the perfect cannabis pipe and it's as easy as just taking it apart you unscrew the uh nose piece and then you take out this little plastic piece and then you're done and now you have your pipe and what i found is that um the tubes that come on dry cleaners and so i took that tube and i put it together with the marichum and then i used shrink wrap why are you adding the tube to the mirsham uh to cool down the smoke what you find is depending on how long uh most people would find this very long i find this just adequate of length that it will cool down my smoke perfectly i hear this is yours i love i love by the way you rolled one for each of us too of course i happen to believe that everyone should have their own you and me both my friend uh this is a tapioca tube uh i bend over one end tape it and then what's remarkable about this is that you can take this traveling or anything like that and it protects the joint but where it's really wonderful is when you've finished and you have that roach that's really smelly in that you just pop it back in here tape it up and you're done and you don't stink up the room or anything and what's fun is since it's color cord coordinated you know what's in it you like to you like to use matches right yeah i've always been a match person i learned uh when i was uh in the 80s that wood matches everything leaves you taste it everything you'll taste if you're lighting something up except with paper matches if i light this and let it burn to where the the waxed area is burned it's as clean as it's going to be i'm not going to get anything else cleaner um i like it yeah it's good enough reason for me oh very good all right thank you sir i'll be over to you i just want to let it get and then after you get going this is my little fun novelty item and what it is it's a stainless steel funnel but what's really nice is when you're smoking and you're done you don't you just drop it and that way you don't smudge the end crease it or if you use water that's worse because then the joint never lights up again sure so you keep something like this just in the ashtray here maybe and then uh and as you see that's a pretty tall joint and there's no problem what kind of papers did you use these are called raw they're the newest paper put out by uh it's called classic raw and they are cannabis they are made from hemp why do you use these because they are the thinnest paper you can buy the thinnest paper made and they just came out as you know raw is huge it's been around for sure ever but just within the last year they came out with this new product nice uh yeah you know i i'm a big fan of the papers i use too everybody knows i use the club rolling papers yes but for that very same reason is the thinness of the paper i know that the clubs are 10 grams per square meter of paper 10 grams which is one square meter fun fact huh yeah and it's and ultimately because if you're going to roll a joint you know it's about smoking the cannabis and not smoking the paper or smoking any additives that were in the paper perhaps and so you want as little paper as possible i typically cut down my papers less is best i'd rather not have any but uh is wonderful neil's okay so so we have uh some varieties here to try so let's let's assess this first okay very good this is the tie but it's three years old what's your how have you had this stored for three years vacuum packed in a refrigerator uh in a mason jar you're keeping it dark you're keeping it you know away from any excess oxygen and you're keeping it cool to help you know preservatives and i cheat and i use a um bovi bag the little bovita uh humidity yes yep sure what i want to say though about the tie before we move on is the immediate thing i initially noticed was how smooth it was and you telling me that it's been curing for three years you know i'm sure speaks you know volumes towards that i'm also noticing a spiciness to it a woody kind of spicy that's the cure yes very good but but if i may get into the consciousness it's not a couch no yeah and thankfully so yeah no this is the i think one of the problems with sativa is a lot of people are looking for something that's not there sativa to me has nuances it's it's very up it's very um forward sure uh it's not couch potato it's not something no and i think that's that's that's the reputation sativa has you know people who are looking for more of a cerebral or a more energizing or creatively inspiring experience i think tend to lead to lean towards the satisfaction so few people get an opportunity to smoke a real sativa that isn't a hybrid and that's i think the bigger point here is is most of the sativas in the marketplace today are being deemed sativas are at best you know maybe maybe 40 sativa at best well and very good but i say it a little differently if it's not 100 it's not sativa in other words as soon as you introduce the indica um it's no longer sativa and and what i looked for and even now more so is to keep it sativa and what i would rather do is to mix buds than to mix genetics i would much rather grow out everything as land race do it on the back end right right because you can always do it you have more control you have total control you haven't contaminated you know for you know for better word the genetics will said and in fact that's what everybody's scrambling for now they're all looking for the land race the old land race it's kind of sad you know um also i like land race because i think it has a clarity you just can't get from an indica uh i'm feeling a lot of energy from this time it's gonna start growing on you it was a nice elevator is that why you only took a hit or two it is while you watched me go why one after the next how do you also okay what do you got next for us here uh the next one will be the hawaiian always look for the end where you have the little tab this is convenient uh you know niels one of the things that i love about you man um is your attention to the detail you really pay crawl into all the little nuances um yeah you know again just you know you come up with your your little holder you decide okay i'm going to color coordinate them you decide i'm going to get color coordinated tape but beyond that you put the tape on and you even make the little tab for the easy pull off and put back on right it's all fun i have uh two daughters uh one of them does not care for cannabis at all uh the other one uh benefits from it hugely and uh i'm lucky enough to be able to interact with her as an adult she just turned 30 on this level so that also drives me is i'm another one of my hobbies is cooking and what i'm trying to create is the cookbook of the ancestors so what that is is i'm gonna find the best recipes i can create this cookbook and then give it to my two daughters and then in turn they'll add to it oh wonderful or not and then in turn the next generation the next generation just for fun with cannabis i'm hoping to hand off all my genetics to my daughter um and let her uh enjoy the world that i have been blessed with um but also there's so many individuals now that are my age that are really in need of cannabis um that's really that is a truly uh uh remarkable gift that you're going to leave for your kids and a legacy um you know because again it's pretty unique maintaining these genetics in the pure form as you had i think even a lot of the source countries from what i've heard even their genetics to a large degree have been hybridized out okay some clowns back in the 80s late 80s early 90s went down to columbia went down to thailand went to mexico with indica genetics and started introducing them into these places yeah there are still pockets isolated pockets of pure genetics fortunately i hope so but yeah to have something like this here in california well it's available to any and all who are uh wanting and that's what i'm about it brings me tremendous joy to be able he's not serious don't you try and contact neil's okay he's not giving out these genetics this is between him and me all right uh i i'm going to use my lighter for this one okay this way we can we can spark simultaneously well that's a pretty fancy lighter cheers cheers tell us about it you want to know about my lighter so um i'm all about the tools as you know by now uh about me neils um because i like anything that's going to help individualize the experience for me and anything that's just going to help maximize my enjoyment so i like fun little gadgets and tools whether it be you know antique you know sterling silver ashtrays or something a little more contemporary like this lighter i had made by this artist wasteland odysseys made this lighter it's the name of the artist and it has been it's a tooled leather is what it is it's hand tooled and then it's been hand painted afterwards yeah i was so impressed with his work i've had a couple custom lighters made for a few of the guests i've had here on high rollers i had one made for a swami and i had one made for the dank duchess as well i saw swamis yeah that was really neat so this hawaiian this um has an interesting flavor to it much different than the thai uh yes it does um now i'll warn you it's um a little in my opinion uh you're warning me now well yeah because it'll go out but yours hasn't gone out so i'm glad it hasn't uh i will tell you that it's a creeper and that you will think that um you are at a certain level but it will creep on you what fun [Music] but i wanted to get back real quick to ty if i may what was interesting about ty is it had a freak in its genetics the seeds wouldn't always open what would happen is the seed would crack but then the cotyledons would not be able to work their way out and the seed would die so that's where we use this device which is this little what little gadget do you have here and now this is actually really important it's just a little a clamp uh miniature that a jeweler would use or somebody in miniature hobbies and that but what makes it very important is that it gives you the ability to crack the seed without going too far so in other words it allows you to apply just the right amount of force to the seed to split it without then damaging the cotyledons while we're on the subject of germination i think we should i think now's the time to tell our little story so we were filming the cannabis cultivation certificate for a green flower and we had mel frank and myself here in studio doing a course on uh seed germination and he had seeds that he had brought in these 22 year old skunk number one seeds right and he had him in various stages of germination he brought him in for this demonstration that we did we finished the shooting for the day and he says well i don't need these you know it's it's it was it was late fall when we did the class so it wasn't time to start you know for the next spring and he says hey i'm just gonna toss these out and i didn't have the heart mel frank's 22 year old skunk number one seeds so what do i do is i walk them out to uh out of the front of the office here a green flower and i find a little spot and i uh you know just move the dirt away and it was nice and moist near one of the sprinklers and i just put them in i threw the dirt on them just to give them a shot you know i just didn't i i i just could not throw them in the trash can okay this is life this is a beautiful life sure enough two weeks later these sprouts come up and there's a little patch of nine little uh little sproutlings little cannabis sproutlings however they they weren't going to live long here uh a green flower either somebody was going to get angry or one of the gardeners that comes and just services the facility was going to knock them down so i reached out to you niels and i said hey got these mel frank's you know skunk number ones man they're they're sprouted out front you got to come save them they're looking for a home and nils you came and adopted them and i came with my spoon so yes i did come down i felt kind of strange though going to the front door and helping yourself but i took five and left the three yeah and here we go here we are it's like a couple three months later this is one of the five right this is one of the five and this is uh a female that's flowering and actually it's already been pollinated uh but that's the phase that it's in right now is i'm going for seed because what you do is you self-pollinate them right you you now had a male or two in the group right i was lucky enough that uh when you planted the seeds there was one male all the rest were females and uh i actually as you know i do pollinate myself but this one i just left everything together in the grow chamber and let it pollinate all the plants you know 50 years after your journey began you know you've been you've been keeping these genetics alive these these land race you know cultivars and now all these years later you've got a new one to add to the collection that was also a relatively old school variety very much so and just the history not only uh with all due respect that it came from you but uh also that it was uh blessed by mill who i'm a huge fan of doesn't get any better than that man does it no skunk number ones well hey niels thank you so much for coming in today sharing your tools your techniques your genetics your stories with us it's been a good time man very well it's been fun and uh i also very much value our friendship know that the feeling is mutual meals i've enjoyed our friendship uh i've enjoyed uh hearing all your old stories sharing your wonderful genetics that you've been preserving and yeah it's been a fun journey man i look forward to continuing it with you i look forward to our further trips together also far out and i look forward to everyone joining us on the next episode of high rollers where we're going to crawl into the tools the techniques and we're going to have a good time so see you next time", "O3rsFUjs2X8": "i'm ashley brennan founder of sabine holistic health sabina holistic health is a non-profit that helps medical marijuana patients afford marijuana a safe effective medicine never covered by insurance today i'm discussing medical marijuana and depression overall people are finding relief of depression with cannabis and there is scientific evidence and patient surveys to support this i'll look at the science behind why marijuana is effective for depression and some unique studies so let's look at medical marijuana and depression the basic science behind why marijuana is effective for depression is because it interacts with the endocannabinoid system the most important regulatory system of the body endocannabinoid signaling is involved in depression pre-clinical studies show that thc and cbd consistently produce the same signaling and results as commonly used antidepressants activating cb1 receptors in the brain produces antidepressant like effects and enhances mood thc and cbd can activate these cannabinoid receptors cannabinoid receptors in the endocannabinoid system are activated by cannabinoids in medical cannabis or the body's own endocannabinoids which are actually very similar when the body is under producing endocannabinoids naturally the cannabinoids in cannabis step in to help by activating receptors depressed patients exhibit lower levels of endocannabinoids this could contribute to depression and provides a therapeutic target for medical marijuana it also gives us an explanation as to why medical marijuana relieves depression some of the first human evidence that medical marijuana could relieve depression came from failed clinical trials meant to produce weight loss activating cb1 receptors increases appetite as seen with thc so it was thought that blocking cb1 receptors might decrease appetite and aid in weight loss however patients taking a synthetic cannabinoid that blocked cb1 receptors were likely to discontinue the medicine due to depressed mood and suicidal thoughts this failed trial to decrease appetite proved that cb1 receptors play a role in depression and activating them with cannabinoids such as thc would produce an antidepressant effect studies that set out to show marijuana use cause depression either suggested that people were self-medicating or lacked a correlation when other socioeconomic environmental or mental health factors were considered there have been significant drops in suicide rates in states that have implemented medical marijuana programs a study analyzing suicide data from 1990 through 2007 showed legalization produced a 10 average reduction in suicides especially in men although depression on its own is not usually an approved condition for medical marijuana treatment or a medical marijuana card patients are often using it to treat depression a survey of 1429 medical marijuana patients in washington reported that 50.3 percent were using the medicine to treat depression and felt it improved symptoms of depression even though it was not the reason they obtained a medical marijuana card or their primary condition other patient surveys and studies yielded similar results in one survey of 4 400 adults those who consumed marijuana once per week or daily showed decreased scores on depression scales when compared to non-users when analyzing this data between medical and recreational marijuana users medical users reported an increased depressed mood and medical complaints related to the body when compared to recreational users this indicates that medical conditions contribute to the development or intensity of depression clinical trials specific to medical marijuana and depression have yet to be conducted however there are clinical studies that show medical marijuana can decrease depression that occurs with other conditions a survey of 131 patients with als lou gehrig's disease showed medical marijuana decreased depression among other symptoms a study of 367 patients with fibromyalgia showed 80.8 percent reduced depression among other symptoms in the largest scale study of 775 patients with hiv aids patients rated medical marijuana more effective than pharmaceuticals for depression these are just a few examples medical marijuana has also shown to improve depression in chronic pain when compared to patients who use opioid medications for chronic pain in one study of chronic pain patients using either medical marijuana only opioids only or a combination of medical marijuana and opioids anxiety and depression scores were much higher in those using only opioid pain medications when compared to those only using medical marijuana the group that used medical marijuana only rated much higher in overall health and well-being in the group using a combination of medical marijuana and opioids patients were more prone to depression but not anxiety than the medical marijuana only group medical marijuana is safer than opioids for pain and doesn't carry the risk of overdose or addiction it can also relieve anxiety and depression reported in many people with chronic pain while this data supports that medical marijuana improves moods and depression with other conditions very few studies have considered depression on its own in a recent study published in the yale journal of biology and medicine cannabis users overwhelmingly reported immediate relief of depression after using marijuana the study observed 1819 people from june 2016 through july 2019 they completed a visual analog scale of depression and reported the strains including indica sativa or hybrid and products and methods used flower concentrates pills tinctures topicals or edibles as well as how they used it such as a joint pipe vape etc the goal of the study was to determine real-time depression relief before and after using medical marijuana patients were asked to report depression symptom levels before and after using the medicine using the relief app in this truly unique study 95.8 percent of users had immediate symptom relief after using marijuana where 2.1 percent had worse symptoms and 2.1 percent reported no change the average reduction was 3.76 points on the 0 through 10 visual analog scale the depression symptom relief was not different based on the strain type or product used thc levels were the greatest predictor of symptom relief while cbd may have antidepressant effects cbd levels were unrelated to immediate symptom relief of depression some negative side effects of depression such as feeling unmotivated were observed in 20 of the patients where 64 experienced positive side effects of depression such as feeling happy optimistic relaxed and peaceful the results indicated that medical marijuana produces a positive antidepressant effect in most patients while both thc and cbd can be beneficial to depression high doses of thc may be sedative or cause a lack of motivation which is a symptom of depression negative side effects like these can be completely avoided with the appropriate choice of strain other cannabinoids and terpenes have been shown to have anti-depressant effects especially limonene limonene allowed 75 of clinically depressed patients to discontinue antidepressants in a clinical trial in japan it is important to consider all cannabinoids and terpenes in a strain to best treat your symptoms the terpenes linal and limonene may increase antidepressant effects when used with thc and cbd when relieving depression thc and cbd ratios are important marijuana is a versatile medicine that can be used without intoxication an equal or higher ratio of cbd will reduce or eliminate the high of thc that can be unmotivating or cause unwanted symptoms of depression when choosing a strain for anxiety or depression a higher amount of cbd that reduces the intoxicating effects of thc may be an appropriate choice thc can aggravate depression or anxiety in some patients when choosing a medical strain patients with depression should be knowledgeable about thc and cbd ratios the medical uses of cannabinoids and terpenes strain types indica sativa and hybrid ways to use medical marijuana and dosing use the links in the description for detailed resources on all of these topics to aid you in using medical marijuana

this subject today as it comes up often in our team meetings and client sessions as well so i'm going to be talking about marijuana and cbd and discussing kind of the pros and cons benefit of harm for anxiety can i just i think let me see okay there we go did the slide move for you uh i think go ahead i just i'm not sure if it's the view we want but go ahead i think it should be fine okay sounds good so starting off i'll just kind of give a general landscape of anxiety as well as cannabis use in the states right now so anxiety disorder prevalence worldwide an estimated 284 million people have an anxiety disorder and by anxiety disorder and in general that means either generalized anxiety disorder gad panic disorder social anxiety disorder or a specific phobia so an estimated 31 of u.s adults experience one of these disorders in general at some time in their life and an estimated 19 percent of u.s adults have had one of these anxiety disorders in the past year not on that list is ptsd which used to be categorized as an anxiety disorder and certainly entails a lot of anxiety um but i mentioned that because there will be some tie-ins later especially in regards to cbd and some potential research around ptsd as well so we'll kind of have that in mind okay so here's the latest graph i could find in terms of where the u.s is at in terms of legalization and different programs using cannabis as you can see 36 states and four territories have now passed some kind of law legalizing cannabis this could this could include uh thc based cannabis or medical marijuana as that or cbd all of the above these 36 states 15 states and three territories have adopted laws legalizing marijuana or thc based cannabis for recreational use and this has really been increasing exponentially since about 2012. and you can kind of see looking at our country here how widespread is becoming and there's this real contrast at this point between what's still the case at the federal level which is essentially at least on the book scene viewing it as an illicit drug and what's the reality for the bulk of our country at this point in terms of using it medically in some form or even beyond that okay okay so i thought i'd start off just with kind of some uh vocabulary because even i get kind of confused with all the different terms and and what's what and that kind of thing so for viewers who maybe aren't too familiar the base of what we're talking about is the cannabis plant which has several different strains you know uh most often or the ones you'll hear about is cannabis sativa or cannabis indica and within that cannabis plant there's groups of different compounds uh chemical compounds and one of those groups of compounds is the cannabinoids and this is going to entail both the thc compound which is the well-known kind of psychoactive compound that leads to the different effects of intoxication you've heard of kind of etc a different group of compounds is the cannabidiol or cbd uh this is the most abundant uh cannabinoids uh compound group in hemp but it's also in you know the cannabis plant or cannabis uh sativa but it's non-psychoactive uh it doesn't lead towards the high or the different psychoactive properties that you might traditionally think of in marijuana so it's been extracted and it's similarized and used for different growing health purposes as we're going to talk about the term marijuana itself is probably you know maybe the most confusing here because it kind of means different things at different points marijuana can mean the same thing as just the cannabis plant you know the marijuana plant or more often it's probably used as meaning a thc based cannabis product you know marijuana something that has thc that's used and you're going to experience the psychoactive effect or kind of a high from it cbd can't make me high cbd can't make you high correct in general it shouldn't but as we'll kind of talk about it isn't a really important point actually that comes up is um how we don't really have the exact science and practice of ensuring the cbd purity and dosage so if you went to a common dispensary and bought cbd right now not knowing much about it if you don't really know how much thc might be in it uh some cbd products have a fair amount up to three four five percent of thc and then it's just labeled a cbd another one might have some minimal amount that's that's negligent has zero in it so part of the issue we're facing right now is exactly that we don't totally know exactly what contains what's in a very regulated trusting kind of way so cbd something labeled as a cbd product in general shouldn't contain at least too much thc that would have an effect but that's not something you never know so that's that's kind of an ongoing challenging question okay okay so let's take a look at uh cannabis use numbers in the states prevalence has been increasing along with that graph that showed legalization increasing prevalence of use has been increasing pretty steadily there's been a 45 increase from 2007 to 2014. more importantly is the increase in what's called heavy users these are individuals who would use cannabis daily or near daily that's kind of what we're going to talk about as a heavy user or beyond daily multiple times daily that's going from one and nine to over one in three from 1992 to 2014. so that's a big increase that means that the use among users within the use of users the bulk of cannabis consumption is increasingly becoming concentrated around a smaller number of heavy users more and more you know as time kind of progresses here maybe you're going to get to this later but um there's often been a distinction that when they talk about a reliance or addiction is that there's a difference between the daily user and the recreational user uh in terms of impact um and i don't know if you're getting to that later or okay yeah absolutely most of these kind of real serious impacts we're going to talk about are going to be connected to this general term heavy user like you're saying in that frequency of use yeah which ties right into the the next point here which is that quote-unquote self-medication or using cannabis in a way that's beyond infrequent recreational and is used in a way to regulate or modify your mood or your affect habitually and this kind of thing using cannabis or marijuana in that way in states with legalization uh among individuals with anxiety and move disorders is the highest so what that means is in states like mine in california the rates of people who are using marijuana in a way that's self-medicating habitually is higher than states that don't have this legalization status quite yet you can you know i guess about different reasons why that might be there's certainly the proliferation of the legalization happening there's dispensaries popping up all over the point all over the place there's even delivery points that can knock on your door and kind of deliver your your cannabis and that kind of way without even having to go out or drive or go anywhere there's shifting public perceptions around it it's increasingly seen as less stigmatized as having more of a therapeutic value it's an all-natural uh means towards you know health so to speak is kind of what the perceptions are shifting towards and there's reasons they're shifting in that direction but the reasons aren't necessarily based off the research we have available yet so there's something going on there that we can kind of dive into a little bit okay let's see okay here's an example so this is i just did a screen grab off of a common uh cannabis dispensary website and this is the kind of marketing that you'll be likely to find pretty easily related to thc based cannabis at this point this one kind of says conquer your social anxiety and you can see six different products of marijuana on the bottom there that they're kind of advertising as being the helpful therapeutic ones for social anxiety so there's this marketing and social shift towards really viewing this thing as you know kind of you know micromanaging your high and using this for social anxiety and this for insomnia anxiety and this you know this product's gonna be for that and this is kind of the uh social and commercial atmosphere that's happening and has been happening you know for a while now that we're going to see is kind of way over here but in contrast to the actual research which is still kind of way back here so this is just kind of give a sense of what people are actually seeing you know what they're looking at when they're buying their products and the way they're thinking about uh using cannabis before they're coming into your office or kind of on their own this is kind of the this is kind of the focus out there right now okay so as we know cannabis use is increasing and more and more people are using marijuana and cbd to help with their anxiety symptoms so let's look at some numbers around this anxiety ranks among the top five medical symptoms that north americans report using medical marijuana for a big study in 2019 found that more than half of u.s adults receive cannabis as having a medical use xthc and cbd here's here's the important one though results show that approximately 29 to 30 percent of thc marijuana consumption was used to reduce stress and anxiety so something something's big is going on there that the thc this is marijuana being used that frequently for the number one reason stress or anxiety participants reported using cbd to replace medications to reduce pain there is evidence supporting that stress and anxiety and for better sleep and thc again was used most to reduce uh stress and anxiety and isn't anxiety one of the ones on the list for medical marijuana approval kind of well i'm going to go into in a little bit more detail okay go ahead yeah i'm sure i'll get there but at this point no not you know evidence at least thc based uh marijuana not really indicated you know as having a lot of research to back it up okay so this is kind of a surprising result like as you're asking because this marijuana has gained this kind of widespread approval and a lot of people think that as a treatment for mental health conditions and it's been legalized uh for many therapeutic uses you know pain relief you know these kind of things nausea uh different diseases but the research isn't there in terms of anxiety you know and stress but it's being used in this way so what's going on so what does the research actually show like you're asking should i be using marijuana that again this is thc based cannabis products for my anxiety at this point scientific data does indicate the potential therapeutic value of or i'm sorry does one second my screen got locked here that should say um it is up there okay yeah so scientific data does indicate the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoid drugs primarily thc for several things pain relief control of nausea and vomiting and that being correlated in different kind of diseases and these kind of things and appetite stimulation you know especially in patients who might be undergoing chemotherapy or these kind of things can be very helpful for these things however a recent comprehensive review did not identify any really good quality literature that reported cannabis as an effective treatment for anxiety symptoms again that's thc-based cannabis beyond that frequency of use is associated with increased anxiety symptoms and future incidents of some problems in particular social anxiety disorder being one of them and we'll look at some more examples of this okay so despite the state of this research the public clearly reports using cannabis to reduce anxiety and it's increasingly viewed as an adaptive way to cope so why might this be one big reason is that low doses of thc do reportedly engender anti-anxiety effects you know this does happen out there this is you do see this and like you're saying a lot of people are going to report this and it's true low doses are going to probably in some most people sometimes uh reduce anxiety and offer kind of a relaxing effect however you as i'm sure everyone kind of knows you got to be careful because higher doses will do the exact opposite and they can often very commonly lead to increased anxiety panic um paranoia kind of feeling why um many people who i might meet with who described their first panic attack you know kind of describe something like this of having too much thc or being dehydrated and using thc and these kind of things so there's kind of this paradox with it where low dosage will probably be relaxing but higher doses are going to really totally do the opposite more importantly than that is that heavy use and chronic use like those heavy users we were talking about who use daily every other daily especially to regulate mood and affect it's going to build up in their system and there's going to be a sort of a dependence that happens where when they stop using or when they're no longer in taking thc there's likely going to be some withdrawal symptoms there's going to be anxiety altered appetite or sleep there's likely going to be irritability or kind of an irritable mood and irritable depression that can kind of develop and these are going to be very uncomfortable things and if the very reason that they were using thc was to kind of modulate some of those aversive feelings here they are coming back tenfold when they stop using what's going to happen further use so they're going to get caught in this cycle of kind of using it but it could become self-perpetuating of these very issues that they were looking to find help with around it so this is kind of partially what explains kind of this discrepancy between what the research shows and why it's so often viewed as a way of helping anxiety because a person might go through a particular night you know or moment and use it in a way that truly brought their anxiety down or they will they were able to cope with the social situation and they got through it by using it that way but there was kind of the devil in disguise there and that they were actually not ultimately helping themselves through something like an anxiety disorder by using it that way it was actually exacerbating the problem a lot of my clients say i i had my social anxiety but this helps me get out the door and helps me be social um and uh and so what's wrong with that right if i can't you know get out with without it what what should i do what am i supposed to do bingo and they're probably right at the outset that it does help them to get out the door right i mean it probably does kind of shift their mood or affect their physiology or thinking and they're able to get out the door that day by using thc using marijuana but is the disorder is the social anxiety decreasing over the long run in the course of their life or is what's actually happening is they're using it temporarily in that way but perpetuating the need for further use of it in that way and missing out on the opportunity to do something different which is of course what we do you know in developing skills like in cognitive behavioral therapy and finding alternative ways of identifying and altering and facing that fear in a way to truly tolerate it you know and overcome it they're kind of staying in the same place by using it to get out the door that way have you ever thought it can be combined in some way to to meet the needs well i think when it comes to thc probably not but as i'm going to get to there's potential too early to say but maybe you know using uh some combination with cbd might be effective more effective as kind of a combination i'll talk about that more in a bit but i wouldn't recommend it in terms of thc based cannabis products okay so we're kind of this is good because we're kind of already talking about this but this is um these are just some screen shots of a twitter feed i was randomly uh scrolling through at some hour of the night this week and uh the thread was around uh anxiety and cannabis and this just kind of shows some of the at times humorous but uh kind of perspectives of how people are thinking about cannabis use for anxiety so this one person says indica makes me so tired that i don't get anything done and that gives me more anxiety or another person wrote i prefer sativas so i can blame my anxiety on the weed instead of myself or another person wrote just like you said sativa is the only thing that gets me out of bed and allows me to talk to people without fear this person says oddly enough i have an anxiety disorder but indicas make me more paranoid so i prefer sativas is that weird question mark so these kind of show a couple points to me on the one hand it kind of shows that in terms of someone who wants to say is you know sativa the good thing for my anxiety is indica the good thing for my anxiety what's the right way to you know take it what's the good one uh there's no real answer you know someone might tell you there is but depending on the person the situation other compounds involved in whatever the product they're taking there's not anything close to a scientifically based answer to the rights weed for you in any particular moment or situation and the other one it kind of shows up people are thinking about it though this kind of is like yeah this is that research we saw that people are perceiving thc perceiving cannabis in this way that they can kind of fine-tune and is going to be helpful for their anxiety but again we're kind of recognizing the problems and challenges with that kind of uh approach to it here okay so we'll go from twitter to this more academic theory based model here this is by um buckner and his colleagues and what this is is just kind of a little bit more detailed and nuanced theory around this general idea of self-medication so this is a model for people with social anxiety disorder you know what the motivation for cannabis use or substance use you know would be so for example one person might want to smoke to get out the door to be able to socialize and there might be multiple layers of that they might be having many thoughts before they walk out the door of how am i going to look am i going to be judged is something bad going to happen am i going to know what to say in this social interaction am i going to get rejected they're flooded with these negative aversive anticipatory thoughts so by smoking or using the thc before walking out the door what happens to those evaluation fears they're just kind of able to be numbed out who cares yeah yes i don't have to think about that anymore and that's what it's doing or maybe the person's starting to feel incredibly nauseous or their stomach's becoming upset because of the anxiety before walking out the door so what does smokey do oh it calms their digestive system so they're managing their physiological arousal in that moment before walking out the door perhaps is to avoid social evaluation or some kind of negative social judgment oh everybody else is you know doing it so i'm going to avoid any negative social evaluation they might facilitate their social confidence in some kind of way or might just increase positive affect so there's multiple layers and if you're working with someone or even you know someone kind of learning this for themselves you want to think about in detail what's the function of this use for me without any pressure or judgment around it starting to think and observe how and why and what function is this serving or multiple functions does the serve in a particular kind of way and do i want to set myself up to create a dependence on this substance to manage this component here or you know if i want to find i'm involved in you know treatment or therapy or find help on your own or self-help it's like how can i know these functions and look to develop alternative skills to manage these evaluation fears manage that fear of judgment manage my physiological arousal what other pathways of targeting these components can you find for yourself and that's god that's kind of how i would um you know approach someone with this challenge here okay so in summary regarding uh thc danger is about over utilization particularly in heavy users for coping motivated cannabis use that's kind of would be my main thing to focus on take away from it the dangers they can create would be leading towards like i was just talking about to psychological dependence it's going to interfere with the possible learning that could happen by not using it and learning how to cope with those feelings and get out the door anyway which ultimately over the long run is going to maintain the symptoms of anxiety i can exacerbate the symptoms over time like we're saying through just maintaining the course of the disorder and even exacerbating physiological kind of withdrawal symptoms uh could potentially lead towards greater reliance on the substance or even an overt substance use disorder and there's especially high risk around chronic use in adolescence there's no reason are you going to say more about that um i i see a lot of that in my practice and and they're they're smoking alone and often to go to sleep uh or at the end of the day rather than in the socially anxious kind of situations of going out there it's kind of isolated uh alone um use yeah yeah especially if there's an adolescent who's in this kind of high you know high use you know daily to every other or or more then there's even some more recent research about how how dangerous kind of the long-term associations are with that things like depression earlier onset of psychotic symptoms these are the things that are being linked to intense adolescent use you know this is the time where the brain is still developing during adolescence and using thc with that frequency around that time is going to alter the wiring it can even impact uh there's some studies that can even impact iq scores you know permanently using it frequently around adolescents so if there's one thing to highlight to be wary of and intervene and trying to find alternative coping methods for it would be you know that kind of use in an adolescent [Music] okay so not necessarily encouraging therapeutic news for cannabis when it comes to thc based products but certainly some understanding of the nuances of it of how it works and the dangers of it to be aware of how about cannabidiol how about cbd what does the research show can i should i can i be using cbd for my anxiety well as terms of right now you know that same comprehensive review found limited evidence that cbd is effective for anxiety symptoms however in terms of this study limited is something uh it's these are kind of stringent uh terms that they use to define it basically it means that it's just it's brand new you know the research is picking up the past couple years but it's still really in its infancy and it's not grown to the point of having firm recommended proven recommendations for it for anxiety at this time that being said let's look into a little bit more detail on what some of these very initial studies and the directions you know they might point us in here and again we're talking about cbd so this is now the non-psychoactive compounds of hemp or of cannabis not the products that are going to be giving any kind of high shouldn't be at least that's kind of what we're talking about now okay so starting off there is this one study that showed cbd was shown to reduce acute anxiety assessed by a public speaking test in patients with social anxiety disorder so what happened was there was a you know group of patients who had social anxiety and they were kind of impromptu giving this performance task of giving a public speaking activity which of course would induce anxiety you know for people who had social anxiety disorder and the group that was given cbd right before acutely uh was shown to report that had an anxiolytic effect an anti-anxiety effect they reported less stress less anxiety giving that public speaking test versus the people with social anxiety who didn't uh receive the cbd who received a placebo so this is kind of the these were kind of some of the initial studies of what they're showing that acute administration at least initially it does lead towards kind of the subjective reduction in anticipatory or performance anxiety regarding at least most of them are around social anxiety it's an example of anxiety but it's kind of showing this overall anti-anxiety acute effect that it will kind of play and there's a couple of studies showing that you know at this point so that's interesting let's let's say these are going to continue and you know the evidence is going to build around it and we're going to kind of find that maybe cbd does offer this calming acute effect and that's something that's interesting but even with that i would say there's a difference we want to be aware of between uh what's helpful with reducing acute anxiety and what's actually helpful with something like social anxiety disorder the course of the disorder so we you know we want to think about everything in context you know in cbt we're always looking at what are you know what really needs to change whether what are the maintaining variables that are contributing to this disorder being maintained over time and one of them is typically avoidance avoidance of feeling anxiety avoidance of feeling anxiety and social interaction situations and again if we're taking something to reduce that anxiety every time habitually then we're still not going to necessarily develop the skills or shift in thinking or coping confidence that's going to actually relieve something like the whole disorder over time so it's interesting but we want to be kind of careful at that just based off the off of these i'd say you know if you're have something every now and again like a speech or a presentation or something like that and uh cbd is used every every now and then to kind of reduce it or perhaps if it was for anxiety around falling asleep if you used it once a month or you know periodically like that and it did have that calming effect for you then that might make sense but on the other hand the same i would argue the same principle applies that falling into using this habitually this is what i'm relying on to feel less anxious and without that those fears of mine are still just as real you're not going to tackle what really needs to be tackled to overcome you know something like a social anxiety disorder or a panic disorder or something like that but if it lets me get to the party doesn't it kind of wear off and i still have to use my skills once it wears off probably you will still have to use your skills once it wears off yes i would imagine you'll feel your anxiety will jump right when you notice it's starting to wear off and uh that might be a challenging scenario so yes it is good that it gets you to the party and that might be an interesting way of potentially using it you know if we were working with someone individually and that's kind of how we conceptualized and planned for it and the commitment was to still be there and use your skills or have an exposure to do something at the party uh perhaps it's better to get to the party with uh in that way without other than kind of not getting there at all you know if you can test it out and it would still be productive by the end of the night uh possibly possibly uh but on the other hand if we always need cbd and there's no growth beyond that if it stays like that then probably not but if it's in the service of building that exposure and confidence and eventually you commit and don't need it to get to the party then yeah maybe that would be a potential you know you could kind of work out with i'd want it to be in a very individualized kind of plan you know doing that with someone but possibly possibly okay good so this was another study a little bit different this study looked at adolescence adolescents 18 to 19 year olds in japan who had social anxiety and this was different from those other studies because this actually was over the course of four weeks and the individuals with social anxiety were just taking uh the milligrams don't get don't have the exact dosage off the top of my head right now just once per day over the course of four weeks compared to individuals with social anxiety who didn't take the cbd and you can kind of see these are two different uh social anxiety scales the two graphs and you can see on the one on the left the blue uh bars uh you can see the individuals who are taking cbd once per day reported a significantly decreased symptomology of social anxiety over the course of those four weeks same with the different social anxiety the level with social anxiety scale on the right individuals taking cbd once per day reported less overall social anxiety over the course of those four weeks so this is a little bit more interesting because it's not necessarily just taking it in that acute moment of performance or anxiety it's taking that's kind of overall a little bit more chronically which is encouraging that it's kind of showing these results but they're still no long-term follow-up on the study beyond those four weeks so we don't really know what happens continuing after that or if the cbd use stopped you know what happened from there so it's still kind of an initial study but interesting and good in the fact that it was more a little bit more of a chronic kind of use you know versus more acute use okay so here's some other interesting studies with cbd there's some initial evidence that cbd can enhance what's called extinction learning which means it might serve like you're asking about and we're kind of hinting at here in the future it might turn out to serve as a potential adjunct to behavioral therapies exposure therapies like what happens in cvt or behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders so what this kind of means is that using adding cbd to a behavioral kind of relearning process for example say someone was afraid of heights and in order to conquer their fear of heights they wanted to try to extinguish or create extinction learning around that fear or that conditioned stimulus so what they're going to do is we're going to expose to frequent and prolonged situations that involved kind of a progressive facing of fear of heights scenarios and what this study kind of demonstrated is that doing something like that but administering cbd even after some of that extinction learning had occurred so after those exposures had kind of shifted some learning that enhanced how strong that extinction learning progressed so what that means is that enhanced uh someone's ability to feel diminished anxiety around purifieds as an analogy but a situation like that this enhanced the learning to say that doesn't have to be as much of a threat for me and that's over the course of time you know that's kind of more uh longer term so this is really where i get interested in the potential of it because it might be able to find a way we don't know exactly the timing or the dosage or how yet but there might be ways of being able to enhance already proven evidence-based strategies to habituate to fearful scenarios or whether it's kind of a phobia or whether it's something like a trauma from the past connecting it back to ptsd there might be something there that helps reorganize the memory or in the learning or enhance it in ways to start to feel less less of a threat response to these built up fearful scenarios that people experience so this another study kind of showed a similar thing cbd may help produce an enduring reduction in learned fear expression when given strategically along with behavioral treatment so it's very initial a very it's very early on but there's could be this helpful contributory effect that cbd might play along with something like traditional behavioral exposure strategies to decrease fear expression to things like fear of social scenarios or feared past traumas or fear phobias or we might be able to find these areas where we can apply this and the benefits of it you need to learn more about exactly how but the benefits of really might help in the future to develop stronger treatments you know in terms of um other proven behavioral treatments for anxiety disorders so these are these are kind of the fascinating studies for me about the potential of this and if we can get this the studies going further and further where this might uh you know more nuance it and get some actual guidelines of direction what this actually might look like um these are these are kind of the exciting parts of it from from what i'm seeing here okay so let's kind of summarize a little bit the picture with cbd most current studies again still examine more acute single cbd dosing and healthy subjects so further studies are required to establish whether chronic dosing of cbd has similar effects well we still need to get more studies around that but overall you know the summary reviews really emphasize the potential value of cbd and treating anxiety disorders but i need to add to that we're nowhere near knowing exactly you know how when and having a protocol for it so there's need for further study of cbd in the treatment of anxiety disorders and what really needs to happen is we need to develop and standardize dosing studies to inform you know what the dosing strategy is going to be exactly which means how much when for which disorder and which situation for which patients etc again we don't still really have a clear way of determining the purity of cbd you know that we know we're getting cbd and the right one and the right dosage it's like we need to have ways of straightening that out but if we can kind of move in that direction um we'll be able to determine you know what cbd's place as an alternative as an alternative or again supplemental therapy of other evidence-based approaches like seaweed like cbt so it'll be interesting and fascinating to keep a watch and see how this uh this research and the subject progresses here okay so again here's my information and if there's any of course follow-up questions uh feel free to get in contact with me and i'll be happy to share what i know and what i learn more in the future uh dr young a number of people talk about using cbd for sleep and even ask about giving their kids a cpd for sleep what do we know about it helping sleep which is commonly going on with anxiety yeah depression well i think what the studies are kind of showing is that it does offer some of that's probably uh the only the only reference would be some of that acute anti-anxiety effect so if anxiety is the thing getting in the way of the sleep or falling asleep then it very well could offer kind of a short-term benefit of decreasing that anxiety which might allow someone to fall asleep you know easier but i'd offer the same cautions with it that using it in that kind of way um it might be better than you know the other prescribed sleep medications out there in the sense that i might have less side effects or potential for you know tolerance or addiction or other kinds of things but it still might not get to the heart of what you need for enduring skills and strategies or get to the heart of the problem for you know what's kind of driving the insomnia so it might help in the short term but i wouldn't recommend using it habitually at this point still or coming to rely on it or use it as a substitute for other great treatments that are still available out there to use that you know between cbt and mindfulness-based approaches and sleep hygiene and i would go to these places first you know certainly to try and develop that um in terms of children i wouldn't recommend that now i think there was like one one anecdotal uh study i found around using cbd for insomnia and a 10 year old but uh the studies are just kind of nowhere near frequent enough to kind of recommend around that for someone you know at that age certainly so i would i would stay away from that and if i find marijuana helpful for me how can i help getting not get dependent on it well when it comes to thc you know marijuana using it in that way do your best as soon as you can to kind of start to do what i was talking about earlier start to really look at and understand the function of use that it might be serving for you and if it's going down that road of leading towards kind of the quote-unquote self-medication or using it to modulate affect or anxiety or these other kinds of things then it's going to quickly go in a direction that's going to exacerbate the problem so i would recommend as soon as you can you know becoming aware of that you know trying your best to only use it in ways that aren't fulfilling that function so you know if you're using it recreationally or to relax or enjoy or whatever it is sporadically then that's another thing but i would recommend trying to alter the function of the use or if that's a real challenge to do and you kind of find yourself lacking the skills or ability to kind of do that on your own that would be the point in time where i'd recommend kind of reaching out for help whatever that's going to look like for you you know social help or friend help or therapeutic help that's the time to really say wait i can there are other skills and proven strategies i can develop to learn how to get out the door or to regulate this feeling or to cope with this situation let me try and explore those sooner rather than later before the self-fulfilled increased problems develop over using thc in that kind of way so that would be you know that'd be what i'd recommend for it and i know everyone's different but if i'm a parent and i know that my uh adolescent or young adult is kind of using daily and and using as i said alone what what sir what does that usually serve in your ex in your clinical experience um when you know when uh when there's daily use but it's really kind of solitary and and not when facing you know anxiety provoking or difficult situations yeah it it might not be related to a function of use for anxiety in that situation it might be probably not a social anxiety or something like that maybe they're just kind of using it on their own to regulate their mood you know or their affect or they're trying to regulate you know perhaps a depression by increasing that positive affect or that numbness or whatever that's coming along with it that would be the questions i would probably see as likelier to look into so you'd want to kind of formulate and kind of dive into you know trying to individually find the answer to that question with each person with each client i stay away from blankets kind of assumptions of why it's happening right try and dive into the details of what the actual thoughts and motivation and what it's actually doing it's a great question that's what we exactly need to find out for every person we're talking to is specifically what it's doing is it's shifting is it numbness is it shifting mood is it avoiding something that's all great helpful information to start to understand and and try and work with to find more helpful avenues to meet that need and one more question of um do you know anything about taking cbd along with other medicines not much research i'm aware of on that too much other than i know other than it can potentially interfere with some things but not that i've seen as being too much yet in terms of major red flags with it but it's i don't think the research is available that i know of or that i've seen to really give a strong answer i'd still be careful you know for sure taking other prescription medications or psychotropic medications i would certainly talk to my psychiatrist around it and not just start taking it that kind of thing potentially but um i'm not too aware of specific you know research on it well thank you dr elin this has been very helpful is there anything else you wanted to add before we finish up in addition to your presentation uh no that's it just to be excited to keep an eye on the research but to remain patient as the gap between the legality and the social scene of it uh is much farther ahead of the research right now so just to be aware of that gap and to be skeptical and patient before we catch up to actual real you know kind of recommendations for this but to be excited about cbd and the potentials at the same time well thank you very much thank you my pleasure", "whDNJbZtXgY": "hey what's good everybody jay ping here checking in respectmyregion.com here today to do a quick taste test pre-roll joint review featuring the hash bone one gram infused pre-rolled joint i'm excited to review this i've heard a lot of great things over the last year or so about this company about their products this is specifically the cookins slash lemon jack 32.95 thc it's gonna hopefully taste lemony i'm hoping for a little bit of cookies i'm hoping for a little bit of jack if it doesn't have any cookies hopefully it still is just gonna be an electric electric lemon jack strain um let's see manufactured on october 30th 2020 it's got a about a year and a week long shelf life uh what does it say remove protective seal twist open cap light and enjoy one superior one super quality pre-rolled hash cone single serving one gram at hash bones oh ingredients 25 bubble hash 75 flour and then a natural paper cone so yeah here we go hollister cannabis the hash bone here we go the way that we do these taste test reviews is pretty simple 10 points 10 categories um 10 points a category 100 point review this is more focused on taste tests and so this is going to be more about the quality of the flour the taste of it all um it's that's going to weigh heavier on the final score so tap in follow like subscribe respect my region on all places smash that like button because here we go one hit you all know the rules i'm gonna talk about it two hits give you the score three hits score out of a hundred let's go dry hit has turps that's good i taste that lemon i taste that jack that's starting off solid already you know wasn't packed overly tight right away that's important all joint smokers should be massaging their joints anyways when you buy them pre-rolled but this one wasn't too bad didn't need a crucial massage all right here we go you guys you definitely get that hashiness the first hit it overpowers the flour flavor let me try it again i'm just really not getting that lemon jack flavor on the on the flour i'm getting whatever the bubble hash is if it's cooking's i don't know and that's what's kind of confusing is is the lemon jack the flower or is the cookin's the flower uh what are the terpene profile on this you know there's some questions that i have about the product just based on presentation and then now smoking it i'm definitely getting the bubble hash and i thought i originally tasted some lemon jack terps but maybe down here towards the bottom is where the flour is going to burn better let's try it let's try to get a little bit more one second y'all all right so with that said four or five smokes hits whatever it is i've got a score in my mind for the taste the taste on this is really a 7.5 because it's not tasting like a strain it's just tasting like you know a joint with some hash so on the taste of 7.5 on the potency and the appeal and the rest of the experience i give it eights to nines across the board and my final score is going to end up being you know this isn't this exact pre-roll is probably an 8 out of 10. i think it's going to be energetic it's definitely high potency but i'm just not getting the strain specific uh flavor profile and so because of that 75 on the taste i'll give it an 80 out of 100 on the final score so big shout out to hash bones the infused joint we've got bubble hash 25 and then 75 flour so this is a potent product i really i do enjoy it and it's a pretty solid so you know definitely go check it out let me know what you guys think in the comments be sure to like follow and subscribe uh respect my region

I'll just do some b-roll but another one ghost train hey that's what I got ghost train Hades I know something but I think welcome got like 81 percent to eighty seven percent I got both of them it was overall pleasant experience with the city Canada so give it like two thumbs up pretty simple I know this really fight doesn't matter to other people in other states it should like that because they're dispensaries aren't like that they don't operate like it's a banking [ __ ] but out here in [ __ ] Illinois act like the Spencer is our bank and you know there's like a security door behind a security door behind another security door what is good YouTube and we're back like I said I just got back from Windy City cannabis right now I got so this is what I miss using to smoke this is not a really

just probably last me a month I use mine tickling too however they have much for you as far as like a player for flavor program which I taste this [ __ ] one more time I can't really taste much out of this I'm not really getting like a cake taste oh no matter like look up and let you guys know like whether that actually works I don't really taste nothing cake wise as far as like wedding cake but uh I do feel something is usually pretty instinct with cars it's just like this literally just like smoking flour which has been my experience still early just like smoking flour so yeah I just be starting to feel some already that first day I took what was pretty was pretty damn massive but yeah and that man I'm gonna let you guys know I like I said hey buddy taste it tastes just a bit sweet but I outside of that any taste nothing I'm for real but eighty percent THC it is a hybrid I saw an indica and sativa and yeah other than that miniature boy man I appreciate you guys supporting the content two channels still steadily growing steadily growing and I'm just nothing but appreciated appreciate it to you guys and I've been in my experience that Windy City cannabis I give it two thumbs up as far as like I had like a bad experience I went to security guard but outside of everybody was cool most people was cool just like one little bit it didn't really blow it I still recommend though they're cheaper than the ones are that's gonna say that cuz they have yeah overall great experience I give this to thumbs up with them filling it for sure outside that man should I pick although I'm out under that this pan yo and I feel like my face is melting off right now", "y-euSNlMtZY": "but there's no yet yeah why don't you do more expensive weed well I got to show you guys some budget strains I say budget strains and I really only mean the difference of ten dollars so far air rise has taken that place as the hey I'm going into an Illinois dispensary and I don't want to spend sixty to sixty-five dollars on an eighth izes there with that being said I've noticed some of their strains have a lower THC percentage I think that we can see the math there they're not exactly going to offer that 35% you know punch you in the nose make you [ __ ] your pants buds oh no oh oh no no no I don't want I'm so sick [ __ ] there Jesus Christ fine I'll get on the [ __ ] ground ah this is this is what it takes Tropicana cookies by air rise I've seen y'all post about this all over Instagram waitin to get my piece well it's finally here I I'm really excited for this one this is a fifty dollar eight this is not one of the usual top-shelf ones I grabbed from Verano I think it might start storming out here I'll hit you guys with the genetics on this one because to be honest on have no idea but with the name maybe it's cookies crossed with Florida orange that would be really funny if I got that exactly right it's time for the first sniff you already knew that with a name like Tropicana I'm hoping for some really nice orange Terps let's check it out [Laughter] it's even better than the mimosa Oh enough talking you just got it I can't hide this little secret in here from y'all any longer before I grind down these nubs of Tropicana cookies into a first taste I wanted to point out look at this guy holy [ __ ] now I don't know anything about Tropicana's lineage or genetics at all but it's got to be mostly sativa with how these buds are formed very loose but oh my goodness they are so so incredibly frosty pushpop Flintstones pushpop is the smell I'm getting off of this I really wish you all could be here well it's absolutely pouring rain over here in Chicago we've got some plans to go out tonight and there's no way leaving this house without trying the Tropicana cookies I can't be smelling these insane citrus and fruity chirps and not get a little bit of a taste so I'm very lucky to have the MJ Arsenal cache as my smallest piece and thankfully the one that I can really use as a taster man so he'll Bonet and try this out what you think about that bag hmm oh man that's that's the Terps I'm looking for in smoke to God let me go ahead and tell y'all worth it absolutely worth it the Oh little musky little gassy almost little fermented fruit and a lot of similar terpene profile to the forbidden fruit Tropicana cookies air eyes let's go wait last thing I'll say the Tropicana cookies is so aromatic that just being over the bomb right now really all I can smell is that like Flintstones pushpop orange guava GRA penis coming off of the buds seriously some of the most flavorful buds I've had gun fruit gum dude oh love it went ahead and grabbed that round two of the Tropicana cookies by air rise look what I'm greeted way it's gang those are some yeah that's a real fruit salad right there that's a real fruit salad of colors textures shades but I mean it's been a wild ride it's been a ride with this air rise Tropicana cookies who doesn't want to see such beautiful colors in there bud but more importantly this stuff is pure jelly it's absolute fruit on the musk coming off of this right now is heavy fruit punch heavy orange I mean come on yeah that's about what I thought we would be a fool to not notice those beautiful hairs that are joining out of the top of that gosh look at that that is crazy I'm getting real Mac vibes off of this with how dusty is we I've been [ __ ] recording man dog threw up in the second bedroom like in the bed but I moved into a two-bedroom one-bath place and my family never comes to visit me and it's for my dog I essentially got a bedroom for my dog all right so uh Tropicana cookies well as we saw it's been a while since I've hit that beaker and especially anything gosh I'm confusing the beaker with this beautiful son of a [ __ ] the Voyager so switched over cuz throw it's a little raw after screwing up that hit let's see that triple percolation of this can help me out no not even a cough that is why I [ __ ] bought this here from me to you just to let you see how [ __ ] stoned I am offer this Tropicana cookies taking these two hits come on that ruined me hey THC is [ __ ] no it's not [ __ ] but when it comes to quality cannabis to make a large assumption of a sub 20% strain can leave ya looking like me I didn't think the 17% would really affect me at all dang this stuff is awesome I'm so relaxed I cannot wait to eat some lunch even though this is a sativa dominant", "NLRgAVod3kQ": "well it's about that time again time for another spin of the bangle of buds here we got two delta nines on here we got the palmetto under the other shred the tropic thunder shuffling up here here we go come on headband give me that headband [Music] oh apple fritter delta nine that's a nice exciting one i'll try that here it is delta nine fresher new on ocs apple fritter it's a hybrid and we got what's the percent ooh 21.46 percent that's nice it's a package to eat on here looks like november the 23rd so about a month ago that's all right that sounds like there's a big butt in there and maybe some small ones anyways though i'm very excited i've been waiting for this delta 9 to show up for a while because they have a bunch of strains that are really cool sounding and they're new on ocs so that's really cool anyways first thing though we gotta check out is the scale make sure it's all calibrated perfectly so you can check it with a 50.00 gram weight and we got perfect there 50.00 so yeah all ready for this apple fritter so on ocs this stuff here is pretty good price for something so new 3.5 of this is only 24. so it's freaking awesome anyway so we're all ready to check it out here so uh let me just zero this and now it's time for apple fritter from delta nine and apple fritter's actually one of my favorite kind of donuts so i'm really hoping it tastes like a donut apple fritter holy fuck this thing is hard to open wow these are really weird containers if you push it down too much you can't open it if you don't push it enough you can't open it you gotta push it the right amount anyway oh yeah hey [Music] oh wow that is a nice smell that's very nice hmm that's awesome what a nice smell this kind of have a little bit of an apple to it maybe here we go let's see come on delta nine impress me so close delta nine is there any more in there fuck it's just underweight by 0.01 wait a minute did it get over no it didn't i thought it did but that was just the air no so it's just under it's as small of just under as you can possibly be there we go look there's a couple little scraps in there little bits and we got these four tiny ones this small one that's medium one and this other medium one wow does it ever look nice though look at that look at the cool purples and all that stuff and i can't wait to check this out with a microscope very cool anyways let's check it out with a microscope so this is the outside of the apple fritter and it is nice looking very nice looking it's almost got a nice glaze on it like an actual apple fritter a donut which i love um [Music] [Laughter] it looks really awesome i love the purple man that looks so cool that almost looks like a black leaf right there might be like black mamba or something that's one another one of my favorite strains black mamba i was had that long time ago so good yes here we go some more close-ups here of uh these things see there's like they kind of look kind of old all crinkly and stuff but you know whatever it smells nice this stuff so um delta nine's been around for a long time it just recently showed up in ontario so the weed here is probably not super new it's probably just packaged recently who knows though it looks decent looks good yeah so maybe i'll break open this one here and uh we'll we'll see what it looks like and um we'll see what it looks like when i break it open here we go wow nice hard hard nuggets so here's a look inside these things looking pretty good look at that look at all the tricoms they're clear mostly on the inside some more looks so cool looks so cool look at that wow there we go got some nice close-ups here on these guys oh my god look at these guys look at that that's so cool looking yeah the inside mostly clear the outside mostly cloudy very nice looking very nice smelling so awesome anyways i'm gonna go and try this out now i can't wait i love apple fritters and i've been waiting so long for this delta nine stuff to show up so i'm gonna go check this out and i'll be right back so i just got in from this delta nine apple fritter at 20 what was it 21.46 percent and um i can't believe it but this stuff actually does taste like apples or have like an apple sort of taste to it um it's kind of like i couldn't figure out what type of apple it was either i was like i was kind of leaning towards granny smith but at the same time it's a little different it doesn't have that same little sourness to it or whatever but um it kind of reminds me of like apples but also at the same time apple trees it's kind of like the smell that you have uh when you're uh in an apple orchard picking apples so i'm just freaking crazy that it tastes like apples i can't believe it i didn't quite get the fritter but i got the apple part yeah anyways wow impressive taste as for the high on here though it says 21.46 but it sure doesn't feel like it's quite a low sort of between low and medium the high on here it's a little disappointing in that area so the buds are real nice they're like really super hard see [Laughter] and they uh they sure look nice this one here in that one breaks up decent and uh yeah it's not overly dry it's not wet it's not super dry it's good but at the same time high is just a little disappointing so i don't know i think i might if would i buy this again probably not but um i'm not saying it's bad because i i've i'm really impressed by the taste uh it's just that it doesn't quite get where i want to go it's not powerful enough for what i want which is unfortunate because i wish it was if it was i would buy this a lot because the taste is so cool and it looks so nice it's just too light for me

bill and carbon footprint as a grower for some of you this is a matter of saving money or environmentalism for others it's a matter of stealth so I'll try to speak to both the crowds it starts with the ideal house for you grow in terms of efficiency and that ideal house tends to be one with a basement electric heating and a wood-burning stove all those elements increase your control per room your first step is doing a once-over of the house in which the grow is in and seeing how electrically efficient it is an average apartment in the US should use up about 200 kilowatt hours per month and the average house about a thousand kilowatt hours your computers are often enemy number one did they go to sleep when you don't use them check the power options is your hot water tank at its lowest safe setting which is usually fifty five Celsius do you have a programmable thermostat have you changed your furnace filter recently are you able to turn off the heat dry setting of your dishwasher that portion of the dishwasher cycle uses up the bulk of the electricity now check the fridge and freezer settings could those be turned down a little bit and finally get LED lighting for the house it's good practice to wait for a good sale at the hardware store and then doing all of the bulbs in the house all at once though I'll try to link to a good wholesale pack for you guys in the description now for the actual grow so first off don't steal electricity that's easily detectable nowadays with electronic smart meters step 1 is your lights the most energy consuming aspect of your setup my advice to switch from HID to LED if you haven't already done so if you're still skeptical on LED grow lights please check out my episode Alida basics because you might be surprised at how far LEDs have come at minimum use a digital ballasts over a magnetic ballast and the digital ballast should be dimmable as well also avoid gas or diesel generators it's almost never worth it if you do use a generator make sure that it's a automated one and liquid-cooled if it's a larger generator and that you're not running it at any more than 60 to 70 percent of its maximum capacity that's a safety tip to Honda is a good brand of generators by the way an increasing number of growers are also using solar panels to offset their electric costs to some degree or to have a backup as far as how you run your lights if your grow is a multi-stage one or a little bit larger you can run the lights on in one room during the day and in another area at night and that makes the grow a lot trickier to detect even with electronic smart meters next is the heat coming off your grow most people do generate some heat and you can use it in the winter you can exhaust the air out of your grow room through a carbon filter and into the rest of your house instead of outside to heat your home this is extra easy with a basement Gro next are your fans both oscillating and exhaust people often way overdo it with the oscillating fans having too many or having them blowing too hard they're only meant to move air around they can up stems by causing minor plant movement if they're glowing your fan leaves all over the places too much also a fan whether it's oscillating or exhaust uses up way more watts at full blast than at half speed if your fans don't have a half speed function that's okay there's variable speed changes that can help a link to those as well finally there are your pumps air and water there's not too much can do about pumps because odds are that you need what you're using but make sure that you're using those home splitters and well-reviewed air stones on the air pumps in order to use them efficiently and the pump isn't too powerful a small efficient dual diaphragm air pump is plenty for most personal growers needs in terms of oxygenating a reservoir or a deep water culture hydro system on water pumps make sure you're utilizing timers and appropriate mist heads to limit how hard and how often your water pumps even need to turn on and that's about all I could think of but use your imagination at the peak of prohibition indoor cannabis growers supposedly used up

can change them today we're going to be talking about cura leaf's entrance into the european market we're also going to be talking about several bills that are making their way around i mean there's bills popping up all over the country but one in florida is not very cool so we're going to be talking about that and we're going to answer a question from uh dm we received from windy city growers about lobbying so let's just get right into it hey tom hey mickey happy birthday i tell you though that florida it's terrible when it comes to their laws about limiting the thc concentration but the florida crosses uh the florida orange crosses from revolution just smells so nice hey guess what we got on the show next week everybody oh my god i can't wait yeah highness himself the highness smash the likes and hit subscribe and then you'll get noticed next week when we uh go live with tommy trump and i got my first sponsor my first weed sponsor which just means free weed what what's your first weed sponsor dude washington butco is gonna so i hit up three uh my favorite we grows because you know doing this thing the the influencer slash whatever you know people are gonna question like sponsors and and promotions and whatnot but honestly dude you can do a win-win you can you can promote a product and not sell your soul like the product i.e being cannabis but uh you know i got the washington budco is going to be hooking me up and i can't wait to share their product on the on the show yeah washington budco is is nice i'm sure uh i i'm not going to be able to play smell-o-vision with washington bud co next week but just fred and then we'll also have to see what tommy's smoking on uh he'll probably be joining us from la hopefully he's got some wonderful and why wouldn't he why wouldn't he have good wi-fi i mean it's a pretty pretty good show tune in we have a lot of news that came up and uh we passed 20 subscribers on this uh on this little ship of the channel that's so funny dude i mean just this little you and me i still wanted to call it two guys in one mic but it's all right that's fun you know what we're getting so old now that that uh two girls one cup or two guys you know one cup one mic uh those types of references are going to get less and less obvious to people which are fine with me i do not need people to know what that reference means but let's get back to it though i mean curly's entrance into europe european cannabis markets it's kind of a big deal right 280 million dollars oh my god this is one of the reasons why oh let's let's get to the stock news we have a we have a cut that we can do on this let's uh let's do our little bumper with the stocks uh moving into the stock news yeah currently enters the european cannabis market in a 285 million dollar deal uh curl leaf holdings which is of course the largest market cap of all the cannabis stocks that you can buy right now over the counter uh and currently market valuation is i believe 11 billion in change and so yesterday it was up like 17 percent uh and then today it's down about five percent and all the pot stocks have just started to dump off a cliff since it became obvious that they are not going to be legalizing at a federal level anytime soon and that's one of the problems with these types of weed stocks is it's just so speculative you know this this thing comes up is this going to have any real value because like the the the european cannabis market's really not that big no but i think the potential for what they have it's going to be greater than the united states because they can travel so uh kira lee's holdings agreed to buy a mac life sciences ltd for 285 which i think is kind of a low entry bar to this industry when it's already been producing billions of dollars in tax revenue right like like currently if only like i clipped i think like 184 million dollars worth of medical say or cannabis sales last year so we pull up the curl leaf chart and see what their quarterly results are to determine whether or not they have acne like year-over-year growth to be able to um account for like a 17 pop in the stock in one day uh however it probably isn't going to be much of anything um we'll see you know curly can immediately start selling his cbd products in europe's and plans to bring thc products and its select brand oh yeah the curry leaf select brand never heard of it but markets through the deal yeah but you know unlike in the u.s where the company can't move federally illegal cannabis across the state lines kiriley's products can be shipped anywhere in the euroboc through the emac their their network so uh appropriate licensing i thought they could only move their cbd products not their uh thc products well i imagine uh this was in bloomberg so i'd imagine there's there's they're working on it you know because in spain uh they have uh like what spannabis it's a huge you know canvassing new out there it's i mean as much as the ignorance still prevails you know you still have gw pharmaceuticals and all these other people you know making a [ __ ] ton of money out there and they're not so ignorant or stupid i guess over there oh we'll see you know it's one of those things where these licenses they tend to become uh less expensive over time and so it implies which you know this isn't necessarily the best implication ever that there would be fewer licenses and limited markets in the future but they just raised all this money and then they spent all that money to acquire this and then it makes the stock go up because why oh they have the right to buy stuff in europe now yeah i mean that's all that is that look at that so that's your home group that's uh oh that's yeah that's some homegrown that's some florida purple homegirl right there medically cannabis right medically hungry yeah that's right medical homegirl it's the way to do it in illinois then uh so we also got a biden's usda secretary gives final approval to hemp rules despite ongoing industry concerns yep the emp rules have been finalized and so we saw those final rules come out there's actually some really nice uh some really nice changes that happened to the final rule from the interim rule and therefore it could be worse it could be worse by a few leaps and bounds because the final rule allows for a difference in the um level of negligence and so the level of negligence has been moved from point five uh percent thc to one percent thc which should provide for like the vast majority of the genetics that are out there as uh as hemp cultivars and then of course the disposal and remediation and so now let's say your hemp comes in a little hot and by that i mean like you're you're over the point five percent total uh you know just throw some more um stalks in and chip it all up and put in some more fan leaves and then test it so that it's it goes back down like your total cbd count might go from like 20 down to 15 or something but then your thc count might go from like 0.5 down to 0.1 which is nice and so now they are allowing uh the hemp farmers to be able to recapture uh and remediate their non-compliant plants with that remediation they're gonna also be able to you can do an extract right and then and create that limit of whatever potency you think it should be uh i don't think they allow you to do the extract i think just allow you to mix stuff back in and then retest it and then once you have then you have to do the extract yeah well still what a painting has though it's like you fill a test like at school they give you a second chance you're like come on i got i know all the answers were right there but it's just it's just the regulations it's just the regulations that's really the problem yeah yeah not exactly and then yeah that's what we call nice things man yeah yeah that's one of the problems all right we have it's agriculture secretary tom vilsack so we're actually going back to the future he was um barack obama's agricultural secretary as well and he's an ally of the hemp industry and so this this new reg takes effect on march 22 as originally planned so this crop year it appears that we're going to be under the new usda regs and so they released these rules yeah so they released them back when did they release that rule i want to say it was august of last year or something like that because they had public comment periods and all sorts of things and they came up the final rule uh the final rule was released back in january so yeah you see like even if we had um federal reform for cannabis it would be like this it would take years after the law has changed because then they have to come out with all the regulations because marijuana is not him marijuana is not him that's right sthcn wait wait wait yeah they are both yeah in the end though you know the process is long and so here in washington the homegirl lost again it's gonna get wide it's just got buried again never made it out of the committee so yeah it takes a long time to shape things up to have that infrastructure it'll be a bit so we also have chicago or do you want to go stay on the uh on the uh the hemp topic no we'll go to chicago all right let's go chicago weed giant illegally took pot to arkansas in whole food salad containers federal suit claims ronald holding okay uh well i just think it's hilarious that verano and verano are they're probably getting torched right now i mean all the the cannabis companies are getting torched right now on the uh the trading floor for the stocks today but yeah chicago company worth roughly 3 billion with sued monday in federal court as part of a sweeping racketeering complaint that accuses the company of illegally trafficking marijuana from illinois to arkansas well how so they're sued but no one like raided what what what what what is this how civil but like isn't there a person behind verano like let's this was my thing about legalization and recreation was huh sammy dwarf is his name i'm just saying rich people don't want to go to jail so if they fix the freaking law go to jail this is freaking ridiculous well actually tom and john could talk about that rich people still go to jail oh yeah he wasn't the biggest fan of it you know he wasn't the biggest fan of jail i don't think anybody goes yeah granted jail like but he had some great stories about him and jordan belfort and you know him riding in wall street in jail while he was serving with tommy chon but uh anyway the lawsuit tireds dozens of cannabis executives and companies including our verano ceo george archus and harvest health and recreation and eris an arizona firm uh harvest is like one of the largest operators out of arizona that attempted to acquire verano for 850 million in march of 2019. uh i do not have a copy of the complaint if anybody wants to get me a copy of the complaint i can read it and be like this is what the state is asking for in their prayer for relief uh i'm not currently involved in litigation and i'm fine with that but i spent about a decade in litigation i'd be interested though but like like again back to why are they being like you know a business should be rated it just it just hurts my brain that you have a federal state to state case here that should involve verona being shut down period not not not being litigated over court or like you know they could lose their license you know if this is a federal crime uh and then again like in the future when these types of things break make sure that we get a copy of the complaint for them so that i can read that and be like this is what they're asking for that's one of the problems with like newspapers is that they're not staffed by lawyers uh and and so then you can't you know necessarily get the the kind of analysis you get from like actually reading complaint and so there's actually a plaintiff so nicholas nielsen worked for the cultivation center in newport arkansas which was managed by harvest as the company worked in lopstep with verano as the acquisition was pending this sounds like a butt hurt investor that's trying to take action to squeeze or exert some type of influence from the actual license holders but uh we'd have to see and so like you know from the way that i was reading it i'm like all right first is this a federal suit and by a federal student is this prosecution right here that is prosecution it just seems like it's a contractual b for some type of beef between these two people it's another reasons why i'd like to read the complaint you know before i well the accusation there is is of course that they're they're also uh diversion right like like this person's saying i'm i'm growing a bunch of plants for this big company worth a billion dollars like it does seem like a petty employee really it's not not a a federal case that's being uh you know government coming after them it's not a federal case the government's not coming after him it's this nicholas nielsen guy and so he worked for the cultivation center like where does he fit in how much stock did he open or own and then it says the 2020 police rate of nielsen's home uncovered 28 harvested pot plants in his garbage can all right cool and so now did he like bring them in he's like hey police this wasn't me it was these guys but you know i have no idea and so like neil nielsen was then arrested and charged after the cops found two more plants inside his home oh that's terrible two whole plants humanly christmas call the dogs uh this claims that those plants were actually being cultivated for harvest greenhouse while awaiting approval from state officials that's very convenient the stude claims that the nielsen's home was allegedly grown from clippings brought to arkansas by michael frontier a verano employee who was allegedly instructed by his employer to take young cannabis plants from an unnamed verano facility in illinois and transport them to arkansas that's derelict in the sense that why aren't these uh genetics like at least stabilized in some forms of seeds uh why are you gonna be flying clones you know coach that doesn't make any sense but why arkansas too i'm just trying to write a highly limited market and so verano probably used its um money to get a license in in arkansas i mean a lot of the illinois operators use their money to get licenses in arkansas cresco gti revolution uh probably also verano and so that you know there's three million people that live in arkansas it is a limited market state for only medical really kind of sucks so if like arkansas ever goes wreck it will be dominated by those five companies well i got you but again it doesn't seem like a diversion issue or it could be a diversion issue if you think about it like but and all these recreational and all these markets recreational medical that that initiate right that they always have this grace period right where everything magically appears the seeds the the cannabis never existed before until you signed that law in place that's right until the uh the zoning commission and then the department of agriculture or the cannabis regulatory commission they give that stamp of approval and your license becomes operational magically cannabis just appears a stork brings it very often you know like just like babies you know they just happen and so the stork comes in that's what it looks like it looks like this is uh some guy named nielsen gets popped for multiple felony charges in arkansas and then for him to get leverage against that um prosecution against him brings in uh verano and harvest health as uh probably had to join them in a suit and then and then but then what he would have to remove to federal court to like get jurisdiction over these other um uh of operators that aren't native for or residents of arkansas again like well nilsson by reading complaint is one of the most important things that a lawyer can do when he's trying to explain to you what's going on yeah well it says here nielsen who's facing multiple felony charges in arkansas has told law enforcement officials that he would definitely testify against frontier verano so it seems like ron's been putting it on their employee as far as like a like a front right like a like you're you're going to help get our business started oh [ __ ] you got caught um i don't know you bro you know it's all good then uh oh here's that one though that we were talking about the uh the beard bros article uh about the al said mid-men zex the new gig represents everything wrong with corporate cannabis and this is about you know uh the beer bros had a great how before actual the structure of recreational um uh cannabis uh you know your reputation precedes you whether you grow good weed and your weed spoke for itself or if you had shitty weed or if you were a shitty uh business person uh you know there was a network and people talk and they still do technically but unfortunately like how do people like people part of men men that started out this this shitty company that had no success and yet still probably acquire another six-figure salary right how do you [ __ ] up and still get a job that bad well it depends on how well capitalized you are but why like what gets them the foot in the door was that you think they paid for the pay to play yeah that you raise money from investors right but so are they just dumb investors i mean what's going on here that these guys yes there are dumb investors out there and so like they you know probably raised some money from some less than smart people uh and uh there you go but you know it's just one of those things where uh you know it not every cannabis company is about operations a lot of them are about acquisitions and assets and so like you know um those types of companies that are about acquisitions and assets and the image and like appearance and it's all real estate play or or what have you uh then you get your amendments right and that's what i mean like the the industry that you think like as a um somebody coming from a traditional market legacy market uh that experience uh you know you have these like you know that cannabis is commodity i paid 25 to save for an eighth so then a quarter is going to be fifty dollars uh a half a hundred and a whole ounce two hundred now and then of course you negotiate with your salesman sometimes you're like hey the more i purchase can i get more of a a refund right this is like the learning basics of business without any uh taxes and all that stuff so i think most people have an idea that any cannabis company that starts is going gonna be a reputable grow slash someone that's there for the plant itself and it's unfortunate when you see these like i want to say shell companies because they're not there's no substance to this there's no actual culture there's no um it seems like it's like funnel money like like hey i'm a rich person i need to funnel some money i know you're gonna [ __ ] it up that's okay it's expected like this is what's wrong with the world man yeah there's a lot of these uh and they're quite great at raising money it's kind of like you know curl leaf what did they do well they raised a whole bunch of money and then they spent it buying all these licenses in europe and what's the value of those licenses yes yeah but don't don't people google we can google around people there's no it's it's just greed and so it's called accretion they use words like that value-add that's another big one or like you know accretion where they they say oh the the sum of these two parts it's not gonna be two plus two equals four it's gonna be like nine and then um you get you get that type of stuff but uh so what is this beard bros company i see that med men is a um a real estate company that dabbles in the cannabis markets but uh you know uh so beer burns got a great blog i think they they're actually a store in a garden down there the thing about the california culture is a lot of these guys have uh uh uh blogs like uh one time uh rest in peace mickey martin was a uh in the early days of medical had a blog called weed activists and uh guy was just savage and just call people out left and right and uh that was the essence of like because he was also in edibles and doing all sorts of things so beer bros are just another legacy um grow that i believe in the recreational market now so they're a good source for california culture and news oh okay so then um beard bros says it's hard to argue that there's a less popular cannabis brand these days than men men how much do you think med men paid for that for the publicity or that for that blurb no good these five bucks 20 000 it's hard to argue yeah i mean it's just they had such great promise right they got the the spike jones video that represented like the the new cannabis culture the new consumer they were trying to they had a lot of blah blah blah intentions but there was nothing of fruition that came out of them except for one little video like i just don't get how these people still succeed in the industry like like it's just it's it's sad and frustrating to see wealthy people where we're like they're saying here in the article a lot of your legacy people can't even afford half these license they can't even get their foot in the door i don't know i don't know tell you what why don't we take a 420 break and then let's look at that verano lawsuit there's actually a pretty interesting chart and graph that we can go over to like point fingers at people and then we can keep ripping on med men or we'll we'll move on to the mexico news probably move on to the mexico loot news but just a second here's the lawsuit um it's a civil action in the united states district court for the first district of colorado again doesn't make much sense uh because like then whoa why do they follow in there well this is kind of normal um and it's not necessarily the worst nose bleeding um uh chart that you'll ever see when you have an mso and so then you have you know marijuana profits marijuana profits going to and from uh the first circle right there is verano llc the the one to the far right is harvest health inc you can see one of them is not an llc and then at the below it's natural state wellness enterprises llc that's probably the um uh the arkansas uh company that was right there and then it's it's just where they they move all the monies and and so those monies kind of go around allegedly according to these um charts and graphs there and so like they siphon off profits they provide uh financial and operating capital uh for people off of them and then uh you know it's it's one of those deals where it'll be interesting to like actually read this whole thing to see exactly what he's alleging and why and then it's it's a rico action uh a private action in rico and so like this guy's getting prosecuted pretty heavily in um uh arkansas sort of like try to offset whatever type of risk he has there he's like all right well i'll bring these people in but now these guys get to like appear and then their lawyers will say oh this should be dismissed and so like this litigation will now get exceedingly expensive uh including for uh with the plaintiff here which is a nicholas nielsen who's also being prosecuted in uh arkansas which is gonna make like affording this a little bit difficult because lawsuits can go on for years if not decades and and be thoroughly briefed before you can actually get to questions of law to get you actually out of those but that's very interesting he's got uh some emails uh attached here and then you know uh some other allegations in the complaint about the transporting across the state lines frontier airlines i'm assuming huh or is frontier one of the the actual things that was defined earlier on if you like this sexy uh mso content you gotta like subscribe right that's right don't forget that where we get to go over um uh more more fun stuff about uh okay who's fighting for what and and how uh but you know that's some news that's going on and that's some litigation that'll probably continue to happen yes they try to enforce the laws in a particular state and somebody gets arrested and then these other msos were playing fast and loose uh well allegedly playing fast and loose uh and we'll see how the facts bear out on this yeah no kidding that'd be interesting to see that that's definitely going to be one of those ones that might uh set a precedent right for how to operate in a multi-state right i mean it could be it could be interesting in the sense that you know these uh operators are trying to get their genetics in various other locations from one state to another and so like how do you do that like if you're if you're an operator that's got a licensing agreement like you know if you're a cookies because cookies keeps opening new shops in new locations so how do those cookie strains get into that state you know we'll all be in california right and pixies fairies of course pixies ferries and also the stork brings all the genetics straight to the dispensary without any questions and uh and then there's these types of questions so it's kind of interesting i mean like this is one of the reasons why you're gonna eventually i don't know when it's gonna be but eventually you absolutely need uh federal legalization because you have this this dual nature of the plant and so like it's quasi-legal in these jurisdictions but it's still also criminalized i mean it's it's medical it's not full adult use well if you think about it too you're setting up in a monopoly for for these companies that have enough money to to litigate their way out like this is wrong on so many levels for the citizens period but meanwhile mexico is gonna might be getting ears right mexico's moving which uh is surprising for me i'm gonna have to issue a retraction from last week or i'm like yeah they're always calling wolf but no the full chamber of the mexican lower house is expected to discuss and vote on the bill this week that just criminalizes cannabis in a move that would make the country one of the largest the world's largest legal cannabis markets then they're going to build that wall so we can't go down that's right well i'm assuming then they're going to like start re-exporting all those wonderful mexican hazes from the 70s um however i don't know if that will happen uh how and then the other thing is they're gonna i think they would be the largest legal cannabis market because there's more mexico uh people than there are canadians like canada right now i think is the largest and there's only like 30 million or so 30 to 40 million canadians you know if you think about this too it doesn't have to be cannabis that once they legalize this in cannabis as a recreational use there's they're opening the the floodgates for hemp like for being a number one producer because since the united states is still behind the curve as we regulate our own stuff we're too busy saying the farmers are bad they're gonna they're gonna press on and create their own hemp and you know because that right now canada is our number one outsource for him and then south africa i think so there you go i mean they have some wonderful mexican hemp coming in but there's almost 128 million people that live in mexico and so there you go it'd be like the largest cannabis market by a mile if that happens and it's been it's been scheduled to happen for so long and it's been delayed for so long once they actually get there and i'm not sure if they're gonna get there this time or if they're gonna get there next time but it's it's moving that's like homegrown for washington you guys still have homegrown for medical it's just you want homegrown for adult use right america i want my rights freedom and so yeah that's we don't we also don't have home i mean like the home grow that we have is medical home grow and and i understand the argument for that when it comes to access to supply but then you know there's a profit mode of argument which i don't like it's like hey uh you shouldn't have access to supply if you just want to smoke weed you should have to pay yeah but that's still shitty argument because the you know home brews haven't put budweiser out of business you know hasn't put restaurants and everything out of business so it will only add to the variety of life god damn it i yes like you know you're not wrong you're not wrong it's just that the um the people don't care yeah well the ones in charge don't care that's that's what it is yes that's one of the bad news stories that continues to be on the radar too uh i'm not sure if that was the one that we had signed up next no that was the true leaf one let's talk about that well there is some more bad news eventually once we get to the florida news yeah yeah trinity team teams up with morehouse school of medicine though on medical cannabis research that's pretty neat that is yeah true leaf cannabis corp turned up with an hbc morehouse school of medicine on a medical cannabis research and education initiative about time that they're going to do some cannabis research dude i'm looking forward to the day i can actually go to the store cvs and buy uh you know a two to one ratio uh cannabis uh extract something you know uh pill anything to add my you know like anywhere i already kind of have it with the legal stores here because we watching is kind of ahead of the curve when it comes to products but still everybody should have this opportunity yep yep and so the florida cannabis company that's truly signed a research education and development agreement with morehouse school of medicine medicine under which true leaf georgia will assist with the school's cannabis related research operations and offer educational courses now this may also play into the lawsuit that truly filed against georgia to get its application in for its medical cannabis cultivation license and now it announces this new partnership with the morehouse school of medicine i wonder if that was an aspect of the cannabis application that they put in it had to be you know you know they're they're right now litigating going but we're gonna be in a medical study that's right you gotta let us in because we're right here all this jack going straight to your educational facility seriously we've got doctors yeah such [ __ ] i mean god damn it's brilliant [ __ ] strategic planning but [ __ ] you for [ __ ] having that kind of money hey gotta pay to play man so that's that's great and it provided if oh can you imagine if they don't get the license are they gonna come through then you know because they haven't announced who's won these because there's only two licenses up for grabs and then there was four licenses for the the tier two the fifty thousand square foot operating facility and then there's two licenses for the hundred thousand square foot operating facility and you know they want that they thirsty for oh god yeah yeah isn't the the requirement still says citizenship right in georgia you got to be resident oh sure there's all sorts of chicanery and relationships with um the residency requirements or like the doing business for the time requirements all those types of things um and then they they were nitpick the truly people were nitpicking regarding like how they uh implemented the application relative to the rules whether or not the administrative department overstepped its bounds when they were creating the the list of the uh the application which another fun thing you know that'll happen sometimes yeah you know the collaboration is considered as being one of the first steps in creation of a personalized medical cannabis treatments that would be a wonderful future yeah totally um there we go well yeah leading to the medical though colorado colorado bill requires schools to store cannabis-based medicines for student use so when the school board refused to let her daughter marley receive her cannabis derived medicine from willing teachers sarah and mark porter made the difficult decision to pull molly out of school on october 2019. in 18 months since marley has been able to take her prescribed medicine regularly while learning her at home keeping her crohn's disease more manageable than it's ever been her parents testified to colorado legislators crohn's is horrible man there's a lot of that so uh senate bill 21-56 aims to make life easier for kids like marley and their families it would require schools and school districts to have a policy allowing their employees to store and administer medical cannabis recommended for a student by a doctor thank god sb 56 yep but i mean this is a crohn's disease patient that's trying to access her medical cannabis and and it's been this is even in colorado and so like the one of the bastions one of the first states for this has still had these types of regulations in place to prevent cannabis medicine from being at schools well washington had the same way we just did it three years ago i believe just recently i know the gentleman that was behind that bill his daughter uh passed on a beautiful little girl she she had something way worse than crohn's and all that stuff but he pushed this bill through for all the other kids it was pretty awesome so yeah i know it's great that uh this so this can be called jack's law and i think i followed this guy's case for a little bit hey or no it builds off of jack's law which allows school districts to let parents or guardians administer medical cannabis to their children on campus in jack's law medicine must be administered in forms of oils nasal sprays or capsules no smoking can you imagine that but the light you're also certain nasal sprays and stuff so at least they have some type of aerosols so that it could actually be um you know so yeah you could get it titrated quicker and so you could get into the the the system faster that you know but the smoking aspect is just just us i mean like they're like oh my god there's a hint of smoke somewhere oh no any smoke at all don't even know what paper you know no it's ridiculous the the the the expectation that like you have to say the kids can't be smoking like no parents can rolling doobies for the kill i mean i mean mr older but you know if it's a medical issue a medical treatment god they're getting titrates they're getting tinctures getting oils they're doing all kinds of stuff they're not rolling up dubies for the [ __ ] kids they would probably prefer to not have to use the medicine to be honest it's one of those things you know usually when you have medicine very often you're like man i wish you didn't have to use this but i'm sick you know yeah there's a kid out there calling because you know colorado had a uh it was the mecca for a lot of the uh uh parents leaving their states uh you know uh charlotte's webb was the uh the initiator of all that right um and uh funny thing about this the because i i give the uh charlotte's web the brothers uh credit for creating that conversation you know keeping it going forward but looks like i gotta answer it text my bad all right well you do that you know colorado also has quentin's amendment which allows school nurses to administer medical cannabis at school for qualifying medical conditions and with a doctor's approval well that's that's a good amendment to have clinton but the left the law left out an opt-out clause for districts that didn't want their employees giving kids the medicine senate minority leader chris holbert a republican from douglas county said sb 2156 is more important to him than any other legislation he sponsored this session seven lawmakers in the education committee approved the bill unanimously on february 24th and now goes to the appropriations committee for review on a yet to be determined date and that is again how laws are made you start one committee hopefully you don't die there then you get out of another committee hopefully you don't die there you get some floor action hopefully you also don't die there and then there's a vote and then you pass if this is nebraska that's it now every other state besides nebraska then you have to go get passed in the other uh legislative body let's say you started in the senate you have to go to the house side of the house you have to go to the senate and it has to be the same one uh and then let's say you get all through all that and then they've been reconciled so it's the same bill and now it goes to the governor's desk and if that governor is mario cuomo yeah sure he might sign it but if that governor is uh gnome i believe is her name in south dakota oh she's vetoing the crap out of that bill and and that sucks and so that's one of the reasons why cannabis legalization news will be here for a bit because these things won't play out over the course of like a fortnight it's it's going to take years miggy is still on the phone so let's move on to the next thing no more urine tests no more urine tests proposed california law would end most workplace marijuana tests again i mean just so dumb just drug test right like yeah i mean the point they have to do random drug tests proves that you can't identify a a consumer of recreational drugs i mean as an employer unless that person's [ __ ] up and then if that person's [ __ ] up then you you take other precautions but writing rejections just don't find [ __ ] nope they you know i mean if they really want random drug tests i think that's fine let's start with the legislature see what they're on and then after that we'll see if we could do it to the people that aren't making any money or like getting a whole bunch of subsidies from the federal government in the terms of um pensions and other fringe benefits okay new legislative bill that's ending a common employment practice five years after californians voted to legalize recreational cannabis in which privacy companies can require workers to test for marijuana use it's assembly bill 1256 introduced by assemblyman bill quirk a democrat of hayward and he has intended to prevent employers from using past evidence of marijuana use such as hero or urine as justification for discrimination against an employee such as denying or terminating employment yeah zero tolerance is a shitty policy overall it's been a shitty policy you know since the reagan era like that it it's why what well a lot of the times it'll have to do with like where does the company get its money from if a lot of it is coming from the federal government they may still have to do the zero tolerance policy as conditions of getting uncle sugar's money and a result of that that's one of the reasons why those types of tests are still done prevalently a lot of people just don't like wheat no i get it it just it bothers me because like my son he asked me or he was saying you know i wanna because he wants to go in the military when he graduates high school and uh he's like i can't wait till i joined the military and hopefully by that time uh the perception of cannabis because of everything that he sees me talking about with morocco and everything he's like maybe it'll be legal then i was like you know i was like even if it's legal tomorrow still another five six years until attitudes and you know zero tolerance happen overnight it's it's [ __ ] up that it's harder to free a man than it is to create a law to put everybody behind bars yeah it's it's harder to get people to accept facts like there's no like this isn't this isn't something to debate and we need more research it's like no no uh we discovered a nandabide in in march 22 fourth of 1992 it's only 29 years old we figured out how this plant worked fairly recently and now we are dang sure this is how it works and look at all these recreational legal states right the zombie apocalypse hasn't happened planes aren't falling out crashes aren't happening everywhere i mean economies are actually thriving but i i i mean we live in the family including painkillers by the way uh you know pizza use is up yeah domino stock [ __ ] goes up [ __ ] i mean it's a win-win baby man people feel great people feel great but it's one of those deals where you're dealing with people that don't know the actual objective facts and and you're trying to just get people to understand facts that's it opinions you don't i don't care what your opinion is on marijuana do you know how it works let's have that conversation and so then once you get moved past that conversation they should be like oh well our laws are really [ __ ] stupid right but if they if they don't understand how cannabis works then it's really easy for these losses to continue yeah yeah and they don't understand also why can't prohibition exist like that you know we have to constantly educate like yes it's all based off it idiocy nothing scientific based it's all racial uh propaganda uh there's nothing legitimate about why prohibition exists like there's no saving the people it's about controlling the people you know it's about controlling the people and uh speaking of control though or no longer uh be a judge of your moral character when the administration marijuana would not count against immigrants good moral character under new congressional bill thank [ __ ] god i mean this is immigrant submission to prior marijuana use can no longer be used to deny them u.s citizenship under a new congressional bill representative brandon boyle a democrat from pennsylvania filed the legislation on monday it addresses a part of the federal immigration policy that's concerning concerns establishing good moral character because yeah everybody already hears good moral character as part of a national application yep they were using our cannabis laws in immigration for decades as something to justify uh you know revoking your uh your visa and deporting you yeah so i'm glad to see that they are introducing uh bills to try to change that this is one of the aspects of the more act that gets into it so like now it looks like they're you know breaking off that piece because the more act is a very large you know bill that they contemplated and and it was going to amend the immigration naturalization act to uh get rid of a lot of the references to marijuana which can prevent people from you know getting their visa or becoming naturalized and they said they're also going to have another the congressman's bill specifically cars out an exemption for applicants who admitted to have using possessed or distributed cannabis and then it would also remove another stigmatizing question that the united states citizenship and immigration services asked you on some of those forms when you're trying to get naturalized have you ever been a habitual drunkard which will no longer appear on uh the questions as well that's an old-timey [ __ ] holy crap have i been a habitual drunkard well yes but like my job was to be a drunk at uh disneyland and it's it's what they paid me for you know i'm the town trunk okay i gotta jump out for a second all right you do that and i'll say uh you know boyle the the rep that sponsored this he said these questions are wholly unrelated to citizenship and it's extremely troubling to see federal applications like this that continue to use a harsh and antiquated terms such as habitual drunken this careless language only serves to reinforce societal stigmas and misunderstandings about substance abuse and it's time that we matter modernize the process that is pretty darn awesome uh let's let's move on to the new vaporizer shipping band impacts the industry and high times is now reporting that the preventing of online sales of e-cigarettes the children act which approved by the congress last december states the ups can no longer handle vape product shipments check out the video that we've done on this it's called the delta 8 vape ban and so the delta 8 vape ban we're going to do some more content on in the next uh two three weeks because it goes into effect on the 26th of this month however it will not really really start catching up to the people that are probably going to continue to sell these things online for another 90 days or so it's not like you want to be on that list tune in for more on that and so yeah what they did was they defined this electronic nicotine delivery system in such a broad way that it would also encompass for no real good reason uh uh vapes and this is a delta eight vape find them at your local head shop that'll probably be where most of them are being sold in a month so they're saving the children that's awesome save those children no longer will anybody be buying e-cigarettes online especially children you know that's one of the reasons why i have not given my daughter a credit card yet because kids don't know how to get into the goddamn uh dark web which i know they know like this is a failed attempt again being another [ __ ] daddy state you know whatever you want to say and then like you see how it's defined and you're like ah crap this is gonna fall straight into what a vape cartridge is and did they intend to do it no they didn't but like it's one of those things where it's so overly broadly defined and says that this nicotine electronic nicotine delivery system is any product that delivers nicotine flavor or any other substance to a user inhaling from the device delta 8 or cbd um so does this mean so like the product itself like the empty cartridge the empty battery cartridge right empty no product in it can that not be shipped to you then as a company because really this doesn't really affect any recreational markets because they're not doing interstate commerce anyways right but no it's basically what it means it's not going to be able to be shipped to you uh using the post office there's maybe like one very small exception but that's kind of like if you're shipping in between friends uh and you're only going to do that like 10 times a year and it's like very small uh and even then they might give you [ __ ] if you try to like mail it but there's going to be uh mail regulations that are coming out about april 27th and then we'll see uh yeah i just anticipate a lot of the and you're seeing it right now like all the delta eight products are starting to evolve a little bit away from the vape carts for example now they're taking a lot of cbd flour and then they take the delta eight and they spray the cbd flour uh and so now you have this blended product where you have delta eight plus you also have cbd for the entourage effect and and what is it it's flour you can mail it but it also delta eight so it's in demand or you're seeing drizzlers uh you know which is essentially like the liquid stuff in here but then you're going to have to be like trying to refill your own vapes and that's going to get frustrating so you just go down the street to the vape shop and buy yourself a delta egg cart well i'm saying like well someone in the recreational market that i see you know they're i don't think there's any change to those guys like because they're not shipping their [ __ ] out there's we don't have any mailing options so you know washington's safe in that market yeah i think you know i mean it just seems like it does hurt all the cbd people who are trying to be on that gray market on the edge right it seems like you see it's either you're in the uh recreational market or you're traditional or you know that's it yeah the healthcare market is uh we'll see we'll see the next farm bill you know in 2022 farm bills coming out we'll see if that addresses delta yeah thousands of california marijuana convictions officially reduced others dismissed good stuff man last month with the stroke at penn san diego county superior court judge eugene a gonna kill it i hire a bead nearly 26 000 people with belly utility marijuana convictions on their records had them reduced to misdemeanor convictions i wonder if i'm one of them i wonder if i had to apply for that that's where most of my arrests were at night in addition to the thousand people rested i'm so proud of you for being arrested for weed well underannounced was a misdemeanor when i was younger so twice twice well you know that would make me a social equity applicant yeah in the first time uh i got pulled over and i've always been honest with cops like my activism comes down to like good policing and stuff like that like uh the first time uh actually three times i got pulled over the first time honest the cop cop lets us go takes our bag and dumps it out but gives me back my pipe it says don't smoke and drive uh second time uh i got pulled over for an out brake light and then i had five cop cars come up in my car after i was already honest with the cop with an eighth like hey this is what i got you didn't catch el chapo and then next thing i'm in the back of the car freaking out like what the [ __ ] i was honest with you and uh he's like i'm gonna kick you in if you keep it up then uh yeah i mean just these just petty stuff you know the third time again under an ounce so they're not gonna like take me in they're they're looking for the bigger boys and uh you always gotta like know your role right know your rights type [ __ ] yeah let's talk about your rights in florida you know where rights can very often go to die go florida not only not only can your rights go to die there but good luck trying to get unemployment in florida so let's let's talk about florida should marijuana legalization limit thc probably not but it's happening according to forbes uh thc of course is the most famous cannabinoid out there however a lot of these types of states are trying to cap thc they try to do it in washington state with extracts so state legislatures in florida have proposed a 10 thc limit on smokable flour and a 16 thc limit on edibles still sold in the state's medical marijuana marketplace let's talk about why that is ludicrous go for it oh governing nature i mean just the whole nature and so you're going to force people to pick it when it's not ripe which again that's not necessarily going to help the patient achieve the uh entourage effect of the whole plant that you're looking for moreover it it continues to like over emphasize the importance of thc you know that even a 30 thc plant is fine hash has been around for thousands of years and so has keith for thousands of years and been way way stronger than uh 10 or 30 percent flour we've been fine and then the 16 thc limit on edibles is that by weight because that's insane you know because if this thing weighs a gram does that mean that i can have 160 milligrams of thc in there that is like an elephant-sized dose of an edible right there and florida's had medical for how many years now uh florida's had medical for i have no idea i want to say it was about the same time that illinois maybe a little no 2016 i think they actually finally passed it because they had to pass it twice because they had to get over 60 percent so i think it was 2016 and like all the licenses are not that old like 2017 and stuff and then truly just access to capital and took over but why is florida so florida like i mean like what's the point like what happened who got hurt here that like now we gotta capture it like what is going on and you're gonna kill the genetics of florida like i think don't think people are understanding like your state is legalish you are you have a chance to be on the forefront of like genetics and appellations like we talked about like if people were to start like okay we can start having this florida sunshine or whatever you want to call it you know there's prime opportunities for your state to pull in a [ __ ] ton of money right you're not going to do that with limiting goddamn thc caps and [ __ ] [ __ ] regulations right i mean like the only thing that that thc cap would do is make the illicit market just fine they'd be like hey i'm going to go back out to the street to buy it why because that stuff will get you high this stuff gives me a headache because they're going to have to do something to that flower to get it down to there i mean like a one-to-one blend maybe that's all you would be able to get and then you have to be watching that ten percent um and so there's there's that aspect and then it's like some of these medical patients need higher thc concentrations i'm glad that they have it inedible but they probably want to also be able to inhale it yeah dabs i mean concentrates or anything uh straight back to the weed man you know yeah that's it i mean uh where's where's moral beach at myrtle beach i always thought was in south carolina but i have no idea okay because uh i don't know if uh because we're getting close to the end here but the horrible story you're talking about is the uh the war on weed leaves one myrtle beach man paralyzed cost 11 million in landmark civil rights case wow so home surveillance video showed in april 2015 a team of heavily armed officers used a battering ram to enter julian benton's myrtle beach home to execute a search warrant three officers fired 29 times [ __ ] kid johnny mccoy julian benton's attorney said they hit him nine times effectively crippling him paralyzing him he had multiple surgeries and still can't walk and then they lied to cover it up yep south carolina south carolina's finest demonstration of not understanding that weed is harmless now this is this is just horrible uh i don't know if you're familiar with j cole the the rapper uh he had a song called neighbors and uh he actually uses actual video footage from his house of officers raiding his house because they thought he was a grow operation opposed to a rap studio is what he had in his goddamn basement so they thought the power was going to growing weed as opposed to growing beets yeah yeah i can't wait to nicholas i'm looking forward to the high mighty i gotta get the puns out now i don't want to embarrass myself when he gets here i want to be all a fan boy some of the questions about 1985. you know uh let's go let's do chong's weed through the decades so we're going back to the 60s where were you smoking all right were we puffing on that i could imagine that you remember blueberry coming into the scene and then i wonder what his criteria though for having to grow now because you know part of what the circuit he's going on is he's got the uh the new chong line out and uh and then chicha says has a line too if we could cheat each other after chong and then we'll be like john was blaming you for everything is that true right and then we'd ask to teach the exact same goal that never mind we'll have fun but like hopefully enough hopefully enough yeah that's pretty fun man to it man it's going to be a lot of fun this is our first show we did over 20 000 subs you know yeah we can't we can't stop until we have more subscribers in peoria illinois hilarious and so we're talking i think 115 000. so like what in a year it depends like i uh i got sick there last week or last month and then um and now the website's down so don't visit us at campus legalization oh canvas industry lawyer cannabis legalization news is still online uh and so you know in a few more months hopefully we can start messing around with more um shows that are like directly related to trending national news uh yeah that's one of the ways that you get a lot of suggested videos and just a crapload of views and so you know if there's something that comes out that we think it'll actually break you do a quick video about it or or um other videos about how to get licenses those get smaller views and then they're more localized but it helps us like you know find visitors or viewers that are in those particular jurisdictions that want to get this game oh yeah and then you know uh yeah and then i can't wait for the site to find it up because i do like to do the word stuff right like for people who like to read you know the video thing was just kind of a happy stance of what i like to do like you pulled me into this and now i'm in this dark web of [ __ ] and you know but the words come come visit the website once it gets rocking it's not rocking right now it looks like it looks like it's not pretty right now that's all i can display into it it's not she's not she's under construction folks just just go to the canvas legalization news and be like in work you know but uh you know one step at a time and the the site was pretty big and so like it was going really really well and then i just tipped over and dived uh which is terrible you know but at the same time it's a lot of fun that we still gotta have the channel yeah no this is great i mean [ __ ] we got 90 people hanging out with us and i [ __ ] love it you know i look forward to our moments you know i mean there's gonna be lots more news coming and uh just take it one day at a time man that's it there's always something to talk about i told you man yeah like that was one of the things do we already talk about the bakery licenses no ah the bakery licenses i can't wait for these things to be a thing like you know everybody's like oh i want to open up a weed restaurant you know where you can make these types of infused dishes and i'm just held on there bro uh that's not how this works they all have to be pre-packed and like you know pre-dosed and all that and then there's really not a consumption lounge license type that's out there yet like where do you go in washington where do you go in seattle down the street to smoke a bowl with your boys or like your friends you know like where do you go yeah no there's no place uh you know and in uh the park right like i mean i'm endorsing public smoking but it's it's decrimed here at the point that's what i'm saying like that's why prohibition is so important ending prohibition is so important so law enforcement can worry about the [ __ ] that's important and not some guy smoking a joint with his friends in the corner of a park you know well and then the guys would have an opportunity to smoke their joints somewhere else yeah yeah if i had if we had well we used to have lounges during medical times but it'll happen again you know so but yeah that's the next step there's a lot of levels to this uh regulation that needs this infrastructure that needs to happen uh want to take the listener mill all right let's do one question if we have one question but then i got to have a call about the websites yep we got whitney city gardens on instagram ass i find myself in the new illinois speaker of the house's district do you think there's any value of lobbying him to fix her cannabis laws any strategic tips to change this [ __ ] because honestly the cannabis regulation feels like it's poorly written and being poorly rolled out um all right so the new speaker actually introduced a bill on this and uh well he introduced a bill that would have increased the ownership of amounts of craft grows from three to ten and so if anything it would have allowed fewer operators to own all of those licenses which are the most accessible cannabis cultivation license currently in the state of illinois uh that's not a good sign if anything it looked like that was an mso bill like you know multi-operators like hey one craft grow that's that's okay but that's only 14 000 square foot flowering i want um and so can i own ten of them is that okay if i can own ten uh and and that's the bill that that representative ford introduced i can't remember what h b it is off the top of my head but it was like ew ew did he introduce a bill that says hey 5 000 square feet is too much we need a micro cultivation license of only 500 plants no he did not he wanted to increase the amount of ownership to essentially allow for greater m a amongst the uh current caps of three licenses he wanted that raised to ten what's the small do you guys have small associations there like like they do like they did in rhode island where they fought that one no nobody has license just seems to me that you guys need more um uh we call it uh community gathering type things you know we do there's a lot of work to do in illinois but uh i know we gotta get out of here so thanks for tuning in everyone make sure you like and subscribe to keep up with all cannabis legalization news we'll see you on sunday you", "Khfmh28C7do": "[Music] what's going on everybody care cannabis here with a new tips and tricks video I have not done one of these in a while but I figured what's happening to my grow room merits a new tips and tricks video and that is how to prevent mites there is a very simple answer be clean now the part about not it not just mites bugs in general but I'm gonna show you the kind of damage it does you can see if you have your resolution on your YouTube settings up you'll see all the webbing that's starting to occur that's not a spider those are mites spiders eat mites but not the other way around and you can see it's starting to get like wet a little bit you can see the moisture build-up that's not good either I don't know well that's just covered that's why that's not good at all but yeah it starts to go up the plant and then they eat the bugs last and then you're left with nothing so I did a video on how to get rid of mites you never truly get rid of mites once you have them unless you sterilized the room with a sulfur bomb and nobody's ever gonna do that they're usually just gonna I don't know what they do to be honest but yeah it's actually getting pretty bad on these reeve edgers it hasn't actually affected these ones yet which I'm glad I mean it's affecting them as you can see on the leaves you can see just the the little dots everywhere that's mites eating it away and if you look under it which I don't really want to touch and do you can see black little dots which are mite larvae and such but they haven't webbed any of those yet so that's nice I use cold water to spray these every couple of days a lot of people comment saying oh don't spray during flower don't foliar spray it rains outside if these were outside did get rained on they would still live their weeds they grow like weeds it's fine but the long answer for how to prevent mites is don't let animals in to grow room ever I made that mistake I have a dog it's a small dog but they still carry bugs and [ __ ] from the outside always if you're gonna be really anal about it always shower and then go into your grow room make sure you're not wearing shoes that you've worn outside now make sure you're not wearing clothes you've worn outside if you were wearing shorts outside bugs could be in your hair on your legs and stuff they go everywhere you could have one larva a gland on you and you could walk into your grow room and the whole grow room could be [ __ ] in a week you don't want that to happen we battle these forever until I'm gonna until I restart like I literally I can't take these anywhere if I take them to a new place the mites are just gonna live on these and then start in that different room so I literally have to start from scratch if I want to completely get rid of the mites so if you don't want to have mites in you or any bugs for that matter be clean be as clean as you can sterilized [ __ ] keep [ __ ] clean wash [ __ ] do not go into your grow room dirty as a [ __ ] going clean it's just easier that way take a shower before you go in is the best way to do it other than that that's the only way you're gonna be able to truly prevent from having bugs and still they could get into the house some way somehow especially don't let any pets I've seen a lot of growers who let their dog roam around and [ __ ] and then like I'm like that's just you asking for bugs that's bugs waiting to happen so don't do that but that's it for this tips and tricks video guys it's a preventative measure just be clean that's all I can say thanks for watching guys and we'll see you next time

capping somebody is really it's real deal exotic my [ __ ] you should know when some [ __ ] is real deal exotic i got my hemp wrap rolled up um this hemp wrap is full of vibranium you know what i'm saying for my people follow me on instagram y'all know what weed i'm talking about it's not actually called vibranium but we finna get into that i'm gonna show y'all matter of fact i'm gonna show y'all right now just just look at this weed look at this damn weed like i said i am making this video so y'all know what the exotic is dump it out on the tray so y'all can see y'all can see this [ __ ] look at that look what's in the jar bro this is how like this is how you know you got some really good weed you see that keith and [ __ ] that's left over i'm saying look at that [ __ ] it looked like vibranium don't it i know it do it's black bro this weed is literally like like black this might be the darkest weed i've ever smoked not even finish the hearing cap to you but this is what you should expect when you're looking for real deal exotic this is what you should expect and not just cause it's purple you know what i'm saying don't let the purp fool you bro there's some there's some purple strains out here that that don't smoke that good i've had a few you feel me but this [ __ ] right here just from touching it like you see my fingertips i'm touching this hoe oh my god it's busting all right we from the sparkle if i can find a damn night oh found one we from the spark up and get straight into this you know what i'm saying i've been enjoying smoking as we like this weed gets me loaded as hell every time now for my gang that's been rocking with the channel for a minute y'all know i don't have some crazy ass strains coming in and out um every time i do get you know some exotic or some [ __ ] like that um you know where i'm coming to first baby coming to y'all i'm saying i gotta show y'all just gotta show myself what i'm smoking on how i'm blessing my lungs and [ __ ] you know so let's dive straight into this right i'm gonna basically give y'all some key points what to look for and what you know what i'm saying to be aware of when you are looking for some exotic blood we're gonna start with the dispensaries you know i'm saying if you searching for exotic bud add dispensaries it's pretty much easy i'm not gonna lie they they got the tic percentage on there they got the strain name and all that oh yeah and before i forget this the purple [ __ ] i just showed you the vibranium that strain is called oreo mints by cookies what i'm saying buy cookies which is burners brand um if you don't know who burner is man you need to dive into the wii world a little bit more because he doing his [ __ ] he just give you that see this weed it got that potent gassy taste on the inhale and like exhale it's real smooth like it's smooth smoke but yeah anyways when you're at dispensaries you know i'm saying it's pretty much easy to get to exotic stir you know the strain name the exact thc percentage they got in it whether it's an indica or sativa or a hybrid you know what i'm saying be prepared if you're going to a dispensary and you want some 30 thc or up depends on what states in as well but be prepared to spend anywhere from two hundred dollars a half a half ounce to four hundred dollars for a half ounce i'm saying it cost it cost a lot to smoke the best quality cannabis out there but the [ __ ] be for me it'd be worth it what i'm saying like this i could smoke this halfway down put it out be high as hell for two three hours then come back to it smoke it halfway down be high as hell for another two three hours there's one blunt in one day i'm saying rather than having some regular regular you know it's still gas but it ain't no no threats it ain't no damn threats so you got that gas that ain't threats you know you're gonna smoke about two three i'm lying you're gonna smoke about four five six blunts a day well me me personally i'm gonna smoke about four five six blunts a day of just some regular gas but on some [ __ ] like this some [ __ ] i'll be trying to conserve you know what i mean i'm not running through it bro 0.8 in it um yeah i'm point eight in it all the way fam so with that being said i did get a half ounce of this oreo mix a half ounce of that went for 150. when i seen that weed i was prepared to spend you know what i mean 200 for a half the reason i even bought this half in the first place was because it was my christmas gift to myself you know me i don't buy i'm not a materialistic person fam i don't buy shoes i don't buy clothes i don't buy [ __ ] like that what i spoil myself in is different kinds of wraps different kinds of weed that's my that's my lame that's what i like to do that that's what makes me happy basically that's what i'm trying to say but you see this this lotto pop y'all remember this is a lotto pop if you didn't count the lotto pop video the most expensive eighth i've ever bought it's even more expensive than this purple weed i'm smoking right now seventy five dollars for eight would i do it again no but i don't give a damn this is where a lot of people get tricked too you see this jar and [ __ ] like people look at the drawing be like damn that jar is sexy bro so the weed gotta be hidden [ __ ] will open this up and it will be reggie in there and now get it anyways cause the jar or the packaging y'all don't get fooled by the jar of the packaging just because the jar in the packaging is sexy doesn't mean we finna be sexy and exotic so be aware of that too especially if you out here you know what i mean i don't know [ __ ] be putting that [ __ ] in anything they'll get they'll get some reggie and throw that hoe in a cookie's bag and it'll be a whole half in the cookie's bag [ __ ] at the dispensary cookies sell three fives in those bags so i don't know what you doing with a whole half in that hope somebody getting her weak that's all i'm saying but right now what you finna see on the screen is different exotic strains that i've smoked in the past month yeah it's only about three four strains in her but these are the exotic strings that i've smoked in the past month these are your 30 percenters and up you know i mean we got the gorilla cake uh purple milk and the l7 but all all three of them hoes guess you know if i had to say which one was the best out of all three i'd probably say the purple milk second would be the gorilla cake third would be the l7 and of course they gonna have a name at the top i mean so y'all know which ones are which now these are key things to look for bro these are what you need to the actual butt itself all everything aside you know i'm saying we went over the prices the thc percentages and all that but this is for my people who don't you know what i'm saying you ain't going to the dispensary let's just say that you need to look for nice crystally white you see all the wheat i just showed you crystalline white that's how the tricom should be on that hoe it could have orange hairs in it you know like the l7 it had the orange hairs in it and don't be tricked by the purp i already said that i think but do not be tricked by the purple [ __ ] you know i mean unless the [ __ ] look like what i just showed you or their lotto pop i don't have a lot of good purp ice cream lotto pop this oreo mints know what i mean that [ __ ] but all of them hoes what did they have they had them white hairs on them they weren't just purple you know i mean it wasn't just purple and it went shining like if you put your flesh on that [ __ ] it's gonna shine you're gonna know you're gonna say damn this hoe just beautiful like it looked like a lava rock bro all that purple [ __ ] if the [ __ ] don't look like a lava rock that be glistening in the sun i don't i don't want it that's another thing you need to smell the weed bro examine start examining your weed before you buy it y'all that's how i look at it every time you buy some weed it's an investment in what your lifestyle and your health it's good for your health and it's the type of lifestyle you live in pi head lifestyle don't just you know

pre-rolled joints and cannabis flour all retailing between 40 and 70 jay-z telling cnbc exclusively in part i created monogram to give cannabis the respect it deserves by showcasing the tremendous hard work time and care that go into crafting a superior smoke monogram products are next level the parent company is a result of the biggest cannabis spec in history that raised 575 million dollars

company brian back over to you frank before we let you go we got a quick question okay so apparently this deal bringing in a couple of cannabis companies obviously you mentioned jay-z sean carter is

know a few jay-z quotes yourself i'm gonna i'm gonna refer to one of his most famous ones jay-z said i'm not a businessman i'm a businessman so it relates to this like this not only is he an influencer for this company uh his company roc nation will also bring in other influencers people like alicia keys and dj khaled and they're going to be able to create their own cannabis lines uh the

it's because i feel like i'm about to [ __ ] throw up that that's what i got that's what i got i'm nauseous as [ __ ] right now um considered just scrapping this as a strain review because of how shitty i feel it's the worst excuse ever i've got rollins by cresco now this is going to continue a recent cresco trend as you guys have seen on the channel went about a whole year not reviewing one product of theirs and now like the last five eighths i have bought have been new cresco strains so that's where i'm at and i've got rollins rollins is the sativa leaning hybrid combining lemon tree s1 and nigerian this is something that i'm super excited for for really one obvious reason um i've dabbed rollins before i've hit it out of the honey badger had that live rollins butter from cresco the effects of this strain are [ __ ] awesome it's the exact sativa leaning properties that you guys know i'm a huge fan of i want my heart racing i want energy i want lemon i love lemon terps we find them in so many of the sativa leaning strains so let's pop this bad boy open this batch of rollins is coming at a thc a value of 29 28.5 shoot me later oh man come on first sniff i need i need this nausea out of here let's go rollins hmm ladies and gentlemen i am so visually and uh nasally impressed that sounds dirty the bright citrusy lemony just bite of this this this this chirping profile simply bites you guys have got to check out some of these fat ass nugs i got from cresco dude on this rollins come on man come on man you know what i'm saying dog you know what i'm [ __ ] talking about yes sir baby um look how smooth that rollins is no coughs okay i need to go inside it's very cool i probably look like hell i was so tired before this took a massive rip of this rollins it's yes a rush a high octane sativa man there's some intoxication elements to this god god damn oh my god dude not only is this some of the best cured cannabis i've had in months i literally i'm not playing i'm gonna have to like oh there we go there we go oh my god this smells erupting off of this are insane right now they're so much more just like fresher and more vivid god my fingers holy [ __ ] man this rollins you guys gotta get this man seriously nug structure effects terpene profile just look at that oh man christmas came early i've had in the mason jar second sniff [ __ ] mason sniff i don't know but i feel i'm gonna get a much more concentrated smell out of this rollins by cresco most definitely wow oh undeniably it's so much sharper once it's been in here not only is it sharper that lemon is so much more sweet i won't even [ __ ] deny that it's negative 24 degrees on a lovely sunday with me in these uh these monsters but uh we're gonna go work out we're gonna get them some play time and then i'm gonna take a big ass rip of some rollins and we're gonna send it off i cannot [ __ ] wait to get home and game and not uh like my hand is frozen what y'all think were you surprised as me i don't know man maybe some of y'all have smoked this before and already grabbed it but let's take a moment shout out cresco man shout out cresco to making some big big quality control changes to their illinois medical cannabis program how chill are you huh what are you smoking on that's got you like this not for real i'm trying to cop almost embarrassingly so i had a really rough day with the dogs surprise right i know it's something i repeat on this channel a lot but especially with the dalmatian under a year old there's no easy days there's no easy days whatsoever i had herpe all over my parents house this morning because she was just so excited and i i snapped man i've just been really stressed and i yelled and just got out of my skin um needless to say when i was able to grab some of this rollins here today i like literally looked to the sky practically and said cannabis gods literally strike me with every sativa lemony goodness of just bringing me out of this funk and i'm happy to say it was very very successful pretty much from hitting it moving forward i've been exactly where i want to be with them and with myself relaxed physically mentally i enjoyed it in the sense of finally getting to enjoy being around myself after i like yell at the dogs or if like i get angry like that i don't want to be around me so i hid it uh and now tony we've got a fourth and goal against these quarterbacks you're going for this stuff all game they're not the only ones going big it's time it's time for that sub-zero hit it's finally here it is man okay it is negative one negative 11 wind chill clean the voyager for you guys going in on this rollins super bowl sunday oh man it like burns my nostril okay before my phone gets all [ __ ] up in the snow oh my god i call that a success man in the rollins still with that little bit of lemoniness on the background awesome finished off the last of the rollins last night and my final thought is a concise one rollins combining lemon tree in nigerian is no ordinary sativa and is a strain that speaks to why i hate the categorization of cannabis strains into sativa hybrid indica it's it's such a broad piss-poor rating system not rating categorization system that doesn't really get the details what i'm getting at is rollins had a lot of knockout on the end a lot man like i was sleeping really really well off of this rollins and i i don't know it's something that i think you guys need to experience for yourself the concentrates rad the the nugs of the flower are seriously some of the most memorable i've had in a while do yourself a favor and get rollins but also do yourself a favor and kind of just give a little bit of thought to what i said if there's anything i ever ask of you on this channel it's to understand that cannabis is far more complex and interesting than how american culture is really handled up until this point there's always something new to learn within this plant i hope you have

united states and can be used to treat everything from depression to insomnia and now some dementia patients are self-medicating with cbd products without proper evidence of what the impact may be the researchers are now playing catch-up just beginning to study the possibility and efficacy of a cannabis drug for people with a spectrum of cognitive impairment issues recently researchers at king's college london are trying to use cannabis as a better alternative to antipsychotic medications that are currently used to treat aggression in patients with dementia but often come with dangerous side effects what are the differences between the two better known compounds in cannabis thc and cbd does the difference even matter thc is the main psychoactive component while cbd is primarily a relaxant thc is more potent than cbd producing the same effects with a lower dosage while the legality of thc usage is divided across state lines cbd is largely legal while thc causes temporary side effects such as slower reaction times and memory loss cbd is predominantly free of any of these effects at present researchers are trying to repurpose a cannabis drug named satifx which is an oral spray license in the u.s and the uk the drug which contains both thc and cbd was originally used for treating patients with multiple sclerosis and is now being repurposed to help treat dementia it attempts to target symptoms of agitation and aggression seen in patients with dementia the drug is designed to be a safer alternative and perhaps more effective treatment for dementia currently there's a scarcity of pharmacological treatments and some of them are rather damaging and dangerous especially in the long term so they would prescribe off-label antipsychotics for more severe cases of agitation in terms of side effects satisfaction is a relatively innocuous substance when compared to other antipsychotics it has common side effects such as increased dizziness dry mouth and risk of increased falls particularly in an elderly population even though it still has some side effects it's already a licensed drug that had gone through rigorous and objective clinical trials we already have much better awareness of what the psychological risks are overall speaking the cannabis drug with thc and cbd has therapeutic potential in a behavioral sense it may increase drowsiness which is similar to a calm and relaxed feeling but we still have to wait for the results to know whether cannabis is effective for treating dementia you", "WTfenC_FumM": "oh my god dude that's so flavorful i was expecting it to not taste as good as it does today i got my hands on something i'm pretty excited about smoking on some banana og flour from moxie got a little bowl packed up ready to go that's delicious it's got a real dank earthy taste to it while it still has like notes of banana and some creaminess in there as well but this strain review is going to be a little bit cooler than my other ones that i normally do typically i only review the flour but when i was picking this up on the menu i also saw that they had banana og and live resin so i grabbed both banana og live resin banana og flour so stick around i'll take a dab towards the end of the video but first let's talk about the flower banana og is a cross between you guessed it og kush and banana kush the effects of this strain are amazing and they come on super quick like that one bowl got me feeling pretty good already and when you actually look at this weed man it is crazy it is like all trichomes you can see a little bit of stem and some plant matter under all those trichomes but this is seriously caked up this is some beautiful [ __ ] weed and the more i break these buds open the more trichomes i find it is an absurd amount of trichome coverage and the weed is super sticky i'm gonna stick two nugs together and see if they just stick together by themselves this is the ultimate sticky test can two nugs become one yep that's pretty impressive that is some sticky ass weed but this banana og is a pretty light green color with little orange hairs poking out of there as well the nugs are nice and loose they're not dense at all but they still had a really nice bud structure to them it wasn't like a bunch of shake in the jar and the weed is super fresh and cured perfectly i'm super impressed always by moxie they just have like the best curing process for the weed in the state in my opinion granted they do rarely drop flowers so they might just pick the perfectly cured weed for when they drop it but compared to most of the other companies around here i just do not get as good of a cure from the other companies if you're from pa you know what i'm talking about it is not rare to get dry weed straight out of the dispensary but the scent of this strain definitely lives up to the name it seriously smells like you were smoking some og kush in an ice cream shop it's like a banana split with nugs in it it's [ __ ] crazy it's like a mix of fruity flavors and creamy flavors under that og kush flavor if you've smoked og kush before you know the flavor it's just that like classic dank weedy flavor i can barely fit this whole bong in the shot i gotta back up a little bit that's fire dude such a great taste at first you taste little hints of banana and vanilla and then it's just overpowered by that pure og kush taste if you're a fan of fruity strains or that classic og flavor this drain is definitely up your alley and those two flavors just pair really well together that like dank grassy taste with the banana and creamy flavor it's just a nice experience i really [ __ ] with the strain but this flower is testing at 22 thc and the terpenes on it aren't out of this world but the smell and the flavor alone are just so overpowering to me that like it is a very impressive flower to me terpenes mean a lot more when it comes to extracts than flour to me if it is flour and has a high terpene profile it's typically good but flour doesn't necessarily need a high terpene profile to smell very pungent and have a great odor to it when it comes to flour i think a lot of that really has to do with how it's cured my main complaint about this drain is it's a little stemmier than i'd like it to be but it's really not too hard to pick that off i feel like when the weed is super dense it's hard to sometimes pick all the stems off but when it's nice and loose like this you can just pick all the good stuff off and then get that stem and throw it right in the trash can i'm gonna pack one more bowl up before we try out the concentrate i had smoked this flour before i did the video but i haven't tried the concentrate yet i only had a half gram of it so i didn't want to waste it moxi's concentrates typically only come in half grams which for some people they really like that because it's pretty expensive but honestly i feel like i go through a half gram so quickly then i don't always like to pick it up they do have grams too but i feel like 80 to 90 percent of their concentrates are weighed out to half grams but like that's only four or five dabs like only one dab if i feel like being crazy so i kind of feel like i'm wasting an entire jar if i just go through that so quickly but they only had the banana og in half gram so i had to grab a half gram i will enjoy this four or five dabs trust me delicious the high is mainly like a nice spacey head high but it's still like noticeable in the entire body as well and i still feel like present i don't feel like super zoned out or anything but sometimes i feel like my brain is just going a mile a minute with these random ideas and high thoughts i'll catch myself being like i wonder if my dog knows i'm high why do we bake cookies but cook bacon what if kobet doesn't exist and just nobody ever wants to hang out anymore i don't know man it's just a nice spacey high but now i'm going to take a dab of this live resin it has more of a wheaty scent to me than a fruity scent i'm curious how it's gonna taste it looks like some beautiful sugar wax though nice and crumbly a little drier than i like my sugar to be but as i've said about consistencies it's really just a preference thing it really has nothing to do with the quality of the actual product but i'm about to take a dab out of this little guy it's practically the size of the banger it's so small it's got a great function for such a little piece though oh yeah it's a little too dry for the dabber so i'm just going to dunk these three little rocks in all right choose you guys oh my god dude that's so flavorful i was expecting it to not taste as good as it does oh wow that's super sweet it's weird it really just smells more like the og kush and like a carafeline scent where it's like a little peppery but it tastes just like the weed smells like it's super sweet you can really taste that banana it's like really noticeable the banana is definitely the most noticeable flavor on the concentrate holy crap it's pretty much the same effect just a little bit more intense like it's definitely more in the head than the body but i'm still feeling higher in the body as well but this is like a true hybrid high where it's like you feel present you don't have like a total couch lock but you still have that like stress free like happy high feeling you get from the indicas if you like hybrid trains this is definitely a good one to pick up moxie really hit it off the park with this one it's probably my favorite banana themed strain i've had it's a nice sweet flavor without being too sweet i just love this blend of dank weed and sweet fruit it's really a delightful mix but this strain was a very exclusive flower i was literally only able to get 1 8 of it that's why i thought it'd be fun to add the concentrate as well let me know if you want me to do that in the future by the way i can't guarantee that i can always get a concentrate of the flower form at the same time but if i can i'd love to do that for a strain review if you guys think that that's a cool addition but there's a 1 8 per patient limit at the dispensaries because literally the dispensaries get such small batches of this flour but hopefully moxie flour becomes more prevalent one day and it's something we can just always see on the shelves this banana og is definitely one that i want to get again i'd rate this strain a 9 out of 5. [ __ ] i'd rate this strain a 9 out of 10 and honestly i feel like it almost should be bumped up to a 9.5 out of 10 after that brain fart it's a super strong strain the weed was strong the live resin was stronger i'm [ __ ] lit i really hope this stream comes around again soon and hopefully in a bigger bath so more people can enjoy it but let me know what train you guys want me to review in the future i got a lot more on my plate that i want to review but i love hearing your suggestions you guys recommend some pretty fire strength to me i always appreciate it that's the video you guys make

Leafly this lets me know that look at that that looks kind of nice so that's mango skittles no listen listen with leafy hands and say now this is [ __ ] the mango cannabis strand has been around since the early 1960s hey that's [ __ ] in 1991 it was crossed with KC 33 to give us the current mango string the foliage turns to a deep red purple color was a smell a taste of sweet mango mango takes 9 to 11 weeks to flower it that's let me see if I can find something different you guys cuz that's just mangoes that's not mango skittles that's just mango I don't think they have anything on mango skittle [ __ ] because it is a new strain mango skittles cannabis grow John know it doesn't really have anything on mango skills but mango hasn't been around since the [ __ ] 1960s I started smoking weed like

go ahead subscribe to the channel hit that post notification bell so you don't miss any of these fires videos let's go it tastes exactly like it smells let me taste coming through my mouth right now coming from my nose to my mouth you know when you when you breathe it comes through your nose and goes in your mouth that's that's it's reversed I don't know why I couldn't get that out so when I breathe out I taste some angles on the inside top of my own roof of my mouth sorry you don't feel like I'm a little distracted I'm not trying to be distracted oh oh Korona ah y'all cover your food cover emails and stuff we'll just plain well I got a little buzz already that's kind of cool I definitely taste a lemony taste in the back of my throat oh it's quite smooth there's just a mild irritation on the back part of my throat of mouth burning sensation that's probably from coughing that is um the flavor seems to be a bit it seems to be normal though like a regular flavor like it's not spectacular it's a good flavor don't get it wrong it's an excellent flavor but it's not spectacular you know what I mean you know how this when you instill smoke she still smoke what have you coughing from now on all right back give him a breath straight whoo now three drums waiting almost profusely you'll see that great day in the morning all right yes hmm it smells like the smokeless wafting out at the top I don't know if you can see it on another video but smokes coming out the top and I smell like a scent diffuser it smells like like Musk like a musky Cologne wow that actually smells really good I think I'll burn some and put it in my safe defuse out in this plan it's quite nice I'm really getting a strong lemony lemon flavor at the roof of my mouth and in the back with this with a slight grapefruit flavor when I say grapefruit doesn't like it's not like it really tastes like grapefruit it's like you know the bitterness you can't even call grapefruit bitter I don't know what you call it it's not bitter because bitter to me seems like would be tart but you guys know how that dead [ __ ] the taste of this that messed up taste of a grapefruit that's what I taste my back my throw excuse me all stuttering and mumbling and all this other crazy [ __ ] I'm trying to get so I watched another video this morning about please telling a guy that that he needs to move along up the street and the gods DesPlaines her off so that he lives right here and the police officer said you don't live here anymore and then he starts walking dude he says put your hands behind your back and he's like what are you gonna do man what what the [ __ ] you gonna do and dude just start swaying on bone now the other officers a female officer she's standing in the back she got her taser out and she's standing up with her chains down while he's beating the dudes ass I mean he's like [ __ ] laying some gloves on dude got his head covered so he's hitting him in the back in the back of the head like that but I mean he you can tell he's like laying into him it's a fake cop this thing looks like he weighs about 300 pounds he's like ah put it all his weight on the whole time dude like what the [ __ ] is wrong with wrong you to pause like what the [ __ ] wrong with you the police is partnering with the taylors tank back she looks alright I don't know his name but she says all right Tim that's enough and he just keeps going well Nordby well another dude he's like what's wrong with you and the police like what the [ __ ] wrong with you and I'm like you know my point of that story was is that since it appears that the police are running amuck across the country why is not the federal government or the National Guard come in and take care of the pulleys down here's what's supposed to happen the National Guard supposed to come in take the police off the street in the militaries in the military suppose going and be as acting police or vice versa he's in the military goes and they get the police Hall and the National Guard goes in there and acts like acting police but at any rate the police need to be removed every last single cop needs to be removed I know for a fact that all cops are not bad there is really some good cops out there but we don't have time to weed through the good we do the bad cops to find the good ones dismantle all of them get everybody out of there you never work in law enforcement ever again you're like that's the only way to fix this problem I believe but the reason why I think they haven't fixed the problem is because no one's getting beat or what but people of color and the indigenous people which we are indigenous people as well but people of color those are Ottomans is getting whooped that's why I think the federal government hasn't stepped in yet now you best believe if rich old white man was getting beat by the police or white people period was getting beaten what better place there is white people getting beat by the police but I mean if it was happening like on a regular basis like videoing it like they're doing us man an extra girl would have been in here they would have been in here man this [ __ ] is getting out of hand the police you know cuz that's all I'm hearing about is the police are [ __ ] up I don't hear about no other agency tripping ain't nobody else buggin just the [ __ ] police what is wrong with the police show that part is when a police officers whooping your ass they've made to where you can't even defend yourself you're not allowed to defend yourself where do they do that in it what cops beating my ass I'm supposed to just cover up and just take it until he gets all the frustration of his wife not [ __ ] up of his kids not listening to of him feeling it's his [ __ ] his test to become a sergeant of all that I gotta take all that whoopin because he doesn't know how to control his temper because he can't control himself this really pisses me off you guys because they're not just doing it to to people of color and indigenous people I mean they're doing it to us or a larger scale but they're beating everybody they're running up on everybody man if you're protesting to run up on your ass they're really mad at you if you're white in your protesters what's the [ __ ] you doing white protester for black cause you know they're tripping off that [ __ ] all y'all can see I'm passionate about that my badge all Charlotte that bus taking a little bit more you're early their bulb burns really quick on and I am this is a street level to Gus so I'm kind of disappointed because I barely got a buzz but I was doing a lot more talking than anything so this one we're gonna wanna take one hit and they give you the flavor critique on and we're gonna move along one being at BS Tim be an FG s of the flavor critique of this mangled skittles really give the flavor critique of mango skills we're gonna give it a six I wanted to give it a seven excuse me I thought about a five I wanted to give it a 75 is to average seven is too much so we gotta give it a six I'll give it a mint to a high six on the flavor critique of mangoes skittles oh oh oh the buzz

my eyes they look like they're high Oh baby my eyes our eyes anyway let's get back in your mango skittles I can almost taste the skittles on the mango right now hmmm in the back of my throat top of my tongue I taste the slight very slight berry flavor it's really slight it tastes like though have you ever had a it kind of tastes like a blackberry mixed with a poison berry kinda anyway that's the flavor that I'm getting from it right the cross before him boy oh yeah okay there's a burning on the top back of my throat um the question is from the peanut gallery would I recommend this to my friends um I would recommend just the highest like it's a creepy eye cuz it's creepy every time I move or say something like well I'm here anyway the highest started to come up so I don't know I might recommend it to my friends I would definitely recommend dispensary grade of this to your friends cuz I know this dispensary great has got to be better than that it's good don't get it wrong and getting high but it's not intense it's it's kind of a mango high it's like the relaxed life you know about mango it's a mango hot if you've ever had mango I want to take a little holy whoa I

mellow high it is still a high and it's kind of like then even highlight it's it's kind of creeping but it's creeping at the even level if that makes any sense to you guys it's really a nice mellow high um I just see sitting back watching a movie with this buzz but I can also see going to the beach with this buzz the reason why I say I can see going to the beach with this bus is because I just

didn't make a list but they're real good and they were really close to making a list so what almost made a list but didn't we don't want to overlook anything so today I picked 12 flowers that are really worth the try that didn't really make any list they didn't make the top 10 they didn't make the top indica sativa x' hybrids that didn't make the sweetest they didn't make the strongest list but these flowers are right below that and I would say that some of these flowers people would just love them so I want to give them some notability too so today we're going to talk about them and coming in at number 12 is a flower called the pleasures and this flower if you haven't tried it it's really a great flower this is by Big Al's and Gashouse and this has 22 percent THC and I really love the the pushers if you see this flower it's definitely worth the trying coming in at number 12 plus from Big Al's and gas house but we're gonna move on up and coming in at number 11 by fire society we have ether and I really like this flower ether was the first of the fire society flowers that I really thought was really good I didn't make any the list but it's definitely worth the try coming in at number 11 24 percent THC ether but we're gonna move up the list and coming in at number 10 we have a cookie string called pomelo and this is one of those flowers maybe you never even heard of it before this this flowers a hybrid it's got 23 percent THC and I would say that pomelo is definitely worth the try this is one of those cookie strains that was for me it was in the top 4 or 5 strains of all the cookie strains I really liked it so we're moving up the list and coming in at number we have a very heavy hitter we have London pound cake number 53 this has 30% THC and it's a hybrid and this was a super strong flower if you like super duper strong you definitely should try London pound cake number 53 it was for the heavy hitters this is a must trying but we're moving on up and then coming in at number eight we have spin gog and this was a really great oh gee this I don't know what the THC isn't it because when I bought it they didn't really have the THC sticker on it it says wildlife on the front but this was a very good flower clear head nice feeling good going stingy where you go ah this flower number eight but we're gonna move up the list again and next up we have something from scoops which I guess is part of cookies ba Co and ba Co the great thing about Bozzio was the flavor this had a really earthy herbal flavor very unique flavor I really liked it it was about the flavor this flower has 22 percent THC and it is a hybrid and we're gonna move on up and next up we have alien og by the beard brothers and this one Oh G was really nice for me it had a kind of a minty taste I really liked it and it coming in number 6 alien og 20% THC you see the guys with the beards right on it beard brother farms alien og this flower was great number 6 but we're moving on up and coming in number 5 we have the jungle boys jungle cake and this is one of my favorite strains from jungle boys it didn't make a list but it's definitely really good this flower is 30 percent THC it's an indica and I got this down at the TLC dispensary down in Boyle Heights I had a run-in there and I ran out of there too anyway coming in number 5 jungle cake by jungle boys but we're gonna move up the list and we're gonna put in a straw of our favorite and we're gonna have this at the very end or take us out with the little straw paper cup of our favorite but I'm not going to tell you what it is yet so that's in and now we're moving on up and at number four we have the original Jack Herer and it's my understanding this is from Jack Herer wife and I met the people making this at a show called the champ show in Las Vegas which is the glassware of the bond show and this flower super strong if you like Jack Herer this is a good one it didn't get my favorite Jack Herer strain because this flower is really strong it's a little over strong but if you want to try a good jacket super strong I definitely recommend the original Jack Herer this flower has 23 percent THC and it's a sativa but we're moving on up and coming in at number three we have your highness brand the strain tequila mints and I really like this flower this is one of those sleeper flowers you might never try unless you saw this video but I definitely recommend it this flower is a hybrid that is 24 percent THC your highness tequila mints definitely worth the try but we're moving on up and coming in at number two if something called grease monkey by dole juh and ganja and this flower is a hybrid it has 27 percent THC and this flower you're starting to get to the point world will stone you to the bone this is a super strong flower this is one of those ones I only got a chance to buy at one time but I kept my one but as you can see dole jangan jaw greasemonkey fantastic 27 percent THC number two but we're moving on up to number one and coming in at number one is Team Elite genetics cookie dough and this flower has a happy feeling it was strong I liked it it's a heavy hitter 30.6% THC it's a hybrid and of all the ones that didn't get rated on any list this was the best one so if you want to try a really good flower that probably not too many people are talking about you should definitely try team elite genetics cookie dough this flowers number one on the list of flowers that people really don't know about so we're going to take you out with a vapor cup hit of cookie dough

Nepali og okay so Nepali og also known as Nepali cush is the offspring of OG Kush and Nepali land race land raise is when cannabis is grown in a specific area or land over long periods of time what happens is they begin to crossbreed and interbreed within each other for generations this creates a unique and untouched Rin of cannabis unique to that specific area or land and in this case it's gonna be Nepal so that's why we call it Nepal and race yes science so Nepali land races cannabis that has been growing and integrated for generations in Nepal and the surrounding areas such as Afghanistan Pakistan and India so that is crossed with OG to give us this Nepali og THC harbors around 21% and CBD at about 0.3 the Nepali cannabis structure is tall and bushy as you can imagine being grown in the wild pretty much as a weed so if you do plan to grow this plant just understand that yeah it does grow pretty tall and bushy buds are medium-sized and very dense as you can see here this is an indica with an intense body high and a couch lock so if you guys don't know indica in the couch so yeah you're pretty much gonna be stoned and stuck to the couch if you smoke too much of this so don't do that so some of the effects are make you happy creative euphoric hungry as well as relaxed some of the medical benefits are to treat nausea stress lack of appetite pain and insomnia some negatives with this particular strain are dry eyes dry mouth dizziness headaches and paranoia so make sure not to smoke too much so you don't feel any of these bad effects because nobody wants to feel shitty when they're high you know what I mean and the flavors you could be expecting to taste when you smoke this are spicy fruity sour earthy and a little bit of pine Innes because of the og as you

we followed a green gelato and a super silver haze from clone to harvest this took place over the course of just over two months and it's been very enjoyable for me to record and to share the progress of this grow with all of you so let's have a little look at a recap of how this grow went [Music] as always when growing this was a massive learning curve for me and i learned a lot about the two different strains if i were to say one highlight of the grow it was definitely cultivating the green gelato it's a strain i've grown a few times and i really have grown a deep liking towards it and then the biggest downside was using a strain that i had no history growing and i didn't actually know the exact lineages of which was the super silver haze but all in all i'm super happy with this how this grow turned out the green gelato was perfectly finished at the end while i still felt the super silver haze could have gone a little bit longer however i've decided to end this grow a little bit early and to turn the super silver haze into some dabs as i'm really really really looking forward to my next run which is going to be finally the fabled quarantine kush in this grow i made use of the bio biz range of nutrients as well as some nutrients from um yeah as well as explo grow from a pump company called explo grow which is a microbial consortium the soil i used was the auger soil lux from jamie's garden shop available at marijuana sa as well and the lighting used are 277 quad uh what quantum boards alongside a 182 watt uh blurple led so a complete led grow on this one and you are very very happy with the final result so in closing there's just a few things i'd like to mention this was my first ever grow series that i've ever been a part of and filmed and produced and a lot of this was done completely by myself so i really do appreciate the support that i've received thus far a massive shout out as well to cole who does all of our editing on these videos who has really allowed me to bring the content that i create even further to life and on top of that you know this grow wasn't free of issues it was uh happening during a very busy time work wise and i felt sometimes that the plants weren't given the absolute attention that they required but i treat every single grow that i do as a learning curve and to make it to the end and to see a beautiful harvest is more than enough for me so it's really you know a big privilege for us to be able to create this content for you and as a first ever grow series i'm incredibly happy with how it's turned out so guys that's all from me dean with my grow series i hope you enjoyed it i hope you're enjoying the content from marijuana sa and as always if you are please like and subscribe please check out our patreon and please continue to support us on this journey you guys mean the world to us and the support means the world to us as well until next time guys peace out [Music] [Music] [Music] hey [Music]

strain review this time we're gonna be talking about g6 jet fuel I gotta admit I'm a pretty big fan of this string it's just about gone this is this is all I got left this little teeny guy but I was really really impressed with this string it's a very mood mood uplifting strain I'm a big big fan of the high from this one it's a big mood elevator it's one that'll make you very very happy it'll make you smile and it makes you feel relaxed it doesn't give you any anxiety like a lot of sativas do this one I think is labeled about a 70/30 mix sativa dominant it's a cross between Aspen OG and high country Diesel but yeah like I said I think it's a great a great hybrid it offers you a lot of the best of both worlds really it relaxes you but it gives you energy at the same time without the anxiety the smell of it is very very pungent it's got like that diesel e type of smell to it a little bit piney as well the taste of the buds to me were a little bit fruity and a little bit Irby I mean it just tasted tasted very weedy if you know what I mean you probably do if you're a regular smoker but definitely definitely a good flavor from this one overall the look of the buds was pretty pretty great I was like an aquamarine color it was a very very cool looking weed I showed you guys a couple of pictures and a little bit of footage of it at the beginning but it had plenty of crystals on it a very lime lime greenish tone to it and then it also had like some apple ringing tones to it which I I found kind of strange I've never seen weed like that before but it was definitely definitely a good strain if you ask me the buds were kind of Airy you know typical of your sativa buds but they weren't too - airy you know sometimes you get a sativa and just kind of falls apart when you break it up it did have a nice bit of denseness to it so overall I think the buds were pretty good there and overall I'd say this is a great hybrid strain that offers energy and mood enhancement properties it'll give you a little bit of the giggles and a little bit of the munchies but I think the overall tone of this one is it's all about the mood it enhances your mood it makes you smile that was the number one thing I noticed from the first toke of this one so if you're looking for a mood enhancer I think g6 jet fuel will be perfect for you this version of it was grown by IES oh and I think they did they did a great job there we're gonna have plenty of stuff plenty of more strains coming for you guys here on the channel right now I'm smoking on some gorilla skittles so we'll be having a review on that one here soon but right now it's the g6 jet fuel and I think I think we'll give the g6 jet fuel we're gonna give it an eight point six eight point six out of ten very solid

Parkinson's disease it's not clear what it can be used for right now what we think it could be useful for are to help deal with some of the non were symptoms of Parkinson's disease specifically anxiety for Parkinson's disease people with advanced PD may lose weight so being able to help people with an appetite to regain that weight to help people with pain pain is one of these really pernicious non-motor symptoms of PD that is not easily treated it can be useful for these other issues that may be of great benefit to people with Parkinson's disease the new risk for marijuana and Parkinson's disease are multiple one first of all this is not your father's marijuana so marijuana potency has increased dramatically since the seventies through increased breeding the marijuana is incredibly potent and so the effects may not be what people expect along those same lines the issues that people experience with PD so just slowness and thinking cognition problems they already have some balance problems many of them do and they're prone to hallucinations or paranoia those are all symptoms which can be exacerbated by marijuana and it's the last thing you want personally PD begin to experience the exacerbation of their condition what would we know about marijuana and Parkins ease it's not very much so that's the reason why the Parkinson's Foundation is really leading the field to generate that basic level of information about what we know but we don't know about medical marijuana Parkinson's disease then how can we move the field forward only until recently has the marijuana have been able to be researched on a more broad scale in the u.s. those restrictions are slowly lifting certainly elsewhere in the world those restrictions are gone north of the border in Canada medical marijuana is more widely available than here in the United States it's still against the law in the federal level but many states are beginning to allow it Jews and so what we need to do as a community and this is why the Parkinson's foundation is taking the lead is being able to understand what is access meaning to marijuana how do we translate that into efficacy for people in Parkinson's disease how do we understand the different formulations of medical marijuana the different potencies the different combinations of the components CBD and THC within medical marijuana what's best for a person with Parkinson's disease at an early stage at a mid stage at a late stage it's that information that we need to gather as community so that when our people with Parkinson's disease are asking the question is medical marijuana and right for me we have a list of answers that can help them make that decision for themselves at this convenient we planned a whole will be bringing experts from around the world to a specialty in the regulatory aspects we'll bring in industry representatives who have navigated the hurdles of the FDA in order to get cannabis derived medications approved for human use we'll have basic scientists who can really understand the potential that can cannabis derivatives may have in altering the course of Parkinson's disease we'll have clinicians in the room who are experts in movements orders who can then and also have experience with cannabis can help guide us on what cannabis may or may not be useful for [Music] you",

marijuana now he's facing possession charges and a child endangerment charge because his four-year-old grandson was in the truck the rules say that 30 days after July fourth that patient valid patient card holders are legally allowed to possess and this is the gray area here dispensaries don't open until after the new year however as a card holder you are allowed to have up to eight ounces of marijuana and even grow it the state doesn't even mandate where you're supposed to get it from Jamie is in the right he does have his card he was within this limit the Department of Health and Senior Services told 41 Action News article 14 under amendment 2 establishes protections but ultimately the interpretation of how those protections apply at any point in time is up to law enforcement and the courts which is another unclear area they don't seem to understand the rules and regulations DHS s put out this year to protect the patient's the judge here in Davis County will decide by tomorrow if Wilson will still be able to use medical marijuana while he's out on bond in Gallatin Missouri I'm Sarah Blake 41 Action News we reached out to the task force to ask why they were following Wilson they never returned our call", "_k4ttDa181w": "well here at one of the cannabis retailers here in Halifax on Clyde stream downtown Halifax a couple of examples of some of the edibles that are for sale today and will be for sale more throughout as cannabis edibles continue to roll out so we have two peach mango chews here these are each five milligrams of THC with the total cost of seven seven dollars and fifty cents for this package eleven dollars or so for some chocolate these are sea salt and caramel milk chocolate bars and then twenty dollars for three packages of decaf peach ginger green tea with again cannabis inside and so a couple of the options here at this store with some renovated spaces as well you can see fridges behind me because they will be having beverages for sale as well cannabis oils for example cartridges that go into vape pens are also going to be available for sale overall the main message today is that the supply is going to be a little bit limited to start the selection is going to be a little bit limited to as this process continues to roll out in more of a trickle what can people expect when they only purchase for sure so the flavorings range from raspberry vanilla peach mango a whole array of different ones varying sizes from like a single pack to like four packs just because you know their varying amounts of THC in each piece as well and it's that like a consistent dosage I guess that's what people can expect when they have one gummy or half a gummy or whatever they choose to consume yeah for sure yeah they'll be labeled on the packaging so they know exactly how much they're gonna be consuming so there's no confusion about like how much you're gonna be I'm taking out each time and so this is kind of another way that people can enjoy candidates basically they don't want to smoke like who's I guess your consumer your target customer who you think is going to come through the door yeah definitely it's targeted towards first-time consumers it's great for someone who's never consume cannabis and doesn't want to consume it through smoking at all because there's no you know it's just going to be digested through your stomach basically yeah is it a different way like how does the body react to cannabis by eating at vs. by smoking at so generally I think smoking goes through your lungs and teaches or through their to your bloodstream through this way it goes through your liver so as it goes through liver the reason why such a low amount right now for edibles at a max - at 10 milligrams per package is because it's the t-shi can become a stronger version of itself through when it's processed through a digestive system so they want to make sure that you know no one's going to open consume because we always say start low go slow so you can just easily ease into it and figure out where your tolerance is at so there's no you know no chance of overconsumption as the products come from the producers to the distributors they will have certainly more for sale on the website in the new year and more selection throughout the next few weeks here at this retailer in Halifax as well as retailers all across the country depending on each provincial jurisdiction Bret Ruskin CBC News Halifax", "O1YIto4Xq34": "definitely love having strains like this on deck everyone loves to see it everybody loves to smoke it [Music] today i'm gonna be smoking on some gelato from gti got a fresh bowl packed up ready to go choose you guys oh yeah tastes phenomenal it's a super smooth hit gelato is a cross between sunset sherbet and thin mint girl scout cookies it originated in california in the bay area but somehow it made its way all the way to the east coast this strain is super popular mainly because of its looks it's definitely considered some rapper weed if you listen to rap at all i'm sure you've heard somebody mention smoking on some gelato at some point i mean these buds truly are gorgeous like when i look at weed this is exactly what i look for they're extremely dense and sticky buds mainly on the smaller side i picked up four different eighths so a couple of the eighths had some big nugs in it but for the most part they're pretty small buds the total thc percentage is coming in just over 24 the most prominent terpenes are karyophiline and limonene so it really has a lemony peppery smell at the same time it's super unique honestly and what's even more weird is as you grind it up it becomes more of like an earthy hoppy smell so like the set is really all over the place on this strain it's hard to really pinpoint just one cent for it [Music] the high's really nice it comes on pretty quick like just those two rips and i'm already feeling some pretty nice effects and this stuff [ __ ] reeks man i know i might sound stupid saying that because like obviously all weed smells but this weed smells like stronger and like much more noticeable and it lingers so if you're trying to like hide the smell from somebody i would really stray away from gelato because it definitely like sticks onto something i'll smoke a bowl of this and go out for a few hours and come back and i'm like oh wow my house still [ __ ] reeks of gelato i ain't bitching but hey if you live at your parents place or something and they don't like the smell of weed i would stray away from gelato at least if you're smoking in the house all right is there any life left in this bowl maybe a little it's weird it's not really fruity when you smoke it it has a couple fruity undertones but more or less you really feel like the earthiness to it all right let's take another bomb grip that was nice it does have like a little bit of a creamy taste to it on the exhale but it's definitely not fruity definitely notice more like earthy creamy taste which is why i really like gelato because it's [ __ ] unique it's definitely not your run-of-the-mill strain you're just gonna find anywhere and it's not an overwhelming high it comes on quick it stays for a while but it's not at any point where you're like [ __ ] i can't think straight like what the [ __ ] am i doing no it's like a very clear high and it's one of those strains i just [ __ ] love to look at it's bright green with patches of dark purple all around it and it just has these bright orange hairs it looks like they're just cheetos bursting out of the nug while at the same time just being drenched in terracones the more you break it up the more trichomes you'll find goddamn i love gelato dude it's a great body high i feel super mellow and relaxed but not like that like stuck on the couch feeling where you just can't do anything it's just like a really nice all-around high it's definitely one of my favorite strains but not my number one it's a little more stemmy than i'd like it to be it's a real hassle to pick out all the stems when you're smoking it and i mean this depends on the ground in the grower but this run honestly wasn't trimmed amazingly in my opinion which is annoying because honestly gti is like one of the best growers in pennsylvania but with this run at least each one of my jars had a decent amount of trim in there let's get another rip [Applause] in but this strain is great to smoke day or night it's really not going to put you to sleep it's great for the everyday smoker super euphoric you just really feel good not just like kai obviously you're gonna feel good but you just like feel good about yourself it doesn't give you any anxiety like i have anxiety as it is so sometimes when i smoke like my anxiety really amplifies but when i smoke this i don't really feel that anxious feeling at all i can be out in public i can speak to people and i feel totally normal it's not like that like oh my god what am i saying how am i gonna wear this oh my god sometimes i just totally freeze up when i'm super high in public and i really don't feel like you get that way with gelato like let's just take a moment and appreciate how beautiful this weed is great bud structure if youtube had smell vision you'd be [ __ ] yourself i definitely recommend picking this strain up if you ever see it at the dispenser i wouldn't consider it exotic which is for whatever reason the term everyone uses for like the best of the best weed which i honestly hate because like you think about the word exotic like this isn't exotic this was grown in someone's [ __ ] grove facility this wasn't grown in like the back woods of the amazons like i don't know what people think is like exotic about it like the term exotic i don't know it's just kind of silly to me but if there's like a term under that i guess would be like top shelf like i would definitely consider this top shelf weed but not the like exotic best of the best which everyone like always has to lose their [ __ ] over if i had to rate this out of 10 and give it like a solid 8 out of 10. my only complaint is it's a little stemmy it's really not dry at all which is really rare for pennsylvania so hats off to gti for growing some weed that's not dry i feel like i haven't really shown gti off much on my page but i actually really do like them i really have never been disappointed with any of their flower strains so if you're in pennsylvania and you see it it has my stamp of approval [Music] damn dude it really is smooth it's a great all-around strain super euphoric high super unique smell great taste definitely love having strains like this on deck everyone loves to see it everybody loves to smoke it let me know if you've ever had gelato and what you thought of it it's a pretty popular strain so it doesn't just have to be from gti but if you've seen it before let me know what you think about it but click like if you

University of Texas at Dallas recently engineered a prototype roadside test for marijuana intoxication all the test needs is a saliva sample to determine how much THC the chemical in weed that gets you high is in your system here's how it works saliva is applied to a sensor strip coated with proteins that bind only to th see if THC is present it will bind to those proteins then the strip is placed in an electronic reader that applies a voltage proteins with bound THC behave differently so there's an increase in electrical current which can then be converted to THC concentration if no THC is present there's no binding and no change in current the test can be done in less than three minutes and is accurate for THC levels as low as 100 picograms per milliliter that's more than sensitive enough to detect typical THC levels after smoking beyond the potential to help law enforcement the researchers hope that data from this study might help with the development of relevant laws Prasad is presenting her results at the American Chemical Society's spring 2020 National meeting and exposition in Philadelphia [Music]", "2IZa69rdR0U": "[Music] we are here at CES 2020 taking a look at the latest we'd check around so right now I'm in front of a booth for a company called pax and they have had a vaporizer out for a number of years now but today they are launching their new AeroPro it's a new vaporizer that actually connects with these specific pods right here to be able to give their users more specific precise information test results on the CBD content the THC etc in the strains that they're smoking not only does it give you more transparency in the information but it also lets you personalize how you take hits so right here you can see that you actually get to personalize how hot you want to smoke a given strain and also you get to choose how many doses you want to take for every inhale not only does it give you full transparency on the test results on the strains that you're smoking but it also lets you personalize how you smoke it straight so that app actually stores your preferences for each strain so maybe one you want to burn hotter and one you want to just sip on over time right and basically by storing that information and sort of adapting over time to how you smoke you gain sort of a more personalized experience to you're smoking houses right and the arrow Pro actually provides haptic feedback so when you inhale you get a certain amount a certain dosage and if you inhale hard or soft it actually still tries to give you a sort of adapt it tries to give you about the same amount and it actually vibrates it gives me kind of haptic feedback when you finish the dose so it's kind of a cool contraption here it adds it a lot of transparency a lot of smarts it's really cool to see this shift over time where they're adding so many smart and so much transparency to this burgeoning industry for more of the latest tech at CES check out our youtube channel otherwise thanks for watching [Music]", "WGS5bSNAqcQ": "- My name's Leah Campbell, and I'm a 36 year old\nwriter and single mom. I microdose marijuana to\ntreat pain and anxiety, and I have no problem admitting\nthat makes me a better mom. I do want to preface this by saying that I'm not a medical doctor. I'm not in a position\nto advise anyone else on how medicinal marijuana may help them or make their lives better. I can only talk about\nmy personal experiences. I have stage four endometriosis, which is a chronic pain condition. It started about 10 years ago. I've had five major abdominal surgeries. Pain has been kind of a constant in my life for the last decade. As a single mom to a six\nyear old, that's hard, especially when my period\nhits and I'm stuck in bed. - Hello.\n(laughing) - What's your name? - Josie. - Josie, who are you? Are you my daughter? - Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm. - Are you my best bud? I was not the person anyone\nwould have ever expected to be advocating for\nmedicinal marijuana use. I grew up in a family of police officers. My father was a narcotics officer for many, many years of my childhood. My whole life I've heard\nthat drugs are bad. I was 25 years old before I\ntried it for the first time and honestly, I hated it. Smoking marijuana made\nme wanna sit in a corner and not talk to anyone, which isn't a great thing for an introvert who already kind of is drawn that way. And I was pretty sure marijuana\nwould never be for me. So when a friend suggested\nI try microdosing, I was pretty against it, but I happened to be\nvisiting her in Seattle for another friend's wedding\nwhen my period started. And it kind of seemed like my period was about to ruin what should\nhave been a really fun time with people I cared about. So we went to a pot shop, and we discussed all the options and I bought a couple of mints that came in really low doses, and I followed the instructions\nof the employee there, to basically do no more than about two milligrams\nevery one to two hours. For most people getting high\non a medicinal marijuana edible would take five to 10 milligrams. So I was taking much smaller doses. I found that it really did\ntake the edge off the pain, especially the cumulative effect. So it didn't necessarily\nkick in right away after the first pill, but as I continued going\nthroughout the day, I was able to be more and more functional without really being high. And that was the key point to me, was that something was\ntaking the pain away without taking me out of commission. When I got home to Alaska,\nI started experimenting with marijuana more and more, and I kinda found that my ideal dose is about 1.5 milligrams,\nagain, every one to two hours depending on how bad my pain is. But another benefit came out as well, and that was that I started to realize the anxiety I've dealt with my entire life was leveling off on the days\nthat I was microdosing as well. And that was huge. You know, as much as pain\ncan knock me out of my life, anxiety can as well. If I'm having a high stress day or I'm just not in the right head space, I have a hard time working. I have a hard time being\nthe friend I wanna be, the mom I wanna be. What is that? - My tooth fell out.\n- Yeah. - [Leah] Can I see your mouth? Did it hurt very bad or\njust a little bit bad? - Just a little. - [Leah] You pretty brave? - Yeah. - So for me a bad pain day\noften means being stuck in bed, which is hard as a single\nmom to a six year old who wants to be going\nout and doing things. It's not really fair to her either. She can sit in bed with me\nall day and watch movies, but why should she have to? I do a lot of things to manage my pain. Marijuana is really just one tool in a great big bucket of tools I have. But in terms of pain\nmanagement in the moment, microdosing helps me, not\nmore than anything else, because honestly, prescription\npain killers I've been given knock out the pain better, but marijuana helps to\ntake the edge off the pain while still allowing me to be functional, whereas the prescription\npain killers I've been given knock me out too and, as a mom, that's not an acceptable solution. So these are some of the products I use. These are really small mints, and the thing I like about these is they come in the small doses I prefer. It's like 1.6 milligrams a mint, which is usually my preferred dosage. So this is my favorite product. I also buy chocolate bars. These chocolate bars come in 5\nmilligram dosages per square. The thing I like about this is I can get even smaller doses if I want, just because I can take a small bite and I could break one of these squares up into five or six pieces if I wanted. All of these are kept in my freezer, in a special box that my kiddo\nknows is mommy's medicine. We've talked about it\nand discussed the fact that these look like candy,\nbut that they're not. Hey Josie. Oh, did you just wake up? Thank you for joining\nus, little sleepy head. (laughing) Can I ask you a question? What are these things? - Mommy medicine. - And are you ever supposed\nto touch any of this? No, how come? - Because.\n- Cause it's not for kids? Love you.\n(lips smacking) I think at the end of the day, we're all kind of just trying to survive and that may be especially\ntrue for those of us with chronic pain conditions or mental health struggles. We just wanna be the best\nversions of ourselves. For me, microdosing helps me to be the best version of myself. After years of trying\njust about every solution and every option available, it's one of the best that I've found, and like I said before, it's just one tool in my toolbox, but yeah,\nit makes me a better mom because it helps me to get\nout of bed in the morning when I'm having a bad pain day, and it helps me to clear my head when my anxiety is spinning me out. It gives my child the version\nof me that she deserves, a mom who is functional and happy and able to get through the day. I think a lot of people take for granted that not everybody has that\nwithout the additional help. Whether I were taking a\nprescription medication or this medication that I'm\nable to buy at the store, shouldn't matter. It's something that helps. It's something that gives me\nthe version of me I wanna be. It allows me to have relief and it gives my daughter\nthe mom she deserves.

brought in chris from happy hydro we talk about environment particularly indoor grow environment we talk about the temperature humidity co2 and air circulation you all have made it very clear that you want to see more of these type of discussion videos the video i did with pigeons on plant training has over 105 000 views right now the video i did with rob from cl tv talking about plant nutrients that has over 175 000 views as of right now so you all have made it clear that you want to see more of these discussion videos and uh got one for you today the audio on this video is actually recorded onto one channel so chris's voice on it is slightly lower than mine in the future i'll make sure to record on two channels so that way the audio will be better in the future but still pretty good you can still listen to it so don't click away just yet let's get into the video all right we're here what's up chris how you doing good man how are you good good ready to talk about awesome ready to talk about environment or what let's do it all right so we'll cover uh let's cover temperature humidity let's get into co2 and then air circulation so basically covers everything has to do with uh plant's environment how's that sound sounds great man um you're located on the west coast i'm on the east coast we're dealing with different natural outside environments which um affects you know inside environments and also correct me if i'm wrong there's not people don't really have basements on the west coast right yeah i don't have a basement now it's just yeah on the east coast you guys almost every house has a basement right yeah like every house in buffalo pretty much has a basement and it's really a good spot to grow in terms of like trying to keep things private maybe like from family friends visitors you know it's a it's a good way to keep things separated but there's when i say it's a good place to grow it's not an easy place to grow in terms of like you know humidity temperature and controlling things so i take it you grow in basements i've grown in basements in the past the biggest issues that you have is a lot of basements aren't completely waterproof or sealed you know you get like a basement that has cracks in the walls and stuff and you can easily find yourself dealing with mold mildew and just like things like that that can really screw up and grow it's not the optimal place to grow but when you you know if you have a two-bedroom house and a roommate and there's nowhere to grow and you got a basement it's like well obviously we're gonna utilize that space if possible so we have to look out for cold concrete floors you know it's you don't want to just set your plants on the cold concrete floors in a basement um and also just in the summertime dealing with humidity dealing with the extreme cold in the winter those are some of the challenges but it is a common area that people do grow in and i i think that people could get some value out of some tips on how to grow down there if you're on the east coast absolutely absolutely so we could definitely talk about that so let's start off with temperature so me living on the west coast i actually live in a very dry climate a very hot climate i live in a desert region you're in a more humid climate since you're on the east coast you have bodies of water around you it's a lot more humid it's a lot more colder so i think our discussion i'm pretty excited to have you on here in particular because you live in such an opposite climate that i do and so there are different pieces of equipment that we use in order to control temperature humidity and so on and so forth so kind of starting with temperature so the ideal temperature that i usually aim for when i'm growing my plants is anywhere between um 70 degrees and about 82 degrees fahrenheit roughly that's kind of ideal now how some people may be watching this they have may have read my book and saw it was slightly different than that what's in my book is kind of a general guideline for that i'm kind of narrowing that down to be a little bit more ideal leaf surface temperature of 82 is what i've heard to be ideal so i kind of aim for that if that means that the canopy temperature is a little bit higher than that to achieve that leaf surface temperature of 82 that's okay now as far as how low it goes i had mentioned 70. it's okay you know if it goes into the 60s that's fine i actually do like to drop my temp in the 60s towards the end of flowering that way it tends to bring out some of the colors in some of the phenotypes that i've grown um so going down to the 60s is is fine for me like the plant will still grow just fine in that range but having a swing greater than um you know 10 15 once you get to upwards of a 20 degree swing between day and night time temperatures that's when you know you might want to cause for alarm it might be stressing out the plants too much so i would um i would agree with you and i think that i would do pretty much the same thing but one thing on the east coast that we have to look out for is if if we drop the temperature down to 60 degrees in late bloom and we are not aware of our humidity levels and we have like high humidity low temperatures um you know it's a prime time opportunity for powdery mildew to start growing in your plants like um i've dealt with it in the past having like too cool of a of a bloom at night with too high of a humidity um from you know growing in the summer or growing in a basement that doesn't have a knock a basement that's not completely dry or um or even growing in an upstairs like bedroom or something that you just can't if you don't do a good job of keeping your humidity uh low you can definitely have issues with powdery mildew with cool uh temperatures in late bloom so i would warn people watch out for that and then um another thing i wanted to well what percent is high rh do you consider high that you're at risk for powering mildew i mean if you're in late bloom and you're and you're over 60 humidity i think you're starting to creep into dangerous um territories i mean i'm sure it's debatable um yeah i agree with you on that one i've had bud rot uh in late bloom yeah big large dense buds higher humidity not enough air circulation that that is involved in this as well and with pottery mildew and it happens yeah and it's so depressing when it happens yeah yeah cause it's like you've just spent three months maybe four months doing all this work and you're you know about to trim or you're about to be cutting down soon and you find that powdery mildew and stuff and it's like oh man like what do we do do we now we have to throw a lot of this out like wow um it's terrible but to rewind a little bit you mentioned the uh plant canopy and leaf temperature surface and one thing i wanted to mention is that um if you're using like a grow room monitor such as like the pulse sensor or sensor push or any really temperature it could be like a 12 you know walmart uh temperature thing with the probe or whatever that probe you're going to want to have in your canopy the temperature at your canopy on top of your canopy could be different than the temperature uh you know in the in the side of your room or whatever so i think it's important for you to know that they want to take their temperature levels at the canopy where the plants are because it can be different throughout the room yeah i agree with that i know some people have a room temperature they also have that canopy temperature i know some people actually put it down by the soil so they can get kind of get an idea of what the soil level temperature is now of course if you have that humidity monitor just resting on top of your soil it could kind of be inflated as far as the humidity number for example um you know if you have a wet medium moist medium yeah and that's not going to give you a real accurate representation of what your temperature is in the soil right it's kind of like above the soil but it kind of gives you a general um general idea of what uh you know your temperature and humidity is at the soil level so yeah canopy level great call out is to get measurements there for sure um and then you know you mentioned bud rot and and uh you're cooling your temperatures down in late bloom and stuff a one thing that you can do or that growers can do to avoid that issue even if the humidity does get get high in the room is to have good air circulation so i know this was on your list of things to talk about when you have good air circulation it makes it hard for mold and mildew to grow so having you know the leaves on your plants just like you know moving a little bit signifying that there is good flow coming through the canopy is going to prevent um the possibility of a lot of like mold and mildew and butter out and stuff like that i do want to take a step back and talk about temperature just a little bit more so if the temperature is one thing that i use to regulate the temperature in my grow environment is an inline fan i use the ac infiniti inline fan which i know that you are familiar with i use the t6 model for my 4x4 grow tent and i have for those of you who don't know about the ac infinity fan there's a controller on it and this fan is is pretty advanced compared to other fans you can actually have set points on it as a probe and set points so you can actually hang that probe and canopy level and you can have the set points for certain temperature and humidity so what i have it set for is the temperature at 82 so once the temperature actually goes up and reaches 82 it will my ac infinity fan will turn on and it will start to exhaust some of that hot air and then of course my lung room or the room that my grow tent is in has air that is around room temperature it's usually around 70 72 degrees so that air is coming into the grow temp passive intake and then again once that hot air is being exhausted the fan will automatically turn off so it's intermittently coming on controlling and kind of keeping that temperature around 80 82 degrees when the lights are on now when the temperature is too low so say it goes down below my ideal temperature like i mentioned you know 70 roughly if it goes into the 60s that's okay but i have a heater in my lung room so lung room the room that my grow tent is in i have a heater so i try to stabilize the temperature at around 70 degrees 72 degrees for example now on my heater there is a feature on there which is going to you can put that you can set the temperature so if the temperature drops below that set point it's going to kick on so my lung room is stable at all time due to the heater and then as my grow light is on and it's exhausting with that hot air that stable um air coming in about 70 degrees is coming into my grow tent so my fan is coming off and on so that's how i regulate temperature in my grow space and then one other thing to mention was the sensor push sensor push pulse those are monitors that you can use within your growth space i personally use the sensorpush one i actually just got the pulse one thanks to you i haven't used it yet though but but um having that canopy level as well and getting alerts through your smartphone because there's an app that you connect and tells you what the temperature is what the humidity is you can just see it on your app you don't actually have to go into your grow room um so using those pieces of automation uh what do you mean records like it records the data over time so you can go back and you can look at your graphs and be like oh on i notice that every november this happens you know what i mean on the graph it gets too cold in my room so i know i need to have a heater in november like you can go back and analyze the data or like i know that like i'm noticing that in the middle of the night it gets too cold or it gets too hot in the day or you know whatever exactly exactly you can analyze yep and you can also do the set points as well on sensor push where you get notifications on your phone right so if the temperature drops yeah so the temperature drops too low i'll get alert then i can go into my room figure out hey why is this heater's not working do i need to increase the temperature so on and so forth or if it gets too high right maybe maybe uh you know something went wrong to where my lung room the temperature is too high um so the air coming into the grow tent is too high so that i need to make adjustments maybe add an air conditioner for example so how does it work with you you're you're talking about this um the sensor pushing how it can give you alarms to your phone this technology of like those types of alarms greenhouses have been using for forever um so my wife her grandfather owns or owned a greenhouse he's passed away and the business was closed but um in his greenhouse they had alarms so it didn't go to your smartphone they had a wire ran so there was an alarm in their bedroom in the house like in front of the greenhouse so if it was too cold or too hot um you know the alarm would go off at three in the morning and they'd have to wake up wake up and go out there you know they've got a ten thousand dollar crop they gotta uh make sure it doesn't die so i just think it's funny how the technology is still kind of the same but like now it's like oh right on my phone like i don't have to have an alarm like in my bedroom yeah so when the temperature reaches too low i'm using a heater you know my lung room temperature's too high i have actually have a central air conditioning is what i've used i've used those portable air conditioners before very inefficient didn't have good luck i mean temperature was super stable don't get me wrong but as far as energy consumption it was super expensive so i i've avoided using that i use my central ac now that's just in my area like i mentioned my climate that i live in i live in the desert region so i'm able to kind of get away with that what do you do do you do you have to run a heater and you have to run any sort of air conditioning too so um on the east coast if you're if you're growing in like your house where you have you know central air or um heat it's going to be very similar to what you're dealing with it's not going to be a whole lot different um but you know if you're growing in a space where you don't have like for example a friend of mine is growing in his basement and um what he does in the wintertime is he runs a couple of the growers choice 500 watt cmh lights instead of running led lights because he actually uses the heat from the lights to keep the grow space warm and then when they shut off he's got um you know a heater down there and i i think he actually uh vented his like heater for his house to like be able to uh produce heat into the basement grow room as well but um yeah that's something that people in cold environments can do you know leds are efficient and they save on heat but if you need heat use an hps or a cmh yep yeah it's going to generate a lot more heat and heat up your grow space i know growers who that's what they run in the winter time is hps so they can warm up their grow space and in the summer time they go to led yep yep that's um it's pretty common on the east coast at least uh for the people i know and the growers that i've met in the local grow shops and stuff when i worked there let's talk about humidity shift gears over to humidity so humidity uh you know there's a lot to be said about humidity what the ideal range is i know a lot of people go again go for vpd a vpd vapor pressure deficit we won't get into too much detail about what that is feel free to google if you want to learn more but basically your humidity level goes by the temperature leaf surface temperature to be more exact some people just use the the temperature in the grow room to kind of chase after vpd but it does call for higher higher humidity than normal right and you do come across risks for things such as bud rot uh pottery mildew mold things like that for uh what calls for higher humidity than normal vpd oh okay yeah yeah yeah so if you're running like 80 degrees i mean we can bring up the chart right now let me see if i can summarize vpd for for those who might not know basically like your plant is going to release moisture from its leaves based on how humid it is in the room yeah transpiration yep okay so it transpires it releases humidity transplant out of the leaves into the room and if the room is very humid it will transpire at a lower rate if the room is really dry it's going to transpire at a faster rate which is going to affect how often you have to water the plant and the the health of the plant and how it's producing cells and um growing yeah i mean that's one thing i run into is a very low humidity uh transpiration increases if i'm running synthetic nutrients for example bottle nutrients of feeding the plant it could run into very very very well run into a toxicity issue it's happened before to where you have too much yeah because your plants drying out uh the medium a lot quicker it's up taking nutrients quicker there's a plant available nutrients you can't run into toxicity issues with low humidity so kind of bringing up that humidity but getting back to the vpd i'm looking at the chart right now so for example if you're running a temperature of 84 degrees it's calling in the green area for about 70 74 to 78 humidity so let's just give you an idea that's you know some people hearing them like oh wait that's that's way higher than what i'm running right now some people might hear that number and they might be like oh i hear pottery mildew pottery mildew knocking at the door you know so um it's risky i think chasing after vpd i think is definitely risky the general range that i usually aim for is between 40 and 60 percent um so i can avoid pottery mildew you know bud rot when it comes into flowering so on and so forth what um what percent humidity do you usually aim for well let's um i'd like to just talk about early veg for a minute um well seedling clone and early veg because i feel like that is a point in time where humidity is extremely important and um a lot of people have issues with their plants during these periods that they think are due to ph nitrogen toxicity or not enough nutrients whatever like it's hard to sometimes pinpoint if you're not tracking your humidity well uh the the general consensus really is that you have to have high humidity in early veg and for your seedlings and clones or they just they they don't grow well yeah you bring up a great point i should have said that it's crazy the difference that it makes like i've i've seen a girl maybe i was even involved in it that had you know just vegging plants that just look like and you're like why is this happening like what do we do we you know we go through the list we try to narrow it down you know what let's introduce a ton of humanity uh to the room and get it up to you know 70 percent three days later all of the plants are just i call it praying for light when the leaves are just like they just look so happy like um so i think like early veg one of the biggest problems that people have that they overlook or don't put enough kind of like uh effort or whatever into is is figuring out or is getting their humidity up so uh one thing i saw which is really cool from seed to stone he has these little plastic domes that he puts oh so he transplants his seedlings or his clones into the pot and then he has these like plastic domes that he puts over them which acts as like a little humidity it only keeps the humidity up as the plant transitions into its new vegetative state and uh new pot and i've seen you do it with like plastic bags plastic bags over the cups yeah that helps with seedlings for sure which is cool too yeah but one of the biggest changes that i made like as an early grower was introducing more humidity and a veg and just it's just it's a it's a big um big difference yeah you bring up a great point i should have said it earlier when i mentioned that the 40 to 60 the 40 60 40 to 60 that i mentioned earlier is really for for veg and flower those are safe routes now when you're in seedlings clones um i run higher than 60 i aim for like 65 to 85 percent is typically what i aim for on that avenue and then when they're in veg you know mid veg is when uh you know i get below 60 and that goes against vpd you know some people are going to say that this isn't ideal and we're just kind of talking general range that the plant will grow in here um so i think that's the kind of a general range so like i mentioned before i live in a very dry climate so i have to actually run a humidifier at all times 24 7. two humidifiers actually have two humidifiers in my lung realm in my veg 10 i have a humidifier too and my flower 10 i don't need to run a humidifier most of the time we also run we also run a humidifier in a vegetation in this climate oh you do without jerry in this diamond yeah okay i've heard a lot of most of the time i've heard a lot of people i know my friend lives in boston and uh he's i mean he's right on the water so humidity is just naturally high i mean sixty percent plus uh it's just naturally i know in florida too it's crazy so people have to run a dehumidifier all the time or else powdery mildew you're both on deck just in case just in case because you know the with the season's changing i mean winter you know if you have forced air in your house in the in the wintertime it's getting dry and the winter just gets drier in general over here it's honestly a pain in the ass because if you're not really caught if you're not paying attention to the seasons especially if you're a new grower like you know you go you have this amazing grow because you did it in the perfect time of season and then you go to do your next girl and you're like you know why why what's happening why why aren't things healthy the seasons change and the humidity is different so we keep both to keep the humidifier on deck and the dehumidifier i mean just try to really pay attention to the season changes so you have them on at all times in the room even if you don't need it or do you only bust out the dehumidifier like on certain seasons we bust out the dehumidifier for usually uh mid to late veg and then into the drying phase like we don't we don't crank it during the drying phase because if you dry your stuff too fast it's just not good it'll smell like hay and not good so we don't crank it but we run it in the summer we usually don't run it in the veg we usually don't have to at all even in like mid-late veg um yeah we run in the summer in the winter we just run it basically in late late late bloom uh and in the drying phase uh the humidifier we run in the winter we're running it in veg actually mostly year round um like i said i just find that the veg up like the veg plants grow so much faster with good humidity so we don't really use the humidifier in bloom ever i don't think yeah i don't really think we do and if if we do it's only for like the beginning for you know a little wild first couple weeks or something but yeah that's a good example of how it's comp it's different for me like i'd never run a dehumidifier need to winter time like you mentioned the heat forced hot air you know i have a gas forced hot air heating system it does lower that humidity actually it was 18 the other day 18 that's crazy crazy low so i'm constantly battling that low humidity and that's why i have to run multiple humidifiers in the climate i live in and it's just a perfect example how two different climates two different setups you just gotta you know uh figure it out there's so much balancing i get so many growers asking me questions about what they need to do and they live in a different climate so it's like uh they it's like different than what i would do and so it's just a matter of uh tinkering with your equipment and figuring it out i think i think this is a good segue into discussing co2 yeah oh yeah yeah um using co2 the most ideal way and efficient way to do it is in a sealed room right because if you're not if you're just exhausting all your co2 out the window it's you know what i mean you're gonna go through tons of tanks or you know propane if you're using a co2 burner or it's just not extremely effective to run co2 and then just like exhaust outside so the long room is a fantastic way to uh to have like a a good co2 system where you know the co2 gets goes into the grow tent and then it gets pumped out into the lung room you know that lung room is going to have a higher co2 content like the the co2 is going to stay in there that the plant isn't the plants aren't consuming um it's going to sink to the floor because it's heavier than air and the passive intake on your grow tent i assume is at the bottom so the co2 is just going to get sucked you know back into the tent naturally and uh kind of just keep going into the tent into the long run into the tent in the long run and um and you're so you're using tmb naturals um co2 canisters correct yes and you you shake those up like once a day and they um do you do you like hang it above your plants or do you just set it on the ground so guidance from tmb naturals we you can do a couple things number one is you can hang it above your plants because co2 is a heavy gas it's going to sink down so your co2 will sink down there or if you have an oscillating fan within your environment they had mentioned it's fine to place it like around that either in front of the oscillating fan or behind the oscillating fan so that way it's blowing the co2 around i've just been putting it on the ground i've hung it above my plants before i actually think my co2 tank is uh the canister is actually oh right now i need to refill it um i haven't been monitoring the co2 uh recently i have gone grows where i've monitored the co2 very closely with those tnb naturals it kind of varies especially since i'm living in the house that i grow in human respiration my i'm exhaling co2 i have a roommate i have pets that is actually sufficient so when i go in my room my lung room alone it's like 600 800 ppm of co2 and when i'm out yeah without the without tmp naturals now with them when i got tme naturals in there plus my human respiration i'm up over a thousand oftentimes a thousand 1200 i know a lot of growers uh ideally they had mentioned a thousand to fifteen hundred when you're using like a co2 tank for example which i know you have experience on and there's a regulator and so on and so forth is that typically what you aim for or what do you what do you aim for when it comes to co2 and how do you manage it i think i think if people are are using supplemental co2 they're they're you know ideally trying to hit a thousand twelve hundred at the very least before i get into the tanks so i wanted to ask you is there a specific reason that you decided to go with the co2 canisters from tmb rather than like the mushroom bags or tanks or um they sent it or whatever sent them to me for free try it out that's a that's a good answer that's that's the reason why yeah i've seen those bags and those bags i've heard a lot of people say they're much more effective there's some i think last with 365 days or something like that i think the exhale bags but i haven't used those so we use this i used to sell them in the grow store i worked at here we don't sell them on happy hydro yet but um you know we had one set up in the store and we and we had a monitor on it and it kept the tent you know 900 to a thousand and i'm pretty sure as long as the the mushrooms are or the mycelium is growing as long as it's growing it's producing co2 constantly so basically i you know someone can correct me in the comments if i'm wrong but as long as that bag is is alive and producing more co2 and growing it can last as long as you keep it alive but they are you know it is introducing another living thing into your room that you kind of have to keep an eye on it and kind of keep alive i mean if you just throw that mushroom bag two feet away from a thousand watt hps light or something i'm pretty sure that light will dry it out or kill it or and there are cheaper methods to the bags and the canisters uh there's actually home remedy methods it seems like every time every time i release a video where i show the tma naturals or talk about co2 in some sense there's always somebody in the comment section who lists off a super cheap way to do their own co2 and their own their own method of doing it i don't have it memorized i've never tried it but there's super cheap ways in order to create co2 on your own without buying canisters bags tanks uh so on and so forth but you you run the tanks sometimes right you used to run the tanks i have i have co2 tanks so the biggest thing like if anyone's using co2 tanks right now and they're getting them from their local hydro store and they're swapping them out at the local hydro store um it needs to be known that those tanks were inside of other grow rooms and if other people aren't clean and they have bugs those bugs get on the tank they come back to the to the grow store they go to the co2 you know factory wherever they fill them long story short they come back to the grow store and they go to your room so i would tell everybody who walked into the grow shop here in buffalo that i worked at bleach your tank before you put it in your room take a take a washcloth with some bleach water and just bleach it down because properly diluted properly diluted yeah it would just really suck to swap your co2 tanks out and then have spider mites because the guy before you wasn't a clean grower or or maybe your growth store isn't the cleanest grow store you know who knows but yeah if anything that you're bringing into your room and swapping out regularly like co2 tanks i definitely recommend cleaning um how much does it cost for a co2 tank and regulator and all that stuff oh it depends um i i remember uh tank refills were like 20 bucks uh to buy the tank full for the first time i think is probably 80 to 100 bucks depending on where you go um and if you're in a sealed room it lasts what two weeks or something roughly it depends on how big the room is you know like if you're and how efficient you are like sealed room is a very loose term uh because i a lot of people may think their rooms are sealed but they're not um it's hard to get a perfectly sealed room like i'm sure there's plenty of people who have done it but uh there's always gonna be little spots for stuff to leak out and um but the tanks you know you can get three four weeks out of the tank in a smaller area if you're um efficiently sealed and and everything and you know the cool thing about it is if you hook it up to the monitor and the controller and everything you can keep that co2 level exactly where you want it and you can take uh they make this perforated hose that comes off the end of the tank and then you hang the perforated hose right above your canopy so it's just you know raining co2 right over your canopy and since we're talking about canopies in co2 something that we should be aware of is that the the plant leaves are absorbing co2 as the co2 approaches uh the edges of the leaf like it's only consuming co2 right by the leaf so if you don't have good circulation or like constant flow of co2 co2 is heavier than air so it's it's going to the ground at all times if you don't have circulation pushing that co2 around and back up keeping your plant leaves kind of moving a little bit um the plant is going to consume the co2 around the leaf and then you know if it's just stagnant air it's not going to get more co2 you have to have circulation or or some sort of you know distribution distribution system uh dropping the co2 onto the leaves ideally constantly to really get the most out of it yeah and then it always kind of worried me with the seedlings with the the bag over the cup we talked about that earlier it's like there's no air circulation going on there how is that seedling still growing so like it when it's small when the plants are small like that you can kind of get away with having the bag over for 24 48 hours 72 hours whatever or like you said seeds of stone has this whole dome that he puts over i think those domes actually have a ventilation um sloths so you can you can open it up um but yeah for a short period of time and when the plant is small you can kind of get away with it but uh but yeah you bring up a very valid point is that air circulation is definitely needed uh in order to maximize you know co2 intake and so you were saying that like just you and your cat and your roommate and everything like produce enough co2 in the house and in that room like if you're spending time in there to where you don't need a whole lot of supplemental co2 so based on that we can say that talking to your plants makes them healthier right yeah somebody commented on my one of my videos and they're like oh you just put your gym in there right you just what put your gym in there then you'd be constantly start working out and then do push-ups jumping jacks don't wear a mask in your grow room so speaking of ambient co2 if you don't have a sealed room and you're and you're exhausting um you know out the window or like whatever the ambient co2 in the in the world is between 250 and 400 i think it's closer to 400 and varies on on where you live um it is rising um but there's tons of like big greenhouse growers and stuff that just can't afford and don't have sealed environments to to uh implement uh external co2 so they just use the ambient co2 and in order to do that you just really have to have good airflow and circulation you know keeping those like i said earlier keeping those leaves moving you can still achieve good yields with ambient co2 but these new led lights that are coming out um such as the roi e720 they produce so much light that i'm pretty sure that in order to get the most out of the light to get the plant to be able to keep up and photosynthesize the amount of light that's being produced by those uh they they need co2 yeah absolutely right i mean commercial facilities are the commercial grow lights right these there's a reason why the they're labeled commercial grow lights is because in commercial facilities they regulate co2 and they're able to have the additional par hit their plants there are so many home growers who just fry their plants with these new grow lights it's becoming more and more common even at the proper light distance it's still they just don't have the co2 they have low levels of co2 so their plants just aren't able to handle it you bring up a really great point with that one so yeah increasing the co2 in your grow space will allow you to intake more of that par and also it allows you to deal with higher temperatures your plant can handle more extremities when it has more co2 i'm pretty sure it can handle more nutrients too seems like it just kind of like turbocharges the the photosynthesis process so the plant can just handle more it definitely helps uh but you know it's definitely not a requirement so i know something i could have a lot of new growers on this channel and uh some of them might be thinking that they need to start implementing co2 you don't have to the natural levels that are there is going to allow your plant to grow just fine i think the amount of yield that it increased as far as like a roi return on investment adding co2 versus not having co2 i think that's a bit debatable i think it depends on the uh the method of co2 how much you're actually spending right if you're spending a bunch of money on canisters versus bags yeah if you're sealed so there's too many variables to really talk about that one but um dude when i was a new grower i freaking walked into a hydroponics store and like i don't even know how to describe it like i just it was like my brain shut off and i i i'm no longer just growing a plant they made it seem like i needed the world to to grow this plant right like oh man it was i i didn't know what i needed and what i didn't need right because they just wanted to sell me everything oh yeah you're starting to grow co2 definitely i'm like okay well i have three hundred dollars and uh the bill is one thousand so how do we what do i what do i really need to just get going truth is you don't need co2 to get going uh you don't need a million bottles of nutrients really you're just growing a plant like any other plant and and uh keeping it simple as a beginner i wish i would have done that i did not dude i got i over complicated things so much that it was just it was a disaster the moral of the story is about that is like as a new grower like it's it's really hard to navigate and figure out like what you actually need and what you don't and at the end of the day you need a little nutrients you need a little light you need a little dirt and a little bit of water and some good temperatures right like you know environment is key yep absolutely and i think one other thing that we do need is air circulation right let's let's start talking about that and we'll wrap up with that one is air circulation is just so key for for so many different reasons um co2 we already talked about how it is important for co2 if you have stagnant air your plants aren't getting the optimal one on co2 because it's directly right by the leaf is is really what matters for for them in taking co2 so air circulation is very important you had mentioned that you like those plants to be dancing at all times i agree with that just a little bit yeah yep i agree with that um i also aim for that what i do is i'll have an oscillating fan above the canopy or right yeah right above the canopy so my plants are able to sway from that so there's air circulation there and i also have a oscillating fan on the lower part of my canopy you know it's usually on the ground and it's blowing i actually have those clip-on fans now that clip directly under the grow tent so this is super easy i can just adjust the height on the grow tent but above the canopy below the canopy those are two things i usually aim for and that's usually gives good air circulation that plus my inline fan popping on and off for air exchange that's usually a pretty simple method that's usually what i aim for now i've run one oscillating fan in the past and it died overnight and uh when i found it there's some part there was some bud rod that already started and once it starts even if you fix that issue it still can continue to grow within the buds and unfortunately two weeks later i harvested and then uh drying came and i opened it up to some some bud rods so that wasn't good but so now i'm running two oscillating fans of my grow tent at all times what do you usually do for air circulation it's just a kind of rewind to talk about oscillating fans you know that i've been doing tons of research into oscillating fans because i'm trying to find a high quality one to bring onto the happy hydro website and what i've found is that most of these oscillating fans the smaller six inch ones suck like they die on you like you said you had one die um and so i mean i think it's worth mentioning that if any cust if anyone out there is doing is looking to get an oscillating fan to do your research i'm not going to call out brands specifically in the video but do your research and make sure the brand that you're purchasing from you know has a high quality fan a high quality uh oscillating fan because like you said they do if it's a low quality quality fan they do eventually die out and um when they do three months worth of work can can be out the out the window so you know is saving ten dollars on your oscillating fan worth risking a failure i don't think it is i have no problem mentioning brands if they have defective products the one that you're i think you're talking about is the the vivo sun or some people call vivoson i think it's i don't know which way it's pronounced i've been saying vivo sun and they haven't corrected me on it so i'm gonna run with that but um i've been talking with them about that in particular because i did have a fan that died from them and if you look on their reviews it was just flooded with people who have that fan uh that would die on them and what they had mentioned is that they have revised that fan so that issue no longer happens what was happening the root cause for that is as the fan was oscillating the wiring inside was constantly rubbing up against the side and then there was basically kind of a short circuit i don't think that's the right term for it but the wiring would just get yeah the wiring would just get um annihilated from moving back and forth it would wear out and then it would no longer have the electricity to the fan they said that they fixed that problem we'll see if that new generation of fans if that problem is fixed or not but yeah you bring up a group i'm not willing to be a guinea pig for it neither neither will i uh put my customers up to that um if they do fix it and uh you know they put out a good product and you know i'd be happy to distribute uh a quality product but um until that's you know verified um we probably won't have a vivosun fan on happy hydro site right now i'll be the guinea pig perfect i'll be the guinea pig if the new one they send me is legit then hey i'll let you know if you get if you get bud rod i think you should send them a bill for your long harvest it'll be nice if i could do that that would be really nice but what do you usually do for air circulation so a cheap thing that people can do that's pretty reliable is to just buy a cheap box fan take to a grow light hangers hang it from the ceiling and have it blowing air right between the top of the canopy and uh the light fixture okay so vertical it's vertical it's not you know i'm talking about horizontal on the top of the grow tower vertical right vertical okay so like the side of the grow temperature yeah um so that's like just like a cheap way to to really move a lot of air i mean a box the box fan will move a ton of air um how did you how do you fix it up just like hang it from grow light hangers grow light hangers okay yeah and then it can just blow you know it's not ideal for like a 4x4 grow tent but if you're growing in like a bedroom or something um and you need to move a lot of air like you know hang up hanging a big box fan it's like a budget way to get the job done got it um obviously it's not as great as like having oscillating fans like mounted to the walls and stuff but um you know that's that's the way i was a budget grower like when i did my growing you know i was between the ages of 14. i don't tell my mom and uh 22 i wasn't just i didn't have a lot of money to to to invest so i found you know cheap ways to do things that worked really well uh and you mentioned that you put your oscillating fan you know over the canopy in between the light another huge benefit there is those lights are putting off heat and if you can just pull that heat right off uh before it hits the canopy that allows you to push those lights a little bit closer up up to a certain extent the closer that you can get the light usually means that the deeper that the light will reach and you know the denser the buds you could produce up to a certain extent [Music] but yeah that's a trick that i use hanging the box fan cheap trick um if you have the space then you have like an oscillating just standing pedestal fan laying around your house that you can just use you know grabbing that throwing in there is a good way to to just to have a budget option um in the grow tent i think that if this oscillating fan thing is dealt with and like they have high quality oscillating fans that can clip on to the um the grow tent pole you know that's perfect but if they don't there's there there are um i think the monkey fan uh there are fans that clip on to the grow tent pole that don't oscillate but but still you know are small combat compact uh and can push a decent amount of air into your you know four by four tent or whatever um one thing to mention about that though is you just gotta be careful to avoid wind burn right wind burn is a real thing if you're constantly blowing air onto the plant consistently the plant can have a stunt growth that dries out the leaves the outer part of the leaves and you'll see the edges start to to brown and curl down and things like that happens it may i've happened to me multiple times and also even with the oscillating fans uh if it's blowing directly onto the buds those white pistols they turn brown and start to recede a lot faster due to the amount of air that's hitting them so um you'll notice that i know there's some girls who have come across that in the past so explain that to me again quickly it's so like in uh in what part of bloom do is this a concern i mean really any part of bloom i mean i've been an early flower and i had an oscillating fan and every time it went to one side in blue it was hitting a bud and the bud on that branch the hairs the pistols went from white to brown and started to recede and then you look at the other parts of the plant and that wasn't the case now how much that's going to actually impact growth i don't know um but it certainly had stressed out the the plant to the point where the pistols had turned color and receded it's really interesting i never thought about that or i guess i just never noticed that but it makes sense i mean obviously the oscillating air is going to affect your vpd in the way that the plant is transpiring and you know drinking water damn i had something to say but i'm losing it oh okay so if you if you just have a carbon filter sitting on the ground and you have a fan on top of it like an inline fan and you're just you know scrubbing air in the room and you're sucking in air through the carbon filter and then pushing that air straight up um it's a good way to get the co2 that sinks to the floor back up and above your plant canopy so that's like you know if you're not worried about if you're in a sealed environment and you have an extra carbon filter and a fan just like laying around and you're looking for a way to get like some circulation going in your room you could just set that on the ground with the fan on top of it blowing that air up uh you know 24 7 you know another way to just get some circulation going in there and it'll also you know that filter will catch some pathogens and things other than odors that you probably don't want floating around in the room that's interesting and i've never done that scrubbing method before so i've never heard of that i think it's a great great tip for sure um when you're scrubbing so uh the only problem is if you're worried about odors right so if you're just scrubbing in the room you're not creating negative pressure so negative pressure for those that who aren't aware it's basically so if you have a carbon filter and a fan inside of your grow tent and you're exhausting air out of it you may notice that the sides of your grow tent start to suck in a little bit what that means is that no no air inside of that grow tent is just gonna leak out of like the zipper or a hole or whatever as long as you have negative pressure in the grow tent all of the air that leaves the grow tent goes through the filter first now if you remove that negative pressure so you're i'm no longer exhausting the air out of my tent i'm just you know scrubbing the air inside of the tent i've got the filter on the ground i've got the fan on the filter it's just scrubbing the air inside um air is going to smelly air is going to leak out through your zipper through your ports through through whatever hospitals actually use negative pressure rooms for patients and basically anybody who who may have some sort of uh airborne illness or something you know they put them in a they put them in a negative pressure room that way the virus doesn't you know accidentally creep out of the bottom of the door of that room the airflow is constantly creating a vacuum in the room you know so i think it's kind of cool how negative pressure is used in uh you know a hospital environment to to protect from uh you know pathogens and stuff infecting humans and it's also used in the growing world to prevent odors from just leaking out wherever they feel like so it's a lesson in negative pressure interesting that's good stuff okay so i think it pretty much wraps everything up our in talk about environment we talked about temperature humidity co2 air circulation this isn't everything you need to know about those things these are just kind of a discussion that we're having uh you know what we do for those different things to control those those pieces of the environment and uh i think it's beneficial since you know we live in different climates so talking about these things definitely there's some things that i didn't know that you do which is this is awesome and i'm not sure if you knew that everything that i had talked about as far as controlling environment in in the desert region so it depends on which inv which climate you live in always you know feel free to make adjustments as necessary in order to get your environment's conditions into the ideal ranges yeah and uh if anyone really if anyone has any different you know way that they deal with humidity temperature everything tell us in the comments um you know this isn't the be all end-all these aren't the be-all end-all ways to uh control your environment and i'm sure there's things that we miss and stuff so please comment in the description let us know like if we're wrong or if there's a better way or a different way to do something um definitely want to hear it

automatically generated by the youtube algorithm until next time peace", "iRPq0ozF7fw": "what's up it is 3 p.m on a sunday afternoon thanks for tuning into cannabis legalization news where we explain marijuana so you can change them today we're going to be talking about three policy makers who are just showing their whole ass to the whole world uh let's see we're also going to do an update about mexico and malta and somebody in detroit is suing detroit for just some petty stuff so let's just get right into it hey mickey hey tom oh i can wait i'm reporting from 1937. we have a breaking story that's come across the line for cannabis legalization news thank you for joining us everybody since it's 1937 we're gonna say i hope that you've turned up your radio as opposed to likes and subscribes uh governor ricketts who i'm assuming was the appointed governor of nebraska in 1937 says if you legalize marijuana you're gonna kill kids what was the date of that article maybe that was a march 14th 2021 what march 14th 2021 oh that makes me angry i mean i understand when it's something that is just so wrong that you think it's from like 1937 but when it's from 2021 and it's a governor in a position of power saying that weed will kill your children it is just a lie it's the same type of why we've been fighting against on this program and thank you for joining us by the way uh since 2019 starting with the 19. corn [ __ ] are in charge of nebraska dude period the the balls there's only one nut in nebraska yeah there's nothing i mean like i would i would probably be fine going through life as a cat lawyer in nebraska simply because they'd be like well at least he's not on wheat yeah and you're white and i'm white that also helps this haircut probably doesn't let's see that haircut picture that uh governor pete ricketts is rocking so governor pete ricketts uh gave a press conference as you can see he has adopted the lex luthor-esque uh seriously dude like like evil incarnate is right like yeah stereotype right there right and governor pete ricketts and other prohibitionists in nebraska held a conference on wednesday in the capital rotunda just ahead of a unicameral hearing on medical marijuana legalization mmj is in front of nebraska lawmakers for a fifth consecutive year months after losing ballot approval in the 11th hour last fall following a ruling by the nebraska supreme court governor ricketts said if you legalize marijuana you're going to kill your kids that's what the data shows from around the country um you know that is the biggest lie that i've heard all day simply because uh children are not dying from cannabis they aren't if anything in legal cannabis states children's schools are getting funded children have a harder time accessing cannabis especially in states where the illicit market is allowed to participate in the uh regulated market so all those people that were because you know you know who doesn't card right nikki oh dealers drug dealers don't card and so like i see stuff like this and when i see stuff like the the caps in florida when they say that this is about you know preventing our children our children are going to have brain damage and you're like no well you preventing the 10 percent uh flower cap on thc for medical cannabis or for lawfully purchased cannabis just means that the dealer down the street can be like you don't want those nuggets i got the real thc in my nuggets right here and because it's illegal i'm not going to be carding to see whether or not you're over 21 or paying my taxes but it'll still be a cash transaction this is how you get spice outbreaks and other uh outbreaks of bad drugs when uh you know overall you know my 100 percent and legalization but it's also our harm reduction and how we treat just our perception of of what it is like this is complete [ __ ] like complete idiots see like what the how are you shoveling stupid to your people and then still get reelected like how is this like like like like does anybody even ask like hey where are the kids that are dying like like show me the data show me on the doll where marijuana touched you but let me uh just continue to read some of his stuff and i hope that i don't get too upset about it so governor ricketts we already said that ricketts continued marijuana has big impacts on people's cognitive abilities changes their gray matter in the brain damages their ability to be able to develop their cognitive abilities to be able to think to do well in school this is something that's harming our young people and it continues on through the workforce so uh you know i didn't use cannabis when i until i was in college i've been a c student since i was four and so i know i'm pretty sure maybe if i would have smoked weed when i was in high school i would have done better but but no probably not have you ever gone to school it's exceedingly boring the only people that do really really well are the people that are like oh you listened to what the teacher said kissed her ass a little bit and then did it a-plus this kind of stupid does not do your constituents doesn't do america any favors like this is the kind of [ __ ] that so you're saying a guy who lives in a legal state you or me or anybody in legal states deserves to be behind bars because pandemonium has erupted you know this is it's and then not only that you're saying in order to save the children we need to keep it illegal so that the children can continue to access it through drug dealers as opposed to cannabis will no longer necessarily be something that drug dealers are stocking because people that can actually buy sell and grow it uh on a local level uh and where it's licensed and where the purity is regulated and then not only that where they're like i need to see your id oh i don't have my id get out dude safe access isn't is about uh uh you know it's the the the plant itself being a good plant like good product good known product and it's also about a safe place where you can pick it up like i go to the store and pick it up dude yesterday i just went to uh uh uh stop by have a heart and i picked up this uh for my sponsor washington blood code thank you so much so good um so good dude i've been smoking mids for so long i forgot what good we was like and oh my god this is the champagne the weed but anyways uh uh you know i went to the store yesterday they had a long line and everybody was a good citizen there was no cops no raids like the the kind of civility that happens when it's legal and people don't treat it like the [ __ ] up ignorant type [ __ ] that they're preaching in this like your kids no your kids are in trouble with the law because of this the law is the the issue not the plan this is not you know it's ignorance 101. you know ricketts said that the use of marijuana has a huge human toll sharing examples of two fatalities he says were linked to ingested marijuana or thc let's see the death report on those two fatalities meanwhile how many uh people have died of the coronavirus in nebraska or how many people died of heart disease in nebraska how many people have died of alcohol poisoning or like liver failure in nebraska how many people are dying of cheeseburgers in nebraska but for some reason if you legalize weed children are going to be the one who access it that why alcohol is still illegal because then uh children would would ha not be able to access or the children would be able to access alcohol i mean like it just makes no sense what they're saying the same thinking as like you know in legal states they're trying to put limits on what's already out there but we got to think about the children are you [ __ ] kidding me children will go to the store you're not allowed in the store you've got to be 21 and over so you're there and you've robbed the weed dealer and so now the weed dealer isn't necessarily going to be on the streets no more especially if you regulate your plant correctly and you make it really really easy for those growers to get licensed so suddenly they're trying to go legit because they don't want to be looking them behind them and see if everything's going to get shut down they're going to take everything they own they would prefer to be legal themselves and then again i don't know who's selling this weed to kids but i do know that it's not the licensed operators i mean when you know back in traditional days you know i don't ever recall being asked like hey uh can you prove me who you are and what state or what a idea is you know this is uh this is just dumb this is dumb and it's hurting this this this is the type of [ __ ] that hurts our society in the whole like you know i travel the bus you know to work every day when i when i come in i go through the city and i don't know if you know but seattle's a pretty big city you know and uh we have a huge homeless problem and a lot of these people freaked out like during the uh uh what was that when we had the chop and and all the maggot people were freaking out about like antifa and you know we're just uh uh un uh dystopian society well the thing is you know we have a large homeless population of people living in tents [ __ ] that i haven't seen in a long time and it has nothing to do with legalization but people point to this like acceptance of like but part of the problem is how we view mental health and drug addiction like harm reduction is 100 percent what we should be doing not incarcerating and uh putting things on prohibition like uh dr carl hart billion dollars out of the depend defense department's trillion dollar budget to help the [ __ ] homeless people why why do we do maybe it's because we like seeing homeless people so we can judge them as being bad so that we can be like you know not that guy i got some things going on uh but it's just so mean and so stupid how we do this stuff and so like you know again the ama one of the organizations that ricketts mentioned quoted a january article about a mississippi ballot initiative that said while it's possible there may be beneficial medical uses of marijuana numerous evidence-based studies demonstrate that significant deleterious effects abound and the article also notes that such measures put physicians at risk of criminal and civil liability now the ama is full of scientists and they should be better than that because they should know that the reason why numerous deleterious effects abound is because those were the only studies that got funded and they were trying to find any deleterious effect and then one of the big risk factors is the risk of criminal and civil liability that has nothing to do with the cannabis plan and everything to do with the legality and the scheduling of the cannabis plant agree yeah this type of [ __ ] until it's over so you know if if you guys have not yet i mean like you're not you can't disrespect the office but you can invoke people out of office you know you can't you can be polite but firm and then of course then if you're a trumper you can just forget that america is a thing and do whatever you want until like again you get arrested but don't recommend that you know you're not going to convince these people of this because they're already in belief of stuff that ain't real you know it is this is oh my god dude this is why i smoke some good weed like this is why you need good weeds just to put up with this [ __ ] this this idiot odyssey uh that this guy is a representative of a group of people in america and then he has a bunch of other people that agree with him that you know what studies are you guys looking at where are you why why is this such a thing for you to to deny like prohibition doesn't work right we've had how many billions devoted against uh this plan howard buffett and because warren buffett's kid is crazy and he's an anti-prohibition guy and he's got billions of dollars and so that's one of the reasons why uh macon and and uh not detroit the detroit of illinois decatur uh has had such a hard time in illinois getting more licenses and opting in to allowing cannabis businesses is that howard buffett spends all this money on propaganda and of course like the picture of mr ricketts at the podium he's at a sam podium smart approach marijuana the most ironically named anti-marijuana uh organization in the free world but and this is why we don't have nice things because these well it is not us per se but like the [ __ ] and government the people who are running the show the ones who are the authorities right like ones that are stuck right here in 1957 you know where things were easier because you didn't have to really think you could just depress people and believe in crap and then you know what didn't matter you just had to make sure that you had a good haircut and you're white especially a man and then you could just tell people facts yeah yeah make [ __ ] up [ __ ] and that's the problem like so the ama they're like a roller coaster too and i think anything that is a entity in government is a roller coaster of this opinion on cannabis like with the va you know one year it's like don't do it next year it's like okay we're gonna think about letting you guys do it so it's okay it's not a plant that's killed anybody no one's proven anything and now it's like don't do it again people it's not this conversation is so more about wellness and social justice that at the end all game everything that we preach about this is the greatest hypocrisy we got going on right now oh yeah and the hypocrisy continues because ricketts also cites the american psychiatric association a dubious association in my book if you ever see how antipsychotics work which pdf is 2019 position statement on the matter posted online uh and the document concludes with the apa does not endorse cannabis medicine the words danger or dangerous don't appear in the document however it does say in part policy and practice surrounding cannabis-derived substances should not be altered until sufficient clinical evidence supports such changes well that's effing impossible because of the way that the funding is currently set up the only funding is for finding harm there is no funding in for finding benefit because that would defeat the purpose of schedule one tac if you think about too a a psychological company they're not there to help you get better i mean like the if they were they would be promoting what would help which is treatment and and and consultation and you know they there's no magic [ __ ] pill that makes anything better like whether it be uh schizophrenia i mean it helps but things with treatment need to be done like that's this is just pure fear mongering of taking care of yourself you know the endocannabinoid system i'd imagine you know it's entwined with your nervous system your bone structure seriously throw that freaking back into the pipe of the american psychiatric association uh so this endocannabinoid system that we discovered approximately 30 years ago and i've done a lot of research on predominantly in israel where it's more lawful to actually do research that's objective as opposed to trying to find the harm why isn't that enough i mean like we know that it's a biological system in our body we know why it works we know what it does we know that it doesn't kill people now does it i'm not sitting there saying like we should give it to children no right the stuff your home it's it's that as as dr ethan russo told us and if you haven't seen that episode on cannabis legalization news smash the likes hit subscribe and then search uh ethan russo cannabis legalization news on youtube and you'll find it and he does a great job explaining that this is the chief homeostatic regulation regulation system on your body or in your body stuff doesn't usually get out of whack when you're a kid stuff starts your whack more and more as you get older more and more after you've seen enough rotations around the sun where you're going to get injured or where you're going to get old or where you're going to have pain or where you know you might have um audio audio auto immune diseases like crohn's or ibs or or lupus or or uh so many other diseases that your endocannabinoid system's out of whack on and and the only thing we clearly have is we have a governor of nebraska that's suffering from uh cannabinoid deficiency and we all are paying the price for and by we all i mean like i have to read this and get like so mad that suddenly i become cyclops without his freaking visor and then um not only that you know those poor people in nebraska that actually need access safe access to their medicine what are they doing well they've probably already moved yeah now i'm proud that i cursed not as much as i thought i was going to on this uh i mean really i was heated when i saw the topic i was like oh man oh she's gonna be effing all the time keep rolling on to the next one i'll go back to 1937. hang on [ __ ] let's cut uh okay so the next story is just as bad as the first story tennessee republican wants to permanently block recreational marijuana through state constitution in tennessee yeah and this this one even it gets worse right so representative brandon ogles of franklin tennessee received approval in the house criminal justice subcommittee for house joint resolution 140 which would amend the state constitution prohibit future general assemblies from permitting recreational drug use now the hate and stupidity does not stop there it goes on to the potential constitutional amendment would also prevent the state legislature from ever legalizing rape human trafficking or prostitution without making any another change to the founding document like how are you going to put rape and and prostitution in the same like the thinking here is not you're putting rape in par what was it prostitution yeah one of those things is consensual and then the one with the cannabis that you're putting in there there's no psychological dispute or there's no real psychological damage for adult use cannabis but anyway this is one of those things where i'm so angry and it's 420 somewhere that we can test the official position of the department or the ministry of health of japan this should make me violent so violent that maybe i'll even have more burning eyes after this 420 bumper [Applause] [Music] okay it was all a lie tell the minister japan that it'll kick in i'm sure your anger will [ __ ] well now as we continue on with this one anger is going to continue on ahead of wednesday's meeting yeah although amended the resolution he initially filed to also include the ban on legalization of recreational use of substance on the federal drug schedules list the item first only pertain to sex crimes i mean come on man do we i mean what kind of [ __ ] stupid like how are you gonna ever like first off why do you even need a bill for legal like we're gonna stop like we're gonna make sure no one ever legalizes rape like like was that ever an issue where is the legalization of rape uh lobby that's like you know what we need we need to legalize that uh rape but this is that [ __ ] we're like i'm doing a good thing here but at the same time we gotta get the we people like they're all the same people right yeah because there's there's two stops after marijuana uh the first one is human trafficking and the second one is rape you know according to the ministry of japan cannabis use makes you violent uh man like the problem the real problem with the the laws are that they're so wrong that they like we're not trying to get like censored by youtube we're trying to like say like no there's an endocannabinoid system this is why medical marijuana actually works here's how these other things work you really have nothing to fear about this plant it's terribly over regulated you guys are just causing yourself unnecessary harm because you believe in fat fantasy and lies and remember everybody in this country was [ __ ] brought up to believe that santa claus is a real goddamn thing that brings you toys in order to support your parents to be able to manipulate and control you and then we're like shocked that our leaders are still feeding us lies and garbage so they can manipulate and control us but that's the thing though man everybody's between the santa claus lies and the [ __ ] the government's here to help you lies i mean gary's been swayed government's a little kind of like a wizard like the government is basically santa claus to a certain extent especially in america shout out to rob man thanks for tuning in really appreciate it um love that show up clt be in the grommies man hell yeah and so um i had a point most mostly my point is um sometimes when i read the news out of the south or nebraska i feel like it's before we had technicolor before we had science facts or even knew what the endocannabinoid system is it's a very special time that makes me angry but this is why flower states get a bad rep this is why the flower states when everybody thinks that you're you know uh banjo uh i hear songs coming when i walk you know i mean like it's just you're being a stereotype stop being stupid stupid stop it stop stop hurting your people stop hurting america i mean essentially all gays told the committee this will ensure we never have recreational drug use in the state because it's illegal to drink i'm assuming or smoke cigarettes in tennessee this will ensure that we never have recreational drug use in the state i think it's a very much an expression of the value system we have in the south in this state again evidently you're not allowed to drink or smoke cigarettes in tennessee or maybe not even have coffee where do we draw the line on drugs because like with this unlike with coffee i don't have to filter this through water to make an extraction first off it wouldn't work if i was going to make an extra extraction from it i would do it with a more of a polar solvent you know like an alcohol and or a butter however then sure that's more of a drug coffee is more of a drug than cannabis flour cannabis flour is a plant again the perception of drug use and how we interact with drugs and how we treat things because like you're saying it's a variety of things from coffee to heroin right let's just it's everything it's sugar you know and if we can just learn the chemistry won't be a drug let's all realize how much of a drug sugar is you take the sugar cane and then you gotta process the crap out of the sugar cane so much so that you can strip out any plant material what so frickin ever and then you get what's the chemical composition i know it's carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen because it's an organic molecule but what a hey if you're watching out there and you know the chemical symbol for uh sugar uh and that that that would be of course um uh sucrose not uh dextrose or or fructose uh we're gonna go with uh is glucose because glucose and fructose put together is sucrose that's sugar did you say [ __ ] those we are yes this is what happens when cannabis legalization news get enough gets onto a tangent we should have a tangent bumper but the thing is though i mean come on this is the [ __ ] with the the save the children and the recreational drugs we'll never we don't need this in our not my backyard [ __ ] children and so like if i'm gonna be giving uh their kind of bs lines i should at least look like a cat if i'm gonna say like we need to make sure we have cannabis concentration limitations for our regulated cannabis markets for the children i should look like a cat if i if i'm telling my voters my elected representatives in nebraska that the reason why medical cannabis should not come to nebraska is because it kills children i should look like a cat because you are in a freaking world of fantasy it's not real and you should be robbed of your reality if you're saying dude i you know it's just hard to see that there's so much stupid out there but at the same time i know we have a lot of good people and that's the thing like everybody's like oh this legalization is going to happen tomorrow this legalization is going to happen tomorrow and you and me and then if you're joining us on wednesday you should hit them thumbs up subscribe and then tune in on wednesday we're going to talk about tommy chong and all the weedy smokes for the past 60 years um but that's a point of it man like you know chong probably thought it was gonna be 10 years away 40 years ago i thought it was going to be five years away 10 years ago you know and and then some people think it's going to be tomorrow this year and it ain't because some people think that cannabis will kill kids and not only do they think it they have press conferences where they announce it as if it's a fact and again if it the more act or whatever happens if something happens even though uh what's the shunmu turquoise session where he talks about like it's always a priority for democrats like i'm not gonna see i'm not i will be excited we will go live the day of if something goes through a bill where they say hey like we did it to the moor act originally but i'm not holding my breath man like this is not you know we've we've but we are they've gotten everything off their plate though and so like i'm yeah i'm optimistic that the second half because now we're getting into the 420 time and so uh after wednesday we're past st patrick's day and then it's the next holiday is really easter and 4 20. and so i'm thinking that that's probably where they're going now that they've gotten the senate all of washington's gotten the 1.9 trillion dollar corona relief package uh signed sealed and delivered on to the next one and maybe some of that next one is going to be that uh cannabis package coming out of the senate you know we will be going as soon as we have details on that yeah no i just you know uh being that we're further than we were which is nice but again it's never far enough when people like lance gore hasn't seen his mom and his daughter personally in six years like how does he let the prosecutor that's wrong not even just but not just the prosecutor but the visitation visits like like he hasn't had access like so that nut job in the the buffalo guy the when they the insurgency when that guy took over that [ __ ] got a in meeting with with the news people like the following day lance hasn't seen his mom or his daughter his daughter graduated high school uh college and uh uh like brilliant kid um without her dad like prom all this [ __ ] all the life stuff like she's got a dude i mean just life like the government has taken away this man's life and not just his but many others you know women this is [ __ ] they're a plant and what does this plant do makes you better well again it it helps regulate your homeostasis levels yes and so like uh if you have things like think about anxiety or anything else or like you know pain stuff where your your central nervous system is kind of like freaking out a little bit uh that may be why your cb2 receptors are all over those types of areas in your body and then also maybe while your cb1 receptors are very very concentrated in your brain except not in your brain stem and so like you're not going to stop breathing like you can with alcohol or opium or opioids this is not an opinion this is a biological fact based on thousands of dead people tens of thousands of dead people and how many of them were dead from marijuana you know two people did get hit by a bale of it and so they were like moving a couple of bales and and oops but that was a farming accident that really wasn't but you know like you're like you're saying though like it's it's a stabilization of your body like kind of like how you have centrum for women and centered from old men for seniors right like there's skywalker you know there's the sky master sky master excuse me i mean this thing dude i really tell the difference of really good weed these are all top colas and uh i've been buying mids man right at the top oh yeah that's that's good i've been powering through in the gang oh look at hey uh slowly now now let's see if you can get the autofocus going put it up a little bit higher your eyes and it might block off your face okay uh there it is this is what we're fighting for everybody i feel like we're on a uso show but we're looking at pictures of weed right oh i mean just the fact that this people are serving time or this little amount right here not even not even a gram probably uh it would put you in trouble like in tennessee like you like as soon as you're in town you drive through the the state line you're ass puckers and you're going to be like all right if that one cop sees me because i'm too dark and decides to pull me over and happens to smell something i'm [ __ ] yeah but let's get back to this [ __ ] who's in charge of tennessee olgas is his name or olga's uh o-g-l-e-s it's uh i think it's norwegian for stupid but uh amending the state constitution is a years-long process the legislature must approve a resolution with the proposed language in two separate general assemblies hopefully one is not run by you know people who don't believe in science uh meaning it would need to be taken up by the legislatures in 2023 or 2024 session if it passes this section or session hopefully then this means this was just grandstanding on the part of the governor and the reason why you grandstand as a politician is because you're supposed to be solving problems and all the problems were caused by all the politicians before you and now you're going to be the only one that escapes this this uh causing of problems by politicians and fixes everything so uh what pardon you missed the uh the awesome statement here august also added that those long-standing southern values were eroded in virginia as a result of the recent legislation like like what's up these people with their values like there's a guy on the floor the other day that said i know that black lives matter don't like traditional family what the [ __ ] are you talking about we all have moms dads people we love like what the what kind is this [ __ ] values like we are not going to believe in science and we will oppress people is is that one of the values what are these when you say values it could be just a bouquet of freaking flowers man well what type of flowers are they daisies you know are they uh are they marigolds are they uh dandelions or you got something worthwhile for us you know like you know what are you what are you saying these values are because values could be racism you know that's the value is that the value they want is because like the values against the south it sounds like that they're really upset with because you know virginia actually legalized it sounds like the values they want are not believing in science and oppressing people because they can that sounds like a really un-american value i wouldn't be sad if he happened to walk outside and got throw punched but you know whatever no no no you're not allowed to do that he's an elected official you have to respect the office and that's why you vote him out of it because he's clearly not qualified damn right i mean he's preaching goddamn third grade like like who is your audience who what is the educational level for your constituents like i feel sometimes sad like please tell me i not all of uh what messed up state is this not all tennessee things like this i know they don't let's bring it home because uh governor olga said that if you ever want to have a true discussion about medical marijuana you have to truly solidify it we'll never have recreation the conversation will not even be had by a dozen or so conservative lawmakers in this chamber until we know without a doubt there's no recreational coming on its heels and the slippery slope is stopped period and so like um that is just a catastrophe of a statement and these catastrophes of statements are often made but rarely this terrible because first off it says if you ever want to have a true discussion about medical marijuana i don't know if this guy has the ability to have a true discussion about medical marijuana because it appears that he does not understand the endocannabinoid system otherwise he would not have this tact uh and then you have to truly solidify that we'll never have recreational god forbid anybody in tennessee would do anything they enjoy what is tennessee the home of like whiskey and nashville yeah just saying where did it hurt you where did this little flower of a plant like did it jump out and get the bad day one day i mean like what how did this thing come at you one day like you gotta stop a slippery slope because like giving people something that's an alternative to opioids alcohol cigarettes lots of other perhaps pharmaceutical drugs for sleep to anxiety what type of slippery slope are you trying to stop here the slippery slope away from being uh addicted to prescriptions and like you know not being able to get off of these prescriptions is that the slope you're trying to stop do you not want your people to be healthy well isn't also tennessee the place where uh like the oakway pandemic like was a peak once thought with like all the focus of the doctors hustling pills and on all the stuff like i believe big farmers got a big pool there like just like a florida big pole in um indiana because i mean that's where like eli lilly is but then where spies are located moderna pretty sure fives of modern are not in the south like you know but it's still it's like you got poor populations are easily manipulated you know that's that's that's what i'm saying people you are a commodity you know they your constituent is not looking to you as a somebody to want to be for your favor they're thinking you are an asset that i'm going to shovel this pill program for you you know this is ridiculous man there are websites to namaste said mel genitalia [ __ ] candies yes uh just want to give a shout out to jay phoenix for throwing us fiverr on this you know really appreciate that i'm not necessarily saying that people should find out where the governor of tennessee and or uh nebraska lives but uh if you would mail them a sack of gummy bears perhaps um you could do but you know it's not necessarily what you you may want to do however you have to realize it's at least sending a message yeah when you're talking to people that have so checked out from reality they believe that they may have lost the ability to enact sensible regulation to make the right decision when it comes to uh appropriate policy on this because they have made a moral judgment uh and that that really kind of relieves them of having to make a factual judgment well and i think we have to like say what like with mcconnell and uh uh you know their constituents re re reelected him right like the man helped push the hem thing through but again he's also a horrible human being like how do we manipulate the legislatures to benefit the the campus the cannabis policies right so i doesn't normal grade uh because the constituents what not there's a lot of grading that goes on you know by well normal's not necessarily an ngo they kind of are actually but these types of political organizations that are trying to rank uh legislatures because i just say you know look at your local areas and and and see what you can do you know it if you're not going to be the one to run against that person you can at least always support the person running against the one that's going to be in your favor with the you know what you're what you want yeah well let's move on to the next piece of crap story that's coming out of the south uh florida house committee approves thc limits for medical marijuana so the bill aims to prevent medical marijuana from being treated as a recreational drug but opponents argue there's no justification for the measure representative spencer roach likens what he's seen now in the state's medical marijuana industry to the practices that precedes the opioid crisis are you [ __ ] kidding me dude but hey this basically means that we now have a factual discrepancy with mr roach now first off he's one of the most ironically named senators in florida that senator roach is against the medical marijuana however he's starting to conflate the opioid crisis with cannabis now to this is where the slippery slope actually is to go down this means that you are not paying attention to the factual aspects of the substance and its effects on your body and and that is the dangerous slippery slope you see he's going to now stay opioid or opioids heroin those types of things and then disappear and go well that means marijuana that's right that's just factually wrong it's legally correct under uh the federal law legally that is the correct statement which is wrong it's shockingly wrong terribly wrong like hurting us wrong but that's i think part of the education right we have to teach these dumb asses that cannabis is not toxic non-toxic right all these other things are toxic like go through your liver and get flushed out and uh it hurts your body you know inevitably uh cannabis it clings it loves your little fatty cells and hangs out and things and you feel great with it like your body is not recognizing it as if it is alcohol cocaine heroin uh some other drug which is also recognized as a poison by your body uh for some reason your body is recognizing this cannabinoid as something to store in fat cells for regulation for later first like some reason yeah again it's a natural product like and i always it's like being a dead horse but scurvy we learned the hard way that if you don't get vitamin c you get scurvy you know and so if your body doesn't get thc you get [ __ ] up law enforcement [ __ ] up law enforcement you also get a whole cavalcade of uh treatments that the pharmaceutical industry is not all that great at treating for chronic conditions that are probably caused by endocannabinoid disruption not that we're allowed to study this disease or or even system uh and as a result who suffers you me the people everybody who benefits law enforcement pharmaceutical companies exactly there's so much misinformation that people are you know that's the thing about law enforcement right like i am not an acab i i like cops i i have nice things i want my my kids to be protected and stuff like that like they there's better [ __ ] and other [ __ ] to worry about and and legalization the prohibition hurts our society like like we are under trust in law enforcement that's what it does cannabis prohibition undermines trust in law enforcement it's it's you know the other day uh i was thinking uh i had uh smoked a little bit and uh uh i was on my way home and i i was right next to a cop right next to me at the light first i tensed up a little bit but then i realized there's no reason for this guy to even like suspect me or do anything like like that went away real quick opposed to 10 15 years ago or out of state anywhere out of this state my ass bucket is when i have a cop around me yeah but this guy this senator roach i'm sorry representative spencer roach i saw spencer and i thought it was senator representative spencer roach he says 15 years ago when we look at the opioid crisis that's what we're seeing this kind of doctor shopping drug seeking behavior we not only have a responsibility to act now but an opportunity to act before it's too late i would like to direct spencer roach to hash and it's 4 000 plus year history uh but uh other than that he says that this bill is going to restrict the thc levels of medical marijuana products to 10 percent for whole flour and 60 for other products while limiting patients to 1500 milligrams of thc every 35 days based on no freaking science whatsoever you know this dumb ass he doesn't even know why they have to doctor shop because most doctors are not putting out cannabis prescriptions because they put their their license at risk like this is another ridiculous argument about why we should save the children we can save ourselves from ourselves this is ridiculous again like you said hash right and then roach goes on to conflate these are apples oranges and this isn't even apples oranges this is more like apples staplers comparisons well you're not even close you know he's like roach says i mean we're talking about 10 million milligrams over a 70-day period that's 740 now 780 bottles of 24-count aspirin all right first off no second uh you have now said you're gonna have a 24-count bottle of aspirin who buys the bottle of aspirin with 24 aspirins in it what are you doing going out for a weekend you know it's worse aspirin and then so the only reason he said the 24 was so that he could multiply that number and say 780. and so this is which what i how i would look at him if i saw him i would be like you should know better you should no worse medical advice though i mean aspirin will [ __ ] kill you if you take a lot like i have yet i'm trying really hard on cannabis aspirin may cause some stomach bleeding but like it's the tylenol that can actually kill you and so tylenol can cause the liver failure okay at least he didn't give us that because like he could have said that's 780 bottles of 24 count tylenol maybe he didn't get permission from the tylenol people to use that uh [ __ ] but yeah whatever because you know this this this ban on on medical cannabis having 10 or more thc that's going to save the children right there because the children are only buying medical cannabis that's a good one too oh my god but no that's like they aren't can you regular can you tell the drug dealers that they're not allowed to grow more than 10 thc because that's how the bill should be written uh i mean the so the bill was passed through its first committee with a party-line vote but at least two republicans expressed serious concerns with the thc cap saying it sounded too close to lawmakers playing doctor thank god at least somebody spoke some reasonableness is that lawmakers playing doctor when it comes to a woman's body we want lawmakers playing doctor when it comes to our body and what we put into it what is a drug how i can have a drug all those types of things but i'm wondering if it's the sun that does this to these people because you know california is starting to turn into florida because uh feinstein says should marijuana legalization limit thc probably not but it's happening supposedly senator dianne feinstein yeah and senator john corn of texas who jointly chaired the senate caucus on international narcotics control released a report in which they proposed various regulations of legal cannabis protect public health and safety oh i'm glad there's a federal police power now it seems like but among the call for a national institute of health remember that one institute that like says cannabis is heroin that one to intensify its research on short and long-term impacts associated with high potency cannabis and make a recommendation jointly with the food and drug administration as to whether states should cap the potency of products that may be sold again 15 legal federal patients at one time but their stock was capped at 3.5 percent it's just that it still ignores the fact that hash has existed for thousands of years and keefe has existed for thousands of years i put some uh some keef on my my pipe earlier when it was 420 somewhere and um i'm fine again like you can't you can't get any more concentrated than that when you're taking the trichomes not nor should you nor are you trying to like sit there and get at the ever clear like i don't want necessarily cannabis distillate because that cannabis distillates not gonna have the the entourage profile that i'm going for you know it's gonna have too much of the thc and not enough of the terpene profiles or maybe some cbd or some other lesser lesser cannabinoids in there to kind of smoothen out the experience public health and safety i mean i'm tired of being protected for myself i am tired of this [ __ ] like arbitrary public health and safety i get coronavirus that's affecting the public health you know that's stuff can go from one person to another i'm going to have to pass this this chillin to somebody else and i'm not doing that much right now because coronavirus but um where is the public health and safety risk i i can see benefits like i'm i'm getting the benefits now it's one of the nice things about living in illinois no it's the the law is the public safety and health issue right like the the law the fact that uh uh we are incarcerating kids and we are going after people that that's the public self inhibit and then access access the safe access that poor kid and then there's there's more uh data that comes out and who's the people that are getting arrested for cannabis the black and brown kids so think about them think about all the dangerous deleterious impacts that the legality of this plant is putting on them when they get caught with it especially when they're young for the rest of their lives all right and they still do it and not only they still do it they have schmucks that are running states in this country that are saying that we're going to stop it that it kills kids in in the states that have re-uh formed their prohibition their their you know legalized it you know their enforcement therefore the better every single even our nation's capital that you know the the law enforcement and the relationships are always for the better i haven't heard of any like oh now the raids have increased because more people are walking around like zombies through the city or attacking dominoes you know where's the freaking horror stories right you know it's just the horror stories are like children are getting new parks and uh school built in colorado right uh i don't have that that newspaper article on me anymore but our schools in peoria illinois got six hundred thousand dollars from the taxes nice sweet you know we didn't have that before that's going to help those children oh and and there's fewer people selling cannabis on the street because uh you can go buy it uh now which is nice this is like capping the vitamins on tomatoes you know what i mean it's like you can only have so much health right yes think about that like if they said like oh my gosh you have too much uh tea no not thc you have too much vitamin c in this orange send it back pack this orange based on its vitamin c level you're too healthy we can't have that and you know and here's here's the other thing here right so we got florida we got california we got these jackasses in the the committee that are all talking about limiting and then we have uh virginia who's thinking hey we should probably speed this thing up you know what we should do we should actually have because this has been a very somber episode of cannabis legalization news and there's so many people hanging out so thanks so much and you know give us some thumbs ups and share this with people and be like you guys should check these people out because we're trying to legalize the plan but uh yeah some good news out of virginia governor northam considers speeding up legalization of marijuana in virginia you think it was social justice or do you think i could find a filter for slow motion though because if there ever is a a need for a slow motion filter it would be the legalization of virginia which does not go into effect until 2024. yeah lawmakers are working with governor ralph northern's office to consider speeding up the legalization of marijuana by years possibly by making possession legal as soon as july 1st instead of january 1st 2024 holy crap that's fast yeah 2024 they're going to speed it up and then it's going to be in 2021 i think they're trying to uh make the uh possession legal date as july 1st of this year so don't forget if you're in virginia don't don't be in the slow motion go call your elected officials at the state level both chambers because you're not in weirdo nebraska that only has the unicameral chamber chamber uh and tell them that they need to speed it up i mean they probably saw like washington state survived with the pandemic uh the second largest crop you know for the uh revenue uh you guys i think brought in like 10 100 million so far or some [ __ ] like there's a re almost a billion in sales but then like the taxes are different it was a combined uh cannabis sales for medical and also adult use but there was a lot they like they only anticipated their r3 program getting about 20 million dollars and it actually got like 31. and so it was over it was overestimate so like we we sold a lot but you know what and also if you think about it too i'm thinking okay there's obviously the one metric of the actual revenue that's brought in but what about like also the this is something that can never be figured out because no cop ever like clocked this in but the amount of time devoted to arresting people like for cannabis like for how much time has been saved and money and uh uh in all our legal states like how much uh focus now goes on to real crime you know this that's got to be a huge metric yeah but that's the thing like it's not a real crime it's not it's it's it's not a crime i mean that's the thing it's anything cannabis related is not a crime in my world like that's why the activism has always been easy for me like i understand i understand criminalizing it while you're you're operating a motor vehicle i understand that uh and that's a regulation so like if they want to make that a crime fine but uh if they want to make a crime for you to have a joint while you're sitting on the couch watching netflix no that's not a crime well and you know i can't wait to when we talk to tommy chong because one of my favorite uh examples of like large amounts of personal possessions is a story by him where when he had rated for his bong store uh you know the dea were going through all [ __ ] and found pounds of marijuana in his cupboard and they're like you got what why he's all i don't know you have a pound of sugar at your house what what you know what i'm saying like yeah i mean like that's how it used to be when uh when it was medical here like uh i could afford to have a lot all the time right i used to buy by the ounce and it would it was good and it was large because there was a fair market and all blah blah blah but and then that's what this this this budco stuff because they're from the old medical times and it reminds me i'm like oh man i forgot what good we was like like really good weed that was always in my possession uh i mean i i got i i'm still smoking better than what most people are on any other day because good mids out here are great but you guys have been like you have the industry and the stuff and you have enough growers and operators that you can have a wide assortment of products so that the wide assortment of people that are purchasing the products can find what's right for them which is fantastic and then of course you always should have that type of top shelf product that's out there where you can have like the trophy cuts and then the best uh you know the stuff that was you know hand trimmed taken care of completely through the supply chain uh and you have a great chain of custody on it so the products like good weed that's been cured right tastes way better like way better yeah and it hits like the lungs it just it's breathing oxygen to me you know like some plant you can tell like it wasn't purged right and then but the good one some plants you can't purge that well because like if you're trying to grow in water uh or aeroponics it's more difficult to flush your plants now if you're growing a soil based like i'm kind of biased towards soil based growing because i like weed that tastes good and so if you want to make weed that tastes good show me weed that tastes good that wasn't grown in soil yeah and i think you have a great point with the uh we have such a variety of growers and stuff that you can find that one grower with a great price point in the the quality that you like and accept you know that and that's the thing like i've always thought like with legalization just make it legal and now for the market you have to require testing right and you know we all know like pesticides are bad and also other [ __ ] like i would rather have an organic like you know bugs being used for uh insecticides and all whatnot but the thing is if you you just get it tested and put it out there people will buy shitty weed shitty whatever quality product because people smoke cigarettes good things they're gonna look at the price and look at the thc yeah for the most part end of list now like i'm not gonna do that like i'm gonna like preferably i'm not gonna see a list of its thc or or even it's terp profile and i'm gonna i like to buy like that's 31 flavors you know it'd be great if you could taste them as well not necessarily can but i like to buy like you know where you get to see it and maybe smell it and so you can see it in the jar and be like man what is that one right there and then they'll tell you and you'll be like oh i haven't heard of that genetic can i can i give that a smell holy crap what the heck is the terp profile on that and then that's how i will get stuff and i'll find out it was only like 17 thc but it was an amazing experience that was a point break strength it was a good strength purpley and well flavored well grown well cured you know it was that's that's what buying weed should be where you can have this experience of like um smelling it asking like what you're trying to go for like why why are you using this cannabis like what's your activity for this because like that's the thing you know you can have cannabis for the activity you just don't have regular wheat i mean that was like 20 years ago you just have regular wheat but now you have weed for a particular activity for a particular flavor for a particular experience no no totally i mean that's the great thing about canvas but like and also uh like you're saying how it just uh the the profiles um and you know with that meme that i shared where the winky face hemp is not marijuana right so like i don't know if you saw the the the the most recent chronic taste test i did with josh right right i smoked my first hemp uh delta eight one and i felt really light-headed and really good like a good yeah chill buy which you know you would expect from cannabis right because it's not about the tc it's about the cannabinoids and the terpenes and because right after that we smoked some flour and that was the most horrible flour i ever had which i was kind of sad about like i never met a plant that i didn't like and it tasted like smoking a seed and like how is the hemp better than the the marijuana technically but in the end they're all cannabis and and and you know it was a great experience you're gonna have some really well-grown hemp flour there's some good there's some excellent growers and there's some excellent cure in so there's some great stuff and then they're spinning this d8 from like a lot of the uh um stock what do they call that biomass that was extracted by the cb for the cbd and then the leaders of cbd aren't moving so they turn it into a delta eight they spray the the tasty flowers and so those tasty flowers that might have been moving for like four hundred dollars a pound are now moving substantially higher than that and then not only that now you have delta eight flour which means you don't have to worry about these vape cartridges bands people can have an entourage effect with it and delta eight is not delta nine and i mean it's not you try it uh and you'll see it's just a more chill uh kind of an experience and so that you're gonna be blending it with a cbd flower that's uh i should buy some delta eight flour actually actually uh some of my clients should mail me some delta flour yeah i mean you know it doesn't have the same aromas and everything as as as weed but they're cousins and they're exactly the same plant they say they're exactly the same plant it's just that they're just different types of of the same plant and so like you would have like a class one which would be a thc cultivar and then you'd have a class three which would be your cbd cultivar and then there's even class fours now and there's probably more classes depending on the other lesser cannabinoids that they find out but you know hey that's one of the cool things that we're going to see here next year the 2022 farm bill i wonder what they're going to define hemp as in the future i don't know it's exciting times man i think this whole year this whole administration's going to be exciting here for everything yeah yeah and we just have to keep up the fight to uh educate the people that are running uh the the states where it's i mean it just sounds like it really disconnected i mean it sounds just completely cut off from reality when i hear these types of things coming out of nebraska or tennessee or florida like they don't even know what they're talking about disconnected yeah well it's the same people yelling about regular election so so they don't know what we're talking about hey uh if you guys want to give us some viewer mail that would be awesome and at the end of the show we like to go over some viewer mail questions so drop us a comment not necessarily in the live comments because there's like four million of those but then if you drop us a regular comment on a question or you can go to our uh community page and drop us a question there i might actually be able to oh there it is you can go to cannabis industry lawyer on instagram and drop us a question there or follow mickey on facebook actually facebook.com backslash freethc for all of miggy's uh memes the the dank cannabis memes it's it's two forms of dank memes it's dank dank memes on facebook that's sticky icky that's sticky me yeah yeah so male 1 free the plant said what strains are on your mount rushmore of wheat mine are blue dream grape vape green crap basically anything high in piney thank you for the show that one's top like you know that one is tough because uh there's florida purple sometimes branded as miami punch by revolution genetics uh that one is one of my favs um and then i i do really like revolution's geneticist i like point break as well uh and then i'm a sucker for a good og kush love those ones then um that's really it i mean that's those are the things that i really gravitate toward and then whatever else i might be growing you know yeah i hope to get some growth going on i need some seeds anybody um but yeah i like the uh i got familiar with blue dream during the medical times out here in washington like that was the one plant i could smoke and be like all right this blue dream because you know a lot of people have that that bud but i don't trust flavors and whatnot but that's the one that too hit me home as well as a dutch treat i really enjoy a good touch treat yeah i think i've had a dutch treat i mean i haven't had a blue dream in a while like i i just there was so much of it going around like 10 years ago and it's yeah don't get me wrong and i like blueberry i like blueberry muffins i like purple weed uh but that berry taste uh of the blue variety is just so like old school that now they have all these new flavors and i'm not talking like cereal milk or like you know peanut butter or anything like that with the chocolates not but uh the fruitiness of the flavors and and the the flavor effects that they have on it and like the colors and all these other things but man i just got like some really cool ak-47 that was like crossed up with something and that stuff just is is like a blast from the past like a really refreshing one like a fairly skunky um loud kind of old-school varietal yeah well and then this skymaster i'm smoking right now is pretty [ __ ] awesome yup what's oh i don't know uh maybe do some homework on that one um yeah they're gonna go on the back of the thing now that's the thing like there's so many hybrids and crosses that are out there it's kind of nice to know like where they came from but then you just go to the philos galaxy and spend like an hour there well again i'm just more about the farms and the growers like when i reached out to uh washington buck i reached out to three of my favorite growers uh washington but code trailblazing and uh mad mark and uh because i'm trying to put us me in a position where you know when you do a review you don't want to be obligated to anything cannabis related right so i'm trying to just promote the good we the good stuff you know without like making

from the american heart association they find that marijuana is linked to an increased risk of heart trouble including heart attacks and heart failure janae norman has the details good morning janae hey george good morning yeah would you believe that during the pandemic the marijuana business is booming already on track to outpace all of last year as the aha took a look at how both recreational and medicinal use impact cardiovascular health this morning as sales of marijuana soared during the pandemic a new warning from the american heart association that the marijuana millions use may actually be hurting their hearts in a new review of studies the organization finding cannabis use may be linked to an increased risk of heart attacks and heart failure there have certainly been reports of people with heart rhythm abnormalities hospitalized patients who have more complications of their heart attack for example when they're hospitalized with a heart attack or heart failure dr rosemarie robertson the deputy chief science and medical officer of the aha cautioning more research needs to be done after multiple studies found smoking the the in cannabis could shrink blood vessels that feed the heart and lungs i think it's clear to us that using marijuana thinking that it might help your heart or be good for the cardiovascular system there is no evidence for that the evidence that it can harm you is also anecdotal but there is some researchers also finding that edible marijuana appears to be associated with even more harmful heart and psychiatric complications because of the amount of thc absorbed into the body system but cbd is different studies finding that the portion of the marijuana plant that doesn't produce a high has actually been associated with a reduced heart rate and lower blood pressure this as purchases of marijuana spike when the country went on lockdown in march more than a dozen states deemed cannabis stores and medical marijuana dispensaries essential businesses in colorado retail marijuana sales in may were 35 million dollars higher than in 2019. and both oregon and washington state seeing their cannabis sales spike through the late spring and early summer as consumers spend more time at home and so more research is needed and the aha suggests that the dea remove cannabis as a schedule one controlled substance so that it can be widely studied because as it stands now as a schedule one drug cannabis is defined as having no medical use and a high potential for abuse guys thanks very much well hey there gma fans robin

long time but as i'm going around and i'm asking questions of people it seems like at least the really widespread growing of cannabis the widespread making of hash dates from a little bit after the end of world war ii this is where most of the stories that i'm hearing are putting it and for most of that time the cannabis that was grown here was land race streams cannabis that evolved in this area and uh we'll see some of it a little bit later on and it's very different from the cannabis that you're seeing here at this farm so what's happened in morocco as has happened in the world of cannabis all around the globe is that new hybrid seeds have been imported from places like spain places like the netherlands and when growers work with these hybrid seeds they see a really much larger yield two three four acts yield the hash when hash is made from these plants here uh the yield is three four acts of what it would be from the land race plants but you can also see that these plants are struggling with the environment they're not fully adapted to it and what's happening now is sort of the next evolution in this there's another strain it's called hardara which is a combination of the land races and some of the hybrids that have been brought in so we're going to take a look at all of these different six types of cannabis that are grown here on this farm and take a look at how the revolution that's happening in the world of cannabis is beginning to affect traditional cannabis cultivating communities", "XRm0e2OgEXg": "welcome to thoughts with tea my name is tree recently the

really couldn't party because I realized that most of what I knew about cannabis was here see nothing so and I have been exposed to eat for at least five years now so I decided to research on it today we'll be talking about cannabis how I got exposed to it the effects of cannabis and my present relationship with cannabis medical uses countries where cannabis is legal in what form it says Lego and let us get the facts out of the way first cannabis is a psychoactive drug it has two major components that are responsible for most of its effects first THC which is tetra hydro cannot be no burning let's just call it THC I'm the second component that's interesting for it is cannabidiol let us call it CBD so CHC is the psychoactive component and CBD is the non psychoactive component they both have several medical uses and CBD that's cannabidiol has been approved by the FDA in some states of the United or some states in the United States and yeah it's approved in Canada also in some sort of drug form it's actually approved for use for medical uses of countries CHC on the other hand is the psychotic component and yeah it's not having a lot of approval in a lot of places and there's lots of lots of risk in using it so yeah it's not really get enough approval however there is a drug called Sativex there has a combination of THC and CBD and it's a fruit to use in some countries like politicians activists legislators that are pushing that cannabis should be maybe we go it makes cannabis of like national interest you find that lot of importance people are trying to make it legal makes you think why are they trying to make it legal if it's not medically approved why are they trying to make it legal even for recreational use like for people to just visit and just you know have fun from first let's get to the misconceptions that are associated with use of cannabis or if you know it's more a speech the misconceptions that are associated with the use of lead post misconception is that it is non addictive it is addictive and it is addictive with withdrawal symptoms when persons try to stop using them second misconception is that it improves long activity no it doesn't improve productivity so I think this misconception arises from the biological facts that the use of cannabis it causes widening of before house because of this made people think improves the activity of the lung it improves the functioning of the longbow actually in the long run what actually happens is that it has been reported to be involved with chronic bronchitis misconception number next it is possible to smoke only can be so well there are extreme circumstances where pastors with very high discipline use only comedies but the truth of the matter is that many persons that use cannabis actually started from using to be cold like started from smoking regular cigarettes or started from using other illicit drugs and then graduated into using cannabis and in some of the cases versus I started using cannabis went ahead to start using secret because a lot of people mix cigarettes and cannabis together so people who ever had to use even order more damaging illicit drugs so yeah it easy gets withdrawn previously tobacco used to be like it gets rid of cannabis but now it's like reverse kids because cannabis is a gateway drug to tobacco so that misconception is possible to use only cannabis in a strip situations maybe yeah but most likely it would lead to use of other drugs or it stems from using or that drove the last misconception is that it's of natural origin so that makes it same who are we playing with there are so many things of natural origin that are not safe ever heard of poisonous mushrooms like there are some are you just sticky buns you did I think there are some shellfish is that poison is like all game and et tu parallel the old natural or Auggie the unnatural like their natural lands so to speak is the poison it exists from all gay is even like a very large arranger at the origin okay so let's I'm talking about plants several plants actually poisonous cocaine is of natural origin it's from a leaf as actually cocaine is actually from appliances from your nephews so because something is a measure doesn't necessarily make it safe moving on why do people seek out to use be still I did my own miniature research yes I use this WH o report I will have this w what's below i would put the link below in case you exceed it's not a long actually it's long I'm playing with you if you like 72 pages long oh yeah it's contains really good information you should check it out using this so yeah why do we desire to just kind of this the first effects would be for the euphoric effects it gives I would just say that I have alternatives for you you're looking to get like easy happiness what a comedic movie secondly I looking deserves use cannabis because of its relaxing effect the accessibility community of cannabis gears relaxing effect really nothing there are alternative yeah some people deserve to use cannabis because it gives an energy boost it'll shake drink water this does give good energy I mean mostly people desire to use cannabis because they think he would meet them or create see if they take you this time they think you would motivates them I don't know like if you need motivation find what you know maybe you don't know what you're doing in nope that's where you need kind of this motivates you I'm just play with you looking on legalization of cannabis the more areas this kind of is legal was the strength of the legacies of cannabis I'm going green to trade only because in most countries in Europe cannabis is legalized in one way or another for medical use in France we provide form of CBT I think is legalized for use in Greece medical it's legalized in we all know that um in Germany it is like allies for medical use in the UK I think it's also made it's also like allies for medical years in Croatia in Croatia in Switzerland medical use in most countries in Africa no it is not legalized for any kind of use however Ghana is an exception in Ghana it is legalized in some form for medical use in Nigeria of course it is not legalized I mean if she I mean in China it is not like a life in Thailand it's like a nice thing when we are not in Australia I think it's little iced also for medical it's not for recreational use like just to have fun it's largely not legalized and their countries the Hobby legalized yeah like South Africa it's legalized for puts nutritional medical use yeah in a few countries in Canada also if legalized from it for recreational use a few countries is legalized for porn but mostly its defects of cannabis shutting effects immediately after smoking there's like intoxication its effects behavior who might see things differently they might lose consciousness might behave different some people might just be really excited so big might think be friendly they might see small things I'll speak it just basically influences the mind immediate it comes okay some persons might have panic attacks mostly this is for first-time users the business might also hallucinates from first-time usage but also not just from first-time usage some persons also have you seen AIDS even after using it even after being like a regular used up maybe where the concentration CHC spider then they hallucinate or maybe they take a higher dose of cannabis and finally that they could hallucinates the long run some persons get addicted they depend on encompasses unfortunately develop a stroke from AIDS what about acute bronchitis before its influence this the brain development changes the brain structure with time after long-term usage of cannabis it changes the brain structure it reduces the density of neural fibers in some parts of the brain lowers the IQ it's associated with lower education a hot comb who achieve less educationally the wildlife satisfaction and it increases the risk of using other illicit drugs impair the memory isn't as cognition like it influences people's ability to learn so know that we have the facts out of the way let me tell you the story I said I was going to tell you I saw this year was the first time I got exposed to cannabis there were persons that's way using cannabis and initially I didn't know that way cannabis uses I mean we're like new users and anyways I didn't show on the face I mean several cannabis users that I have met it doesn't show in their appearance the effect of cannabis starts to show in the long term it were just regular cup members just like myself and do sometimes when we were together doing things they would use cannabis I'm hunting around conversing with them not learn it's more about it's when someone wants to smoke I excused myself or have them excuse me because now I am in secondary smoker let's move on I think on cannabis is this there's a nine percent chance that you will get addicted you use cannabis you would say that chances do you realize that it chance Ryan from Cornell viruses like them maybe below 1% so about five deesigns like it's really new what do you realize how many people died do you realize how much of a global pandemic this is because the chances are low doesn't mean it doesn't happen you may not become addicted but why would you want to risk finding out why would you want to risk disrupts in your life if you do have an addiction later on personally I generally don't like the idea of depending on something to do basically so if you have a medical condition and it's a drawer describe drug okay that makes sense and usually some people say oh you can use it to treat depression so if it's no Kuni depression even like maybe my old depression i feel like there's a whole reason why you're depressed and notice we only relieved your depression shortly in the long run you're still going to be depressed and you can't afford to continue using cannabis because then you might develop an addiction so it might be helpful to visit a therapist I would actually help you get to the root of your depression then you get out of it instead of now 23 substance that may not actually solve your problem but would just give you risks in the whole process and you might so people might argue alcohol and tobacco are even more harmful than cannabis but still they're legal think about it drunk driving is the second factor in the whole world that's responsible tobacco is ranked by WH o as the one cause of deaths in the whole world that could be prevented I think if tobacco wasn't legal would it still have these details I think the problem with alcohol and tobacco having this much damaging effect is because one they accepted true they're available greediest in a school and they are also addictive which means that there is a possibility to abuse it and even if you're not acted there's also still the possibility to abuse it because it's very accepting aging but it's accepted it's legal it's okay to do it shouldn't we just learn from this and like realize that because something is illegal or because something is not liquor doesn't necessarily mean it's safe or not and just know it's possible for say I'm Reggina okay my final take would be this if you have a medical condition and a doctor is prescribing it because actually cannabis has missing so like CBD has been seen to help epileptic patients has been sent to help with neuropathy I listen to help consultations HIV patients like really these extreme diseases extreme illnesses have been helped with CBD but there is also that high risk of having schizophrenia from using cannabis associated with skis or feeling like its associated with going crazy do you really want to risk that so my personal take is this you don't want to risk going crazy okay let's assume we don't you don't go crazy we don't want to risk having an addiction you don't want to risk reducing your IQ like I'll be able not much intelligence before then I won't reduce our IQ you don't want to risk altering your behavior based off of something you think of having fun I'll talk so I think that the risk outweigh the benefits for recreational use if it's a drug then yes it's a drug you're using it as a medically prescribed role but for fun you risked outweigh the benefits and if you want to be happy find a safe harbor to be happy if you want to be relaxed finally safe are we using motivation finally safe are we to be motivated you're not so busy drunk so I keep this thing I hope you learned something from the vlog of soothing soul I come your way again if you found this vlog helpful please subscribe to my channel and drop a like thank you", "0U_VnKq42XI": "hello everyone I'm Rick boxer I'm a urologist at UCLA and I am happy to be able to speak to you about cannabis and the urologic practice my colleague Neil Baum helped me with with this and I always give him all the credit he richly deserves and so in the this particular program we'll cover how does cannabis work the myths associated with cannabis safety of cannabis and the urologic applications the my journey to learn about cannabis started when I saw a patient a number of years ago who had been esthetic renal carcinoma he was in the intractable pain and anything that we gave to him was of no benefit and so therefore we he came to me and said I'd like to try cannabis and what do you think and quite frankly at that point I had no knowledge about it whatsoever nor did my colleagues I thought about it and and after he came back and had a very particularly terrible experience because the person who was supposed to help him could not help him and it was about seven or eight years ago in Los Angeles before that was when was only medical and so I decided I was going to learn more about this and as I learned about it I wrote about it and have been speaking about it but more importantly I wanted to share my knowledge with my colleagues because this is a patient driven and a patient driven medication and people want to know about it and it's only the best thing for your medical care to know about it I'm in no way advocating it I'm just simply saying knowledge is important so with that I want to proceed the responsibility of a urologist I believe is to just know a little bit about or even more about the use of the cannabis now it just the tip of the iceberg is some of the conditions that may be helped and we'll talk about those conditions in a moment but there is so much to learn about cannabis and one of the problems is that because it's Schedule one that is it's not allowed really to be researched within the universities the Schedule one has prevented and has become an obstacle to knowledge which i think is wrong so all of us end up having anecdotes and stories by patients and that is not the best way of guiding our care for the patient we really need to have evidence base on medicine and that evidence-based medicine will come but first the obstacle of being on schedule one like heroin or LSD has to be overcome 95 percent of us live in a state in that has either medical or fully legal matter of marijuana and only if you live in Nebraska South Dakota or Idaho is a completely prohibited otherwise your patients have the access to medical or for that matter recreational but we're doling and we talking about access to obtaining marijuana for medical purposes interestingly enough it's been illegal for so many years and it's been it's been considered to be dangerous all the way back into the 30s and far before that but in the 30s when there was reefer madness or than the 40s movies that that portrayed it as as a terrible drug well if you go back you find out that the Declaration in penance was written on hemp paper and so people have known about this for a long time the consumption of cannabis is based on speed rate of metabolism and choice there are various methods by which you can you can consume you can smoke or you can vape you can hear this person is using a bong which is water pipe you can consume in in candy or foods of some sort and what happens is that if the person takes cannabis by smoking or vaping you they get a much rep more rapid concerned by the cannabis you it's eaten it's a much slower effect because it has to be metabolized well under those circumstances some people will take one or two pieces of candy or or a brownie or a piece of candy in a candy bar and say oh nothing's happening and then they'll take a second or third piece and by the time the third piece or fourth piece is ever consumed the the effect will become multiplied that's why people need to be very cautious when they take medication through food which is metabolized now it's very interesting to me that the vascular system the lymphatic system and the nervous system have all been well described for hundreds of years and yet the endocannabinoid system was only discovered in 1992 and as you can see from the receptors the receptor of CB 1 which is THC which is more the the portion that people think about when they think about affect psychologically or neurologically or cv2 which is also known as CBD and people think well how can possibly have a medication or a drug that affects all parts of the body I mean literally soup to nuts and we are urologist we know the difference and so we have to wonder what is it about this drug this Mitali the CBD or TC that really affects everything well the fact is that there are different receptors for CB 1 against CB 2 and CB 2 are principally the ones that that will affect things that your urologist want to take care of particularly in reducing inflammation or reducing pain and so when you understand that the receptors throughout the body are different then you understand why CBD and THC and generally marijuana will affect different people in different ways the facts of about cannabis are that it's been used for thousands of years and it's but I showed you the number of states 33 states and history Columbia where it's medicinal should be um this Columbia is also recreational um it's off-limits for scientific investigation it's classified as Schedule one as I mentioned be same as heroin and LSD and in fact there's more research been done on heroin and LSD than on marijuana because of all the laws and truly became a and has become a political plant and there's limited evidence for abuse yes it can be abused but there is limited evidence and that's once again because the research does not allow people to really find out what is in that plant the plant has a hundred and forty-four chemicals within it and we only know of a few so cannabis and evidence-based medicine is critical in my mind because that's what we've been working on as to clinicians all of our professional lives patient values and preferences and best evidence and clinical expertise all Center in evidence-based medicine and since it is truly a patient driven medication people don't will not go to a doctor generally speaking a urologist and say what do you think I should take and the urologist starts off by saying take cannabis that's not going to happen what happens is the patient comes in and says I want to take cannabis how will that affect me because it's um it's been controversial and and promoted by lots of different organizations and groups and of people finally the National Academy of Sciences the medicine looked at it and put out in nineteen ninety nine twenty one years ago of a book that showed that the it is effective conclusively effective for chronic pain nausea and vomiting with chemotherapy that is chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting as well as muscle spasm and MS now those are the three things that that the National Academy is founded it is conclusively helpful for but there are complications and that's why the complications and pediatrics and pregnancy is that you the grade there is greater number of NICU NICU admissions in women who smoke marijuana or consume marijuana while pregnant there's also premature births and underweight well you think about it if those women were to take any other drug even alcohol for example or or other drugs such as cocaine which are much much more addictive of course they too would get greater number of ICU admissions and premature deaths that doesn't excuse it but it just shows you that that drugs are bad for pregnant women there's no conclusive evidence that it causes heart attacks strokes and diabetes it doesn't cause respiratory diseases such as chronic like chronics cigarette smoking there is some thought that if you smoke every day multiple marijuana cigarettes it would have some lung disease or issues but knowing very very very few people do that and actually including in California for decades people were smoking considerable amounts of marijuana and and studies show that they really were not affected like they would be had they been smoking cigarettes it does not improve immune competence and some people have even thought it would be good for treatment of testicular cancer there's no evidence of that whatsoever but for cardiovascular effects it does elevate systolic and diastolic soon aunt after consuming marijuana causes tachycardia increases sympathetic stimulation decreases a time to angina and there is a slight increase in Aminah and MI for one hour post marijuana use so now just like everything else in life you gotta take consideration any comorbidities and so therefore if someone were to have significant cardiovascular disease you would say that it's a bad idea to smoke marijuana for any purpose now another myth is that it's a gateway drug that has been disproven repeatedly and yet it is repeatedly spoken about and so it's all you can do is try and try again the National Academy of Medicine in the Institute of Medicine in 1999 the same book that I reference before has indicated that it is not a gateway drug but what we really need is research not anecdotes so that people will be able to know what - if it indeed is helpful another myth is that it causes cancer does not and when a person comes in to be seen and they ask about cannabis in the medical in a minute and see that only has medical marijuana and frankly just the knowledge of knowing what in a state that has recreational as well or adult use as well the you just have to say let us look at what is eat what is allowed in each state and that is for the medical purposes but and also it's good reference for you to be able to determine whether or not there's medical marijuana that would be helpful in any particular state and you can say well I guess that's at least anecdotally if not evidence-based that it might be helpful so for example in Illinois interstitial cystitis is a qualifying condition for the use of cannabis and so if a person were in California and they said well I've got painful spasms because of interstitial cystitis you could say to yourself well it is allowed in Illinois there may be proof that it is helpful and I I can't god I cannot prescribe it but I certainly can say that it is recommended or at least possibly used in Illinois cachexia due to cancer is another common condition that is that people use cannabis for to stimulate their appetite terminal illness hospice care chemotherapy induced nausea muscle spasms that's why I put in interstitial cystitis here because if it helps them MS muscle spasms maybe an interstitial cystitis as well or for that matter other muscle spasms it's it's been stating to me how well in Parkinson's spinal stenosis spinal cord disorders and we course see patients that have and have those conditions which resulting geologic illness PTSD rheumatoid arthritis sickle cell anemia at least the pain associated with it intractable pain and every state has the the ability or I should say has stated that if doctors find a condition that is diagnosed as debilitating then marijuana in a medical state can be recommended pain is the most common reason for for using the medical marijuana 100 million Americans have chronic pain and so this is the reason why chronic pain is the most common by far and away the most common reason why people use medical marijuana others is multiple sclerosis chemotherapy induced vomiting nausea and cancer as I listed before so you can see that over 50% of the people will want to use medical marijuana for chronic pain why again why 50% greater 50% use marijuana for pain well in 2016 214 million prescriptions of opioids were used more than 60 million Americans consumed acetaminophen on a weekly basis over 30 billion doses of NSAIDs were were given and 80 million aspirins are consumed a day not all of course are for pain but that's 117 aspirin tablets for every man woman and child in the United States the opioid crisis in the United States is is absolutely an epidemic and unfortunately know about epidemics now but is that an epidemic rate as many as one in five whose are opioid addicted received opioids as prescription for non-cancer pain 11 million abusing opioids and a million thousand people are go to the ER every day for opioid misuse the the most chilling thing is 72 thousand people who die every year and that is more deaths there are more deaths since a year 2004 opioid than all the deaths that occurred on the battlefields in every war since 1775 it is a spectacular amount of people who have have died and as it turns out marijuana is a could be a substitute II and some individuals and does not kill and this is the reason why it doesn't kill I think that this is the most important slide there is why do opioids kill and T C does not and the reason is the receptors the the cannabis receptors are in the in this portion of the brain and in the cerebellum the opioids are in the this portion but most importantly they are in the brain stem for breathing and so this is the reason why opioids kill and cannabis does not there has never been a death due to overdose of cannabis but seventy-two thousand people a year die of cannabis overdose in the United States as time has gone on it's become more and more legal in various states but more importantly and in this particular sideshows it that Americans believe it should that medical marijuana for sure should be legalized sixty-two percent versus thirty four percent and just in 1969 when when I went I was when I was in college in medical school 84 percent thought of what should be illegal and only twelve percent legal so attitudes have change and that's why your patients are coming in to talk to you about it so the summary is cannabis is safe it is not a gateway drug and it has several urological applications you can see that annual desk 435,000 from tobacco seventy five thousand from opioids none none from marijuana a hundred from peanuts so you can see that even even peanuts are more dangerous than marijuana the finally one joke by Bill Murray I find it quite ironic that most dangerous the most dangerous thing about about weed is getting caught with it so the dangers are few the the potential benefit is great and in it in this particular talk I hope I was not trying to convince you to use it but I'm trying to come to you about and educate you about why some people do so thank you very much if you wish to contact me there is my email address I wish you a great day thank you", "9zaBvLXZPCc": "[Music] look at what i've got here but today's another one of those days i'm not going to tell you what it is till the end of the video today we're going to talk about la's best active daytime strains now i definitely know something about this but i'm more of a heavyweight and this list was particularly concentrating on lighter weight strains that are good for daytime and are active and i think there's a market for that someone asked for that video i said huh maybe i can look back and figure this out so i did so today i'm gonna do a top 10 of the best active daytime strains but we have one runner-up i came up with 11 so there's going to be 11. so we're going to start with that and coming in at number 11 for my favorite best active active daytime strains is xj13 by thc design this flower has 24 thc excuse me 23 thc and this is a jack hybrid and it's real good i would say that all these flowers are heavy enough so if you do too much maybe it's not daytime for you so i would moderate use if you have vapor cup i would just do one straw don't do more otherwise it'll just knock you out but this is a good active daytime flower coming in number 11 xj13 by thc design and this flower is a sativa hybrid but we're moving on up to even better flower and coming in at number 10 we have something by connected cannabis called gelanade and gelenade has 22 thc it's a sativa and this was a good daytime flower i got this flower of buds and roses and it's funny as you try lots of different flowers this was a good one so if you're looking for these type of flowers you can't find these all the time so you got to look at the list and grab the one you can get coming in number 10 from connected cannabis gel and aid but we're moving on up coming in at number nine we have something called biscotti by team elite genetics and i got this at dr green thumbs this flower has 22 percent thc it's a jackish jack herrera type flower but this flower has focus and euphoria and it was really good so if you see biscotti by team elite genetics just a try this is a good active daytime flower and it comes in at number nine but we're moving on up and coming in at number eight and this flower made the best list too i really like this flower something called face on fire by by lava cake and fire society fire society and this flower was really good i really like this flower this is one of the high thc flowers on the list this flower has 28 thc and it's a hybrid like i said excuse me it's from fire society and nero and oh maybe just fire society if i'm wrong so grown by fire society and this flower was really good i am telling you this one stoned me had focus i was euphoric i liked it but like i said with these strains if you go too deep you're going to be stoned to the bone just go a little bit less but i think this flower with not a lot of use would be a good daytime flower but we're moving up again coming in at number seven we have something called colombian cookies by humboldt county indoor and this flower is a sativa it's got 20 thc i got it at buds and roses and this flower was really good i was just so so surprised it's also jackish and i think a lot of these are jack derivatives or some kind of jack but this was a really good flower for daytime use it got on the best sativas list it is really good coming in at number seven colombian cookies by humboldt county indoor but we're moving on up to number six and at number six we have something by the backpack boys called california guarana and this was one of those flowers i reviewed that i said if it was stronger it would have got a higher mark but for in best active daytime strange list maybe this is a really good one so i like california guarana and i would say this was a not as heavy as some of the other uh backpack boys strains but it's enjoyable and good so if you're looking for something for a daytime flower and you see guarana california it's a good one coming in at number six california guarana by backpack boys but we're moving up again and coming in at number five we have something from big owls and gas house called northern brights and this is a super euphoric flower i like this flower very good and this happens to be the only indica on the whole list everything else is sativa hybrid or sativa hybrid but this was the one indica that sneaked in there this is a bright euphoric flower with focus 24 thc i recommend this flower i bought it actually i would say probably two years ago so it's been a while i haven't seen it since but if you see northern brights by big owls and gas houses definitely worth the try and it comes in at number five for good active daytime strains but we're moving on up and coming in at number four one of my favorite strains if you're following the threads below the videos i recommend the strain all the time king's garden jack herrer only 20 thc and this flower comes in number four uh it's a sativa and one thing i would say about this flower that changes it from other flowers this flower i'm a heavyweight so i'm going to give you some advice forever if you're not heavily don't follow this advice this flower gets better you just keep going and going and going and before you know it at the end of the night you are stoned to the bone i don't even say you have focused you're just stoned and happy right but for someone who's looking for focus that has a vapor cup that just does one straw this or even a half a straw because you're going to get 12 draws so you do eight draws right this thing might give you good focus run you around all day enjoy your day that's why i like jack herrer because it's a really active creative strain for me i think one of the most so i highly recommend this flower this flower is the best sativa on the list and on the best active daytime lists it's number four and it's that way because this flower is not a lightweight this flower if you go in deep it will stone you to the bone coming in at number four jack herrera by king's garden and by the way right i'm getting a lot of questions there's a jack out there too from king's garden and something called jack is not jack rare and i have not tried that strain the one that's the one that's really good is jack herrera but we're moving on up so let me put this uh straw in oh let me load a little bit so there's two scoops in there already all these straws are handmade and i'm going to add one more scoop in there and just three scoops is like a bong in a mountain you can see it and then we're going to tamper but just holds it in so it doesn't fall out and we're going to stick this into vapor cup and in about a minute and a half to two minutes you're going to see the water vapor it's going to gather right here and this cup i am telling you for people who have got it and there's some heavy weights here that have got it they just can't believe it and even i can't believe it that's why i keep talking about it i wish i never smoked if you want to try something that's the best and i'm not pushing it down your throat i you know these comments sometimes they upset me a little bit because i'm telling you the information you get here you couldn't find it anywhere else there's a lot of effort that goes into this and i'm telling you this cup even for a heavy hitter to make someone that's doing dabs stop doing that because you're dysfunctional right love is life is about enjoyment and function and we have to be functional so we can get take care of business and so anyway uh coming in at number three we have korva mac one and this flower was so good it got underplayed because there was something called iog mach 1 that's number one on my best flowers list but it's super strong it's so strong it could comatose somebody so this list is about active daytime strains and one thing about core of a mac one this flower's got 21 percent uh thc and it's sativa and this was a bright strong euphoric flower i liked it if anyone gets a chance to see uh or buy excuse me core of a mac one this flower is a winner and i rated it the best on the whole core of a lineup and i think probably i have i don't know 10 strains of corva and this one was the winner and then i got a comment under one of the posts that said well i could have figured that out and i i laughed at it because not unless you tried them all i tried ten and i picked core of a mac one and the person came back and said why you know i picked that too and we agree that's how we know it is the best one we all hope we all always agree core of a mac one is a winner if you see this one you gotta grab it coming in at number two is a flower by the fire society called smarties and this flower is very very good this flower had ultimate focus i would say that this flower was strong with focus so i would be careful with this flower 29 thc making it the high flower on the list but i thought this flower was really good i mean i really enjoyed it i thought it was just awesome this flower had a lot of focus and it was strong so i wouldn't do too much of this but if you're looking for focus now we're really into the flowers that really have focus which is number one and number two i truly believe if you're looking for a focus flower that if you don't use too much then you can have good focus and go through your day smarties at number two with 29 it's a hybrid is a winner but we're moving up to number one and the winner of the best flower with the best focus that you could run around and i i use this flower and i said you i think you could be on the debate team with it is grandi flora supercharger this flower is a hybrid with 24 percent thc makes time go by fast has extreme focus but one thing you gotta notice about all these strains and especially about cookies affiliated strains they have indoor and outdoor versions and you can't compare the two so if you're looking for supercharger and you see it in this bottle right here maybe this is the indoor version because someone got back to me and they showed me supercharger in a bag and i'm like huh and because i've never seen actually any grandiflora in bags but people are trying to now give their babies to farms they grow them outside they get some extra money right but they don't realize that then someone goes back online and reviews the same flowers and outdoor and it's not the same because the flowers that are the best to me or the flowers that are best out of vapor cup are things that are indoor hydroponic grown with love small batch the grower who they call caveman a lot of you people don't probably know that but they call the grower a caveman and i'm telling you the caveman has to love those flowers like they're they're your children it's incredible and if you see supercharger in the bottle just like this you can see what it looks like it is an incredible focus flower incredible i gave this to a lot of friends to try even one of the managers of one of the friendly dispensaries i do business and they came back and they have a cup too so they use the cup and supercharger like oh my god i love going to the gym on this you're looking for a gym flower granny flora supercharger is the winner so i'm going to take you out with a quick vapor cup hit of granny floor supercharger and you can see i've got it set to 330 right i'm going to put it back on it goes off every 18 minutes but you could see all the vapor in the straw so i'm going to take this either so it's easy so it doesn't choke me up so here we go supercharger by currenty floor and a vapor cup at 330 degrees i love this flower you can see how much vape it makes it's smooth it's enjoyable and i'm telling you if people want to argue with me tonight i'm on the debate team this flower's got focus if you want to see vapor cup this item go to vaporcup.com i'm telling you this can take even someone who doesn't believe in flower they've already moved up to stronger things back down you will love this item you don't have to up tolerance i'm telling you there's no amount of good it is awesome and you can see it on vaporcup.com if you're looking for strains go to weeda entertainment.com if you like the videos you want to party with the doctor join in uh thank you very much party all my friends [Music] you", "R9z06iHSmmw": "[Music] what's up it is 2 p.m on a wednesday afternoon thanks for tuning in at cannabis legalization news where we explain marijuana laws so you can change them today we're going to be talking about whether or not legal thc vapes are still allowing toxins in your lungs humboldt county's hip band and how you can help south dakota uh with their wild issues so let's just get right into it hey mickey and tom happy wednesday happy wednesday happy wednesday at 2 p.m but south dakota's got issues if you think so smash them thumbs ups because they this is exactly what happened to arizona in 1996. so like the people go we want it and then the people in charge go [ __ ] you that's that's what happens in america though man just it's the most american [ __ ] up thing right like like like the people will try to do something and apparently if you imagine like a congress all right so the people like put on a ballot initiative hey no slavery uh and so they try to avoid the civil war uh and then and then congress is like nah nah bro we're just going to keep this dude and it's it's not for any good reasons and and to top it off right so like what's going on about hb 1100 that's what it is right that's right is that it's trying to uh repeal is that what it's trying to do hb 12 1100 is where is that does she have the you know maybe next time you need to work on your transitions man don't don't just start wandering off and nowhere i thought she had it there already so it's all good uh but i mean we're just here right uh but governor and her allies are proposing legislation that would cause severe delays to the medical marijuana established by measure 26. so i mean obviously it's just [ __ ] overall right like this is not even uh based in any factual reason or or intellectual you know there's no like greater good for it why why are we doing delayed medical you know there it is but that's it the truth about hp 1100 and then i'm not sure if that actually was starting off our show yeah maybe it was so yeah allies are proposing a legislation hb 1100 that would cause severe delays to the medical marijuana established by measure 26 and the legislatures are making claims that the voters didn't know what they were voting for i'm sorry i thought i was voting for for shasta i i thought we were voting on drinks not not weed what's funny is this is pre-marijuana vote so they can't even be like yo the voters were high when they voted for the [ __ ] they were confused the voters were confused i like that oh oh come on we can't have the voters be voting they didn't know what they were voting for everybody everybody let's throw out all those georgia votes the voters didn't know that they weren't voting for trump just throwing out these wild words you know can't invest in marijuana people don't know what they're talking about because you know along that same lines is you know the governor is the one who's creating this bill the lawsuit and everything but the ag abandoned an effort to defend the adult use initiative as well so there's a lot of banned in an effort to defend the law but that's that's just all the problem like what happens when um the administration is not on board with what the people want and the people want weed and so this is what will happen and as one state goes to another and then like what happens when indiana legalizes if they could even legalize would they immediately just be like no they didn't know what they were voting for they thought they were voting for pepsi or coke they did not know they're voting for weed right what i love about this whole situation there is like this this [ __ ] governor who who uses the citizens money to create this initiative is also being accused right now of using the state airplane to travel for right-wing political events like aren't you the the the the what do you call it a party of like uh rights and uh civilness and uh uh you know we should be doing the right thing [ __ ] freedom and small government unless you want to put cannabis in your body yeah i mean this is this is the [ __ ] where it makes you a little vein pop and you're just like all right this is this this makes perfect sense measure 26 was approved by over 70 percent of south dakota voters on election day when they didn't know what they were voting for evidently and yet house bill 1100 delays every single component of measure 26 if passed medical marijuana patients would be criminalized for another 17 months so it's really not about the patients in south dakota and it's not about what 70 percent so if you are in south dakota and you're in that 70 i want you to call your legislators and be a complete karen on the phone seriously yeah i mean like seriously get in like coronavirus is starting to abate and south dakota is a fairly republican state they probably didn't even put on masks go show up at where they're going to do their business and say excuse me um i'm one of the 70 of people that would like to access my medical cannabis and why are you sandbagging me what's going on you know and that's how you get [ __ ] done you don't you don't storm the capital with a gun you call your representative and then you hold a pen next to a check and you go you want me to sign it or you know uh each day like here in seattle we have funny money that's uh uh we get little vouchers so we can like this is a represents us and donates to whoever we want like every parse state has its own process learn your state's process and just get involved you know right right every state is prime then it's like let's do this over there i'm like whoa boy talk about a patchwork quilt of laws uh it's it's 50 it's it's dual sovereignty is kind of a [ __ ] because then some way that they do it in indiana is a different way that they do it in illinois and then people are asking about cannabis licenses and i'm like wait what state are you in uh you know weed helps besides like all the other medicinal stuff that's being listed in their thing it also helps dealing with this [ __ ] like it helps like like you're like all right yeah but you know what else it helps with uh being snowbound i am uh i'm going on like day nine under the dome uh at least and so like we can't even really get outside i was stoked today that it is 19 degrees in central illinois though brother yeah i know but still um i mean you're at least we're ready for it yeah we get it like we just get it like bad [ __ ] and it's like oh man at least you couldn't even escape it in texas but then i got family in florida i'm going to the pool well i hit my brother up in el paso and he's like dude it's fine over here and i was like oh yeah i forget texas the size of a third world country so you got a little bit of everybody in there texas is huge texas it's huge hey you know where you can go you know where you can go to get more information about no on hb 1100 in south dakota go to south dakotamarijuana.org for more information lauren do we got a a screenshot of the south dakotas yeah there you go south dakotamarijuana.org get the truth about house bill 1100 and exercise your voice call your legislature in south dakota and say hey i'm one of the 70 percent of you know your bosses that told you that we would like medical cannabis for our patients get off your duff and start making with the rules already and honestly it shouldn't be this hard now since over half the population voted for it right you're like you're not like being an activist as far as like you're saying something in in a crowded room and everybody's gonna look at you no this is an issue that people agree on an issue that people have actually agreed on that is so difficult in the cannabis field hey did we also kind of rehash and uh examine the south dakota a.g abandoning the effort to defend the adult use marijuana initiative yeah we briefed over that jason ravensborg what's the name of the south dakota a.g that's the person needs to get voted up needs to get voted out all right let's go on to the next big thing and everybody this one was like our lead our thumbnail story of the day should we get a thumbnail sponsor thumbnail sponsored by collateral bass our thumbnail story of the day legendary california marijuana growing region humboldt county permanently bans hemp cultivation not a shocker man why is that a shocker to you oh no not a shocker i don't know why is that because imagine it's kind of like uh martha's vineyard right they're the martha williams of cannabis they got a reputation to uphold uh here in washington state uh the rule is five miles and what you're trying to avoid is cross pollination pollination you know what you how can you grow premium outdoor cannabis flower with all these damn hemp plants around it it's not going to happen yeah it's definitely something that they're just covering their asses and then i agree with them you know there's a little push back but again it's the appellation it's the what you know weed here i mean like what that's that's true man but like you don't want your crop to seed yeah that i mean humble's next thing is going to be like a marijuana amusement park i can't wait for humboldt county to become a marijuana amusement park we're going to need to legalize cannabis globally i think because then it can be like you know wine country nobody's really getting robbed well i'm sure people are getting robbed at napa but like when you go like to to europe to visit the vineyards you know that's that's a touristy thing you spit into a bucket you still get pretty drunk uh i could see it happening like that but you really got to get all the uh black well we shouldn't call it that though the legacy market the illicit market the market that you know does only it in cash and guns that that market kind of needs to be totally eradicated you know full legalization and we're getting there but again this is not going to happen because the process is not fast even a sleep of 10 is not going to i'm realistic for my 50th birthday i hope to be able to say oh i'm going to weed country humboldt yes i mean you still can do that but it'll be seattle well i mean that'd be great but like like you know the outdoor farms in humboldt county like where where are we going to have like the events because like could it be like going to the vineyards like it's like oh did you go to wente farms it was fine but then i really liked that one you know and so if it could be like that or like you're going from farm to farm in the humboldt county region that would be the [ __ ] man well there's the the gangi air thing is going to happen right like somebody just uh this you're just taking notes of terpenes little whiffs you know have bougie as [ __ ] maybe chewing on the leaf and then spitting it out somewhere i don't know somebody yeah it's the french guy french cannoli will be making hash oh that would be dope dude but like no it's a lot of dope people that are going to be doing the ganjia thing so uh the materials on that come out in two weeks and you know check them out and then of course hopefully in june i will be doing shows from uh the humboldt county area because we have to well i'm not sure if that's where they're gonna have it but it'll be in the central uh uh you know central part of california yeah i mean wherever your next business takes you right like speaking of your business dude what because like you're they're your cannabis lawyer but you're you're not a uh uh uh a legal or a um um sorry a uh criminal that's the word you're not a criminal lawyer right that's right so my criminal lawyer uh questions i'll go to jeff hall and so when somebody calls and they've um committed a crime i'm like oh better call hall uh let me get him on the phone and then i i give them to him and then he's like come on tom this leads in chicago i'm like all right fine i'll call stephen comey and then i'll call somebody else it depends on where the crime is yeah right but for your business side of things like right now you just got a letter that just came out right you're trying to just do some marketing sure what uh what what does your client like look like yeah that's right man everybody needs to hang out and go to because like you would have gotten the uh email uh the newsletter today the newsletter was pretty darn awesome today and so you could have had the cannabis industry lawyer newsletter in your mailbox today and it covered all a lot of the stories that we're going to be covering on today's episode on cannabis legalization news and there's a new piece of information on the massachusetts cannabis licenses so head on over to the cannabis industry lawyer and sign up for our newsletter uh to be able to stay on top of all things cannabis legalization news but yeah man we just opened an office in uh boston okay yep and it's all about your network right i mean that's essentially what i'm worrying is about it it is but then it all becomes about the licenses and so there's a lot of ip in the uh cannabis world and so like as you continue to build out in a particular state so like i have illinois the materials really really nice and then i'll have michigan's pretty pretty good and then uh massachusetts and then of course like georgia's going to have a dispensary round so i want to get there is i i tried to get into some people's in the uh the sacramento had a an application window that closed last friday a portion of it so you know it's you just help out wherever you can you know sure sure but you're dealing mostly are you dealing with uh like groups or like because i mean again it's not cheap to be oh they're always groups i mean i say like hey uh sign here here and here all right you owe me sixty thousand dollars um so right and it's groups and people putting a team together and then they go and they raise money and they put together their plans for how they're going to actually uh operate the license if they get it and then you know you apply and then sometimes you can get the license more readily and other times it's more of a lottery or a luck of the draw or you might just be in line for a year and a half yeah no i was just curious because like i mean as we progress you know uh the industry becomes more uh accepted uh you know it's like the neat thing that happened happening right now with the vaccine in california with covid right like you know first they were deemed essential workers and then it deemed the industry is essential like hey people are a majority of california citizens are getting medicine right i mean all use is recreational use in my opinion you know we you know our use is recreational use come on meggie medical use there we go might have had a little might have a little bit of medical use in that four minutes now we'll be having some medical time but uh sandro pincone the ceo of hemco co inc i'm not sure if that's really a thing hamakoko inc in san diego county which manufactures 30 million smokable hemp cigarettes a month from flower grown in california said californian is an agricultural state and why wouldn't they allow hemp to grow is ludicrous well you see that's why you can tell that that was for somebody from san diego simply because they they probably wouldn't be doing outdoor there it would it would probably be too hot maybe greenhouses and stuff but if you're doing outdoor in san diego let us know i mean it's perfect as well right it's always like 80 75 to 80. yeah well i'm from motion side i did my mom grew plants in the backyard yeah it's it's perfect weather to grow like outside year long pretty much and if you have a greenhouse it just puts you over the top yeah but still i mean like i just think it's interesting that why wouldn't you ban hemp farming if you're known for an area to make like really high quality th seaweed it's just clearly someone who doesn't know about the history right and someone who doesn't know about i mean that's what there is there's a history there's a uh and i think that's why we you know i really appreciate the people hanging with us dude like like the fact that we've been just doing like a google hangout you and i and then you know at the end of the show we have like 100 [ __ ] people still hanging i'm like really like that's because i think we should do this along that we we know things share it you know knowledge is power that's right hey how big is humboldt county what what land area are we talking about like oh it's the size of a state in new england is it yeah which one which state oh i would say maine nope it's connecticut humboldt county is the size of connecticut thousands of residents employed in the outdoor marijuana production industry i bet it does nice dude all right again i uh i've been through the area being from southern california you know it's got us you know humboldt can still evolve i don't know if you saw the uh uh there was that one documentary on i think netflix or uh amazon but it talks about the immigrants and a lot of people are being abused because when it was an outlaw unregulated market you still have a lot of opportunity to take advantage of people yeah market you're like we need to put the cost of the flower down get an automated trimmer get this person out of here that's an employee but i mean the tremor grant was a huge uh you know culture thing where some people have good experiences where they travel you know but you have a lot of young people women and boys that sometimes even they don't come back like there's other horror stories so the regulated market does make safe workplace as well safe access mm-hmm in my opinion paul pogba i think we should all smoke uh wait one more minute they do they actually do outdoor in michigan and so like the licenses are all dependent so you can get an outdoor license in michigan but you can also get a hemp growing license in michigan i mean but i understand why you would if you have a world-famous cannabis you'd probably want to ban it simply because you're you're trying to make the highest quality product you can and they could farm hemp somewhere that's not famous for its th seaweed if you're cognac you're gonna make sure no one else is using cognac right yeah it can be made in kodiak france i believe right let's do well uh yes i think something like that it's kind of like bourbon but bourbon's like a statue so like if you're going to make bourbon you have to like comply with this particular statute not messed up yay regulation yay regulation all right well you know what that means it's been 20 minutes it's regulation time somewhere get it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] marijuana workers get priority for covet 19 vaccine before teachers in california's rollout the san francisco gate is that the name of the the paper the sf gate yeah san francisco gate is reporting that cannabis workers will get priority for covet 19 vaccines but a notice from the california department of public health issued on saturday said medical marijuana workers including delivery drivers and retail employees are included in phase one a while growers producers and others involved will be included in phase one b where food and agriculture workers are currently placed alongside with teachers phase one b means they will be vaccinated as supplies allow [ __ ] yeah well i like that they are i mean the the a's the a1a makes more sense because if you're the customer focused or a customer facing one you know a lot of how many people are you going to come into contact with as your as your work and your bud tending shift you know yeah and then they deal with a lot of range of people i mean it's not just all young and old people or not all young people smoking right they definitely probably would help prevent the spread you know this is what you do you deal with the people who deal with the public a lot that's right yeah yeah and so like you know people that work at grocery stores and then teachers but i'm just glad that watching the the um the covet 19 charts the past month has just been so optimistic and inspiring and all that and then uh to to help celebrate that and to temper ourselves mother nature just decides to clobber the [ __ ] out of the whole like country it's like here comes a shitload of snow and some cold weather yeah chill stay home and smoke weed stay home smoke weed allow us to get those vaccines in arms so what do you think about the uh cannabis uh workers being labeled as uh essential to the covet 19 vaccine drop us some comments on that hell yeah we're all pro weed though let's talk about the la school superintendent austin buettner he tweeted cannabis delivery drivers before school bus drivers and teachers makes no sense to me um being that you're not are they in session though i'm curious because here in seattle we're not doing in person school so maybe that's it maybe they aren't doing in person learning but i don't know i mean we're returning to in-person learning in illinois are they returning to in-person learning where you're at let us know in the comments yeah it'll be interesting it is it is it's kind of nice remember that one time we were giving away something on our 10 000 subscriber show and and we asked like it was samuel caldwell it was the answer to the question who was the first person arrested for uh cannabis in and some guy answers and he's like i'm in italy yeah i love the internet though man this is what um dude i can't wait till we get the site going again to have a place that i can contribute writing like it's not just about the videos you know oh yeah about just content one of the things we need to do on the cannabislegalizationnews.com website when we've relaunched that we've already moved it over aws but now we're just trying to do a refresh and our coder was sick and that's okay uh so over the next month but then we need to have like a real easy way for people to submit stories and reports so that we could have content getting you know yes auto created generated well even just a a place for you know my email is more than welcome to take suggestions uh you know i'll say it here at 420 binary at gmail.com but when i write it down because of uh uh spam crawlers i always put 420 binary and then something weirder than gmail hopefully most people know by now there's bots that just go scan the internet for [ __ ] you know yep and if you're one of those bots i welcome you to follow me on instagram at cannabis industry lawyer where no bots have ever followed me oh yeah i'll take i'll take the hit so i'll take your likes and shares but uh uh whatever you're gonna [ __ ] uh have we asked people to like share and subscribe lately canvas i still he wants to contribute yeah canvas lifestyle oh you should of course we put rob stuff on man what all right let's uh let's turn the news cavalcade on to new jersey like has been happening you know what's really fun about canvas legalization news ever uh lately it's everywhere man it's it's starting to like come out the gills of everything you know that cannabis legalization news is moving when indiana and iowa are just and even wisconsin is starting to actually discuss like medical cannabis programs in earnest new mexico is is it earnest or ernst oh i don't know all right but yeah new mexico dude what about that uh new mexico lawmakers approve a marijuana legalization bill in committee yes that's right first you need to get out of committee and then eventually you get floor time floor time is a really special time in a bill's life it's where a whole bunch of people either in favor or against it uh talk about the the piece of law or piece of law yeah and that's the part of the process i think most people don't understand like um for homegirl here you know it took us three years just to get it out of committee like nothing's fast years to get it out of committee yeah and so again thank you for tuning in to camp's legalization news now the takeaway today is uh that hb 1100 in south dakota is terrible and you need to fight against it but it's also depending on where your cannabis law goes to an administration it may die and the people wanted legal cannabis in south dakota but the administration for whatever reason i don't think it's a good one but like i'm assuming they have reasons and the reason was the people didn't know what they were voting for uh the real reason is oh [ __ ] i didn't know they're gonna do this well no that's the real reason is they just want to abuse you people and they don't want you to have an endocannabinoid supplement so that you can deal with a whole bunch of ailments oh and also not have to worry about being a criminal and so um why that is still a very uh prescient thing in the heartland is something else so let's see how mississippi is going to handle it there's supposed to be some rules coming out of mississippi but are they going to do kind of what south dakota did who knows let's get back to new mexico because that one was actually pretty good so new mexico lawmakers approved marijuana legalization bill in committee the new mexico house committee approved a comprehensive marijuana legalization bill on monday nice yeah man legislation was from representative javier martinez one of multiple legalization proposals that have been introduced to the 2021 session you see that's how hot cannabis legalization news is right now it's always one of multiple bills i mean what's going on in virginia virginia's got like two bills legalizing it you know yeah and then uh it sounds like a good bill though they're gonna allow homegrown like if they're gonna home grow how many plants a home grow tell us about it this one says uh first off adults 21 and older would be allowed to possess at least two ounces of cannabis and grow up to six mature plants and six immature plants for personal use and i like how they're using the definition of mature and immature uh illinois needs to get more mature and then also do that as opposed to the five inch rule remember i have um i'm i'm curing that that uh plant that was really really sad remember that plant that we had all right tell people more about uh the the measure in in new mexico i'll get the the thing out of the cure and i'll show you an eighth that's not a plant you're gonna show your sad bush like this thing looks like like like this big and um yeah i i'm looking forward to see what did you get a gram out of that thing come on man like is it in a full jar i thought you would at least be telling people that marquina's bill is advancing to additional committee before i could come up to a full floor vote uh and under the approved measure i've already talked about the six plants but uh see it it became a nugget and so the nugget uh weighed in at about like 3.7 grams uh and i think a lot of it's stem you know and so um it's it became an eighth nugget this is not a plant this is not a plant it was less than five inches tall it just became one big nugget and so like that's a huge loophole in in that i could have grown four thousand of those if i like kind of like just create a printer where it's all right you'll have a form with just three inch nuts all over just farming it hey hey what are you doing hey those do not count as plants read the law okay until they catch up to you oh it's so silly it's so silly and so um but then you're not allowed to sell it and all that so is it going to count as a plant sure but that's why it should be a mature versus an immature plant yeah yeah oh my goodness also ensures that tribal governments are able to participate in the new industry the bill will also allow small businesses to obtain so-called micro business licenses to begin operating before the larger businesses i like it nice legislation favored by reform advocates because unlike the other house and senate measured it would specifically use tax rev from the sales to support reinvestments in communities most impacted by the war on drugs just like in illinois right now if you're from illinois watch out because pretty soon you're going to get that rescore for your dispensary application but the best aspect at least in operation right now in social equity in illinois probably is the reallocation of the tax funds so always include the how allocation of the tax funds in your social equity plan because then you're going to see gamification of the uh corporate entities they'll come together to be able to get the licenses by exploiting whether it's the locality like in a detroit or very often the micro licenses like this they need to be from that location you know if they legalize it which i have uh being a foodie i mentioned about himself and mississippi does a barbecue if new mexico they're known for chili's i would imagine infused chili rianos would be off the hook chilis for a second i was thinking about the baby back ribs song and the chain restaurant chili's and i'm like that's not what he's talking about and then of course it was not it was not what he was talking about all right here we go again everybody smell your nuggets you know you might hyperventilate a little bit uh lawmakers delay vote in n.j weed compromise putting legalization on shaky ground once more a little bit more hyperventilating ah jersey ah this is being reported from yesterday february 16 2021 another compromise on penalties for underage weed use was put on hold tuesday afternoon yet again throwing the fate of legal marijuana in new jersey back into uncertain territory but just [ __ ] man why is it so hard to get justice correct uh because justice correct is not a thing uh it is a more perfect union it is not perfect and you know what you can tell it's not perfect anyway man senator nicholas scootari who's a name i'm sure i'm just butchering a democrat from union new jersey who delayed the vote said the senate judiciary committee would schedule a new meeting wednesday that's today by the way and may consider another marijuana related bill with a cleanup bill establishing penalties for younger offended offenders that have been requested by governor phil murphy that's right how can we legalize it while still arresting you for it yeah some silly [ __ ] period some silly [ __ ] period now again uh we are talking not about any of the license types so tune in to canvasindustrylawyer.com uh sign up for our email us on that and then go to our map page because we're gonna start building out a lot of new jersey content to get ready for the license round when that comes up i'm not exactly sure uh we're going to have to wait for the law to be signed with the late department passed and yeah and then you have to get the rules but at least you have governor phil murphy and this is the difference this is when like an agenda is set by an administration that's receptive versus by an agenda that's set by administration like south dakota which is very anti you know what's funny too in this situation uh jersey um and watch this happen when they do legalize it relation recreationally big money's gonna course take over a lot of [ __ ] right i just learned i think what is it cresco's owned by a rush russian oligarchy one dude cresco is owned by a russian oligarchy yes one dude no no we can actually look at cresco's stock right now it's trading on the on the otc and so um and i'm still working on doing the um this the cannabis stock uh script the problem with the cannabis stock script is like the analysis that i want to do to the actual stocks for its price to be able to determine if you should buy it or not uh that math requires me to sit and focus for probably about four to six hours and um i'm working on that ten states wicked dro we're getting to it it's gonna be our marquee story of the day so make sure you keep staying in for a few more minutes we were talking about cresco's stock it is not owned by a russian oligarch but back to the jersey thing though yeah let's get back to jersey i'll just give you let's hang on while we're getting back to jersey why don't you you tell people about the jersey i'll cut to the stocks report sure yeah i know i just i just think that big money's gonna take over but what you're gonna not see is like the legacy people like new jersey weed man a freaking staple and who's been in the movement uh will he we got to get nj weedman on an application to answer that question but cresco's stock is ticking at 15.57 down almost 4 on the day and if you go to its key statistics you can hit view all and then you can actually see what the float is versus the institutional ownership and so the institutional ownership is 2.6 the insiders that own it is only 2 so that means that really only talking about like less than five percent of the stock is actually owned by smart money uh the other ninety-five percent of the stock is just a whole bunch of bros on twitter thirteen cobb asking uh how do you get into the cannabis stock cannabis there's there's many there's probably at least a dozen cannabis stocks that you can go buy like e-trade what is that do you think you can go to e-trade like if they're otc i bet you can buy like you know gti true leaf cresco you could buy all those i bet otc on like you know on a brokerage platform yeah that's dope dude yeah man all right so what else we got going on with that for oh yeah let's cover up on jersey oh [ __ ] like yeah we just go way too far you lose people on the other end skartucci says and then at the issue of penalties addressed in the cleanup bill murphy wants those underage to face only civil penalties for possessing marijuana once it becomes legal for people 21 and older yes why are you going to arrest these children yeah well by the way 6k 6 000 people have been arrested since voters approved the measure 6 000 and so what are they arguing at about how can we keep arresting these people you know how can i turn you into an asset how can i monetize off of your ass that is not cool that is just not cool i tell you and then we already did cover uh new mexico so what's our next one are we actually to the marquis story of the day of the week yeah we are hang on a second since we're at the marquis story the day of the week i would like to advise everybody to go to empire direct and buy some sweet sweet delta athc uh i'm not sure if you've tried that delta eight yet have you meggie i have not well did you know that you're not gonna be able to mail it in vapes for very long really yeah that uh that ban is gonna go into effect this spring oh [ __ ] well there you go it is uh legal hemp and so it is not on screen usage and that is t-h-o-m-h-25 it's tom h25 you enter that in you will get uh a coupon on your next empire direct order now of course uh they do have some very thorough marketing that some uh commenters have found frustrating yeah but all right let's go to our marching story of the week lawmakers in 10 states have introduced proposals to legalize marijuana this year according to the reason foundation which sounds like a totally made-up think tank yeah yeah but um dude it's the thing i mean to tell you like cannabis legalization news is coming fast and furious until 2021 this includes proposals in connecticut florida new mexico new york maryland minnesota pennsylvania rhode island texas and virginia virginia check that box already if all those efforts are successful nearly half of u.s states would have legalized marijuana for adult use that tipping point that we're going to need to see before we can get that more act passed i think minnesota's legislation today i believe they took a bunch of input yesterday for a session today man we are going to be updating that map like nobody's business over cannabis industry lawyer.com it is going to be a lot of work fortunately we have a new uh research attorney starting and he is going to be pulling all those new bills and then we are going to start with the rules and the application windows that we think are going to be coming up you know and so if you do want to see like your state go to cannabis industry lawyer and search for our map of marijuana legality uh and you know the title is kind of misleading too because they throw in virginia virginia already did but not till 2024. well again like it was like virginia was a just amazing efficiency and it's not quite done yet they have to do the reconciliation process but it just kind of goes to show that shotgunny kind of blast and also the popularity of it there was two different bills they passed one of each and so now they have to kind of you know match them back all up like the senate and the house both agree oh let's legalize it but not like that like this yeah i mean all i can say is dude just get involved you know this is so frustrating get involved if you know somebody in south dakota oh my brother-in-law my brother-in-law's family well i'm gonna tell them in yankton south dakota you need a call you need to call them man it's not even just for your south dakota any state like like if you're not happy where you're at you know every state has a policy every every county [ __ ] decriminate in your town do anything you can yeah but still shout out to nathan and mary uh down in tampa i hope that they are calling uh nathan's family back in south dakota to be like come on bro we need that dispensary in yankton oh is that another place that you're gonna have it uh yeah well you know i've been i've been i've been all over the place but connecticut rhode island all right so that pretty much will wrap up all of new england with connecticut and rhode island going i think new england is just just there off the books new jersey kind of broke that over in the eastern seaboard we have new york and pennsylvania on the list right here maryland as well so if you get new york maryland pennsylvania it come 2023 2024 we're going to be popping and it's going to be about ready for uh full on and this is the thank you for joining us until the end if you're enjoying this don't forget to click the bell and subscribe but also uh i think what's going to happen with the 2022 election is there are the democrats as they are already laying their foundation for their strategy where all these democratic governors are putting this onto their agenda even in wisconsin where the democrats they don't own the houses they're they're they don't have a house they don't have the senate they don't have either and so it's a very divided government coming to 2022 it's like no you vote for democrats and we will legalize marijuana and they're going to just try to take back as many houses in as many states as they can i mean seriously uh as a single-issue voter which is not it's not a single issue but like there's so many benefits for voting only for cannabis like for your country like there's so many social justice benefits industrial benefits wellness benefits uh tax benefits the benefits are so contagious that it's been 20 minutes you know what that means somewhere in the world somebody's tuning into this and they're wondering hey is it 420 somewhere i think it is i think it's uh that was the benefit of having the uh the bumper because you see one of those isn't delta eight thc it's not hemp and so yeah legal medical cannabis it's it is medical marijuana's wilderness is getting thinner and thinner we're going to have to start looking internationally and if you want that stay tuned for sunday i think we have japan on japan is pretty darn backwards oh yeah we're going to talk all sorts of japanese laws man but medical marijuana's last wilderness you heard this is political is reporting that man not mentioned in the reasons foundation article or nebraska and idaho both of whom have never passed any sort of medical marijuana but there are now movements afoot in both states nice nice cannabis advocates in nebraska and idaho buoyed by successful votes for legalization other deep red states last november if lawmakers fail to act this year advocates are vowing to take the issue directly to the ballot box where voters are all but certain to approve them and then they will be roundly rejected by the supreme republican majorities in nebraska idaho and south dakota it's sad well idaho's the states is trying to make a rules that you can't have legal anything so those poor guys are going uphill omaha right on we had nebraska on before remember that guy yeah nebraska and also south dakota both fell victim to the same single issue problem with their ballot initiatives please next time 2022 uh us's in the future for the cannabis advocates in south dakota and nebraska especially you guys please listen up just have the ballot initiative say we legalize all cannabis or all forms of cannabis don't use the word and what so [ __ ] ever if you give me your your ballot initiative and the word and is in it i will punch you future uh uh us that are trying to legalize weed in nebraska and also in uh south dakota seriously though i mean come on like like the senator anna wishart in nebraska says we have we now have strong vocal support from people across the state uh who has been trying to pass medical marijuana legislation for years at this point everybody knows somebody that has been benefited from having access to medical cannabis all use is medical use that's right no use is abuse that's the other problem with schedule 1 thc any use is defined legally as abuse under federal law which is so flagrantly flipping [ __ ] wrong i mean it just it just goes back to the understanding of science in 1970 that we didn't have even though we did kind of have it and then they studied it and then they didn't study it because they they banned you from studying it so it all got studied in israel where they discovered the freaking endocannabinoid system and anatomic in the early 90s and then we still deny it well come on how many reports did we have in in each decade that got denied the laguardia um why are you in the 40s yeah what's the other these other ones the the carter one right here that was the shaffer commission one of the ways they got the democrats to vote for schedule one marijuana in the 60s was they said we'll study it and figure out where it's supposed to go in post we'll fix it promise you dick nixon you can trust me and uh that didn't that didn't turn out and so it's been schedule one ever since but that was the schaefer commission report in 1972 i believe there were other reports in the 50s and um and then all the science had to move abroad to israel where they just kept publishing it with dr mitchell and that's where they discovered the endocannabinoid system i mean cannabis helps not just with uh uh like ptsd and other elements but it helps with the case of the [ __ ] that we got to deal with right like all this [ __ ] that you you're like hold on how many reports got denied and there was a patent and uh you're saying almost everyone's going tomorrow i'm going to sleep dude i mean the the deadliest thing i am is to a pizza yeah yeah i tell you that's uh it's another pizzagate we got another pizzagate in our hands because we're trying to legalize it all right let's go uh let's get some babies we got so much news in it justin reform coalition urges president biden to pardon all non-violent marijuana convictions yes i mean but see again the hard part is there's no general database like in all this activism i'm doing uh pow pow 420 freedom growth forever all these other groups there is no way to get a list because of all the ricoh charges and layered [ __ ] that comes after hell the reason why lance uh uh is not out is because again the prosecutor vince lombardi jr stepped in and said no this guy's showboated and can't he's a threat to society even though he had a a food drive during winter freaking society i just don't like this guy pretty much i just don't like this guy same same thing for luke camarzo i think there might have been some guns found or a gun but it wasn't used in like defense or no [ __ ] and and he had a video that just irked everybody you know you you you can't this is why the bidding activist sometimes is hard too right where no one wants to there's repercussions to [ __ ] and there shouldn't be right we we shouldn't be killing our heroes and all this other [ __ ] hell no but i tell you this is a broad coalition of groups that are urging president biden to pardon all non-violent marijuana convictions it was normal the weldon project the national i'm sorry the minority cannabis business association the national cannabis industry association aka the ncia and even that newly formed group from last week the united states cannabis council oh you mean the new guy jumped in the low bar for things in the cannabis industry it's the mso guys but anyway and so the the criminal justice system is in urgent need of reform and one thing that i did enjoy from president biden so far is the defunding of privatized prisons the uh we are we will not accept nor will we solicit any sponsorship from prisons this will never be cannabis legalization news brought to you by consolidated prison systems if it was it would be on the upside down and [ __ ] finally got right right like i also like we trust the cops yeah i'm sorry i uh i'm the prison systems are a sponsor no no no there should be no pr profit at all in prisons all right well that was that was something else let's let's get let's get some quotes on this cannabis prohibition ruins lives wastes resources and is imposed by a large majority of americans the group writes in its letter they also also referenced democrat governor jb pritzker pardoning last month more than 11 000 illinoisians with low-level cannabis convictions saying that actions showcased the important role of clemency and achieving justice and equality it's time it's past time for the harm to stop they say i mean really think about that man why did jb pritzker a governor in illinois get a pardon that 11 000 people because most of those cannabis to rest aren't done by the federales they're they're done they're by the the dea and the fbi they don't really arrest every any many of the criminals most of the criminals are arrested by local cops and then after that state police and despite making it up to close to five percent of the global population oh there's another prison fact despite making up close to five percent the global population the u.s has nearly 25 percent in the world's prison population you know a lot of this crap grew out of the tough on crime war on drugs and so we were on drugs in the 80s and then um people got really upset and they said oh the crime's just getting terrible and they started then getting tough on crime defining it basically as drugs and that's where you get the the crack cocaine disparity and whatnot and the prison population explodes and then of course they have contracts with the federal government it's that public private partnership now uh where the profits are going to the prisons and then you can i think you can actually trade i bet we can buy a prison stock oh yeah guaranteed and and you know the the prison uh racket is so bad where you know these guys pop prisoners are making uniforms for a dollar an hour you know they're slamming out products for major companies in foreign military and police like there's so much money being made off of the prisons by the system that it was created i mean the fact that they can sue they they've sued in arizona they sued the state because they weren't having they had empty beds like you're you're telling me yeah and like you know uh guest of the show chris martin from hempfield farms out in arizona and the zonka brands he also reported on how then in the 90s it was about reform it was about rehabilitation paying your debts to society and going back out a fixed person and now it's just all about nothing yeah your your cattle yeah well you know dude if you're joining us right now that is awesome thank you for the 231 that say they're watching that's total i mean that's also facebook but let's go over our top story one more time uh there was there are 10 states that have proposed marijuana legalization at the adult levels so please do if you are one of these states call your legislature and say you got to do that you got to do that so that is connecticut florida new mexico new york maryland minnesota pennsylvania rhode island texas and virginia every state has a they should have a find my legislature option if you go to the website make it easy just type in your address it pop propagates like who's your person and just type in one thing like a subject like i support this bill yeah man that's it well we got some more we still have uh several more stories how about delivery might be the answer to weed equity vice news is reporting this and that's that story we talked about before with the uh the the protests with the uh the one agency that was against this uh and one of the big farms was a tilray that was pulled back or the crisco this is the massachusetts delivery operator license and so they have a delivery courier license and unfortunately a delivery courier license is not very profitable and so the social equity fix that massachusetts is coming up with is this delivery operator license so you would be able to uh somewhat have the uber of weed kind of oh yeah that's just okay you don't have a brick and mortar store and so you have a car or fleet of cars and then you can take orders and deliver them yeah but the proposal's still there right we haven't found there hasn't been a like a solid like as of next week you're you can qualify as an applicant to to join right we're anticipating and so we're preparing the work right now so if you are a massachusetts delivery operator uh hopeful get in touch with us over at uh well just follow me on instagram or something in canvas industry lawyer go to campus industrial.com and sign up for our newsletter and then reach out but um yeah it's coming and so like we think it's going to be this summer we're working on putting together an application for certain aspects of it now simply because we have the regulations and we kind of see what they are already doing in those places but uh it's the the massachusetts model is is uh highly regulated and it does take months and so it's it's a process i mean like i'm looking over like applications and they'll start in like february and they'll end in december and i'm like man that's that's a process yeah i would love to be a curry though i mean like what a great like exactly well that vice video i saw the the guy who was doing it for alcohol and like just to prove that he can make a whatever overhead i mean again it's a young man's game not a i need to make twice as much as you do right as a kid like delivering pizzas i'm gonna do that okay this is my career right and that's that's fine if you want to deliver pizzas of weed but um that business is not just like it just wasn't very profitable in the operations that they have in certain states because the stuff that they require on your car those types of security features are and then the cash handling and all that other stuff so i mean it hasn't proven to be a very very lucrative aspect that curry or business model and therefore they're trying to have not delivery licenses but delivery operator licenses where you can have a website where people buy their weed from you and then you drive it to them okay i mean it works but who's the guest that we had in la remember they do like the amazon style where they have a warehouse and they ship from there i mean that is that a good option too for the uh that market coming up for deliveries uh yeah i mean like that's the where is it going the retail experience is going to have an online presence and so the real beef that people have has to do with the cost of obtaining the uh retail license where you can actually physically go there is quite high and so if you just stripped all that [ __ ] down and you had like your vault and your security system and just you know a garage yeah but in california right isn't the ease isn't that the app that does the same thing pretty much i don't know if they have dispensaries but then again like it's just if you're trying to do the courier model you're not going to be making uh very much money right but if it's an app like you're saying like uh like grizzly is an app for alcohol i mean sure no like there's there's no ability as far as i'm aware in illinois for you to like have a business model where people are are kind of like doing an uber of weed okay that's that's um you can do it you just might get arrested yeah i'm yeah i'm not encouraging it i'm just saying you know for uh legal states it could be an option for oh yeah the the legal states one of the things they've always done is not legalized it it's almost like a very confusing licensing agreement that our musicians that we listen to are all entered into and they're like did you read your contract no but i got one got that record deal and you know it's so funny though just how cannabis is still underrated underestimated because i mean right right now the cannabis industry supports 321 000 full-time jobs whoa 321 000 full-time jobs how many people work for walmart i bet more people now work for weed than walmart i bet more people work for weed than coal i bet more people work for weed than a lot of things we have to get a uh a graphic up for us on the instagram so it looks really nice uh where wheat is on on the list of the top employers you know like uh because if you're at 321 000 now before those 10 f in states that we were talking about with the exception yeah now it's down to nine but uh virginia's not legalizing sales until like 2023 2024 or some stuff in the future i think about 321 000 people paying their bills uh collecting benefits uh electric bills groceries not getting arrested and having the benefit of allowing to supplement their endocannabinoid systems so they can age more healthfully they can mitigate health problems that arise from when your endocannabinoid system is out of whack that is often awesome info graphic from leafly the problem with that is i cannot make out the chart can we zoom in on the chart so they can kind of read it to the people listening at home so we got going on here uh so 321 legal cannabis jobs 122 400 aircraft pilot engineers right and then dentists at 122 127 000 dentists and then we have um writers and editors there's more people in weed than writers and editors 192 thousand riders and editors painters and paper hangers whatever the heck that is 236 000 emts 260 000 emts we have more uh legal cannabis employees we have us just more electrical engineers i did not know there was only 314 000 electrical engineers in the country but there's 321 000 people that work for the cannabis industry it's we're next we're going to take out hair stylist barbers and cosmetologists with 406 000 on our way to the post office 523 200 work for that and then police officers 670 000 we should do a show when that comes up when police officers imagine our when legal cannabis employees outnumber police officers that'll be interesting no kidding wow what a topic that'll be tune in for cannabis legalization news 2024 it's legal to find virginia now christian levitino wants you to join clubhouse i don't have a smart or yeah i'm a clubhouse i'm on clubhouse and so like i should use clubhouse invite me to a clubhouse thing you should i just i do it's just that you know there's only so many hours in the day and you have to keep the lights on and work and stuff you know i know you're always like lawyering that's your problem bro i know i'm trying to clone myself so somebody else can be doing the lawyering while i'm doing the marketing yeah so you think new york's got aspirations though saying cuomo announces 30-day amendments to legislation establishing comprehensive adult use cannabis program in new york but it's cuomo it's cuomo you can trust what the governor says didn't he just get a whole bunch of [ __ ] for uh some of the stuff he was saying about the copa response that he was doing how they counted the numbers for uh uh nursing home deaths but i i it's really a non-topic of nothing people were dying regardless like like let's look it was all about the treatment right we need to like you know contain the [ __ ] and yeah that's that's what he was in trouble for a little bit but say that some of the tweaks are how the 100 million dollar social equity fund will be allotted uh what types of nonprofits will be able to get uh in line and all that that's that's great uh you should just kind of try to keep it broad on that try to keep it local and like have the tenants of the act and so it's going to be those social equity to repair the war on drugs those harms look for those and then also to enable the use of delivery services local governments would have the opportunity to opt out from delivery services inside their jurisdiction delivery is an important add-on to uh very often the cannabis dispensary license and so um well especially new york you don't want more traffic you know you know everybody getting out and go get we sure but then there should be a difference between uh a cannabis delivery operator like you know what they're gonna start doing in massachusetts as opposed to a brick and mortar uh dispensary and so brick and mortar dispensaries should become more like bars and you know so you can go and buy and enjoy unless like um liquor stores you know or maybe there's just in the future there might be more than one type of dispensary that's how it was in the past here yeah yeah i'm sure but yeah i'm gonna say at least washington lawmakers approved drug decrimination bill and committee vote like that's a step forward we looked at our cousin oregon yeah like you guys are doing all right landmark drug decrim bill in washington state cleared its first legislative hurdle monday panel lawmakers voted to advance the measure just hours before a key deadline but it was close it was a 7-6 vote so the house public safety committee approved the pathways to recovery act h.b 1499. so one of the first things that a bill does before it becomes a law is it needs some approval from a committee to make it out of that committee to show that it's popular enough to be debated on the floor thanks andy appreciate you man yeah man and uh stay tuned we do have some awesome guests lined up we're going to probably try to start doing about like a guest a month uh something like that or or as as we can sign up ones that we think are interesting or if like uh various companies want to come on and talk about aspects of the industry that they help with plus we like to sprinkle in our little offshoot videos not just whenever we can right right i tell you so uh that's that's pretty cool that washington lawmakers are taking the first steps towards their drug decrement bill what about uh lax thc vape rules so we got uh lax thc rules still allow toxins into your lungs so in 2019 and 2020 vaping associated lung injuries killed 68 people and injured 2 2807 across the united states as reported by leafly and later confirmed by officials at the cdc those injuries deaths were exclusively associated with unlicensed thc vape cards no [ __ ] in 2018 a new wave of novel cartridges of adidas thickeners thinners dilutants and artificial flavors began flooding the market new out of this were mostly limited to illicit market vape kurtz but a few seeped into the legal regulated market as well you know people going cheap uh those new additives included vitamin e acetate aka beard cream oil ew ew what's this squalling let's just call it squalaline yeah that's that's clearly not it but it's s-q-u-a-l-e-n-e yeah and then the thousands of food flavors not approved for inhalation i mean overall this was just the [ __ ] river oil substance yeah okay you know what i mean yeah this was not oh salesman has been replaced by a shark oil salesman but this was not unforeseeable right safe access includes a regulated you know thing where you can say okay if an issue pops up then everybody will have that commonality it took him a while to figure this out like no one wants to admit yeah i'm getting illegal vapes you know uh a regular market ensures safety for the consumer uh also the cdc said the number one thing state car cannabis regulators could do to protect public health was ensure that chemicals of concern like vitamin e acetate did not enter the state licensed thc vape cartridge supply but as of early 2021 cannabis regulators have not done that so here in washington we did ban vitamin estate but that was like last year like it took him a while to yeah yeah so there's some still allowing it which they shouldn't uh leafly investigation into the current and forthcoming regulations around thc vape cartridges in the 15 legal cannabis states reveals that more than a year after the vape long also known as e valley or vape e crisis vape gate right a few states have banned vitamin io washington but not a single state upgraded its thc vape car testing requirements to the standard current oh okay so it's about the testing so europe and canada they do test for that and all their nicotine vape cartridges but not here interesting crazy man i tell you what i got uh a flurry of emails because i'm on the cannabis law section council and so there's a lot of bills being introduced into the state of illinois i wish that i had more um you know bar association cannabis counts and sections that i sat on so i would get like emails from all the states as they're trying to amend and and create new aspects of their own laws but there's a lot and so let's see here there is an hb 193 that is a cannabis regulation will affect separate delivery companies oh interesting wow and so yeah cannabis regulation delivery and so uh let's see there's also another one an hb 312 cannabis delivery licenses and so um it's how strong is your canvas alliance there what i mean well like here in washington i actually give a lot of props to because you need an association to help speak up and be on top of the the legislation right like the people trying to limit there's really no industry yet and so like the industry is just the established mso players and so unless you're like a guy that's just making money hand over fist and just like oh you know just kind of wait you don't need any more competition so right now all these guys just don't give a [ __ ] right now about legislation like they're just kind of well they do there is a bill that they're advancing but it's not this driver delivery organization license must qualify as social equity applicant you could be challenged by a constitutional thing there but then it's regulations and prohibitions for delivery organizations uh oh interesting so these this would be like a delivery organization that can get product from any cannabis business license in the united state of illinois and then it's kind of like a delivery operator license so maybe they would have a cannabis delivery operator license and just totally piss off everybody who's just spent like two million dollars to try to open a dispensary i mean uh cannabis and cannabis sales in unincorporated communities tries to say that an unincorporated community can now ban sales even be like 1.5 miles beyond the the territorial limits so god yeah it's granting uh you know townships and municipalities super powers to go beyond the scope of their community limits to continue to prohibit the sales in unincorporated territories that's not beyond yeah but it's it's uh unincorporated unincorporated areas very often it's in the middle of nowhere and so like it's the rural people it's it's the ours it's the red staters um and then the 401 so hb 401 cannabis conflict of interest that one just came by oh interesting i'm gonna have to actually dig into that one so it's going to removing language allowing persons to apply for or hold financial or voting interest in any cannabis business as if it is a passively okay and so interesting it's they're changing that's what they'll do they'll change these laws and so in every state they're just going to go ahead and keep changing the laws bro bring your own kit what's this one called bring your own cannabis to work day no oh this one's really cool um this one's really cool this one's called bring your own cannabis hb 715 so a big thumbs up to hp7115 bring your own cannabis it is going to amend the illinois municipal and counties code to allow corporate authorities of a county or municipality to license or regulate businesses operating as a public accommodation that permit the consumption of cannabis on the business premises that are not regulated under the cannabis regulation and tax act i.e not a dispensary or a growth yep provides an exemption from the provision of the cannabis regulation and tax act and defines public accommodation so essentially it is the byoc act support hb 715 because then you'd have consumption lounges there would essentially be a consumption lounge license at the municipal level well it says possession right so like funny story um twice uh this week uh i got some flour that's kind of extra stinky and uh i put some of my grinder before i go to come to work and sometimes i don't notice how strong it is and i've had it sit i buried it i thought okay no one's gonna notice it and then these guys my customer comes in and he's all it smells like something in here right and that we just smell like weed he's like i didn't want to say we but i was like yeah sweet and then uh uh i just because i'm in a position where i can finally be like look i'm in a legal state um i i'm doing it after work it's just you know i for my bus ride i don't know it's like a civility slash moral thing where i'm not like [ __ ] up at work or whatever right right you're like yeah you guessed your rook so yeah support that bill yep and then uh there's more that's this is like you're asking like well what's the one that the people support the ones that are currently operating that's the cannabis license dispensing location relocation um uh bill that's hb 1869. so if you currently own a cannabis dispensary which of course is nobody in the state because they've given away no new licenses in like seven years um uh right because that was the last there was one round of medical licenses abs 2014 yeah and so that and so we haven't gotten any new operators since then and now what they want is they want the ability to move their license so they've now they have all the money because they made all the money last year you know and they're making all the money each month and they're gonna be making all the money this year uh this is why people need to speak up and get involved yeah well again like this is this is one of those things where they're trying to get this bill passed so now they can do the studies for where they want to position themselves and then buy that real estate and move there yeah money [ __ ] makes rules [ __ ] yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna object i'm gonna say like you

right well i think that's that's pretty much there's one more uh khb 1952 uh it's called j-u-v-t-c-t oh cool cannabis expungement so it's going to amend the juvenile court act 97 and allow it appears that there's going to be some expungement maybe it's going to be automatic yeah so like if you were a juvenile caught with cannabis or drug paraphernalia then you're going to be able to get that expunged so that looks like it's going to be a good bill and you know see it just they just keep coming and then they they emit yeah nice oh yeah it's getting better all right there we go we even got to end up with an illinois roundup of their their uh pending litigation or legislation man 239 people thanks for hanging people yeah if you were hanging with us thank you so much you know we really

tuning in everyone make sure you like and subscribe to keep up with all cannabis legalization news we'll see you on sunday sunday [Music] you", "a3GfUyb3Pb8": "welcome to this debaco university video here we're going to be looking at well-known cannabis options now there are many many options just here to provide you with some representative examples for these certain categories that will be outlined here now as i said there are many options there's many current options with many more entering the market each and every year so your stream should be selected based on what best matches your specific growing conditions with and to aid in providing a general list a few strains are mentioned here to help act as a source for comparison now finding unbiased data is advised whenever possible as string descriptions make each seem like the only one you would ever need to grow and you'll see some of those kind of descriptions provided here but why is to kind of get try to get some unbiased data to try to get the largest pool or ideas selection of data to try to get an idea of exactly how these may perform so when we're looking at performance you also want to be an informed consumer so how do you become an informed consumer well this is looking also at the end products or what they may produce this is for any string purchased a coa certificate of authenticity should be provided this holds true if you're purchasing an end product or looking for what strains to grow as well as far as what may have produced that now here we're looking at a concentrated extract and cbd oil but it's particularly looking at dry flour as well and even potentially more importantly where is the testing line what is the data showing an independent lab so we're going to focus here on high cbd strains so be aware though that just because it is a high cbd strain you also need to take into consideration that the 0.3 thc limit which does make many of the high cbd strains above the federal thc limit so just because it's high cbd does not automatically necessarily classify it as hemp may still fall into the marijuana category if you're above 0.3 percent thc now popular common strains will be provided as a starting point on the following slides with website provided descriptions to provide some background for each strain in the description there's a link to the lecture sides there's also a link to sources that you're welcome to check out and as always any subscriptions that you make to this channel are always appreciated now indica cbd so just looking at an indica's cbd the og kush you can see all of the consistent test certificate here where it's going to give you some of the cannabinoid id it's going to give the weight the concentrations in milligrams per gram and again a signature here kind of signed off when it was tested and kind of some additional information again something you should be getting with any material you are purchasing yourself energy kush this is just said to have um with resin notes of cinnamon diesel and sweet grass this dense purple flower is perfect for low thc variation on a cannabis classic the total thc content of just 0.28 this batch of og flour is a great choice for anyone looking to get minimum thc doses with a full spectrum product and again that's quoted in the website so if it truly does test at that 0.28 thc this would classify as hemp which opens up a lot more opportunities for growing this particular strain they have an indica cbd this is cherry wine and as a name suggests terpenes in this be to crackle with a pop of sweet stone fruit layered with piney peppery undertones i always love the descriptions that some websites give to cannabis flowers here you can see that the terpene profile is additionally listed here and you can see it does favor some more versus some others so again that might be important to you for consideration uh again cherry wine is also a cbd rich powers capable of delivering a lovely balance and smoke ability according to the website so again something just to consider there where we're looking at you know what is the thc level and is it below that zero critical 0.3 level it definitely looks like based on this test that it would be however we also need to consider what our states are using for thc levels as far as is it just delta 9 thc this would fall into the category but if we're looking at max dhc looking at some of the conversion factors and delta h is not considered but we have that thc a as well but some states take to consideration so be mindful of what state you're growing in that can determine where that line does lay they have hawaiian haze and this is kind of more of that warm citrusy kind of tropical fruit as they associate with it that's probably how it got its name you could see its terpene profile here as well it's delta 9 thc level as well as the ghcv and thca levels there so again be mindful what state you're in but this is another one to consider if you're looking at a c higher cbd strain that also has sativa-like morphologies then we have this it's another sativa based cbd the electra here just again another option to look at and as you can see with all these options if these numbers do change these terpene profiles do change uh so i've tried to keep the test relatively consistent just so you have that nice sense of comparison now remember they also say choice if you're looking for a relaxing daytime strain because they're assuming it's a sativa but keep in mind again sativa is referring or is greater correlation to the morphology and not necessarily the effects i always caution people when they read something like this that it's all relaxing daytime stream because it's sativa not always the case these sativas and indicas are really more correlated with the plant morphology now we have a hybrid here of cbds is the wife cbd and looking at this one it's a high cbd hemp strain that packs more than 18 we said they quote cbd with a skunky and sweet aromatic profile this hybrid hemp strain is mellow with tangy flavors profile notes of cherry the y2d hemp flower has dense green buds and you can see again here is your certificate of analysis something you definitely should be looking at considering with anything you're looking to purchase so i hope this was helpful and just looking at some of the cbd varieties or strains that are available to at least start some of your research as you go through and determine what you may want to grow yourself", "VEiE_EhsW6Y": "a warning from police in Westchester County tonight about cannabis candy they discovered some during a bust last week and now one police chief wants to warn parents that these marijuana infused treats could easily be confused by kids for the real thing Marcus solace has a story police admit it wasn't the arrest of the century an alleged low-level marijuana dealer busted in Tarrytown this week but it's more than buds that were seized there's THC in liquid form attachments for e-cigarettes and what's most troubling for the police chief edibles in the form of gummy candy I feel very strong that there is no need to put it in the form of something that's very attractive all to young children Chief John barber Len says the issue isn't whether recreational use of marijuana should be legal in New York as it is in several states and most recently in Canada his concern is the marketing of certain products containing THC there's two issues here hey is it an attraction to younger people that really shouldn't be making that decision and B what is the possibility of accidental exposure the chief points to a Journal of the American Medical Association study that found in Colorado the number of children hospitalized due to accidental exposure jumped 34% so could the sugary stuff be mistaken for something harder the similarities are striking down to the same shape and coloring of the products so if I was to put this on my counter with my ten-year-old daughter home what's to say she's not gonna pick it up and he didn't think it's a gummy worm from CBS who was to say the difference a difference he says parents should be aware of", "NhnnGxYoaMM": "so a lawsuit is being filed against the DEA to force them to reschedule marijuana and make weed legal the lawsuit says that the DEA made a mistake over 25 years ago that means that they should have never even been able to make weed illegal in the first place and I'm gonna tell you how this could mean we might actually get legal weed right now on the strain show answers to all the questions you've ever had about weeds what's up I'm Matt welcome back to the strange show the channel for adults and patients where I teach you the answers to all the questions you've ever had about weed so people have tried to get weed legalized for a long time but now there's actually a lawsuit being filed against the DEA a woman named sue Sisley along with three military vets recently filed a legal action against the Drug Enforcement Agency they filed this in the US Court of Appeals and they're trying to force the DEA to reschedule marijuana sue Sicily it's a medical doctor who's done some really tight and groundbreaking research on using weed to treat war veterans who have PTSD she has also publicly talked trash about the government's trash weed she described government grown weed as poor quality and low potency and she said this is a problem because this is the only weed that we have access to to do our testing when we're allowed to do our very very limited testing that we can do so this is what the press release said check it out the DEA has for decades applied the wrong legal standard in determining whether a drug has a currently accepted medical use under the Controlled Substances Act and we all know this is BS because we know that weed has medical uses and they're accepted medical uses because the FDA has approved a drug with CBD and if fda-approved drug and the FDA is who regulates drugs in America I would say that weed applies and that's what they're saying in this lawsuit to the court petition says that the test that is currently used to determine if a drug has a currently accepted medical use is outdated and it's wrong and it should have never even been used in the first place so the DEA has a five-part criteria for these drugs when they're being scheduled and they made this five part criteria back in 1992 when the DEA originated and check out what they have listed for the five criteria whether drugs chemistry is known and reproducible whether there are adequate safety studies whether there are adequate and well controlled studies providing efficacy whether the drug is not accepted by qualified experts whether the scientific evidence is not widely available the lawsuit says that this test that the DEA has created for their self depends on flawed and outdated case law so in this lawsuit they want to change that five part test and they want to reconsider marijuana scheduling and they want to actually start using real-world examples of weed in clinical trials instead of these raggedy-ass government grown samples I remember when we were kids the legend was the government grew that fire weed but the truth is the government grows stank weed and I mean what really would you expect but real quick I got to give a special shout-out to the homie JP what up buddy JP has been watching the strange show for a long time and he recently moved to Denver and he said when he moved here he just knew that one day he would meet me and the other day we were walking down the street and boom he met me and it was super tight we FaceTime his brother he got hyped it was a lot of fun thanks for that JP leave me a comment so I know your uh YouTube username buddy the lawsuits opening brief is scheduled for this August and if things went exactly perfect this could mean that weed could be discontinuous means that by the end of summer this year in just a couple of months we could have some sort of legalized weed on a federal level if it's D scheduled by the FDA on a federal level that means this applies to every state in the United States and that would be tight but even though I'm really glad that the FDA is getting sued because we should be legal just because I think that's diet I'm not really sure if this is gonna work what do you think I mean the way I look at it is they're trying to sue the federal government and this is just a lady and three dudes if they don't want to get sued they will just say hmm we have determined in our courts where you're trying to sue us that we are correct and you're wrong I don't know maybe it'll work let's hope it works that would be tight you know what else will be tight buddy

Knew it. Six tonight There is a new product on the market that's being touted as legal marijuana without a prescription. It's hitting store shelves all across the Bay Area. It's something you should be aware of. FOX 13's Josh Cascio reports. Experts have a warning tonight. Sign inside Chillin Glass Gallery in Ybor City reads loud and clear trying this stuff. Delta eight, THC will get you high, Unlike your standard marijuana. This stuff is being sold legally to buyers without a prescription. The difference. What we're talking about here is Dr 90 CBN cannabis of the 80 s being available in hemp. Right. It's available in hemp. It's legal, right still gets you stone, and it's made it legal under the same laws. It made CBD illegal. It's said to be 70 to 75% as potent as the real thing. The best way to think about that is for every two hits off of Delta nine. It takes three hits off adult to hate. So essentially all you all you need is to consume a little bit more in order to feel the same effect right now. The medical marijuana system We have to see a doctor every seven months. On you're fading like extreme prices for cannabis. Some of these patients can't do that. So it allows us to offer an alternative to that whole system, the DEA or Drug Enforcement Agency says it's currently in the process of reviewing the rules surrounding products like Delta eight THC, I'm not surprised because I warned everybody that. It really wasn't medicine for the very sick. It was the camel's nose under the tip, and we've not seen all that We're going to see, says Pull County Sheriff Grady Judd. It should be noted Delta eight will likely show up on a drug test. You could also get it, Do you? Why? If you're driving high on it, what we're seeing here today is not the end result. But the next step. And to find another way to Stone America. I'm worried about the health.

cannabis culture my name is Cameron and this is deep roots we're here in Eugene Oregon home of the Ducks a couple hours south of Portland my hometown to visit with Fox Hollow flora they are one of the more popular brands here in this region and in this state let's go explore [Music] it's just beautiful it's it's it is absolutely gorgeous here every day so it means yeah like you know when you come out to the farm and like in the morning especially it'll be like thick that you've got to see a good day when it was nice and clear you know that thick fog that settles in a valley and like you can't see that your hand in front of your face almost and then it burns off and all of a sudden the mountains are there like well yeah there's still people you know that have a big plot of land in a small house and it's you know like our next-door neighbor has been in in our town you know he's like one of the original like and like you can see all the barn to utility like we've actually had this conversation that barn was built by his great grandfather and his grandfather built that one it seemed like the generations of we're talking about this town with like the pioneers and stuff coming out to work and there's like a lot of families that have ties to just generally yeah generations totally cool you guys wonder all this I didn't order this well I we can we I was thinking family-style oh yeah so what other you went to Hendrickson he went to GZ square I saw all the people hanging out easy there's I mean Kesey squares one of those prime examples whether I know I saw a girl painting there today and then they had that kaleidoscope Lake there's definitely a serious serious 60s kind of vibe that just has maintained its presence you know in this town [Music] so we got some like like fried tofu some rice avocado diced tomato no it's friggin delicious dude my wife would relocate to Eugene for this right now why do you get on this enjoy sure I'll carry this welcome to the Fox Hollow flora bedroom thanks man that looks good near we've got all of our mother plants in here and any clones it'll get cut for production rounds we'll see their life from a cutting all the way to a rooted plant in the back of this zone this is our pheno type hunting program all of these are new genetic lines and we do a vigorous seed sprouting program every cycle we will pop approximately 40 seeds and keep a vegetative copy in our mother room right here while they flower out in another zone and we watch their expressions for what is going to become see if it has the potential to become something we're interested in for production sure and once it's harvested and tested it meets your your checklist of criteria then you can come back and say hey not this one but definitely this one this is our new mother this is exactly it's a really collaborative process everyone loves the smoke the taste test of course as soon as the moms are ready to offer the cuts will come in we'll take our cuttings and they'll go into rock wool trays you'll see we don't have any domes which saves us a good bit of time in washing and preparation and we see a really good rooting success 90 to 95 percent without the use of any PG RS we do not use any rooting hormone of any sort whatsoever so this is a very organic process cleanliness is key we 70% isopropyl knot 91 the higher ratings on it actually evaporates it off quicker and needs that water in there to make sure that it really does a total disinfection before we handle any of our plants and the clone program is no exception so Wow these would be the type of roots we'd expect to see after about 10 to 12 days in the tray so we leave propagation where they are being routed in rock wool plugs and we come over here I notice you're making the transition into soil can you tell me a little bit about this right that's where the magic really begins here we are an organic soil producer at heart and this soil is a special blend that we've worked with a local manufacturer Rexie is that custom mixes batches based upon our needs every round this is our latest batch and each time we get a load we'll take a sample send it off to an analytical laboratory you see it's got a nice loft in it yeah all your usual suspects some koi or some peat and perlite and pumice and a the specialness is really in fine tuning the ratios of these to allow for the kind of drainage that we're looking for as well as get the kind of a parts-per-million of certain nutrients in a soil slurry right from the get-go you've got the right porosity but it also comes pre-charged that's right exactly and so this company is really great and they're willing to work with us to the level that they can deliver a product from a dump truck so we don't have to shovel it out of a tote bag we don't have to go through the plastic consumption of two and a half cubic foot bags and ripping and strip in those bags all day long it's really working well for us and you can see it represented in the plant health yeah yeah so I just out of curiosity if your soil is coming pre-charged how quickly do you start hitting it with things like nutrients or compost teas yeah so we have a set of parameters that has been agreed upon with our supplier and so we know that it has enough nutrition to get it going but still young plants are starving to get some oomph and up and go right and so we definitely like to get a compost tea down really quickly and make sure that really waking the soil up is the way we think of it as microbial life the microbial fungal life exactly [Music] now we're in our next vegging zone where the plants will begin to mature and start receiving a lot of their organics including our compost tea for that we need a sugar we decided to go with earth juice they've been around since the late 80s they make a hundred percent cane blackstrap zero sulfur molasses and we've made that a cornerstone of our compost tea brewing program that will really be the food source and fuel to cook up all of the nutrients and make them plant available and that brew we really settled on the earth juice for empirical observation of the results and we can see it both by looking at our final pH of a brew we can look at the total dissolved solids and watch that number increase from where it sits at the beginning of a brew cycle and then where it's gonna land when it's all finished cooking up and so we know how much parts-per-million zuv potentials and food we've extracted in the process of that brew cycle after we see this brew being applied to the plants maybe a week or less later you'll really see the results in in the growth so this compost tea has more than one ingredient the molasses is the fuel to cook down amendments which our favorite supplier is down to earth and they've been around since the 70s here in Eugene Oregon providing home growers and farmers with the amendments that are needed nice yeah I'm super familiar with down to earth I've been using them for a long long time I love their their single part as well as their multi-part fertilizers really great stuff oh good good point on that I wanted to mention you know as a professional grower here we have a lot of time to really nail in small parts of the processes so we will make full use of their lineup and so at home I don't have the time to quite do the same level of process here but I still want to make use of that organic nature approach and so I definitely like their lended molasses amendments water active aeration and voila we have our microbial magic nice and you said that's a once a week sort of treatment that you guys do here that's right yeah your vegetative life cycle looks great your plants look super happy and healthy I think it has a lot to do with the treatment that they've received up to this point and I would love to see how they transition into flower and where they go from here so you said you go to U of O with your music and what's the rest of the art culture like uh uh a lot of street aren't a lot of murals Eugene is a very expressive town the people are very expressive and whatever they decide to make they're gonna put into an art whether it's on the wall or on a bus even we have murals that people do it or even spray painting yeah well you know it's funny I moved to Portland about four years ago and the bumper stickers on the cars in Portland say he'll go back to California but I hear that the bumper stickers and Eugene's they go back to garlic to flirtin yeah and some people they can't make up their minds a little bit but hey that's alright so what about the cannabis culture in cannabis lifestyle yeah this culture is incredible here so much blooming it really is a great thing especially for veterans getting off of the opioids are you a veteran no sir oh okay okay but you have colleagues or something okay absolutely love it those guys yeah that's great man well Fontaine I really appreciate your time [Music] well welcome to the indoor flowering zone take it in dude you have some weight in this room these are gigantic and dense brother we are pushing on today 66 67 today we're looking here at the gumdrop haze they really stack on the weight and and we have to there's some strains we can get away without using trellis on this one is a must this is not one of them I'm sure that I see you've done a little bit of lolli popping along the way we'll let the plant go for maybe the first three weeks before we make any really big pruning moves on it to select out what are going to become the dominant leaders that we'll see developing as these colas we use these grow box HD carts they're really great for being able to plant up in one zone or where our soils at and roll them right into the zone boom boom boom 42 tables in and in less than a day we could have a room like this planted up and ready to start edging up to flower a lot of people use bolted down situations stationary rolling benches yeah but we can really empty this room out down to the cement floor it's got drains in it we can roll in with a scissor lift and do a top down wipe with the sanno solution and it's really made the process quite streamlined to be able to have you know your pot up area your irrigation line area will roll over to our trellising area drop on layers of trellis plants are in no plug right in where they sit into one of these irrigation lines we're not quite set it and forget it but that's about as close as we can get to it and I notice him here like everywhere else you've got the the quest dehumidification yeah these are the not the largest quest unit but definitely critical for maintaining environmental control in a flowering zone we find that we don't need them as much during the first three weeks of flowering when the plants are still small and filling shading their soil but they really are a critical feature of humidity control which is directly really to both being able to drive the performance of the plant as well as prevent certain pathogens and pressures like powdery mildew or bot wretches a bud rot makes sense all right my friend what's next we've got more zones for you to go check out you want to see yeah let's do it [Music] [Applause] [Music] yo guys I'm going into voodoo donuts it's an Oregon institution the line here at the Eugene branch is a little bit shorter than the one in Portland I'll be right back voodoo is not really messing around I think I'm going to go with something a little bit simple some rainbow sprinkles [Music] all right Cameron welcome to our greenhouse this is a next-gen greenhouse it is a 80 light assisted full Sun beautiful building it's actually more of a spaceship than a building we don't even consider this to be a greenhouse we actually call it a poorly insulated indoor zone because the flowers that come out of here are nothing what most people think of as greenhouse flowers got it the lights are on right now but as the Sun comes up and gets a little bit more intense the lights will just slowly start to shut off and won't get full Sun for the rest of the day and it just produces flower that is on par with the best flower in the world sunlight got these HBS's where's your glasses dude I don't have a pair man I'm loving these summer blue optics right here I'll tell you what man I'd be happy to send you a pair of these I was absolutely lovely can you tell me a little bit about what your what your nutrient regimen is oh yeah so we are 110 percent necklace fan here we run necklace for the gods we have always drawn nectar for the gods and actor hashtag absolutely it's all about the bone it's an organ product absolutely it's made actually just a few miles from here you go to dispensaries in Oregon you're definitely gonna see most of the top shelf is gonna be nectar grown flowers I think it's they just are able to produce something that the Terps that come off of the the bone meal are are incredible they make great products in their extremely consistent then you know it's what one of the things that has made this farm what it is so Eric tell me a little bit about the secret to achieving these kinds of results so the secret here is we use this amazing product called car wash we have been working with them for a few years been very generous there's a lot of like hey I got this problem what do you think I could do well actually if we pluck a leaf we'll spray the plant we missed the bruise almost every night it was 100 parts per million go wash we have put it in to our humidifiers so they actually humidifies the entire room with this right and just it just helps the overall health of the plant we put it we have put it in our clone trace in the flower time especially in the fall and the in the winter we have an electromagnetic sprayer we actually fill it in that and it just attaches and it's able to penetrate and it just keeps the plant healthy it's it's literally a money seems like it seems like every time you add it to a new like stage of life it does nothing but benefit absolutely that's awesome man yeah thanks a lot I really appreciate you show me around thanks for coming by and checking out our girl cellar matter the next thing [Music] hey Shawn I've just taken a tour of the facility I've spent some time with Eric I spent some time with Jonathan I know I'd love to learn a bit a little bit about the the packaging process you're going through here so the packaging project that I'm doing right now is we're just gonna wave a flower then we're gonna packed it and these bags we used us Sierra growers bags this products been great for us or a few different reasons one of the biggest ones is just a consistency of the order and the consistency of the care weight we were noticing a lot of variations of a waste between the other bags which was slowing down our process quite a bit we would deliver to the dispensaries yeah what are your pounds is different every one of the pounds of a different weights so they would literally have to dump each one out then it'd been way up from there now they've opened every pound or add out put it back like the integrity of the finished product is in jeopardy as well right and the integrity of the finished product is another reason why we really like to use them because you know we do a lot to ensure we have a quality cured product when it leaves the farm but once it goes out of our hands it's just that's out of our hands so these bags are you know really good for us so once it goes to the shops because it has a little bit of a barrier it has that light resistance to it but it actually will keep our flower in a little bit better shape when it's out of our hands - we're just gonna sure that we can you know keep the quality as best as we can with her product so and these are also a little bit larger than some of the other bags so the flower doesn't get jammed up as much so we've never had a problem with being able to fit a pound in this bag and we've never had a problem with a half pound of that well I mean I would imagine so you've got some pretty dense buds right out there right right well man well I really appreciate you sharing the the info on this back company [Music] so the music scene in Eugene is pretty good we're kind of that we're in between Portland and Seattle very and Seattle so you Momo you know you catch some of these guys on their way through nights you know a Tuesday night night that's really good I saw Steel Pulse viewers show a couple months ago that I haven't seen them in years they were still on it you know it's awesome saying you know guys have any plans there's a lot of people who want good cannabis and organs well-poised to provide it so there's there's a lot of reasons to get this interstate transfer thing underway Oregon cannabis is sort of like California wine you know what I mean it's like it's well-known and it's like right yeah that's exactly what we looked at he's speaking about wine yeah you know California Big Reds definitely like cut it but if you want a good P in the water you come to work we care about good organic everything we want to know what we're going to see man we want to know how its produced so they held us actually to even a higher standard which actually sets up how we need to operate and move forward in a misty also yeah I want to thank you guys for the opportunity to give Foxhall a little bit of publicity it's a really neat thing you guys are doing and all that kind of stuff so thank you guys welcome in Cameron how you doing brother doing great brother from Fox Hollow farms met a bunch of really cool people there want to check out some of their product the one thing they they kept talking about was their sour banana sherbert so I gotta check that sour banana sherbert it's a favorite across the state it's a staple in our store bread bike rocket family farms and DNA genetics this is a Sour Diesel times banana sherbert as definitely what I was looking at I would love to see maybe something else from Fox Hollow and acai gelato times Jack grilled gelato check out the juice box - this one's a purple punch

kind of summarized Travis and James I kind of put Travis is like the man with people he started from kind of the medical side of things his wife had a head injury and he wasn't even in DIC growing cannabis started growing cannabis to benefit her saw incredible benefits to it fast forward a little bit further we went into the forest initiative is something we found it and that is our poster child forest he was going eight seizures a day after our CBD medicine that we created for me is now eight months seizure free you now we're actually dubbed nonprofit we obviously are doing a friendiy

Oscar we need you to film from up there Yeah, come on McDonald's boy Hey! It's for you McDonald's boy We got the hook up You see that? Do you see that? That is the Mango Biche That is the original Verde Limon in Colombia We are  2047 metres above sea level Wow! - 2047?\n- Yeah - You don\u2019t know what awaits you.\n- Okay - Seeds that come from other places  - are sometimes defective \n- Yes because they grow them with fungicides.  Yes - I don\u2019t use fungicides here, the seeds have to be original, natural.\n- He doesn't... He doesn't use fungicides, he doesn't use pesticides  - It's all natural and he says when people bring seeds from other areas they need pesticides and fungicides  They don't do well here - Aha\n- The only ones that do well here are the ones made here So it's a real local landrace And what's the name of it? Is this Mango Biche? Is this Mango Biche? - Yes, Mango Biche\n- Mango Biche The name of that one is Mango Biche  Now they are taking out the seeds. And how long has he been growing? He said phew Did he learn from his father or from his.... Did he learn from his father or from his grandfather? Is it something that is learned from father to son?  Yes, I will be busy being the boss of this whole plantation for generations What did he say? - That like, he is busy with all these mountains here for generations\n- Yeah, yeah, yeah How... How long ago did they start growing marijuana here.. Does he know the history like In what year was marijuana grown in this area?  How many... - When did they first begin cultivating marijuana in this area?\n- Oh... My first marijuana crops were about twenty years ago - But it wasn't me who started it\n- Yes Before me they had already been growing it for a long time He started 20 years ago but there was already a lot  going on before that when he was not a grower There is nothing from the 7 days that we've been here That can beat this This is a full flowering landrace massive field There is like hectares  and it's not full anymore because they have been harvesting already But this is like 2 or 3 hectares like.. Twenty, thirty-thousand plants and then you know that you're going to a find a champion there if you look long enough Verde Limon here we come Original in Colombia - This is the pinnacle of the pussy\n- 2000 2058 metres above sea level  Full of pot - Do you see the Christmas tree down there?\n- yeah, the Christmas tree there? Let's have a look first before we walk up Do you see the really long one there on the left?   - with the never ending cola?\n- Oh yeah.. - Pointing towards us\n- Yeah. Yeah - In the middle of...\n- Yeah That one - Those look fluffy. They're big but they look fluffy\n- Yeah - No, no, there. The Christmas tree in the upper left. \n- Look up at the top on the right - Yeah\n- And there.. - Do you see that long cola sticking out there?\n- yeah, yeah..  - There's 2 or more in the front there\n- And there's another Christmas tree here in the front - 20, 30 metres down\n- Down - Wow! Green mango full, full...\n- Yes, yes, yes, Mango Biche Look at this King  Look at this  - and it's weeks to run\n- Weeks and weeks Wow Yeah This is a fucking good haze indoors Yeah Smell, smell So... This one will run 16 to 20... weeks indoor? - Do you see that?\n- Fuck Fucking good hazes man Does it have many seeds? Yes? Good, we've got seeds Just a few, just a few Right Barrito, is the amount of seeds good? Very well fucking sexed Who was in charge of this crop? I think this plant is very good, look.  Yes, very good This one smells almost like metal. Metallic... - You know when you take the metro \n- Yeah, yeah, yeah - And you have the smell of the \n- The copper or the... grinding metal on metal That's how it smells What are you getting from here? Oh, where's that Christmas tree we saw - when we were walking in earlier\n- Wow this has also got a strange smell  - You carry the seeds, but separately.\n- Yes, yes, yes, yes - Yes, yes, I understand\n- Separate do you understand? Here we have the original Mango Biche and  this is a plant that a lot of people have been looking for  for 25 years but here it is in the mountains of Cauca and our friend Barrito is taking them out  This is a fungus that attacks the plant. Smells like mango  First squeeze and then smell - Oh my god! it smells like lemon grass\n- Yeah bro - It's lovely, lovely, lovely..\n- Okay, I'm going to go for a little walk Simon - Smell the difference between these 2 \n- Let's go look for another few pheno's Where's that Christmas tree we saw  when we walked in - Where do you come from?\n- From The Netherlands - And are you a marijuana grower\n- Yes The plants that they have already harvested and dried we can see how much they have next door So they work the whole year round because it's 12/12 here - I'm Franco - Is Franco\u2019s hat funny? Its laughable.  If I were him I wouldn\u2019t wear it to school.  What do you think about? - How old are you Jose?\n-  Eight years old.  - And do you help with the crops a little? \n- Yes.  And what do you do? Do you help to plant?  Yes, I help to sow. Very well, and how do you plant them?  - I take them...\n- Yes  - I put the solution on them I mix them very well \n- Yes - Then I make a hole in the ground and I put them in it - very good, very good  And when they harvest the crop - Do you also help to clean the plant?\n- Yes. Okay.. - Do you like the plant?\n- Yes - Do you like how smells? \n- Yes And is there more than one type of plant?  Are there different plants?  Yes, what are their names?  We harvest the marijuana The regular ones or which ones?  Yes, the regular ones What is the difference between the two types?  I can't talk about this Okay - Good - Very good.  \n- Amazing Good job! Ask him if his friends also help him Do you have more friends of the same age who help you?  Are there more kids like you who help with this?  I have friends but there are down there . Okay Stay in school, school is very important.  Work with marijuana for the money  but don\u2019t quit school, its very important. - Okay\n- Okay and they had no other choice than to grow cocoa  and to grow marijuana because the flatland was taken away their crops were taken away and they kicked them back into the mountains and this is what happened to the local people and it's good to see that... and to also tell that story... because in our western civilisation... we only hear the story from one side It's always the capitalist sides and we call these people guerillas  We call the terrorists We call them communists  We give them all kinds of names But in the end most all these people in the world are just poor and farmers and surviving on what they're making for themselves and again here is another example  of how hard these people have to suffer because of government things and  - Capitalist\n- You can spend a week... reading books or websites about Colombia and Colombia's history and struggle... and you will not learn what we have learned in a week on the ground here listening to people. Seeing the faces Seeing on their skin what they go through and feeling on our skin the tension in the air or the good vibes in the air You learn a lot from that  as a human being. As a grower It's a green avalanche you can't stop it and we believe it's the right thing to do  We really believe it  - Yeah\n- No... Nobody can tell me that it's  legal or illegal.  It's just the right thing and you know when it's the right thing I have no nails Right We got him Let's see... Shit dude. That's... - A Colombian tick\n- Look at that fucker. Yep A Colombian tick with a whole lot of THC  from your blood Okay for the final... This thing has been on me for 2 days Okay and I go to Simon being like dude help me out here man like I don't know what to do like am I fucked here? and he's like no bro. No it's cool I get like 10 a day and I just kinda just leave them on man like 10 a day Like oh well you know Fuck, that's great advice man I'll just leave it on  What did he ask you? Like don't the guys get offended when  when you call them gorilla  You know like. What guys? Who did we call a gorilla? - Yeah the Big guys? What the fuck?\n- It's a little bit disrespectful. No? I didn't look at shit.  I took the plane  - I am here with a fucking camera\n- Look, look - Do you think I am looking at wikipedia for one week?\n- But everybody forgets... - If I come here it's...\n- The guy is speaking English for only one year - If I come here and there is a Tyrannosaurus rex\n- Hey - I would believe it. No problem\n- But also if you only speak English for one year Don't forget You see... Check it out dude Those records and those tapes that compose that wall there are from the same years that the  Punta Roja and the Colombian Gold became famous  - An extension on the \u201cplan Colombia\u201d came out. \n- Please The 'Colombia plan' was the program that the government launched when Andres Pastrana was president,  an eradication plan to supposedly improve the quality of life  of indigenous people and peasants. And we realized that this was not really the idea of the 'Colombia Plan'.  The true idea of plan was to create military bases, high mountain military bases. - Is it to control the territory? \n- Yes, it is to control the territory  and that has affected us a lot  because there are daily battles and in the end we civilians suffer the consequences who have nothing to do with the armed conflict.  The Colombian plan has followed a control of illicit crops it has been a military control a military takeover in the entire department of Cauca,  and that has been the conflict we have had to deal with So we peasants say that these crops that we call illicit but are really subsistence crops for us . Because there are nothing else? and you don\u2019t see here only marijuana and coca, you can also see here coffee, corn, banana, yucca.  Here the big problem we have is land tenure Land ownership here is tenacious because  whoever owns the land has only 30 percent For example,  there are people who have 6 arable lands  but have 8 children It is not enough.  The land does not grow  but the family does. - Very interesting. \n- That is why we tell the national  and international government that  we want to change in the productive part but first we have to change land tenure because there really   is no where to cultivate an expansion of territory is needed. And that only the government can do, right? Yes, that\u2019s why we say we need a development plan a life plan and a survey for know  how many of us are in our municipality, who doesn\u2019t have land who does. Who has health and a house because none of us have a good house. We all live in houses made of wattle and daub which fell, destroyed by armed conflict. And that has been the big problem that we have here in the department of Cauca,  land tenure. I sincerely want this to change because   the only thing we are living now is a military occupation  and there is nothing do to about this. Our children have no options  So some of then go to the army  because they have nothing to do  or go in others ways. - Looking for other jobs?\n- Yes, here aren\u2019t many opportunities, many people leave here For this reason we ask the government for a change not just for Cauca\u2019s department, for all Colombia. I honestly think that the government should look  at the interest of future generations  our children\u2019s children.  What will happen to this conflict  that we are living today? When we die, what are we going to leave for our children?  Many people think future is coming  but future is part of what we make before. That\u2019s why we want to government to realise  who it is really owns the land.  - It's a human right.\n- It's a human right - It's a constitutional right\n- Yeah, is a constitutional right   Here is my friend if you want to ask something else for your movie.

LAST WEEK IT WAS ANNOUNCED THE SHORTAGE WILL LAST UNTIL NEXT YEAR. MARIJUANA MEDICATION MEDICAL REPORTER DINA BAIR HAS A WARNING. A NEW STUDY RAISES THE RED FLAG ABOUT CANNABINOID INTERACTING WITH PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS WITH THE RENEWED LEGALIZATION OF RECREATIONAL POT AND THE GROWING POPULARITY OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA. PENN STATE RESEARCHERS SET OUT TO SEE HOW THAT WOULD IMPACT DRUGS AMERICANS WERE ALREADY TAKING. THEY FOUND 57 PROBLEMS. THE REMARKABLE FINDING WAS THAT WE IDENTIFIED 57. DRUGS THAT HAVE A NARROW THERAPEUTIC INDEX AND THAT MEANS THE RANGE OF AFRICA SEE TO TOXICITY IS VERY NARROW AND THE PRESENCE OF CANNABINOIDS CHEMICALS FOUND IN CANNABIS COULD TIP THE SCALE TO THE DARK SIDE WHICH ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS PATIENTS TAKING BLOOD THINNERS LIKE COMMIT IT TURNS OUT THAT IF SOMEONE WERE ON THAT MEDICATION WERE SUDDENLY THE AD THE HIGH DOSE OF CAN AVENUE AID NO MATTER WHAT THE SOURCE THEY'RE AT RISK FOR INTERFERING WITH THE METABOLISM OF THAT. COUMADIN AND HAVE AN ADVERSE REACTION MORE THAN 8 MILLION AMERICANS ARE CURRENTLY TAKING BLOOD THINNERS. AND MANY ARE OLDER SEEKING MEDICAL MARIJUANA FOR PAIN RELIEF OR CBD OIL WITHOUT KNOWING THE COMBINATION COULD BE DISASTROUS WOMEN STATES LEGALIZE RECREATIONAL WHEN THEY RECORD OR THEY LEGALIZE MEDICAL MARIJUANA. WHAT'S NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IS THE FACT THAT IT MAY INTERFERE WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DRUGS OR CARDIAC SOME AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH AN ANESTHETIC CALLED PROPOFOL ANESTHESIOLOGISTS NOTICE THE INTERACTION IN SURGICAL PATIENTS FOLKS THAT ARE HEAVY USERS OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA FORCES TAKE MORE PRO FOOTBALL TO SEDATE HER SURGERY, THE LIST IS LENGTHY INCLUDING BLOOD PRESSURE DEPRESSION, BIRTH CONTROL FIRE OI AND CANCER MEDICATIONS OFFERING GUIDANCE. PENN STATE RESEARCHERS SAY PATIENTS TAKING DOZENS OF DRUG SHOULD BE CLOSELY MONITORED IF THEY USE CANNABINOIDS. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. DOCTORS DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY MAKE MEDICATION DECISIONS PEOPLE DON'T DISCLOSE. WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE USING ILLICIT RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA OR AS YOU SAY CBD OIL THAT THEY CAN GET OVER THE COUNTER OR MEDICAL MARIJUANA THEY DON'T THINK OF THAT AS A MEDICATION NECESSARILY AND I DON'T WANT TO PAINT IT THAT IT'S NECESSARILY A BAD THING IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO MONITOR AND BE CAREFUL THOUGH THEY ARE VERY BIOACTIVE THE VERY BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES THAT GIVE MEDICAL MARIJUANA POWER. ALSO DIMINISH OR ENHANCE THE EFFECTS OF OTHER DRUGS MUCH LIKE A DRUG TO DRUG INTERACTION. BUT EVEN CBD CAN CAUSE AN ISSUE WE'VE SHOWN THAT ALL CBD OILS ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL. AND SO THE FDA FOR INSTANCE JUST HAD TO RECALL A CBD OIL PREPARATION THAT HAD TOO MUCH LEAD IN. SO I WOULD CAUTION PEOPLE AGAINST USING OVER THE COUNTER CBD OIL FOR INSTANCE AND IF THEY ARE USING WHETHER CBD OIL OR RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA JUST DISCLOSED THAT TO YOUR DOCTOR. SO THAT THEY CAN PLAN HOW THEY'RE GOING TO TREAT YOU WITH OTHER MEDICATIONS. THE RESEARCHERS SAY THEY PLAN TO ROUTINELY UPDATE AND ADD TO THE DRUG INTERACTION", "soAFc7NAikU": "what is up ladies and gentlemen boys and girls it's your boy goblin and today we are coming in with basically the marijuana grammys it might as well be we are coming in with my favorite strains of 2020 the ultimate list now listen i know during 2020 i dropped a video of my top five strains but that wasn't the best trains of the year that was just like some of my recent favorite strains this video is actually the top five best trains that i smoked in 2020 out of all of them i went through my whole camera roll i went through receipts dude i went through every single strain i could remember realistically if i didn't remember it it wasn't going to make this list anyways and man we got some heaters trains here hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you do also get your hands on some goblin merch what are you waiting on baby hey it's looking to fly it's looking fresh a december was the biggest month we've ever had for merch so i just want to thank you guys really a lot for the support dude i appreciate you guys if you guys are considering copying some merch go check it out man even if you don't have any intent of buying just click on the website and take a look dude even that just helps me out i appreciate you guys for the love thank you for making merch possible for me love you all let's dive right into it so i want to say as well real quick that these strains are in no particular order right i want to make that very clear uh this is not like a number five number one you know it's just like okay there's five strains and you can kind of determine which one of these you think should be number one and also for most of these i do have pictures but i couldn't find pictures for all of them but the vast majority of these i have pictures not that like three out of the five either way let's dive into it so the first strain of the year that i'd like to mention here is a very interesting one and this is a strain called candy land and this is one that i picked up right after i got my medical card this past year right a lot of these strains actually i think three of them i got after my med card and then two of them i'd gotten uh they're actually not one of them i've gotten before my med card and one of them wasn't even from a dispensary at all but we'll we'll get to that so either way candyland is our first strain here this is a cross of granddaddy perp and platinum haze and i'm not gonna lie this is probably the sexiest weed in this video today this [ __ ] is gorgeous dude look at how purple look at all the trichomes the pistols oh my god honestly as soon as i opened the container my jaw nearly dropped dude you know even for the top top shelf you know medical best product i can find in the state of illinois this was you know head and shoulders looks wise at least above most of you know if not all of it and the smoke matched up too you know what's crazy about this is i remember this [ __ ] was only like 18 you know and i actually i smoked this when i was up north for court with a couple buddies of mine you know i brought this up north we rolled up a blunt of this on three heads and we all got sent dude we put like a gram and a half and a blunt we were all high as [ __ ] dude it was spectacular dude some of the hardest hitting bud a really really nice balanced high you know you're not really feeling too much of a head or body high it's just you're stoned all over the place dude i loved how candyland made me feel some of the hardest hitting bud and it was only at 18 and a half percent if i remember 18 or something like that so it wasn't even that high of percentage but it's all about the terps dude hey candyland coming in with the first mention dude this train was sexy honestly made me horny let's get to the next one all right gamers coming in with the next one the next spot on the list here is a phenomenal strain this is one that i got fairly recently and we've been dabbing this one on stream lately it's called pineapple upside down cake now up until very recently like maybe two or three weeks ago so we got this at the very end of 2020. i'd never even heard of this strain i had no clue what it was it is a cross of pineapple train wreck and cookie monster dear god do i wish i still had pictures of this because holy [ __ ] dude this strain makes me horny honestly the only head high i've ever had that matches this train the just immediate smack in the face almost like someone grabbed my skull and just shook the hell out of it is jack hair however the hell you say that hair some people say it herrera i don't care either way that [ __ ] [ __ ] slaps that's a great sativa this is another one where it's listed as a hybrid if you google it but i'm telling you right now it's sativa dominant like no other dude this is such a great head high and normally i'm a really big indica guy right a lot of you guys have been watching me for a while you know hey i affiliate with the indicas you know sometimes honestly in my opinion sativa is better for going to work indica you know that's like 3am i'm in bed my meat's kind of hard but i can't get it up enough and i need to smoke just to finish you know that's what i'm kind of talking about right but lately dude sativas have been slapping dude i don't know what it is but maybe it's because i changed up my sleep schedule and i've been waking up earlier but 2020 was really the year sativa for me dude i really kind of learned to appreciate it as well as my indicas you know before like there was times where like i would just always pick indica over sativa no matter what but this past year i really kind of came to appreciate you know my my sativa strains and this being definitely my favorite of them of course it's got something with trainwreck anything with train wreck involved in it is gonna slap you in the face dude but this strain was just madness dude pineapple upside down cake look it up dude if you can get your hands on this please do dude it's amazing and also this was not only one of the best head highs i had of the year but by far the best tasting concentrate i had all year it tasted like cake dude it was so good it was delicious but either way let's move on to the next one coming in next we got hey listen man this is a real fancy one dude this is one that you can't get out of the illinois dyspo we're bringing in the zerbert by backpack boys now earlier in this year i had a good friend of mine who was kind enough to hook me up with some california stuff you know and i was like dude absolutely i got to try out some some jungle boys there was some can of teak i think the stream was blueberry cruffin which i loved it smelled like cinnamon it was amazing there was also i tried out white runts which was spectacular but that didn't quite make it on the list it like this did right it was going to be either white runs or zerbert but zerbert just blew any other strain i tried from that little batch of cali stuff way out of the water this weed was insane so hey little mini story here all right so when i got my hands on this i was hanging out with your boy bill you know i was also with the mrs you know miss goblin and i was with my buddy brad right we were all kicking in at brad's house and we're chilling out and we're in his garage and we just rolled up a blunt of this zerber you know we matched on some pack bill had also bought some cali stuff so i rolled up a blunt of zerbert and bill rolled up a blunt of i don't remember what it was it was i think it was some jungle boys sour apple killer i think it was either way it was good weed right so we had two blunts in the air and i remember we we spark up this zerbert and it gets to me i was second in roto on it right and it gets to me and i hit this [ __ ] and it was it was immediately immediately it felt like i got [ __ ] tranquilized dude my whole body dude just immediately got sedated i was like dude i just do gay like what is this this is crazy like i haven't felt this kind of high in a long time and it was like it it almost felt like i was feeling a placebo effect but i knew i wasn't i was like dude this is crazy and we kept smoking it we all got so stoned and later that day right you know we went back inside we all played some cards you know we all played some poker in brad's basement we came back upstairs and later we only smoked the blood of the zerber nothing else we all got sent four heads one blunt everyone was situated for ages dude honestly out of everything on this list this is probably the hardest hitting and longest lasting of the packs right this [ __ ] smoked dude it felt like i took a fat dab of it every time i took a rip of the blunt it was crazy not only that but the bag appeal on this [ __ ] was beautiful dude it just looks so good i loved it dude zerbert phenomenal get your hands on it if you can let's move on to the next one coming in with the next one on the list is a kind of a little bit of a unique one here this strain is called bear dance and this is actually a cross of three different things here right which i'm showing you guys now with the label that came from my dispo this is a cross of pure kush ubekistan hash uzbekistan ubek is saying i don't is the z silent i don't know how to say that word dude either way some hash and snow cap which is a very well known and very popular strain anything with snow cap in it's really cool snow caps something that i i didn't really know anything about that strain prior to 2020 but this past year i've come to realize like if you see snow cap in it it's kind of like a almost like a train wreck effect or like you got to try that strain you know like it's probably going to slap right bear dance is crazy one of the best smelling and looking concentrates i tried this year and the terps on this were crazy dude flavor galaxy i'll tell you what it was absolutely delicious it was sweet almost like a lemon lime flavor if that even is a good way to describe it it was very tangy very sweet you know i got my taste buds all to weaken and it went down

cannabis use in pregnant women and an incidence of autism the study found that children whose mothers reported using marijuana during pregnancy were more than one and a half times more likely to have autism than children who were not exposed researchers looked at 2200 ontario women who gave birth between 2007 and 2012 and said that they used cannabis while pregnant the research was done by the ottawa hospital chill born ontario and the university of ottawa joining me now with more is dr doreen alchar co-author of the study good morning thank you so much doctor for being with us good morning first of all give us your thoughts on what the research found sure so you summaried summarize it nicely but our research was really looking at maternal cannabis and neurodevelopmental outcomes after having looked at it previously in obstetrical outcomes last year and we noted the increase in the diagnosis of autism that was made in children born to mothers who had consumed cannabis during the time of our study period which is about 10 years when you look at the follow-up period of when they were born and then to how long we followed them so were the researchers more interested in looking at why autism occurs or what happens if mothers use cannabis during pregnancy what was your starting point yeah so for this study in particular it was around neurodevelopmental outcome we've previously looked at what happens to pregnancies and we found an increased rate of preterm birth and some other obstacle outcomes which were affected like birth weight and other placental issues um so we we generated more work from that existing uh interest uh to now look at the feed the the babies and the infant outcomes so this is focused on the neural development and brain so autism was one but we also looked at other intellectual learning disabilities and found less of a significant association so there are health warnings out there about using cannabis during pregnancy is your feeling that those warnings are not being followed it's hard to know right now and as you mentioned yes health canada society of obstetrician gynecologist we still recommend against use because we don't have enough evidence to talk to our mothers about what it could mean i think that we probably are seeing similar rates and maybe a little bit more upfront patients telling us about the use because of legalization so that we may be seeing however we haven't looked at the numbers yet but we plan on doing that now to see what the numbers are post-legalization in 2017. right i guess i'm wondering why people why pregnant women would use cannabis is it because it is legal now people think that it may not be um harmful during pregnancy to their baby so certainly that's one there's always the impression that if something is legal it may be okay but we know that that's certainly not the problem the issue with other substances like alcohol and smoking so i use the same analogy um as in terms of why they use it certain moms do need to use it because they've used it for other medical issues for pain management or uh dealing with other symptoms so certainly we have to be aware of and helping those uh patients with other uh uh you know other medications that they will need to have to deal with their uh medical issues as well as there's some people who use it recreationally still as well as for potential help with nausea so this was a big study what do you hope to do with the results uh yeah so this is one of the largest studies and more recent times published we hope that this will help sensitize you know and help our care providers counsel their patients about some of the risks and certainly we know we need to do more studies and continue looking at the cohorts of patients as this was from 20 2007 to 2012 so we need to look at more recent data and continue doing linkage and we also need to look at whether timing of use and other substances affect the outcomes as well as different types of cannabis as you know there's many different forms that can be used doctor thank you so much really appreciate you being with us this morning on this study very important", "E7MvGH0yMNU": "disclaimer in no way shape or form does the information of this video replace medical advice this video's purpose is to shed light on cbd and how it could be used to treat anxiety amongst many other remedies and medications out there is school stressing you out your job giving you anxiety or can you just not fall asleep at night well this just may be the video for you the use of cbd could be an effective and safe way to alleviate anxiety stress and improve your sleep but what exactly is cbd cbd is short for cannabidiol which is one of two compounds found in cannabis the other one being tetrahydrocannabine or thc for short what you may notice is that the chemical formulas of cbd and thc are almost chemically identical but they both elicit different reactions within the body the chemical structure of thc that is found in marijuana is what gives you the feeling of being high while the chemical structure of cbd which is also found in marijuana doesn't give you the feeling of being high but affects the body in different less noticeable ways cbd is known to elicit relaxing and soothing effects without the feeling of intoxication that is usually associated with marijuana marijuana and hemp are two types of cannabis plants marijuana contains a high concentration of thc with some cbd this contrasts kemp as hemp is bred to remove the majority of its thc content leaving the plant as only a good source of cbd this means you cannot get high off hemp derived cbd oils but how do we know that cbd is effective in treating anxiety one study outlined an experiment done on 65 men and women that were classified to be obese majority of the participants were in their 20s to 40s in this double-blind experiment some participants were given hemp-derived cbd oil or an olive oil placebo daily for six weeks alongside their normal diet throughout the six weeks the participants were asked about their feelings of stress as well as other factors including their overall well-being anxiety levels and sleep quality participants were also asked to complete physical activity on a regular basis the study found that overall participants who were given hemp-derived cbd were coping better with stress experiencing improved sleep quality and quantity and showed improved pleasure in life amongst many other benefits so how have people been using cbd cbd oils and creams are currently being used topically to reduce pain and inflammation teas coffee blends and even cbd infused beer help with anxiety relieve stress and help with sleep cbd has also been used to help with withdrawal symptoms panic attacks insomnia depression as well as ptsd although there is little to no side effects of cbd use as well as no proven tendencies for abuse or dependence potential cbd is still relatively new on the market cbd studies are still in the preliminary stages as long-term effects are still unknown so please before trying anything new we recommend you speak to your family doctor and inquire about cbd and find what works best for you if you are interested in learning more about the use of cbd research currently being done or the science behind it please refer to the

"Xr293EcpDFE": "early on a really close family friend of my father's daughter was was targeted and murdered in the 80s it was a big case I'd probably had nervous breakdowns before that that was the first time I can remember like oh this is a nervous breakdown it makes you realize that it's like no matter how good the people around you are she can fall apart my name is dr. Siri Satnam Singh and I'm a licensed therapist this week I'm sitting down with a man who is battling depression and deeply-rooted shame today we will witness him confronting his fast this is Damian Abraham [Music] [Music] so your past I know nothing about it yes mother and father what was all about I grew up upper-middle class middle class I guess my mom was a flight attendant my dad was in advertising my mom had a heart attack at 40 and had to stop being a flight attendant and then my they'd been divorced by that point we had a terrible stepfather okay and he did it kind of everything wrong and I think the other thing that ultimately was the shattering thing was he was such a moralist right like this is around the time Bill Clinton Monica Lewinsky and I can remember sitting at the dinner table and he was like they should throw him in jail like Bo claw it was this very like I didn't get along with them politically at that point but then just to kind of have this like it's like sort of ultimate alpha male vision of this is what you should do you should work hard you know I'm a pilot but I also had another job filling vending machines I do this and I do that you know and I'm raising you children to be polite and use manners and respect people you know he had a another life that he was dealing with too so but he it wasn't a great dude yeah and then it's you know it's the things that we're not aware of that really impact our lives so the moralist stepdad I'm sure you had impulses that you wanted to act out that you could not act out because this is not good that's unconscious shaming yeah yeah talk about that some of the impulses you may have had that he said ah dinner so much anxiety is stress around family dinner you know it was really important that we all sat down together and then it was there are a lot of rules you know like how we set the table you know and how we conducted ourselves at that table and it wasn't like we're sitting in a formal dining room dressed up this was just that the dinner table the breakfast table and I think there's a lot of stress around that it was like a shells like it was like a time bomb sitting across the dinner table from this person like what little inconsistency have I forgotten now I have I made that I wasn't supposed to that's gonna set this guy off and it was never like a physical abuse but it was like not talking to you for like two or three days cuz you ran down the stairs it was a very bizarre you see how you internalize that change yeah yes he shamed you yeah and you internalized the shame that because I put the fork this way and it should have been that way that I am not good looking at your videos the word that came out to me is raised it's not just anger on the stage it's rage definitely yes and rage is a ramification of dealing with shame and a number of artists it's not a through-line but this concept that you have been chained unconsciously that you know I'm not good enough and you defend against it divided because a star everything's still bare I am invisible down here on the same level no one should see me because I'm bad so you defend against it and come to a level to where everybody will see me on stage it's it's another form of dealing with shame exhibitionism the where I will dance so fast and seeing so loud and be so flamboyant and be so grand that no one will see that I feel less than no absolutely it's like it's it's a it's an armor yeah you know like you put it on and you could be that other person yeah so you haven't identified from my perspective up to the day consciously that you are shame-based talk about your experience as a teenage boy here it is dad is gone at when did dad leave dad left when I was grade five so I think I would have been about 12 my dad was British he moved back to England moved to Los Angeles for a while then moved back to Toronto so at the age of 16 I went straight edge which is like a way to be sober you know and identify with something in your sobriety which is as a kid it was so important to me you know so I could be straight edge which meant I didn't do drugs I didn't train I didn't do any of that stuff and I I was part of this thing and then I did that you know and I straighted stop me being important to me after a couple years but I still called myself straightedge just as you know shorthand for it well let's not fail you coming to the get room now yes so where do you feel like you feel is a child I don't know I guess it like I guess like I had struggled in school in the very beginning grade one I was diagnosed with a learning disability that I've kind of come to realize was actually my exam anxiety disorder at that age kind of manifesting itself I would have panic attacks learning new concepts so anxiety around I know failure anxiety around what else I'm talking to a fat kid trust me there's a lot to get okay let's work through it being a young teenager preety can do is perceived as housing having breasts you know yeah I was like you know I had to go swimming with these people you know and and it was a physical shaming you know I think it was more like a body shaming thing it was I was the fat kid I want you to have empathy for the child that experienced that I think that's the one that we need to bring into the session the one that maybe on the stage and you punk-rock the one who maybe unconsciously showing up in places I made a name for myself by having a crazy live show early on it would be bloody and it would be chaotic smashing you know and I was big I was huge at that time I look at that now that was a panic attack like I was just like going up there and freaking the on stage and like hurting myself you know I was definitely reckless in my behavior and that's a panic attack and you know it's almost like to get to that to play that fool on stage every night to be that person for people you almost have to get to that panic attack stage what is coming to the space so far is fear mm-hmm anxiety of course that you're trying desperately to stay controlled and I think that's key to the panic attack and the nervous breakdowns to where you're trying to desperately stay in control of these feelings and then you can and then he explode and what are some of the symptoms you have when you have a panic attack like a lack of joy you know just a general like it's it's it's all gone I would just be like tossing and turning at night just worried about anything everything and I think the problem is being in a band it just hyper accentuates those feelings because it's like you're your kind of you live and die based on what someone else thinks about you and I think that's probably why I'm hesitant writing lyrics for the new record you know it's probably why I'm hesitant to to do other things that I want to do creatively is because you don't want to fail on it so what are we gonna do with this critic stepfather was a critic yes the teachers were a critic yes your friends were a critic yes and you still haven't escaped it that you have these musical critics what are you gonna do with that that's a the big question I guess yes I think the critic is inside of you so you're working all day with these shames although you see what I'm saying in different ways it's yeah there's a lot of shame but I also like the other piece of it I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing without this you know without my mental health whatever it is that I've dealt with I wouldn't be fortunate to be able to live this dream you know like I kind of manifested my own destiny in that way yeah well you have something you have obviously some self-love there too but that shame is in there with the self love so it's like toxic cocktail yeah yeah yeah so this reminds me of Anna Freud where she talked about when we are aggressed against that eventually we aggress against ourselves yeah we we no longer need the perpetrator to beat us over the head now we incorporate that aggression against ourselves and that's what you're doing you were beat into it you gotta be perfect you got to be perfect thus I'm not good enough so plus I can't write though I'm travelling all over the world and being recognized yet I can't write on my new album because I'm not good enough so we have to release the inner critic we gotta let him go I'm experiencing you as a man who's very present with his feelings attributions and I think that you have a lot of feelings that that come all the time all the time and really fast you and you are having challenge processing them as quickly as they come I find it like depending on the situation it's hard to let that River flow you know like I think every situation where it's hard to let it flow first day of this tour was like I get I would arrive in the city we pick up the van pick up all the gear drive to the show this case it was Phoenix Arizona which needs five hours in that van in five hours we don't we're not like a band of friends you know there's like bands you hear about them they're like we're all buddies that's not us like why do we fly to LA to pick up a van to then drive to Arizona and then drive all the way back the next day thus spending 12 hours in a tiny little van together that we already hate being in each other with beside each other inside of it and were then we're gonna have to drive all the way up to Vancouver in a van with each other yet for some reason we thought an extra five hours was worth saving a few dollars so phone's idea that to you oh hi yes do you feel I'll be pissed I just think how they feel oh I do this is identification with the aggressor your stepfather a Mian that's not good what are you doing you should never do this so now you have identified with the aggressor and you have become him I don't like the person I become like you know I don't like the way I treat people you know and I find like I don't like the way I treat myself I don't like the way yeah like I it's cool well I should say whenever you speak to your sauna to your van gesture to your wife or whomever that you become aware that they have the potential to reacting to me and not doing what I would like to happen because I'm shaming right I find it I find I can get that place after I've lost my temper and I'm almost like I can't get out of that place after I've lost my temper you know where I'm less like there's almost like too much empathy at that point like I feel so bad for what I did to them yeah so how can we this is just behavioral stuff now so can you be aware of something of that that that's something that you really would like to change that's right yeah I definitely I can see it's like the panic reaction you know I'm like I was quick to fight you know when I was growing up as a younger kid you know it was just like a trigger temper you know and it was just no I'm and it's been trying to get these emotions in check you know it's work what's the word yeah definitely it's work yeah I would love like to be able to get away from that and do away with it I found cannabis is my closest the closest time to that but before I had cannabis oh my god let's go there my early 20s I was seeing a woman her family went through unbelievable violence I had a breakdown came back to Toronto got put on paxil Bute Hren ativan a bunch I can't probably remember the names of I've tried them all and then about six years ago after ten years of these drugs I was in Holland that cycled off my pills again because I didn't like the side-effects felt the panic kind of coming on weed was everywhere turned someone in my band smoking weed so can I try it everyone looked at me like I was lost my mind cuz I'd never done it and immediately it just something happened I could look at myself outside of the anxiety it allowed me to slow down the emotions the flood of emotions and kind of take them as they came and at first I was I was you talk about shame imagine being strain it and identifying is a sober person and the strength than that for 15 years and then trying to drink or in my case smoke weed a lot of strange kids go through this weird thing when they break when they break edge so I felt weird guilt about it at first but then I realized it was working for me and then the weight loss came I was drinking like 6 liters of soda a day you know things like that like now I don't drink soda um but that was cannabis that allowed me to look at that and be like that's gross that's a lot of sugar no one should drink that much sugar and I don't know it I really gained a lot of perspective you know so you have found something that works for you that has been legalized yes it's a I find there opee and it certainly the cannabis have been the best ways to kind of to deal with stuff yeah and it takes time to release this this stuff Shane is the worst feeling that I have come up with in my clients it's just the face because it takes away your love of yourself it goes to the bone it's to the core I think I told a lot more shame about my mental health in my early 20s once I was diagnosed and I was put on those prescriptions but I think later once I kind of gained control of my mental health and gained a little bit of power over it I find working on it it makes me feel stronger this is something that's challenging and it's just let's say it's gonna be challenging for you to overcome this oh it's definitely challenging to overcome this yes and to be easy on yourself but yet if you continue to give it conscious focus it will change it was shift [Music] have you ever done breath of fire I don't think so so you inhale this time he goes out thanks how it goes in exhale close your eyes this is the center of self I want you to open your mouth wide this is the stuff that really transforms you from one session to the next I want you to see yourself there's a little boy at home at school with friends I want you to see when that little boy was unconsciously or consciously shamed don't judge it just experience it and when we experience it in this time in space we are releasing the shame these repressed memories see that lo vuoi how he was shamed for house with his learning disability with his weight at home at the dinner table don't run away from it get into the breath of paranoia let the fear come up don't run away from it the deeper you go the freer you be when you leave here and this safe space feel it [Laughter] inhale exhale let it go let it go let it go let it go what's in the room right now what are you feeling right now having gone through this process I feel for the first time an awareness of how deep shame goes and that the fact that the shame that I experience internally isn't necessarily the result of negative things that were put on me it might have just been innocent critiques of people's you know best intentions I think I also you know like maybe like a little bit of permission for myself to try and enjoy this a little bit more because it's it's it's fleeting and it would be fun to enjoy it while it's happening as opposed to regret it okay okay well end our session with angel cards and I just throw it to the unknown and let the unknown communicate to my client and see if you get some communication from the unknown from spirit I came in to myself we're gonna share it share it okay commitment okay what does that mean to you I think for me it's gonna be commitment to improving you know my mental and spiritual health you know like in emotional health - I guess - as well but bringing commitment to kind of like working on that you know and then it is something you have to be committed to and work out every day it only gets better when they work at it every day so that's what I you know take for that one well good good good good well I think our sessions come to an end and it's been a great session but thank you very much for having me thank you for being here [Music] you", "d2SkQ_yL8CA": "now then it's a campaign that this morning is followed very closely last summer we were first joined on the show by Charlotte Caldwell whose son Billy has to be epilepsy or Charlotte was pleading with the government for a special prescription to license and distal cannabis oil for her son you cannot take away an antiepileptic medications you cannot stop it abruptly yeah it has to be weaned in the first done things so I'm sayin tune that chord this morning please give me back at police medication today because he needs his medication this is not anything to do with recreational but you're just silent as death warrant so please give it back he's not a doctor Philip he's a minister so he should be listening to the doctor in Canada well after the success of Charlotte's campaigning the law was changed and last week marked one year since the perception of medical cannabis was legalized in the UK but despite the change in the law many doctors are still hesitant to give out the drug and we're joined this morning by doctor Javed Abdel Moneim to separate the fact from the fiction good morning new you so first of all I guess we should understand that what what is it in this cannabis that's supposed to help medicinally well there are there are lots of compounds in cannabis it's a whole plant but the the ones that people believe are active are called cannabinoids there are two that are most important it's CBD you may have heard of that and there's another called THC now that's the one that can cause a high it can cause ill effects but CBD is the one when in combination people think could be the ticket so what is the current law in the UK well the court as you said it changed that just about a year ago law says that specialists not GPS that's the important part specialists can prescribe cannabis based medicinal products only if other treatment options have failed and if they feel there really is a benefit so there must be NHS guidelines in place for prescribing cannabis what do they say yes now the guidelines are there the guidelines are very clear medicinal cannabis can be prescribed only when clear published evidence of benefits exists and other treatment options have been exhausted now those are in draft but that's pretty clear it makes it very very difficult to for example you're certainly not going to get it from your GP right but you've you visit this is the cannabis with the THC in it the because CBD you can you can you can buy absolutely it's available over-the-counter CBD that's that's deregulated in that sense and THC is still the part that's illegal but the you know the evidence over which works in what combination from which diseases is that is what's still not why aren't the doctors prescribe why is it not being prescribed it's a combination of things firstly that guidance it's pretty clear if you if you haven't exhausted other treatments you shouldn't be doing this secondly it called for more evidence there really isn't enough evidence out there that's utterly clear about one agent versus another and thirdly its infrastructure for example Billy had it prescribed but it cost him a thousand pounds a month the import licenses the customs the the protocols for moving the substances into the UK just aren't that so it sounds like the evidence in the infrastructure needs to catch up really with what the laws say and the THC but just explain why is that so helpful what is what what is it so there you go all it's a THC III say it as an acronym it's the high causa that's not necessarily as helpful it's the CBD that is and no one knows how or why and it's certainly the CBD that has more suggestion of help in chronic pain in epilepsy that's difficult to treat and so forth but there are also people who wish that both should be used in combination you say there is a lack of evidence is there evidence ongoing are we actually looking at this now because it's essentially it's a natural product absolutely and it's been around for thousands of years so there was a call for evidence into eight research areas there is soon to be announced potentially a trial a project looking at about 20,000 patients to follow them over the next two years and that's been brought about by a group of patient advocates a certain charity and actually a cannabis medicine or cannabis production company and and and the NHS group that looks over this has said it would be great to have this evidence so watch this space and is that currently sort of a range of conditions that we know that it's helpful for absolutely I mean it's actually licensed in the NHS for use in after chemotherapy it's also licensed for severe epilepsy but again this is only when other usually licensed medicines have been exhausted and the patients aren't getting the benefit from what's already around and more commonly used now people who buy the CBD over-the-counter they say it's useful for sleep for anxiety for potentially for appetite people use it as creams for their skin a whole host of myriad of ailments but that's slightly different that over-the-counter sort of you do they work let me know they are they good the evidence just isn't there but does that mean they don't work I mean cuz there's a lot of online evidence of sort of testimonial where people will say oh my god this has changed my life so it's that only count that I will listen I'm I'm I'm listen if it's CBD not known to cause harm right if it works for you placebo or otherwise I'm quite happy because it can get very expensive but I mean it depends sort of the the what you're buying and how much is in it and this that and the other because it varies and I think that's the problem that people find they're going doing well I don't know what's right for me I don't want to buy exactly and the over-the-counter CBD is actually only a food regulation type item so that isn't thoroughly controlled like a medicine sometimes you don't even know what's in the bottle to you mention that it's this is this has been ongoing for thousands of years people have taken cannabis for ailments for obviously for other reasons why is it taking so long for this and there there are mums and dads desperately concerned about their children why is it taking so long I think there's a social cultural eminent element doctors just aren't used to prescribing this one too the evidence just isn't there the last guidance that came out in August really did almost put a hold on it but that's going to deliver potentially next week they'll finalize the guidance I don't think it'll change much extremely upset about I'd be happy to be wrong yeah thank you thank you I'm coming in today you", "WGofvxnAhV8": "um you're gonna have to smoke a lot of

in fact canopy growth is shutting down some greenhouses in canada but now as you say they're facing two threats from um besides market pressures one a lot of cannabis equipment whether from lab

and john trauben of altitude investment management that's a fun with investments in over 20 cannabis companies and while we haven't seen the the full effect of it we are starting to see the beginnings of tightening supply of things like vape cartridges or packaging or various inputs to the supply chain but everything that we're hearing regarding china is that china is coming out coming back online it would be more impactful for us of what happens here in the u.s than what happens in china we're operational in 12 different states and if consumer trends and in schools and if shopping and if things change that's going to really impact what happens um green thumb up today last i checked for some reason i don't know why kobler says he's not seeing people stop coming to dispensaries yet carl

that cbd oil can safely and effectively treat cancer or not however cbd can help elevate symptoms related to cancer and side effects of chemotherapy such as pain nausea vomiting etc however a study from the european journal of pain showed that cbd applied on the skin could help lower pain and inflammation due to arthritis cbd inhibits inflammatory and neuropathic pain associated with cancer

[Music] first let me say that i don't like waiting this long in between videos but the menu at the dispensary has been lacking now not for quantity there's hundreds of products that i don't want and only one strain of a flower that i do want or a new flower from a better cultivator and you know that really sucks for the dispensary you know i like the staff but man if that menu doesn't you know if [ __ ] doesn't change i might have to be looking at a different dyspo la wedding pop by cresco is a very sativa heavy hybrid that crosses wedding cake with triangle kush wedding cake i love you know it's a very sweet treat and you know i always look for it i mean not from not from cresco but i mean i do like it that an ice cream cake pretty much any of the cake strains are reliable and tasty and triangle kush i haven't had it i know of it now with that out of the way let's go take a look at this visually speaking these nugs look decent you know lots of uh purples greens long hairs but as with most of cresco stuff lately uh looks can be deceiving but one thing that can't be hidden is the breakup and this one is another when you go to break it up it simply turns to dust meaning that it's not going to have really that much flavor and it's most likely going to be harsh as hell a little apprehensive now but uh let's go taste this all right well here we go la wedding pop from cresco nostrovia slanted cheers salute bros here we go right up front kind of citrusy and then it goes woodsy [Music] and on the finish tastes like forced fire oh man oh that's bad and you know i've noticed that cresco these past couple of cresco strains have really had this really rancid resinous aftertaste that just progressively gets worse i got a lathe of green line og recently which is one of my favorite strains and i couldn't stomach it it was you know powdery just like this harsh just like this and it may have tasted good at some point but oh my god it is rough so yeah whoa whoa all right this has one hell of a hell of a um of a head rush so i'm gonna give it a little bit and we'll talk about the effects all right guys i've given it some time and i got to tell you my first impression of this was oh [ __ ] because it hits you very fast with a cerebral head rush that's almost dizzying i mean i know that the 31 is is a big factor but man i thought this was gonna be like you know anxiety that you get but after that head rush uh you actually peek into a very relaxed calming euphoric and alert state of mind this is a strain that you can also feel in your body making it good for pain relief man that initial head rush was rough man i thought i was headed for a panic attack for sure another thing that i didn't like about this flower was there was a big problem with memory recall alzheimer's dementia that's you know that's that's one of my phobias so that kind of puts this strain behind the eight ball for me with the head rush this is suitable for people looking for a substitute for crack or cocaine or crystal meth but the high the relaxed state later during the peak is actually good for people with like adhd 80d because there is that little boost in awareness and concentration but if you're into sativas this is a definite must try you do get that boost that peak is very pleasant but man that head rush all right guys well that just about does it for me here uh i'd like to say thank you to all my friends family viewers subscribers lovers haters thumbs ups thumbs downs uh comments it means a lot to me guys the steady increase in subscribers i hit 500 that's awesome i never even thought that would be possible if you liked the video give it a thumbs up if not thumbs down go ahead leave a comment and as always thanks for the view", "twhHSgpSxnk": "all right

Alan Frankel I'd like to speak with you regarding the use of cannabis in the treatment of myasthenia gravis myasthenia gravis is not an extremely common disorder but it does have an incidence of 15 per hundred thousand which makes it far from a rare disorder technically the term myasthenia gravis means muscle weakness and the disorder is an issue between the nerve and the nerve impulse and the muscle and plate we have a nerve impulse it causes a muscle to contract one of the most important molecules in establishing this neuro muscular endplate is acetyl choline and with patients with myasthenia gravis the severe muscle weakness it's because they don't have enough acetylcholine transmitted across the neuro muscular Eddy plate the drugs that are used like Meston on for myasthenia gravis decrease the destruction of acetylcholine so there's more acetone choline in this end plate and you have good muscle contraction well it turns out which was something that I was surprised by the THC acid which is the raw form of THC non-psychoactive is incredibly effective at helping these patients form neuromuscular junctions that are functioning and it appears that the reason is that THC acid increases acetylcholine in the neuromuscular Junction using the same or very similar mechanism to the drugs that are currently used patients with myasthenia gravis are often on high-dose steroids they're on other medications that help increase acetylcholine by having both CBD and THC a as well as it appears th see all three cannabinoids in a whole plant setting seeking to help these patients tremendously we now have a series of five of these patience and each one has done extremely well each one has tapered off all their steroids and each one now has stopped they're nested on which is a pharmaceutical medication that helps increase acetylcholine I very much want to see a lot more patience with myasthenia gravis as it appears with five patients in a row having tremendous outcomes this might be a new standard treatment for myasthenia for more information regarding the use of cannabis in the therapy of myasthenia gravis please check out my website or call my office for a consultation", "wD2AoiiP4oE": "ANTHONY TREADWELL WELL THIS IS\nUNDER INVESTIGATION TREADWELL\nHAS BEEN REASSIGNED TO JFRD UNDER INVESTIGATION TREADWELL\nHAS BEEN REASSIGNED TO JFRD\nHEADQUARTERS AND WE\u2019LL HAVE NO HAS BEEN REASSIGNED TO JFRD\nHEADQUARTERS AND WE\u2019LL HAVE NO\nOFFICIAL INTERACTION WITH HEADQUARTERS AND WE\u2019LL HAVE NO\nOFFICIAL INTERACTION WITH\nTHE PUBLIC.

When did the marijuan? In the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s no early 60\u2019s and\nlate 70\u2019s this thing was over because cocaine arrives and the violence from south americans\nthat used to come to this area to buy good pot A lot of good people get rich . A lot of people\nget benefits from marijuana. The violence arrives and some Americans that\nused to live in the private airports you know?. ith the little planes full of money and buy\nthe pot and came back to the states And some of them get killed and the other\nreason was the operation Green merchant That americans That was in 1981 no? Yeah so Americans developed green merchant\nthrough America and Colombia and they gave us the The spray . The spray so a lot about pots\nare arriving to the states and the hippies start to block our product and the mexican\nproduct and they start to develop with their collections. The seedless.

So yes, today I'll talk\na bit about the use of cannabinoids to treat pain. And I have no financial\ndisclosures that relate to this. And before I get into\nthe scientific background of how we actually use\ncannabinoids to treat pain, I think we just need to acknowledge what a\nmess this situation is; so [laughter] we have\nfairly few states with legal medical cannabis. This slide as of a couple\ndays ago is outdated because Illinois just passed\nadult use recreational law, so we now have 11 states\nwith adult use cannabis. And this is despite\nit being schedule one so under the Controlled\nSubstances Act, it has no accepted medical use,\nand a high potential for abuse. So this has created such a\nmismatch for so many clinicians who want to know how to\nadjust the use of cannabis in their patients,\nand how to do this in a safe and effective way. And so to this point\na little bit -- we just published a paper little\nwhile ago, we see the conditions for which people are\nactually using cannabis. Far and away, the most\nprevalent qualifying condition for your cannabis\nlicense is chronic pain. It's about two-thirds\nof the total number of qualifying conditions, and\nabout 80% of the total patients. So what does this look\nlike then in Michigan? We're one of the biggest\nstates in terms of the number of medical cannabis patients. We have about 270,000\npatients as of 2017. And we've had medical\ncannabis -- a medical cannabis\nlaw since 2008. But because of this mismatch,\nwe have a lot of uncertainty about how to actually\ninterface with patients. A lot of physicians are\nuncomfortable regarding certifications for\ntheir patients. They're not actually saying,\n\"This is the prescription, and this is how you\nshould go use cannabis.\" Instead, what they're doing\nwhen they sign an application for your medical cannabis\nlicense is they're saying, \"Yes, you have a condition\nthat qualifies you under the state law to\npossess cannabis up to two and a half ounces and 12 plants, and go and figure it\nout for yourself.\" And so because so many\nphysicians are uncomfortable with this, there's also a lot\nof clinics that have popped up where all they do is\nmedical cannabis certifications. You can go in, get a five-minute\nappointment, pay 100 bucks or something, and voila,\nyou have a license, but still no idea of\nwhat necessarily to do. So we have that mess\non that side. And then of course, as\neverybody's been talking about today, we're in the\nmidst of an opioid crisis. And there's a lot of interest in\nusing cannabis or cannabinoids, the active compounds\nin the cannabis plant, to treat both opioid\naddiction, but then some of the undergoing chronic pain that has driven this\nopioid crisis. And there is some support\nof this being plausible. So we know from a lot\nof preclinical studies, as well as like there\nare some clinical trial that there does seem to be\nsome synergism between THC, one of the compounds in\ncannabis, and opioids. So in this recent\nclinical trial, they gave people Oxycodone, as\nwell as [inaudible]cannabis. And they found with\nsub-threshold dose of the cannabis and\nOxycodone together, they got the same\npain relief with -- as they saw with a\nhigher dose of the opioid. So there's some interest\nthere, and might be a way that people are able to reduce\ntheir opioid consumption when they start using cannabis. But then we also see statewide\nanalyses where people have shown that states with medical\ncannabis legislation have lower rates of opioid overdose,\nlower opioid prescribing than the states without. And having active operating\ndispensaries is really important for these effects. We then also see numerous --\ndozens of studies at this point in the US, in Israel, in\nCanada, where people say, \"Yes, I've substituted\ncannabis for opioids, and I do so for better\nsymptom management, and I do so because there's\nfewer adverse side effects.\" So, again, schedule\none substance, not much clinical guidance,\nwidespread availability. You can see why we're\nin quite a mess. So I think that what we need\nto do next is then figure out where the evidence\nlies for chronic pain, how we can use this in a\nsafe of a way as possible, and how to conceptualize\ncannabis in the correct way, which, at least in my view,\nis rather than thinking of it as a panacea or a poison, which\nare really the extended -- the dichotomist use that are\nreally out there at this point, and think of it, \"Well, this is\npotentially one pain medication that people could use,\nand this is the way in which they could do so.\" So with that, let's drum\ninto some of the science, so in terms of definition\nand background, then I'll go into some of the risks that\nare known about cannabinoids, their role in pain\nmanagement, looking at some of the clinical trials, and\nthen some practical tips and guidelines on how\nof use these compounds. So and much of this comes\nfrom the National Academies of Sciences 27 through --\nreport on the health effects of cannabis and cannabinoids. There is some stuff that's\nbeen updated since this time, but this is a really\ngood place to start. It's available to\nanybody online, so I would suggest looking\ninto it if you would like. In terms of definitions, so I'm\ngoing to use \"cannabis\" instead of \"marijuana\", just because \"cannabis\" is the botanical\nname, and \"marijuana\" has, you know, [inaudible]\nxenophobic history to the word, so I'll just avoid\nusing that for now. And so there's subspecies\n[inaudible]. And then we also\nhave cannabinoids, which is active compounds,\nboth in the cannabis plant, but also we -- our\nbody makes its own endo or endogenous cannabinoids. And then there's also\nsynthetic cannabinoids, which either are replicas\nof the phytocannabinoids that are synthesized\nin the labs, or novel cannabinoid\ncompounds that we think of as having potential\ntherapeutic uses. These compounds all\ninterface with the endogenous or endocannabinoid system,\nwhich is the set of receptors from your naturally\nrecurring ligands and enzymes regulating control. And this system is so ancient,\nso widespread, and involved in so many functions including\nmemory, analgesia, stress, appetite, sleep that\nthere's a lot of excitement about targeting it for\nclinical applications. I guess I can't tell\nif it shows up nicely. The two most common\nreceptors in this system, the ones that are the\nmost widely studied, are cannabinoid receptors\none and two. CB1 is one of the\nmost common receptors in the central nervous system. And it is -- when\nit's activated, it tends to be more involved in the sleep memory analgesia\nappetite, those responses. By contrast, CBQ is found\nmore in the immune system. And when it's activated, it\ndoesn't seem to have any kind of psychoactive effects in the\nsame way as the CB1 receptor, so there's a lot of\ninterest in targeting that immune system-related\nconditions. So next let's go into\nsome of these cannabinoids and what we know about them. At this point, I'm just\ngoing to touch on two, even though there's over 100\nwhich have been discovered. But the most commonly studied\nis THC or tetrahydrocannabinol. It's analgesic, it's\nmood-altering, and appetite-stimulating, and it partially binds\nto both CB1 and CB2. I will note that even though\nthere's a lot of concern about the psychoactive\neffects and all of that of THC when in smoked cannabis,\nthat synthetic THC as dronabinol has\nbeen legal for decades for treating chemotherapy\ninduced nausea and vomiting, and AIDS-related anorexia. So there is a known\ntherapeutic use. It's FDA-approved. It's a schedule-free substance, while herbal cannabis\nis schedule one, further muddying\nconfusion in the waters about what's going on with this. Hot on the scene is\nCBD or cannabidiol. We've known about this\ncompound as long as we've known about THC, but there's so\nmuch more excitement about it at this point because\nit is non-intoxicating. It seems to protect against some of the psychoactive\neffects of THC. And then in a lot of\npreclinical studies, it has anti-inflammatory\neffects, it has effects on pain, and most excitedly, is a\nvery potent anticonvulsant. In fact, the FDA just approved\na CBD-based drug last -- I think it was last June\nin 2018 called \"Epidiolex\" for childhood epileptic\ndisorders. And it is schedule five, so\nvery low abuse potential. I would be remiss if I didn't\nmention the other cannabinoids. I'm not going to go into\nthem much, except to say that there's over 100 of them. And there's a big dispute in the\nmedical and scientific community at this point about how\nto account for them, because classically\npharmaceuticals will try to find the active ingredient\nand synthesize that and give that in isolation and say,\n\"Okay, that's a good -- that's the effect that we want.\" But because there are so many\nterpenes responsible for aroma and taste, et cetera, as well\nas these other cannabinoids and herbal [inaudible],\npeople want to know, \"Should we use a\nfull spectrum product or should we use an isolate?\" So I'm not going to\ngo anymore into that, but just to say that\nit's out there. In terms of photos, you\ncan see that there -- it's a close-up of\na cannabis bud, and then a cannabis\noil [inaudible]. And you can -- now that\nCBD is so exciting and hot on the scene, you\ncan buy it anywhere. You can buy it on Amazon, you\ncan buy it at gas stations, you can but it at CVS. And to the frustration\nof scientists who want to actually do studies on\nthis stuff, but you have to get a scheduling license\nto do so, you can buy it for your dog [laughter] in\ncase your buddy has anxiety or joint pain, or\nsomething like that. You can get this in BarkBox\ndelivered to your house. [Laughter] So we also see that this situation is\nevolving quite quickly. So in 2018 -- at\nthe end of 2018, President Trump signed\nthe 2018 Farm Bill that legalized industrial\nhemp, and thus opened the door for the availability for many\nhemp derived CBD products; so they have less\nthan .3% THC in them. But there's not a\nlot of uncertainty about how the FDA is\ngoing to regulate that, so there are concerns about\nproducts that have heavy metals because hemp is a\nbioaccumulator. There's also a lot of shady,\nyou know, companies out there who don't have good processes in\nplace that remove the solvents that are used to extract these\ncompounds, or they use a lot of pesticides and then\ndon't do anything about that when they're actually\ndoing the extraction. So it's really important\nto go to -- ideally to go to a place that has third-party\nindependent testing for metals, for solvents, for\npesticides, and then also so you'll actually know\nwhat is in the product that your patients\nmight be using. One such place, there's a\nnonprofit called [inaudible] that has collaborated\nwith places like Johns Hopkins University. And they've done much of this\nsafety and potency testing, and have a list of product\nthat they verify as being safe and actually accurately labeled. And then lastly,\nin this definitions and background section,\nI just want to talk about how these compounds\nwork a little bit in the body, because this will come in later\nwhen we're talking about how to use them and the\neffectiveness. So pharmacokinetically, you\ncan see from this slide the way that THC shows up in\nthe blood [inaudible] administration groups. If anybody knows of anybody\nwho's injected cannabinoids, please let me know so that,\none, that injection one, it looks almost the\nsame as smoking. So you can just go with that. But if you [laughter] actually\ningest the compounds orally, you have less of a spike of\nTHC in the bloodstream and less of a fast taper, and instead\nyou have an extended -- it takes a while to hit\nand then an extended taper. So you can think about slow and fast release\nadministration groups for using these compounds,\nespecially knowing that the feeling of high maps onto those pharmakinetics\nreally nicely. And then lastly, about how\nthese interact in the body; we do seem to see a\nu-shaped curve for cannabis and cannabinoid effects. So with that in mind, what\nthis means is there's a kind of sweet spot above which if\nyou go above a certain point, you can end up overshooting\nyour medical dose, and then just get higher, in\nfact maybe even get worse pain. So if you look at the Y axis, you see a green plus\nand a red minus. The curve shows where\nsomebody's pain relief is. So maybe you have a low dose\nand you get a little bit of pain relief, you'd\nfind that sweet spot up at the top of that curve. But if you go past that, people\ncould have increased anxiety, they could have increased pain. So trying to figure\nout how to do that safely is something\nthat's really important when using these compounds. All right; so next let's\nmove into cannabinoid risks. I feel like this is\nreally important to go into because there's so\nmuch concern about this, just given that cannabis is\nstill a schedule one drug. And actually, this is where the\nbulk of the research funding from the National Institutes\nof Health has gone in the past. And we don't have that much info\non the medical risks of cannabis and cannabinoids because these\nstudies have typically looked at recreational users. But because many of these folks who are using it recreationally\nwould be considered the chronic heavy users, they're\nsmoking a lot daily, and tend to be younger,\nwe can say, \"Well, these are probably -- this\nis the worst case scenario of what this might look like, at\nleast as a surrogate right now.\" We know that smoking,\nnot really good. So the respiratory effects\nof that, those are some of most widely known\nrisks of cannabinoids, but there's also risk of\ndependence and addiction. About nine percent of people who use cannabis develop some\nkind of dependency issue. There's also increased rates\nof psychotic illness developed by people, especially using\ncannabis under the age of 25. I also need to addend the point\non dependence and addiction. People who use cannabis at a\nyounger age have about a double of that risk of addiction, so\nimportant to note that as well. And that's a particularly\nvulnerable population. And we see some long-term\neffects on memory and brain structure in\ncannabis users as well. In terms of in the acute phase,\nwe see dizziness, somnolence, euphoria, although some\npeople might not say that that is a risk, lightheadedness,\nanxiety, and others. Less commonly, but\nespecially seen in people who take way too much in\nterms of an edible dose, you'll see some vomiting,\nparanoia, occasionally seizures and hallucinations, although\nthose are more associated with the synthetic cannabinoids\nlike spice that people can buy on the street, not typically\ncannabis itself; and then, vehicle accidents, of\ncourse, and then lastly, as with the CBD products\nthat you can buy on Amazon, there's an uncertain\nquality of many of the herbal [inaudible]\nas well. So in states that don't have\ngood regulatory statutes in place about testing\nfor safety and potency, you can end up with things with\nbud mold on them like you see in that -- in the upper picture. And if somebody's\nimmunocompromised and smoking that, it can be\nreally serious and problematic if they get some kind of\nsystemic fungal infection. So in terms of the risks\nof medical cannabinoid use, as I said, we have much\nfewer data on this. The best study that I've\nseen came out of Canada on McGill called\nthe \"COMPASS Study\" and what they did was they\nfollowed folks using 12.5% THC smokable cannabis for a\nyear, and what they -- and compared to people\nwho were not using it in a chronic pain setting. And what they found is about\na double direct increase in minor adverse effects in\npeople who were using cannabis, compared to those who were\nnot, but also increases -- or improvements in pain\nand quality of life. So definitely a mixed\nprofile there, but in a place, excuse me, that needs a lot more\nwork, especially given that, you know, there are so many\npeople using cannabis medically and we just don't really\nhave a good sense of what that looks like risk wise. A couple studies that\ndid come out of Israel where they have more regimented\ntitration regimes have found that there's a pretty low risk\nprofile in elderly adults. They would be looking\nin a population of mixed cancer patients\nand they found with this titration regimen that they saw very\nfew adverse events. Okay; so going into the\nrole of cannabinoids and pain management,\nwe've talked a lot today about the mechanisms of\npain so I'm going to skip over this a little bit,\nexcept to remind you that there's the\nperipheral neuropathic and centralized pain states,\nand that people can have any of these in combination. In terms of preclinical models\nof pain, we know that CB1 and CB2 agonists are quite\neffective in many of these types of pain, but people\nare really concerned about the CB1 acting compounds because of the off-target\ncentral nervous system activity, the types of effects\nthat we'd associate with the cannabis high. While CB2 agonists\nthere's a lot of excitement about at this point because as\nI said, they don't really seem to produce that effect. And there's actually a company\nmaking a compound called [inaudible] that\nthey're testing in a lot of inflammatory disorders that doesn't really\nappear to bind to CB1. And so there's some\npotential there to maybe in the future see some\nCB2-specific compounds on the market. In terms of clinical\ntrials with chronic pain, the most recent meta-analysis\nthat looked at all of the clinical trials noted,\nas with all the other studies that have done this, that\nthese are short-length studies, they have small sample size, they have unrepresentative\ndosing of what people actually use. And they typically find a\nmodest decrease in pain, compared to placebo\nacross pain states. But most of this effect\nsize is driven by the data in neuropathic pain, using the\ncombination of THC plus CBT -- CBD excuse me, called \"sativex\", which is a sublingual\n[inaudible], it's a one-to-one\nratio of the two. It would be really nice, if\nI could give you more data about how CBD alone is effective\nin different types of pain, but unfortunately, I've only\nseen one study that has looked at that in any kind\nof long-term setting, and that has just been\npublished as an abstract, as opposed to a published paper. They did find decreases in pain\nand improvement in function, but mostly in men with\nknee osteoarthritis. I will say also that there's\na pretty clear mismatch between these clinical trials\nand the observational studies in which many people using\ncannabis who have been followed over time they say that they've\ngreat success, they've been able to taper off opioids,\nwhatever it might be. But that uncontrolled nature of their dosing makes\nit really unclear about how exactly they're doing\nthat, and how to translate that into a more\nclinical setting. Because we've talked\nabout -- oops, excuse me; because we've talked about\nsurgical pain a little bit as well, I'll just\ntouch on that briefly. There's only been about seven\nstudies that have been done in the acute or surgical\npain setting, and unlike in the\nchronic pain space, there's pretty much no\nevidence that cannabinoids that have been tested thus far\nare effective in this setting. But similarly to the\nchronic pain studies, fairly limited in length. Many of them actually use\nnovel cannabinoid compounds that have CB1 intoxication\npsychoactive effects. And none of these\nstudies used CBD. And given that there's actually\na CBD clinical trial that came out in the last week, that there\nwas a lot of excitement about it because it seemed to decrease\n-- what am I trying to say, it seemed to decrease\ncravings and anxiety related to heroin addiction\nand recovery in people who were ex-heroin users. There's a lot of excitement\nabout using it potentially as an opioid sparing medication,\npotentially in a surgical space, or as an opioid substitute,\nagain just CBD alone. Okay. So in summary, then,\nwe know that cannabinoids and chronic pain, that\nthey do that plausibility for therapeutic value. We know that dosing\nis really important, and we know that using them in the right people\nis also important. We need to consider how much to\nuse, because we want to figure out that sweet spot\non that u-shaped curve so we don't overshoot\nan effective dose. We want to know about\ncannabinoid content, THC versus CBD, and then the\nadministration groups as well, because smoking all day\nevery day probably is not an effective strategy. But it's possible\nthat you could think of using a long-acting\nform of a cannabis compound like an edible, and then have -- or a capsule, and\nthen having something for short-term great\nfor pain relief. So actually I was just talking to Evan Latinas [assumed\nspelling], my colleague at [inaudible] Medicine,\nand something that they do is they give people\nCBD alone for the daytime, and if people have\nissues with sleeping, they give them a little bit\nof THC with CBD at nighttime to help with that, as well\nas the CBD [inaudible] for your pain, starting\nat very low doses so that people can avoid\ngetting too high, incidentally, by taking a product that they\ndon't know what's in it or one that has too much THC. So I guess along\nthose lines, then, some practical tips would then\nbe to start low and go slow; so again, those low doses\nso you don't overshoot, using a verifiable source with\ncredible third-party testing so you know what you're getting and you're avoiding heavy\nmetals, pesticides, et cetera. And then because we know that smoking is really\nnot probably a good way to ingest medicine\nif you can avoid it, using other administration\ngroups that are available, tinctures, capsules, vaporizing\nif somebody absolutely feels that they have to inhale,\nthings of that nature. And using a combination\nof CBD and THC, because using just\nTHC alone seems to have a much lower toxic\nthreshold for psychosis and potentially other\nadverse events, than using that combination\ntogether. And actually, Dan and I\npublished a paper in \"Annals of Internal Medicine\"\nwith a commentary of how we think people should be\nusing these compounds from more of a harm reduction standpoint\nand on a safety standpoint. And if anybody's\ninterested in that, I'm happy to send it your way. So with that, I know I'm at the\nend of my time, I'd be happy to take any questions. \"And thanks so much for\nyour kind attention.

Do you think to yourselves, \"Oh my god, the drug problem in the U.S.\nis worse than I thought\"? How is it possible that 11-year-olds\nget access to pot? Maybe some of you thought, \"Geez, I wonder what\nmedical condition these kids have.\" The truth of the matter is, most of us don't think about medicine\nwhen we hear the word \"marijuana.\" I admit - I'm embarrassed to admit\nthat up until two years ago I was completely misinformed\nabout marijuana, and I think many\nof our population is today. I remember vividly in sixth grade\nbeing ushered into the auditorium to see a government-sponsored\n\"documentary\" about marijuana. It was the most scary thing\nI'd ever watched. People jumping off buildings,\ncar crashes - it was mayhem. But not once was there\na mention of the possibility that cannabis was useful as medicine. To be honest, in retrospect, I'm a little angry about the propaganda\nthat our government is putting forth; it's even happening today. My big idea worth sharing\nis that medical cannabis can be the healthcare success story\nof our lifetimes but only if we all engage\nin learning the truth and ask our federal government\nto end prohibition of cannabis. I'd like to introduce you\nto my twins, Addison and Cassidy. Believe it or not, today's their birthday. Eleven years ago today,\nonly a mile from here, they were born and came into our lives.

They're missing a protein\nthat allows them to process cholesterol both in and out of their brain cells. The cause is neurodegeneration. They can no longer walk,\nand they can no longer talk. We were told the Addie and Cassie\nwould be lucky to see their 12th birthday. (Sniffs) After reeling with\nthis devastating diagnosis, my wife and I dedicated ourselves to finding treatments\nfor our twins in their lifetime. We gave up successful\nhigh tech careers in Silicon Valley, and we became research philanthropists\nraising money for research, and ultimately, we became\nbiotechnology entrepreneurs developing a compound. The compound we found was cyclodextrin, and we found it with an amazing group\nof scientists, researchers and physicians from all over the world,\nincluding right here in Reno. Every week the girls get an infusion. It's eight hours long -\nit goes into their bloodstream, the cyclodextrin. Every other week, like yesterday,\nthe girls go to the hospital and they get a lumbar\npuncture in their spine in order to get the cyclodextrin\nto reach their brains directly. We think that the combination\nof those two routes of administration are slowing down\nthe neurodegenerative progression, and hopefully, maybe even stopping it. Addie and Cassie were\nthe first little pioneers to try this scary treatment. I can tell you as a parent, with no one in front of you\npaving the way, it truly is a scary moment. Thankfully, a couple dozen\nkids around the world, including a few at the NIH, are now engaged\nin further science and research on this experimental treatment. But the treatment doesn't seem\nto help with their seizures. As a result of the neurodegeneration,\nmy kids have seizures almost daily. A couple years ago\nthey were way more than daily, they were many a day. We started giving the kids\ntraditional pharmaceutical medicines for their seizures. And they worked - some of them worked,\nsome of them didn't work, but the big problem was most seizure drugs cause\nyour kids to become zombies. The whole purpose of the drugs is to essentially take away the stress\nor the triggers that cause seizures. We had heard about a father in California\nthat was treating a young son who has intractable seizures,\nseizing constantly, all day long, and he was using cannabis medicine. We became interested. We contacted him;\nwe learned more about the drug. Ultimately, we decided\nto pursue cannabis in earnest. Did you know that the cannabis plant was used as early as 2900 BC\nin China as medicine? Did you know that we in America\nwere using, in the 1800s, for a century, we were using cannabis\nto treat a number of afflictions. Unfortunately, in the early 1900s,\nas you all probably know, cannabis was prohibited and subsequently demonized\nand turned into a war. It's a shame. It truly is a shame. But we became convinced\nthat the oil would work. So we set out to find\na supply of oil, certainly - Cannabis has been legal\nin the great state of Nevada for almost a decade, surely we could just go out\nand buy some oil and give it to our kids. Not true; there was no oil\navailable in our great state. So we set out to do it ourselves. First we got physician approval\nto do the treatment of cannabis, and then we became caregivers, licensed caregivers\nin the state of Nevada, which allows us to cultivate\nand make extractions, oils from the cannabis plant\nto give to our kids. Every day - three times a day -\nthe girls get a little oil, like what you see here. This oil is extracted\nfrom a very special cannabis plant that's high in cannabidiol,\nor CBD as we call it. Unfortunately, this oil, by itself,\ndoesn't even completely, for our children, stop their seizures, so we still use\na small amount of pharmaceutical medicine, but we use less - we've reduced\nthe number of drugs the kids take, and we've reduced the amount of dose\nfrom the few drugs we do give them, and consequently our kids\nare not only having fewer seizures and shorter seizures, they're also bright eyed\nand happy children again, they're no longer little zombies. This was great progress,\nbut I thought to myself, holy cow, there are two million epilepsy or seizure\ndisorder sufferers in the United States, who's going to help those folks, those kids, those adults\nwith these disorders? And at that moment we decided to take what we had learned\nfor our children and turn it into a commercial business\nhere in the state of Nevada, which was just preparing\nto allow that to happen, and as Kylie mentioned,\nwe've endeavored to do so and are now licensed\nto grow, extract and sell, dispense cannabis here in Nevada,\nin the state of Nevada. Someday the federal government\nwill end prohibition. But how many lives\nwill be lost, potentially, or severely affected in the meantime? How many kids with seizures like mine\nwill move their families, will uproot their homes to move to\nColorado or Nevada to get these medicines? How many cancer patients\nwill be denied access to inexpensive and effective medicine to treat the side effects like pain\nand nausea that come with chemotherapy? There is a groundswell of folks like me\nwho understand the potential of cannabis, and I'm grateful for that. The ironic thing is\nsome of my family and friends, including, most particularly,\nmy own mother, are still not convinced. My mother is worried that free access to cannabis\nis actually a threat to society and that perhaps the medicinal value\ndoesn't outweigh that threat. And she sees the medicinal value\nin her grandchildren. The problem, I think, is that, really, we just don't have enough hard evidence\nyet to convince the skeptics. There just isn't enough\nscience and research to back the foundation\nthat the medicine's working, the medicine's effective, that it's useful\nfor large populations of people. That's not to say\nthat research doesn't exist, there's a mountain of evidence\nthat the cannabis plant is useful. But there's not a lot of clinical science,\nhard clinical science to that effect. That's the conundrum;\nthat's the chicken and egg problem. Until the federal prohibition\nof cannabis ends, until we take cannabis\noff the schedule of harmful drugs like LSD and methamphetamines\nthat have no medicinal value, until we remove cannabis from that list, which is insane that\nit's on that list to begin with, until we remove it from that list,\nresearch can't take place. If I came to the University of Nevada,\nReno Medical Center tomorrow with a million dollar grant\nto study cannabis, I would likely not have success. It's not that the scientists\ndon't want to study the plant, it's that they are fearful\nof losing federal funding. It's because they'd\nhave to deal with the DEA and other regulatory agencies\nat the federal level, which is a complex and expensive process. This is one of the many tentacles\nof the prohibition of cannabis that actually prohibits us\nfrom moving forward. My own personal experience with cannabis\nalong with the evidence, the science that I know about, makes me absolutely certain\nwhat I shared with you earlier. Cannabis has the potential to become the big healthcare\nsuccess story of our lifetimes but only if we allow it. Here are Addie and Cassie\nin a more recent picture. For those of you who are still skeptical, perhaps for those of you like my mother who still worry about\nthe societal downside of cannabis, I ask you to look at this picture\nand consider the following: By limiting access to cannabis\nfor parents like myself, you're forcing me to make a decision between the lives\nor well-being of my children and going to jail. How is that a fair or rational\nset of thinking in modern society? Our 16th president,\nthe famous 16th president, had very strong feelings\nabout this subject. He said, \"Prohibition ... goes\nbeyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to control\na man's appetite by legislation and makes a crime out of things\nthat aren't crimes ... A prohibition law strikes a blow\nat the very principles upon which our government was founded.\" This was Abraham Lincoln. And he said these words\nbefore we had the experiences we had with alcohol prohibition\nor with cannabis prohibition. Someday the federal government\nwill spend the money on research. Someday the NIH will actually be actively\npursuing cannabis as a treatment. Until that day comes, a large group of us\nhave come together and formed a nonprofit to organize and fund clinical research\nin cannabis in the private sector until we can use\nthe academic institutions. We call the foundation PeopleCann,\nin honor of advocates like myself who over the last several decades\nhave been saying what I'm now saying and whose words I didn't listen to\nuntil my own situation demanded it. Never in her wildest imagination -\nexcuse me - would my wife have thought that today she would\nbe a cannabis advocate. She was also \"misinformed,\"\nlet's say, about the plant until we needed to learn. Neither my wife nor I would ever believe\nthat our young children would become the next generation\nof cannabis advocates. (Exhales) I'd like you to meet them. Please give a birthday welcome\nto my wife Chris - excuse me - and my daughters, Addie and Cassie Hempel. (Applause) Hi. (Applause) Would it be unkind to ask\nif we can sing Happy Birthday? (All singing) Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday dear Cassie. Happy Birthday to you. Yay! Good girls!

will be just from looking at a few of its seeds after all you only look at the seeds don't you that's what you bought them for so we did some research as to why you may have found the seeds of each strain so enticing and decided that it must have been on their potential potential that is if you accidentally happen to drop one of the seeds into a pot of nutrient rich and moist soil that is located in a warm place under a light bulb and that was also located in a well ventilated place so where shall we begin at number 10 on the list you voted for train wreck though starting out with a train wreck may not seem such a smart move especially if you enjoy travel this one's popular because of the powerful high and few negative side effects it seems to have a reputation for generating creativity and many comment that it has helped migraines general pain and arthritis gelato comes in at number nine with a word of caution for the uninitiated as this has a powerful hit physical relaxation seems to be the overarching theme while the ability to still function normally is a definite upside sitting at number eight on the list star dog is a winner with those of you who are looking for a good thc level at around 20 percent you guys seem to feel that this is a good choice for those of you suffering from fatigue stress or anxiety at number seven future one seems to hit the mark with those of you who are looking for something that leaves you feeling seriously relaxed apparently also helping to reduce feelings of depression a few of you mentioned the word chocolate and not just because of an attack of the munchies on to number six we have amnesia haze so how did it get its name maybe because it's high in thc and low in cpd levels the citrusy notes seem to go down well with you as does the boost of energy that gets delivered northern lights seems to be another popular choice with you and enters the list at number five perhaps because of its potential to reduce stress and counteract sleeplessness the slightly lower thc level makes this one more sophorific and more likely to create a feeling of blissfulness we're beginning to detect a theme here as this is another great strain that apparently induces a great feeling of being relaxed and happy rumor has it that this plant will also flower after just 45 days which is pretty quick in our opinion so maybe a good variety for those of you who are impatient girl scout cookies makes it comfortably onto the list at number four thanks to its ability to help users deal with pain while providing a full bodied

euphoric and generally happy while still feeling full of energy your comments also indicated potential for helping with stress and depression we also couldn't completely leave out ghost train haze primarily because of the reports of its inducing a strong sense of creativity and ability to still concentrate heavily some of you also mentioned about its possible help with pain and depression but those prone to anxiety should give this one a pass so back to it and the clear winner is wait for it wedding cake an unforgettable journey into the land of delight begins with a single taste of this

pilot here with another update on the exotic genetics red pop phenohunt we've got the artificial red milk and cookies which is not part of the final hunt just the plant that i've been growing for a couple years just as a reference and then everything else our mouth party phenos it's been a couple weeks since my last video guys um so lots happened in the last two weeks just finished off week six of flower and everything's getting real plump remember i'm running under the six hlg quantum board 288 v2s running at 540 watts of total power here we've got the artificial red then mouth party three mouth party four off party two mock party five so let's go through them one by one starting off with my favorite fino so far the mouth party three and the spheno just has an incredible strawberry smell that has just persisted even up until now it's starting to become a little more complex um it's almost starting to develop like a doughy not quite cheesy but like a doughy smell to it so when you smell the buds it smells basically like a strawberry doughnut that's incredible and also i think is one of the best growers it's just got a lot of fat tops nice buds all the way down to the bottom nice even tops everything just grows really evenly this is gonna be i think a great contender for the next massive plant look at these lower buds down here there's some top buds super frosty all of these are still got plenty of white pistols uh barely any of them turned brown so i think it's got a few more weeks to go at least plenty of time for them to fatten up even more i think this is gonna be you know the best smelling tasting and yielding one well best in terms of if you like fruity right i think fruity is awesome but there's other more complex flavors than some of the other ones moving on to the artificial red uh this plant actually it starts getting so dark it's almost purpling out um it's one of the biggest ones grows a lot of buds um super frosty uh the buzz just look weird as [ __ ] i've never seen buds like this guys um i looked at the last video from two weeks ago i mean it doesn't even look like they really grew they did not really um grow any more out i mean they kind of fattened up and densed up but they didn't even grow in the last the last two weeks and all the pistols are brown so this is a super fast finisher i looked at the trichomes you know about half of them are cloudy it's got a nice chocolatey gas smell it'll be really interesting how it smokes um but just these buzzers look really weird guys i don't know have you ever seen buzz like this just it looks like more leaves than buds really so i'm not going to judge a book by its cover we'll just see what she finishes off like and what she smokes like and then another interesting fino the month party 2. this one's kind of purpling out too or at least it looks really dark so i'm thinking it's going to purple out just a beautiful beautiful fino um i don't know if it's any more frostier than the other ones but i think that dark bud and leaf color just makes those trichomes pop and she's definitely the dankest one got like a real piney gas just awesome super resiny um this one isn't too big guys but the buds are really dense and they just grow nice and um this one was the one i don't know if you can see it still got the duct tape down there at the bottom of the stem when she was a small seedling i basically chopped that stem in half it was only being held together by a little hair and i taped it back up and it recovered but it definitely got stunted so i'm thinking i should give this one another chance um you know the yield doesn't look like it might be great just because the plants smaller because it kind of got slowed down and veg because of that but i think this one's got great potential and i mean it stays pretty short too so that's good so we'll see see how she smokes and then there's small party four um kind of an average strain it's got just small buds nothing really special about it um smells kind of similar to this one to the malt party too kind of like a piney gas but not really that strong and you know it doesn't really look as good and doesn't really grow as good either and interestingly this one was one of the biggest ones in veg um yeah you know just phenotypic variation so unless this has like an amazing high or something probably not going to keep this one but still looking pretty good pretty frosty just not as good as the other ones and then the mouth party 5 growing kind of similar to the mouth party 3 over here so pretty good nice nice fat tops a lot of tops has a slight strawberry smell but more you know more of other terpenes let me see i don't remember exactly yeah more of a yeah that one's kind of interesting it's really interesting like a gas like strawberry gas that's pretty cool chelsea's how she smokes um you know just because these this one my favorite one smells like strawberry it doesn't mean it's gonna taste like that right maybe this one will taste better maybe the hell would better um so so far um i like the mouth party five my party three the most moth party two those are my top three out of here and then of course we got the milk and cookies how could you forget these buds are [ __ ] insane this plant is like a week ahead of the other ones just because the other ones weren't really ready for flowering so they took a little bit longer to start flowering um but yeah these are just some of the fattest buds i've ever grown so hopefully these other ones fatten up just as much it's looking awesome um been feeding pretty heavily with the vege bloom dirty pretty much you know 800 to 1000 parts per million since like week four i think around like the end of week four maybe kind of dialed back the base nutrients and increase the shine a little bit so i'm running right now i'm running three and a half teaspoons per five gallons of the vegetable dirty and two of the shine and yeah everything's looking pretty good guys so it's going to be exciting to see them fatten up a little bit more over the next few weeks i can't wait to try them all well that's it for this week's update guys i'm going to do another video soon with the final yield of the organic plant so stay tuned for that it's going to come out the next couple days and thanks for checking it out i'll catch you guys

drug cartels marijuana remains big business but they're now turning their attention to an even more potent product now crossing our border it looks like motor oil but the stuff you see here is nearly pure THC concentrate since May Border Patrol agents have seized it coming across the Arizona border starting to see the people that usually would backpack marijuana through the desert we're now back packing up crude oil that concentrate is made using a complex process of stripping the THC off of plants creating a product that began at about six percent THC into one that carries THC content of more than 80 percent it takes about 250 pounds of this low-grade commercial marijuana to produce a five gallon bucket of this crude cannabis oil once in concentrated form profits can skyrocket each bucket can produce more than $500,000 in vaping cartridges these are all black-market cartridges none of these are from a licensed dispensaries all ones we've recovered in the last year once the crude oil from the cartels hits the streets local dealers begin cutting the product with additives like vitamin E acetate a compound linked to the nationwide vaping illness do you suspect vitamin E acetate will be found in any of this absolutely sure yeah no doubt how much are Americans habits driving how they deliver what drugs to us well that's the whole business right I mean there's if there isn't a market there's no reason to be shipping the stuff up using vape cartridges to deliver THC is now the most popular way for consuming marijuana it's that demand that fuels the cartels new strategy creating a risk no one should take that's a no-brainer the black-market canvas cartridges are going to be hazardous period Labs are testing the crude oil to find out exactly what type of chemicals are

Ay yack...\nThis is good, it sucks...\nAy man I'm fucking tired.... hopefully we don't have to\u00a0get up at 7am you know we have two more days\u00a0\u00a0 welcome to my world we are at the farm dude....\nFanco you must see this hash machine man! yeah maybe somebody's\u00a0\ngoing to put an m16 in your culio tonight we are at the farm This is 800 plants per hectare, and there are 2 hectares on this, so 16000 plants, 200 grams per plant that's two tons per crop\u00a0\nthat's six tons per year coming out of this place\u00a0\u00a0 of this quality and i am seriously impressed...i am\u00a0shocked..this is pure porno pure porno really for us it's really really nice to see other\u00a0\nparts of the world people developing themselves\u00a0\u00a0 and becoming great farmers you know and if we\u00a0fight this war all together all over the world\u00a0\u00a0 all these farmers the United States there's\u00a0no way back in canada there's no way back to\u00a0\u00a0 Colombia there's no way back in Holland there's\u00a0no way back in Spain there's no way back and we all\u00a0\u00a0 work together, all the breeders and all the growers\u00a0we can win this battle after 50 years of madness you never stop learning because breeding plants\u00a0\u00a0 is as i said creating something new it's like\u00a0\nyou could you could compare it with a chef\u00a0\u00a0 a michelin star chef who's creating new recipes\u00a0the ingredients are are almost infinite to\u00a0\u00a0 combine and the way you can combine it is almost\u00a0without limit and it's up to the talent and the\u00a0\u00a0 art and the knowledge of the chef to combine it to\u00a0combine them in the way to create something good\u00a0\u00a0 and you can see it a little bit the same way so do\u00a0you consider yourself a chef a green chef for sure Test this haze, the same Kush but with a tint of haze, a pheno, more sativa, oh perfect man fuck we need a clone of this one mate win the battle against legalization and try to\u00a0\nfind the system that everybody has a benefit of\u00a0\u00a0 this is the most important thing because\u00a0\nnow as we look we are in a great plantation\u00a0\u00a0 but it's still very illegal right you know what\u00a0\nthe people are doing here and they're all\u00a0\u00a0 jeopardizing their life and prison and everything\u00a0you know...so part of your sort of like enterprise\u00a0\u00a0 is making the world a better place well for us\u00a0\nthis this is our core thing you know what we\u00a0\u00a0 like to see that's what we saw in our movies for\u00a0\nexample St. Vincent and Trinidad we did that in\u00a0\u00a0 one movie you go to trinidad you have a curfew\u00a0\nat six o'clock yeah they ban all the marijuana\u00a0\u00a0 on the island all the cocaine is coming from\u00a0\nsouth america through Trinidad, there are shootings\u00a0in the street there's arms disappearing there's\u00a0\ncorruption the whole island went down compared\u00a0\u00a0to cocaine is there more people for prison in\u00a0prison for cocaine or for marijuana here in Trinidad? For Marijuana! you go next door to see vincent everybody\u00a0can smoke marijuana there's great tourism going on\u00a0\u00a0 the cops are laid back the government is laid\u00a0back there's a whole different vibe in the streets\u00a0\u00a0 so two countries very close to each other yeah\u00a0\n20 30 miles and you see a completely different\u00a0\u00a0 vibe the way the government operates against\u00a0\nthe local drugs and people and the current the\u00a0\u00a0 government should see this this is also one\u00a0\nof the reasons that holland basically kind\u00a0\u00a0 of legalized marijuana a very long time ago\u00a0\nin the 70s because we saw the benefit of it sativa crossed with nicoles kush with this\u00a0\npurplish thing on the leaves beautiful they have a little bit of rust\u00a0\u00a0 a little bit of white fly but\u00a0\nthey're healthy plants overall when you come to a plantation like this what are\u00a0you looking for in the buds and in the pockets\u00a0\u00a0 beautiful....look how much resin already for this\u00a0thing is like four weeks into flowering fire\u00a0\u00a0 first of all we evaluate the general structure of\u00a0\nthe plants we look at the the branching we look\u00a0\u00a0 at the internal space so the distance between\u00a0\none branch and the next branch how uniform it\u00a0\u00a0 is how big it is then we go we move on to the bud\u00a0structure we look how close the bud is how tight\u00a0\u00a0 it gets now these plants considering they are\u00a0three weeks four weeks away from harvest they\u00a0\u00a0 are already very very well developed we examine\u00a0the resin quantity of the resin in general on the\u00a0\u00a0 bud on the leaves leaflets and then we can we can\u00a0evaluate even the calyx relief ratio even though\u00a0\u00a0 it's a little bit early to do that at this stage\u00a0\nbut we can see the proportion between the number\u00a0\u00a0 of Calyx and the number of leaf in the bud\u00a0\nand the more calyx the less leaf the better it\u00a0\u00a0 is of course because the final product will be\u00a0\neasier to manicure right and then we can start\u00a0\u00a0 evaluating the more personal the more the more\u00a0individual side of the of the situation which\u00a0\u00a0 is the smell in this case because plants that\u00a0\nhave this amount of resin already have a good\u00a0\u00a0 smell something that can tell you how good it\u00a0\nis already, how strong so it's and then from here we wait\u00a0\u00a0 a few more weeks and we go on and then when\u00a0the product is finished then you can finally evaluate it & understand. you have the crocodile hunters\u00a0\nsnake hunters and Strain Hunters i love it too much.... in holland until\n95 i would say 80 percent was hash\u00a0\u00a0 still the old generation smokes hash  and then after\u00a0it became marijuana but in other countries in north africa and in malana for example or in nepal\u00a0it's all hash smoking countries, but we smoke both so when Arjan rolls into town why is it such\u00a0a big deal to the farmers here...... it's a really\u00a0\u00a0 big deal you you could say let's let's make a\u00a0\ncomparison with the music industry for example\u00a0\u00a0 just to make you understand if Arjan would be one\u00a0of the biggest music producers in the world and this would be a bunch of upcoming\u00a0talents and artists from a cool\u00a0\u00a0 underground neighborhood they would\u00a0\nlove to have this big producers home\u00a0\u00a0 checking out their the music....right so\u00a0\nthis is like their big shot maybe that's\u00a0\u00a0 because Arjan could walk home with some of this stuff....\u00a0absolutely.... how do you think they've done\u00a0\u00a0 i think uh looking around is pretty impressive\u00a0\ni mean i've been looking at marijuana plants for\u00a0\u00a0 the last 20 years of my life right.. yeah this is\u00a0pretty impressive... so why do you come up to these\u00a0\u00a0 places, like what are you getting out of this?...basically we evaluate what they're doing here the highway of phillips lights from holland...somos number one we see the size of the operation we\u00a0see how good the operation is how technical yes This is impressive, the plants look very good and healthy, everything is organised very well. what techniques they are using what they're doing\u00a0with the plants they have cleaning the plot and\u00a0\u00a0 new plants are coming now so they have the cycle\u00a0going boom boom boom boom how far they space them\u00a0\u00a0 how how they feed them how they grow them in\u00a0general and it's really amazing to see the\u00a0\u00a0 development here because this is a place that\u00a0is very natural very organic yet very high\u00a0\u00a0 tech in a way even though it's a simple simple\u00a0construction you can see that every technique\u00a0\u00a0 is applied properly and total so it's very well\u00a0planned the logistics are amazing and the size\u00a0\u00a0 like this the logistic is very impressive.... and\u00a0so can you describe like the strain of weed that\u00a0\u00a0 they're growing here like.... this one is the nicoles\u00a0kush it's been created by our friend elgato and it's very particular plant because it's really\u00a0\ncushy you can definitely smell the cushion it but\u00a0\u00a0 it's a lot more fruity a lot more flour in the\u00a0\nsmell than just regular cushion right it loses\u00a0\u00a0 some of that earthy feeling of the kush and it\u00a0\ngains some fruitiness very special it's and the\u00a0\u00a0 fruitiness is about a flavor thing not about like\u00a0\nabsolutely but it's mostly about flavor talking\u00a0\u00a0 about the effect we smoked it already yesterday\u00a0\nyeah it was really strong really physical\u00a0\u00a0 right... like a kush should be very uh very body relaxing very\u00a0couch-locking... right so and it's a sativa or ...no\u00a0\u00a0 it's more of an indica it's a hybrid technically\u00a0\nit's not a pure indica but it's more towards the\u00a0\u00a0 indica side of the spectrum than towards sativa...\u00a0and what does that mean exactly... it means the\u00a0\u00a0 the sativa plant and the indica plant are the two\u00a0\nextreme on the spectrum and then let's say 99.9 of\u00a0\u00a0 all strains that you see around are actually\u00a0\nhybrids in between these two extremes right\u00a0\u00a0 pure sativa and pure indica are very difficult to\u00a0\nfind maybe impossible because of the evolution of\u00a0\u00a0 cannabis ...um and so what are we doing with the land\u00a0races can you explain that in uh in comparison to\u00a0\u00a0 what we're looking at here sure land races are\u00a0\ndifferent than this just because land rises have\u00a0\u00a0 not been influenced by external uh genetics the\u00a0\nland race is typical of one area for example in\u00a0\u00a0 this area we look for the verde limon land race\u00a0of colombia and it's something that is really\u00a0\u00a0 in this area for a long time when we say long\u00a0\ntime we mean maybe 50 maybe 100 maybe more years\u00a0\u00a0 without influences from external genetics so\u00a0\nwithout people bringing seeds from abroad from\u00a0\u00a0 other areas and starting cross-pollination.... and\u00a0why is that important to find those it's.important because it's creating a very important\u00a0database there are many land races around the\u00a0\u00a0 planet that are not preserved at the moment and\u00a0that contain very unique cannabinoid and terpene\u00a0\u00a0 profiles and these are or may be useful in the future\u00a0for creating new medicine ...right ... for sure useful in\u00a0\u00a0 the future to create new recreational strains\u00a0new flavors new effects and cannabis ...so do you\u00a0\u00a0 feel like it gives you a leg up on the competition\u00a0to like go out and find these land races because\u00a0\u00a0 your palette is sort of bigger ....the bigger the\u00a0library of genetics the better the breeding can be\u00a0\u00a0 and so you're excited to see these again\u00a0because you can bring them back to Amsterdam\u00a0\u00a0 sure and then start working on ..working with it\u00a0..of course ....selecting first the individuals that\u00a0\u00a0 deserve attention and then inbreeding them uh with\u00a0themselves so preserving the real genetics right\u00a0\u00a0 or using the genetic from crossings\u00a0\nfinding something that can go good with it\u00a0\u00a0 try a cross see an f1 hybrid generation select\u00a0\ninteresting individuals from that generation and\u00a0\u00a0 create something new ...and why do you love creating\u00a0something new ...because cannabis is about variety\u00a0\u00a0 the beauty of cannabis the power of\u00a0\ncannabis is its variety it's the fact\u00a0\u00a0 that there are so many flavors so many effects\u00a0\nmedicinal and recreational um it's a plant but\u00a0\u00a0 it's not one plant it's thousands of plants and\u00a0\nwe contribute to this and for us for us this is\u00a0\u00a0 what we do this is who we are this this is why we\u00a0call ourselves strain hunters and this is why we\u00a0\u00a0 we put passion in what we do .....then you're kind\u00a0of like crazy scientists too because you're like\u00a0\u00a0 searching the world for all these\u00a0\nthings.... i like to say breeder you know\u00a0\u00a0 farmers that's what we are right\u00a0\nwe're not really scientists so here you have five one two three four\u00a0\nfive six seven eight nine so you have 50\u00a0\u00a0 clones but these are gigantic ones the\u00a0\nadvantage of this stuff is that you have\u00a0\u00a0 a much quicker start you have a very very healthy\u00a0clone with a big root ball the stronger the root\u00a0\u00a0 ball the better the plant goes you know and if you\u00a0\nhave a plant like this going you probably save two\u00a0\u00a0 weeks on the growth because it's like really\u00a0uh vigorous and powerful you know it will boom\u00a0\u00a0 it will shoot up look also they save them\u00a0\nten days of growth had those clones there then\u00a0\u00a0 you can already from this mother cut\u00a0\nthis size yeah directly cut this size look how strong it is you can bend them\u00a0\nand like they don't correct that nothing\u00a0\u00a0 the quality of the clones\u00a0\nis like really really strong\u00a0\u00a0 let's see and also here the old style razor\u00a0\nblade yeah you see still do it yeah look at\u00a0\u00a0 that look here is the old style razor blade yeah\u00a0look look there are all over the place they're all\u00a0\u00a0 over the place you see them lying here so\u00a0you use those the way they clean them they\u00a0\u00a0 take off all the little stuff also like the same\u00a0the same in the glass house this is still how i\u00a0\u00a0 operate and we are one of the few and he took it\u00a0over look also in the clones the air goes through\u00a0\u00a0 you know and you only need the top you know so it\u00a0really shoots up it's fantastic yeah great system\u00a0\u00a0 before they go in the ground you take all what\u00a0you're not gonna need and the only thing we leave is just\u00a0 a little top this is how we put them and then\u00a0they shoot up this big right like this big yeah also you can see the nutrients it's like\u00a0\nreally really perfect here's hardly any red\u00a0\u00a0 hard wood you know it's like fucking strong jeez the only way to get in here is\u00a0\nbecause of our friend El Gato\u00a0\u00a0 otherwise it would be like a mission impossible\u00a0\nyou need trust for months to get trust with the\u00a0\u00a0 local people because through our connections and\u00a0\nel gato here in colombia we can get in very quick\u00a0\u00a0 and very easy unfortunately last night one\u00a0of the second men of FARC got killed so we\u00a0\u00a0 bought the newspaper we just bought the newspaper\u00a0because we got an sms that they wanna have the newspaper and this could give some kind of friction because\u00a0of course when somebody gets kids the tensions are\u00a0\u00a0 a little bit high so we'll see how it goes down\u00a0today...it was not far from here...yeah it was 100\u00a0\u00a0 k's away from here where the second man of the\u00a0\nFARC got killed yesterday with six other rebels so we'll see how this comes out they know better\u00a0than anyone else where we can find the more\u00a0\u00a0 isolated patches the ones that have been really\u00a0inbreeding the areas where one family controls one\u00a0\u00a0 big field and every year they keep planting and\u00a0planting and planting from that field and making\u00a0\u00a0 seeds in the same field ...right ...and that's when we\u00a0know we are on to something really special maybe somebody's going to put\u00a0\nan m16 in your culio tonight so so wow The most important thing (Spanish spoken at\nstart) We\u2019ve been waiting the whole day, it was\nreally really long but luckily Gato\u2019s connection came through We spoke to the community leader and tomorrow\nmorning at 5\u2019oclock we\u2019re going to leave. Oscar Where are you? Nice nice Where are you? Nice nice Where are you? I\u2019m in the fucking boat. I don\u2019t know we\u2019re going to fish sharks,\nno? I\u2019m in the fucking boat I\u2019m in the fucking boat We are trying to legalize this plant because\nit\u2019s under oppression so we're giving out the political message to states how we think\nthey should deal with the matter and also we have a voice for all the poor farmers around\nthe equator. So that their case is being heard. Because in this case of 200 million people\nnobody\u2019s giving attention to we think is a very important case. (Spanish spoken) Pop rock. Marijuana. Colombian gold. It\u2019s a little bit over with marijuana? (Inaudible) And you see the fan? The fan is to keep the fucking fire on. Yeah terrible What a system hey. What a system man,. Look how they keep the oil? Yeah they try to take the most oil off. It\u2019s a world of breeding and seeds and fertilizers\nand grow shops where you can buy marijuana because for them everything is completely\nillegal. In our case we are like semi-legal so we,\nyou know. yeah. All these things together you know. You rock up to a place and you have to explain\nall these things to really find the golden egg Yeah. Every day is a great day. Huh? Good answer, good answer mate. You should be a fucking politician man. Have a party. We are somewhere inland of Santa Marta . We\nhave a standby situation because of a shooting and conflict in the area so we are just trying\nto figure out if we can get in to a field. So we are here now contacting the local guides\nfor accessing the fields. The fields are Colombian Gold and Punto Roja. And we're going to visit group of militia\nand local paramilitaries that we\u2019re going to ask to help us and to guarantee our safety\nhere. So this one is heavy. It\u2019s Strain Hunters Colombia. Ripe organic star fruit. I didn\u2019t buy it in a shop. So we just arrived at the camp. And that I was speaking to the owner now. And then we're going to visit his field then\nwe\u2019re gonna see how many plants there are. What kind of variety. It\u2019s all looking good we had a nice one\nhour hike up the mountain. And some star fruit. And some star fruit on the way. We find some shrooms. Some mushrooms . Some Colombian cumbenis . We\nfound 3 of them like on my tattoo. 123 beautiful . We\u2019re gonna see what comes out of here. It\u2019s all looking good. (Spanish speaking) Here Si.. So Si what do you think? Do you see all the little red dots . it looks\nlike here we find the original Puta Roja and the Sierra Nevada . This is really really\ngreat Marijuana and this is one of the tasks of our mission to bring back these seeds. Arjan I get something different, slightly\nslightly in the sativa that I haven\u2019t smelled before I can\u2019t put my sort of figure out\nwhat it is You smell really the citrus through and all\nthe other essence. Yeah We have it. We have the original Punta Roja seeds . These\nhave the dots . The typical signature of this strain before the maturation and the seed\ndevelops . okay Man this is it Punta Roja. Original Colombian sativa landrace. Here\u2019s the original puna Roja seeds guys. Fantastic. So dark hey? Beautiful . Very ripe. Smell the citrus. Yeah the smell yeah . That\u2019s the smell of the grass I smoked when\nI was a kid that make you laugh . Yeah yeah yeah. This is wakey weed. Wakey weed you call it? Fucking wakey weed that make you laugh forever\nlike LSD. Everything was stupid when you smoke that\nshit you know, You laugh like an idiot. Laughing a lot. Now it\u2019s time to smoke. Who doesn\u2019t put filters in? Franco this is really really really unusual\nthese calyxes. Quite bizarre Franco Massive and the Trainwreck makes really really\ncool calyxes like this. It\u2019s got that beautiful hazey smell but\nthere\u2019s like a mango . Oscar take a picture of these , how\u2019s these calyxes? It\u2019s incredible. Incredible hey? Right here we have the original Colombian\nGold. You see the neighbour is dark green and she\u2019s\npale. The difference in colour is really visible. It\u2019s a golden yellowish type of plant, the\nbud also . Colombia gold look here you can see there ? young Colas. Young cola . Wow Americans call Cola\u2019s. When this one closes up. It\u2019s a fucking Cola. Fox tail you know? All full and this long you know? So Americans used to call it Cola\u2019s. Really resistant. Colombia Gold. Broad more top. More in the middle of Northern Colombia. It\u2019s really famous. It\u2019s part of the 70\u2019s culture. that's awesome we take more seeds of this This plant is the right environment and is\na 2 kilos plant. Oh really? Really fucking big Cola\u2019s . 2 kilo plants? Here Franc Mangos , lemony and really long flowering\nseason plant fields a lot You really feel things You know what in America in the 60\u2019s and\nthe 70\u2019s a pound of this used to be between 16 and 18 cola\u2019s Damn Like a fucking salami size Damn Big sensimillia when the gringos live\nhere before the violence started Then cocaine appears and shit kills the marijuana\nbusiness When did that happen? When did the marijuan? In the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s no early 60\u2019s and\nlate 70\u2019s this thing was over because cocaine arrives and the violence from south americans\nthat used to come to this area to buy good pot A lot of good people get rich . A lot of people\nget benefits from marijuana. The violence arrives and some Americans that\nused to live in the private airports you know?. ith the little planes full of money and buy\nthe pot and came back to the states And some of them get killed and the other\nreason was the operation Green merchant That americans That was in 1981 no? Yeah so Americans developed green merchant\nthrough America and Colombia and they gave us the The spray . The spray so a lot about pots\nare arriving to the states and the hippies start to block our product and the mexican\nproduct and they start to develop with their collections. The seedless. They have the skills in the west side of America\nand the canadians and what ever. Some of the europeans You know the rest . You\u2019re\npart of fucking story so you know . So this is really a landrace strain front course a long **** call us sees the\nbeginning of the flooring so you can't tell how big is going to be these options what\nyou also and what you also share with the pharmacology Americans killed all the marijuana\nand courage to cocaine to come to America totally so it was it was the same. I'm going to bring to what they need yeah\nduring the meeting okay strong. Credible agents are incredible incredible\nthat's aged our insurance doesn't say. A panel of the world this image is let's even\ntry to use it here and then later to cocaine trade came up as a part of life you do repression\nwould you get back sometimes as a government and all Americans. That's American way. If you guys go. We're not all that. Linda was giving us. Look at this man why you **** Korea under. While. Is mildew at the front of the national park. One is mailed out man far. Smilla's walls. All the mail that **** man man I yeah I need\nto read. The rest of. And this mill worker for drugs. One. 74. Okay. That's. The resident on the night of the box. Look of these men your look here man lutea\nlook at the leaves this month and this can be a little less a Los Angeles the call from\nthe airport the. Well done thank you we that don't. Yeah. Ross militia. Really strong hello my friend because there\nare some of this for us and that the quality of the crystal. Email address a lot because a lot of. New deliveries not bring the crosses it is. H.. This. For instance. This is why. Love say Oscar because of Fadi Frank right\nHey man Hey Melissa this is me now you can say. I don't want to. We don't. Well there's room for everyone good. Thank. 3. Greed has poisoned. Hispanic a double. Steps to miss. We have developed speed. I did manage to come up with the power on\nagain a couple of hours. What did you think that that is the minimum. What was the original. Maybe somebody's gonna put em 16 you could. We are living history. We are privileged because\nwe get to really be in the time of change. We are not really seeing it clearly now because\nwe live it. But in a hundred years from now... kids will read on their digital books or whatever\nthey\u2019ll have about the time of prohibition and the end of prohibition and the change\nand we are the guys who pushed that change and we are witnessing it through. Early in my life I started breeding with plants And when I started breeding it\u2019s like cooking.\nYou create new varieties. It\u2019s a bunch of stoners , it\u2019s a bunch\nof smugglers, pirates, growers, breeders\u2026 Wow look at the fields there.\nHuge pot fields.. Huge pot fields man.\n-Yeah look straight up there. -Now you know why we came back.\n-So everywhere you\u2019re looking right now you can see marijuana fields.\n-You see huge marijuana fields. You see this is a much bigger cultivation area than the\nother areas and this was one of the main reasons I said we have to conquer these mountains\nAnd that\u2019s why I went through all these militias to ask permission.\n-Oh look at that! They have the knowledge of this area more\nthan anyone else Of the farming of this area because the farming\nproduces them money So, they know better than anyone else where\nwe can find the more isolated patches The ones that have been really inbreeding\nThe areas where one family controls one big field and every year they keep planting and\nplanting and planting from that field And making seeds in the same field\n-Right. And that\u2019s when we know we have, we are\non to something really special. -Because the inbred ones are the most..\n-The real landrace. Not touched just inbreeding with each other from one location for a while.\n-Some areas it\u2019s going from generation to generation 60, 70, 80 years\n-In the same place . In the same place. Making seeds\nIn the same place with the same farmers and the same family going on for ages Where you\u2019re getting access is such a feared\nto get in area That just you and maybe you know..\nNot every white people go there so it\u2019s untouched.\nIt\u2019s a very special access . Yeah Lower here they can receive seeds from white\npeople but up there is -It\u2019s our privilege.\n-Yeah it\u2019s a privilege - Yeah that\u2019s the other really great thing Heiko.\nYou know that\u2019s the other really good thing here. We\u2019re going into an area where nobody ever basically went into to really find the original\nland races because this area is just too far and to dangerous for anybody to go in\nSo we\u2019re gonna. It\u2019s completely restricted\nYeah it\u2019s completely restricted and prohibited for anybody to go in\nEven the army doesn\u2019t come for half an hour anymore up here in this area\nIt\u2019s completely forbidden So from a professional point of view as a\nseed breeder It\u2019s very very interesting to see how this\nhas been developed for the last 30 years. This area and to see what happened to\nthe original land races here of the Verde Limon Without El Gato we would have not been here.\n- No.. no. It would have been a much longer mission for us\nto find somebody else to get in here. It would have taken months to build peoples trust. - Pot porno we call it.\n- Right. - There's a lot of pot porn when you're out in the pot fields.\n- Yeah. It's really Mango Biche. Is this Mango Biche?\n- Yeah totally Mango Biche. Totally! Totally!\n- You don't see different pheno's? Like in the other place? Mango Biche man.. Stop! Wait, wait!\nHold on, hold on! When I was young I learned very early, around 10 years old,\nwhen one starts to learn, that here was a very productive land, here we grow coffee, we grow bananas, we grow yuca, corn, lulu, tomatoes,... it is a very productive land. Unfortunately because the politicians from this country abandoned us and never looked after the poor class citizens, the middle class of citizen, or the poor farmers, the poor indigenous, Because they had nothing else to survive, and to make a living from,  people went towards the coffee, As a result after a while appeared the Coffee Committee that made them change to the coffee strain Caturra, and after that came more strains of coffee, very good and very productive, but then they showed us how to work with chemical nutrients, so you had to buy the chemical nutrient and the yield was good. But What happened? they also brought the first disease affecting the coffee that was called La Roya, when they caught La Roya they would lose leaves and production, but once the people would treat it with Urea, the leaves would come back and start producing coffee again. That is not the result they were expecting as they wanted to beat down the poor producers. So what happened is they brought in, La Broca, what the broca does is it eats down the coffee bean, From there everything really went badly because the coffee production was so bad and low that the Coffee committee wouldn't buy coffee from any of the small producers. That is when the community turned to the production of what we see here, marijuana and coca, because at that time it was the only thing that could give a little income to survive In what year was this sir?\n- This was in 1978-79 until the 80\u2019s, that\u2019s how we arrived there. Since then the government has never\nlooked at us like we needed help and instead they are crushing us down with military oppression, With all the money, the government is only focused on crushing the poor farmers and the poor people, through military oppression Here what the people really need is access to lands, There are many people that don\u2019t have lands, me for example I  don\u2019t have any land, I rent every month from an owner that has something and that\u2019s how I survive, but if we look down here behind me, There are better lands, but they are in the hands of capitalism in the hands of the mono-cultures, here it could be the best cultures of corn or wheat, but they only grow cannabis this is how we arrived there. The process of going from growing coffee to this at the end of the 70\u2019s, how long did it take? Did it happen very fast over a few years or did it go little by little? This went slowly here, because like we said before, the people here started to know about marijuana around the year 1978 Yes Later, the people from here in La Cominera a few growers started with a few hundred, 200 plants because they realized that marijuana could also sell and give some money as the coffee was not selling anymore, and when they saw the first farmers got their first money from the first batches, the other farmers started to think, I will grow too, and from their it expanded and became what it is now but the cultivators have also changed since then. Thank you very much - Thank you very much\n-  Thank you For how long have you been growing? Since I was very young, since I was 12. - Since he was 12\n- Since he was 12 Yes This is psychoactive because it has more calyxes it's really fucking pheno hunting This is not so red but it has purple calyx Full purple calyx Strange bud - Quite big\n- Wow This is nice the terpenes Yeah purple. Purpleish Really nice purple calyx yeah Wow man This smells like a purple, really Yeah it does smell purple We have purple buried in the highlands too because of the cold and because of genetics - Right\n- Mexico and Colombia have purple buried because of that. Because they grow in high altitudes. - Yeah and this one is gonna be more purple\n- This one you can tell These 2 plants yeah - But this one is also really nice\n- Really natural purple plant Yeah - Really natural purple plant See if you can get seeds from those too Something flew in my ear look it's a fucking animal look I just took it out of my ear This is incredible. Strain Hunters Colombia The Mango Biche in the Calca region near Corinto city. This is the Corinto area This incredible field of Mango Biche Where we accidentally found the pure original Punta Roja plant - So a double win - A real double win today here\n- It's great here We came back to this area because we were not allowed to access it a few days ago So we had to change our plan. Change the mission path. But accidentally it ended up being a good path because here we found exactly the 3rd land race that we missed The verde limon that is called Mango Biche here and we found the best Punta Roja plant up until now So it's a double whammy When it started, in the year 89 they performed an eradication that didn\u2019t offer any solution. The Colombians or the Americans? From the Colombian government to the farmers, they came almost up to here in La Cominera And eradicated some of the plantations up here. For example here they came and cut down everything piled it up and burned it. But they never came and offered some help with seeds to replace the cultivation's - They only came to cut and nothing else?\n- Nothing, no seeds, nothing So after that people kept growing because it was there only chance to survive, - even until nowadays,\n- Of course, of course And now with the marijuana cultivators that we have that are feminized, that are faster and more productive, And the ones that we can grow in the greenhouses, The ones that can will grow it like this in greenhouses, - and the ones that can\u2019t grow like this\n- Naturally She's explaining how the growers who have the possibility\nall use glasshouses now with lights And the ones who grow naturally like this are the ones who just can't afford to convert to lights Because in the last few years there's been less repression,\nso the people are more free to operate And she said the repression started in 1989,\nthe first eradication programs And they went full gas for a while and then\nless and less and less. Gray-blue.. beautiful. Man, they smell really mango like.. It's.. purple.. It smells purple.. It's nice how the purple is in the bud here.. Grape We have 42 types of marijuana here, what we are looking for the most is land-race, We are looking for the old original seeds of Colombia, the punta roja, the Mango Biche, original. The original, yes we have no problem - It\u2019s common. We have a few of these originals here.\n- Good You know what i think we should do? We should move on quickly to another field.. Because this is pretty young and maybe the other\nones are a little bit older and we can see more bud. There is nothing in the seven days\nwe've been here, that can beat this. This is a full flowering land-race massive field. That is like hectares Maybe somebody's gonna put an M16 in you Coolio tonight Oscar Come on! Oscar we need you to film from up there Yeah, come on McDonald's boy Hey! It's for you McDonald's boy We got the hook up You see that? Do you see that? That is the Mango Biche That is the original Verde Limon in Colombia We are 2047 metres above sea level Wow! - 2047?\n- Yeah - You don\u2019t know what awaits you.\n- Okay - Seeds that come from other places - are sometimes defective\n- Yes because they grow them with fungicides. Yes - I don\u2019t use fungicides here, the seeds have to be original, natural.\n- He doesn't... He doesn't use fungicides, he doesn't use pesticides - It's all natural and he says when people bring seeds from other areas they need pesticides and fungicides They don't do well here - Aha\n- The only ones that do well here are the ones made here So it's a real local landrace And what's the name of it? Is this Mango Biche? Is this Mango Biche? - Yes, Mango Biche\n- Mango Biche The name of that one is Mango Biche Now they are taking out the seeds. And how long has he been growing? He said phew Did he learn from his father or from his.... Did he learn from his father or from his grandfather? Is it something that is learned from father to son? Yes, I will be busy being the boss of this whole plantation for generations What did he say? - That like, he is busy with all these mountains here for generations\n- Yeah, yeah, yeah How... How long ago did they start growing marijuana here.. Does he know the history like In what year was marijuana grown in this area? How many... - When did they first begin cultivating marijuana in this area?\n- Oh... My first marijuana crops were about twenty years ago - But it wasn't me who started it\n- Yes Before me they had already been growing it for a long time He started 20 years ago but there was already a lot going on before that when he was not a grower There is nothing from the 7 days that we've been here That can beat this This is a full flowering landrace massive field There is like hectares and it's not full anymore because they have been harvesting already But this is like 2 or 3 hectares like.. Twenty, thirty-thousand plants and then you know that you're going to a find a champion there if you look long enough Verde Limon here we come Original in Colombia - This is the pinnacle of the pussy\n- 2000 2058 metres above sea level Full of pot - Do you see the Christmas tree down there?\n- yeah, the Christmas tree there? Let's have a look first before we walk up Do you see the really long one there on the left? - with the never ending cola?\n- Oh yeah.. - Pointing towards us\n- Yeah. Yeah - In the middle of...\n- Yeah That one - Those look fluffy. They're big but they look fluffy\n- Yeah - No, no, there. The Christmas tree in the upper left.\n- Look up at the top on the right - Yeah\n- And there.. - Do you see that long cola sticking out there?\n- yeah, yeah.. - There's 2 or more in the front there\n- And there's another Christmas tree here in the front - 20, 30 metres down\n- Down - Wow! Green mango full, full...\n- Yes, yes, yes, Mango Biche Look at this King Look at this - and it's weeks to run\n- Weeks and weeks Wow Yeah This is a fucking good haze indoors Yeah Smell, smell So... This one will run 16 to 20... weeks indoor? - Do you see that?\n- Fuck Fucking good hazes man Does it have many seeds? Yes? Good, we've got seeds Just a few, just a few Right Barrito, is the amount of seeds good? Very well fucking sexed Who was in charge of this crop? I think this plant is very good, look. Yes, very good This one smells almost like metal. Metallic... - You know when you take the metro\n- Yeah, yeah, yeah - And you have the smell of the\n- The copper or the... grinding metal on metal That's how it smells What are you getting from here? Oh, where's that Christmas tree we saw - when we were walking in earlier\n- Wow this has also got a strange smell - You carry the seeds, but separately.\n- Yes, yes, yes, yes - Yes, yes, I understand\n- Separate do you understand? Here we have the original Mango Biche and this is a plant that a lot of people have been looking for for 25 years but here it is in the mountains of Cauca and our friend Barrito is taking them out This is a fungus that attacks the plant. Smells like mango First squeeze and then smell - Oh my god! it smells like lemon grass\n- Yeah bro - It's lovely, lovely, lovely..\n- Okay, I'm going to go for a little walk Simon - Smell the difference between these 2\n- Let's go look for another few pheno's Where's that Christmas tree we saw when we walked in - Where do you come from?\n- From The Netherlands - And are you a marijuana grower\n- Yes The plants that they have already harvested and dried we can see how much they have next door So they work the whole year round because it's 12/12 here - I'm Franco - Is Franco\u2019s hat funny? Its laughable.  If I were him I wouldn\u2019t wear it to school. What do you think about? - How old are you Jose?\n-  Eight years old. - And do you help with the crops a little?\n- Yes. And what do you do? Do you help to plant? Yes, I help to sow. Very well, and how do you plant them? - I take them...\n- Yes - I put the solution on them I mix them very well\n- Yes - Then I make a hole in the ground and I put them in it - very good, very good And when they harvest the crop - Do you also help to clean the plant?\n- Yes. Okay.. - Do you like the plant?\n- Yes - Do you like how smells?\n- Yes And is there more than one type of plant? Are there different plants? Yes, what are their names? We harvest the marijuana The regular ones or which ones? Yes, the regular ones What is the difference between the two types? I can't talk about this Okay - Good - Very good.\n- Amazing Good job! Ask him if his friends also help him Do you have more friends of the same age who help you? Are there more kids like you who help with this? I have friends but there are down there . Okay Stay in school, school is very important. Work with marijuana for the money but don\u2019t quit school, its very important. - Okay\n- Okay and they had no other choice than to grow cocoa and to grow marijuana because the flatland was taken away their crops were taken away and they kicked them back into the mountains and this is what happened to the local people and it's good to see that... and to also tell that story... because in our western civilisation... we only hear the story from one side It's always the capitalist sides and we call these people guerillas We call the terrorists We call them communists We give them all kinds of names But in the end most all these people in the world are just poor and farmers and surviving on what they're making for themselves and again here is another example of how hard these people have to suffer because of government things and - Capitalist\n- You can spend a week... reading books or websites about Colombia and Colombia's history and struggle... and you will not learn what we have learned in a week on the ground here listening to people. Seeing the faces Seeing on their skin what they go through and feeling on our skin the tension in the air or the good vibes in the air You learn a lot from that as a human being. As a grower It's a green avalanche you can't stop it and we believe it's the right thing to do We really believe it - Yeah\n- No... Nobody can tell me that it's legal or illegal. It's just the right thing and you know when it's the right thing I have no nails Right We got him Let's see... Shit dude. That's... - A Colombian tick\n- Look at that fucker. Yep A Colombian tick with a whole lot of THC from your blood Okay for the final... This thing has been on me for 2 days Okay and I go to Simon being like dude help me out here man like I don't know what to do like am I fucked here? and he's like no bro. No it's cool I get like 10 a day and I just kinda just leave them on man like 10 a day Like oh well you know Fuck, that's great advice man I'll just leave it on What did he ask you? Like don't the guys get offended when when you call them gorilla You know like. What guys? Who did we call a gorilla? - Yeah the Big guys? What the fuck?\n- It's a little bit disrespectful. No? I didn't look at shit. I took the plane - I am here with a fucking camera\n- Look, look - Do you think I am looking at wikipedia for one week?\n- But everybody forgets... - If I come here it's...\n- The guy is speaking English for only one year - If I come here and there is a Tyrannosaurus rex\n- Hey - I would believe it. No problem\n- But also if you only speak English for one year Don't forget You see... Check it out dude Those records and those tapes that compose that wall there are from the same years that the Punta Roja and the Colombian Gold became famous - An extension on the \u201cplan Colombia\u201d came out.\n- Please The 'Colombia plan' was the program that the government launched when Andres Pastrana was president, an eradication plan to supposedly improve the quality of life of indigenous people and peasants. And we realized that this was not really the idea of the 'Colombia Plan'. The true idea of plan was to create military bases, high mountain military bases. - Is it to control the territory?\n- Yes, it is to control the territory and that has affected us a lot because there are daily battles and in the end we civilians suffer the consequences who have nothing to do with the armed conflict. The Colombian plan has followed a control of illicit crops it has been a military control a military takeover in the entire department of Cauca, and that has been the conflict we have had to deal with So we peasants say that these crops that we call illicit but are really subsistence crops for us . Because there are nothing else? and you don\u2019t see here only marijuana and coca, you can also see here coffee, corn, banana, yucca. Here the big problem we have is land tenure Land ownership here is tenacious because whoever owns the land has only 30 percent For example, there are people who have 6 arable lands but have 8 children It is not enough. The land does not grow but the family does. - Very interesting.\n- That is why we tell the national and international government that we want to change in the productive part but first we have to change land tenure because there really is no where to cultivate an expansion of territory is needed. And that only the government can do, right? Yes, that\u2019s why we say we need a development plan a life plan and a survey for know how many of us are in our municipality, who doesn\u2019t have land who does. Who has health and a house because none of us have a good house. We all live in houses made of wattle and daub which fell, destroyed by armed conflict. And that has been the big problem that we have here in the department of Cauca, land tenure. I sincerely want this to change because the only thing we are living now is a military occupation and there is nothing do to about this. Our children have no options So some of then go to the army because they have nothing to do or go in others ways. - Looking for other jobs?\n- Yes, here aren\u2019t many opportunities, many people leave here For this reason we ask the government for a change not just for Cauca\u2019s department, for all Colombia. I honestly think that the government should look at the interest of future generations our children\u2019s children. What will happen to this conflict that we are living today? When we die, what are we going to leave for our children? Many people think future is coming but future is part of what we make before. That\u2019s why we want to government to realise who it is really owns the land. - It's a human right.\n- It's a human right - It's a constitutional right\n- Yeah, is a constitutional right Here is my friend if you want to ask something else for your movie. Thank you very much Maybe somebody's gonna put an M16 in your coolio tonight", "JAKkzCfKiWw": "the next speaker is dr. mark Edwin he's one of our physicians in palliative medicine and he's gonna talk today about the use of marijuana in healthcare you know across the ten years we've been doing this symposium this has always been one of the biggest topics that comes up in the audience Q&A and we've actually never done a formal talk on it before so we thought it was a high time that we go ahead and talk about this topic so thank you dr. Brice I have to say I'm a little relieved that I'm not going to be asked go or no go in terms of cannabis in the use of healthcare so thank you for the invitation to present today and I'd like to give each of you an overview of cannabis and let you come to your own conclusions of whether it's a go or no-go my goal this morning is to present some of the studies some of the risks and a little bit of the legislative aspects of it and let you decide if it's high time or not so marijuana what is it a plant originating in Central Asia a pharmaceutical agent a street drug a political battleground full credit all of the above yes exactly so this is a topic that generates lots of interesting conversation in my office I work in the Department of palliative medicine as dr. Bryce says so my role is really focusing on patients symptoms as they go through cancer care and some of those symptoms come from the disease some of those symptoms come from the treatment and it's a curious observation of mine to see patients are often reluctant to broach this question with their providers at Mayo Clinic and one of the points that I would like to underscore is that if this is part of your toolbox share it with your provider so that they know because like everything else that we're looking at we need to be mindful of the compounds that you're taking in whether it be the chemotherapy the nutrition like dr. North felt was talking about or a product like cannabis so be sure to be upfront with your providers about that so a little bit of the background what is it that we're talking about this morning marijuana is a product that comes from the cannabis plant and typically the plant that we're talking about is this one the cannabis sativa plant that was originally identified in Southeast Asia and it does have known psychomimetic properties but also has identified itself as having medicinal properties and that's really what we're interested in learning about and can those properties be maximized in the terms of your cancer care this is not a new conversation when we look back in the medical archives we see this conversation has been one that has gone back for millennia and has evolved slowly as other products have evolved cannabis is used globally for many people they use it recreationally we know that about 45% of high school seniors have dabbled with it in recreational use we know that about 20% of people use it globally for either recreational or medicinal uses yet it remains illegal in many countries all of us in this room are aware that this has become endorsed or at least legalized in state legislatures but continues to remain illegal from a federal standpoint one of the challenges that we as medical providers have in this conversation is brought about by this which is the Controlled Substances Act this was legislation that was passed on a federal level back in 1970 and at that time medications that were considered potentially harmful were classified in various schedules rated one through five five was considered relatively low risk but scheduled one was considered either the highest risk for addiction and/or showed no value in terms of medicinal benefit cannabis has been classified as a scheduled one substance and the reason that's important is that legally we cannot prescribe that people do get certifications but they don't get a prescription that you fill through a pharmacy more importantly from my standpoint is that as a scheduled one substance I need to either procure a specific license in order to study it or I'm precluded from doing so so I'd like to show you some of the studies that are available this morning but keep in mind these studies are very difficult to do they're very difficult to fund they're difficult to recruit for because of this scheduling designation by the Controlled Substances Act so a little humor along the way can you prescribe marijuana to help me with the boredom of sitting in your waiting room hopefully that doesn't happen at Mayo Clinic so one of the things I wanted clarify too is what are we talking about when we talk about cannabis use and I think for each of us depending on our own backgrounds see this as a different product is it a recreational drug is it something that is has a proclivity for addiction and we need to be cautious of is it a medicinal tool that might come into play in our armamentarium for cancer treatments and it's that latter one that I'd really like to talk about a little bit more detail cannabis is a botanical this is historically been recognized in a number of the products that we use so when we look at common use tools like morphine and aspirin these have all evolved from botanicals that have been identified and purified and used regularly and I think there's been a shift over the last ten years to kind of embrace this philosophy and how we manage multiple diseases and when we look at natural products does anybody recognize this plant so not every plant that we can identify is healthy so this of course is tobacco and we have recognized multiple risks associated with tobacco's so I think it's important that we do have a degree of skepticism when we look at these botanicals can they be beneficial but also like every prescription that I might provide you or any of our colleagues today what's the potential downsides of that also keeping in mind that with each of these products they fall outside of the purview of the Food and Drug Administration so there's no oversight in terms of purity or quality in the products that you might per cure from a dispensary so keep that in mind as a side note and part of one of the conversations that I have with my patients is use a healthy degree of skepticism not just in what I say but in products that are not screened for purity or quality this is a study that was published by our colleagues in Canada at the University of Guelph that looked at products that were identified as botanicals and they used DNA analysis to see does the product that is taken off the shelf contain what is advertised on the label and if so is it pure this was done with 44 products that were purchased both in the US and Canada and it's a little disturbing for me that 34 percent of the products contained none of the advertised ingredient that was on the label and about half of contained contaminants which may not seem like a concern except for those who have significant allergies such as nut or fish or perhaps a gluten intolerance so my point with sharing this with you is just use a degree of skepticism when you're purchasing these products or if you go to a dispensary and are getting information from one of the providers there so let's talk a little bit more about the plant and what it is that will be discussed if you choose to use this tool and visit a dispensary in the marijuana plant there are about 400 compounds a hundred of which are identified as cannabinoids the two products that are mentioned most frequently are the two that you seen here THC and CBD these are the products that are most prevalent in the plant and they're the compounds that are most biologically active in the plant THC has a propensity for more of the psychomimetic the high if you will CBD tends to have more qualities in terms of a pain reliever and also an anti-inflammatory when patients go into a dispensary and are looking at different products oftentimes they're given information about the ratio of THC to CBD or are looking for products that may be exclusively one of those two products I think that's reasonable but keep in mind purifying out the 400 other compounds is a challenge so you're probably getting some component of each well how does the cannabis products affect our body most of the time patients are now using these as oral preparations so there's a variety of edibles that people can purchase they can be taken in as gummy bears as teas as tinctures or oils and like most medications that I perscribed it takes about 45 minutes to an hour for that to be absorbed and have a physiologic effect and that effect may last for three to four hours it's not much of a departure from other things that that we utilize for patients who choose to inhale the product it can be taken in in two ways it can be either smoked where the plant is burnt or it can be vaporized so what does vaporization vaporization is where the plant is heated but not burned heated to the point that the products become aerosolized or become volatile and can be inhaled when you inhale the product the effect is much faster its absorbed directly into the bloodstream the clinical effect is within about 10 minutes oftentimes we caution people who may have a history of lung disease in avoid and definitely smoking because you're getting particulates from that so patients who have emphysema or COPD or a variety of other lung disease as we do caution against using the product that way cannabis is a fat-based compound so that characteristic allows it to be absorbed through the skin that's difficult to measure but for patients who use creams or topicals it will absorb through the skin over a period of hours so the one dog says is that grass yeah but I take it for medicinal purposes only so I'd like to show you just a sampling of studies and the way I have divided this is based on symptoms and as I present these studies you'll find a theme in these and the theme is this that the studies are very small and they're often difficult to kind of think gosh does that apply to me or not because they're done in groups that are close to cancer but not directly done consistently in cancer patients so there's a little bit of seeing if we can get that round peg in the square hole so let's go through these and I wanted to start out with pain this is that question that I get asked most oftenly and when we look at cannabis products this is an old study that was done in 1970 I'm going to make no reference to Terry Taylor but so this was a study that was done looking at volunteers who were using pain medications and trying to equate does cannabis compare to opioids in terms of pain relievers and what this author concluded is that in single doses 10 milligrams of THC is equivalent to about 60 milligrams of codeine or 20 milligrams of THC is about to be equivalent to a hundred and twenty milligrams of codeine now how do you put that into context on average if you were to smoke this if you were to take a joint of marijuana cigarette that contains about 8 to 10 milligrams of THC if we were to convert it to morphine which is kind of our prototype of opioid pain relievers it'd be about 8 milligrams of morphine so what does that mean the starting dose of morphine if I were to prescribe it comes as a 15 milligram tablet so this would be at about half a tablet of the lowest dose of morphine just to kind of give you a frame of reference this is where we may depart a little bit from oncology care and that's because many of these studies come from the University of California and San Francisco dr. Abrams up there is an integrative oncologist and has that specific license that you need to do scheduled one studies and he looked at a population of patients who had nerve pain specifically related to HIV nerve pain is probably the most challenging pain to control it's much harder to control from thence a cancer that might be pressing on another organ or a broken bone when you have damage to nerves it tends to be refractory to medication so it seems like a reasonable population to study so what dr. Abrams did was bring in patients who had previously used cannabis for recreational purposes and put them in a controlled environment and allowed them to use cannabis over a period of five days and quantified their pain in the medical world if we see pain go down by 30% that's a thumbs up that's a go if we can get your pain controlled by 30% then we're making some headway and what he found is patients who use cannabis had a significant improvement in their nerve related pain which then went back to normal when they stopped it this didn't seem to correlate with dose so he used two different doses 19 milligrams and 34 milligrams versus placebo curiously each of those groups showed some pain reduction the to cannabis doses were more effective but neither dose seem to be more potent than the other so it didn't seem to be directly related to dosage I put this up just as an incidence or a frequency that we see side effects and the reason I point this out is because as I look at each of the studies regard list of Wyatts used pain nausea appetite this side-effect profile seems to be repeated which is curious because when you look at the incidence some patients seem to have a higher risk of nausea or a higher risk of anxiety which is often why patients choose to use it and there appears to be a subset of the population that develops these specific side-effects we don't know why but it's a pattern that's pretty consistent across the variety of studies a question that I get asked often is gosh doc you know I'm taking this morphine or I'm taking this fentanyl my pain is still not great I can't do the things that I want the scenario that I find happens a lot I'm not sure why but it's usually my kids or my grandkids say I should try pot what do you think I'm not sure nobody seems to take full ownership of I'm thinking of trying it it's usually somebody my wife so anyway okay tell me what your grandson said but the question then comes up can I use cannabis along with my opioid insert whatever product you're taking so the group in California looked at this question can we combine cannabis with opioids and if so is it helpful is it conflicting what do we see and so what they looked at was the vaporized cannabis and this is one of the vaporization machines called a volcano so this is what the product that they used in this study and what they found was that in patients who were using opioids the addition of cannabis was synergistic meaning that one plus one didn't give us - one plus one gave us three there wasn't a change in the levels of opioids so it wasn't that it drove the morphine levels higher it seemed to be that by going through two different pathways to control pain there was an additive benefit without increased risk of side effects so that's reassuring to me these are very small studies but it doesn't raise any red flags that's good well what about nausea this is probably the indication that most people will tell me my grandson told me I should ask you about using cannabis so from the senior citizens really feeling my joints today me too as she holds me so oftentimes when people will reference cannabis studies and pot studies the one thing that I would caution you about as you google these or look on the Internet most of the studies that were comparing cannabis to see if it helps with cancer or chemo related nausea showed benefit but the caution is this what they compared it to was either placebo in other words nothing and of course cannabis was better or they compared it to the agents that we used a generation ago the agents that we know were not particularly effective for chemotherapy induced nausea so a lot of those studies are comparing apples and oranges so I would caution you against that the products that we use now have been compared in only one study and that's in this bar graph that I show you here which does cannabis help with nausea does zofran which some of you may be familiar with ondansetron control nausea is it better to use them in combination or placebo and what you can can see here from this graph is that the cannabis the zofran and the combination of the two were relatively equivalent across the board they were better than using nothing but none was sort of our out front go in dr. Northville terms none of them seem to be an outstanding choice so if people choose to use that that's not unreasonable it doesn't appear to be helpful if you're using other products that may have been prescribed by your doctor it's about the same so it's it's essentially a wash from when we compare it to the current nausea medications that the oncology team is using unfortunately that's the only clinical study that we have looking at nausea and cannabis the third area that I asked I see patients ask about is with appetite and again juniors coming in telling you he ate a whole bag of Doritos after he was smoking pot last night and you got to try this for your weight loss does that really does that really carry out one of the things that I would really import to you is that when you compare someone with cancer versus somebody who is going to university and they may both be using cannabis the process that's going on inside the body of that cancer patient is much different than a healthy person many of you there in the room already know that the impact of cannabis seems to be blunted in terms of regenerating appetite and regenerating intake of food so when we look at that if we try and study that this is a study that looked at around 250 patients that had a variety of cancers lung GI hematologic malignancies and they were given three options they were given the option of taking THC and CBD taking THC alone or they were given placebo nothing at all and then we measured did their appetite improve and did it improve their quality of life and what we found is that the impact of each of those products almost the same when measured in cancer patients I can tell you in my population when patients come in and have been using cannabis the feedback that I hear this is very anecdotal the feedback that I hear is that it may help with pain it might help with nausea there I can measure on one hand the number of patients who've told me it really helped them with their appetite and increase in food so it's disappointing particularly when patients have lost 30 or 40 pounds their family becomes increasingly concerned because clothes are loose people start to look ill family members or neighbors may start to ask how are you feeling and they're hoping to regenerate some of that appetite and it really has not matured to the point that we see that result so take-home points with regards to that as we don't see we see minimal effect with appetite and minimal effect on weight gain so let me shift just a little bit to some of the pragmatic aspects of using this product so in Arizona this was this law passed several years ago pipe just a hair of a margin 50.1 3% of the population voted to approve the use of cannabis as a medical product we were the 15th state to do so and it was implemented back in 2011 in this state you can qualify to get a medical marijuana card with any of the diagnosis you see listed there cancer glaucoma HIV ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease Hep C Crohn's and the rest that you can see most patients will qualify under the context of having a chronic symptom typically pain when you look at the state registry by far and away the vast majority of people procure a card based on having chronic pain so for patients who choose to pursue this they do have to go through the process which is done almost exclusively online all the forms are filled out online patients are asked to require to sign a consent saying that they will not divert the cannabis to anyone else in their family or friends they are allotted up to two and a half ounces every two weeks unless you live greater than 25 miles from a dispensary if that's the case then patients are allowed to grow their own plant and Arizona will recognize other states cards so for patients who travel from from California or another state that does have medical marijuana certifications Arizona does recognize those this does have to be renewed annually I don't remember the cost it used to be about a hundred and fifty dollars but that may have gone up like any compound that is taken in there are side effects we touched on that a little bit and you see those here in terms of dizziness confusion the curious side effect of nausea and anxiety some memory impairment and difficulty with concentration patients are cautioned against driving just as they would with any other compound that may affect reaction speed and for people who are looking at this literature there is some evidence that shows that there appears to be a higher risk of coronary events heart events so for patients who've had a history of heart disease or have had a recent heart attack that's something to be mindful of there's not a lot of clear cause and effect association but something to be mindful if that's applicable to you many people will think of cannabis and for those who have teenagers as I do that worry about is this a gateway drug is there risk of addiction becomes the forefront of their minds when we look at the risk of dependence it is there when you look at the studies from the federal government the National Institute against drug abuse and compared the incidence of addiction you'll see those listed there so the incidence of addiction to nicotine as around 32% heroin 2023 cocaine 17 alcohol 15 and marijuana is nine so curiously that is the lowest of the compounds that we often associate with other agents particularly with all the information that's in the news regarding opioids so kind of keep that in mind and this is that same data just in a different format so take-home points that I would like to leave with you today you know I will leave the thumbs up or thumbs down to each of you to think is this something that I want to have in my toolbox is it something that can complement what I'm using already just a note of caution that there is there is very limited oversight of that industry and the other caution that I would leave you with is that there is very little data looking at for patients who use cannabis particularly regularly how does it affect the blood levels of other compounds that you may be taking whether that be blood pressure medications diabetes medications or chemo therapies does it raise that level does it lower that level so always go in with a degree of caution because you can ask your physician is it safe and he or she does not have the data to answer that question so it is a let the buyer beware because we can't offer you great guidance on that but when we look at the data there does seem to be a role in terms of pain control in terms of nausea control but very little support that it may help with weight gain or appetite so for those of you who are research nerds like me here's some data that you can look at and I will be happy to be around later if you have any specific questions thanks so much [Applause]", "-8kPucbOdT8": "hey guys Nick with precision here and today we're at our partnered manufacturing facility outside of Dayton Ohio looking at our all new line of KPD series of industrial extractors [Music] precision first conceptualized the KPD series of extractors about two years ago when we saw the shift towards a large scale processing both in cannabis and hemp what we did at the time is we searched for the best most well qualified manufacturing partner that we could build an industrial scale modular extraction platform with we found AMG engineering in Dayton Ohio and they've been a pleasure to work with ever since we've combined our expertise in the cannabis and hemp manufacturing arena with their expertise in the AG reprocessing and Industrial Engineering competency and what that's allowed us to do is build a massive but easy to use modular processing center that can be dropped on the farm can be dropped into a building and it's very easy turnkey ready to operate so a lot of people ask why build a modular self-contained industrial extraction skid and the reasons are numerous the first one is that this whole apparatus that you see here takes four people to operate the second thing is it's extremely simple right it's plug-and-play you drop it and you can drop it onto a slab in a farm you can drop it into an industrial processing building or any number of easy turnkey solutions the flip side of this is people typically have unreasonable expectations when it comes to batch processing batch processing is extremely laborious and if you think about having seven or eight or nine extractors to be able to equal the throughput that something like this does you're talking about running those batch extractors 24 hours a day you're talking about having three shifts of people and you may well employ 40 50 60 employees in order to do the same work that four employees could do with a plant such as this so it's really oughta mating the process its streamlining your efficiencies and it's allowing you to operate a business with an extremely low overhead and as we all know that the price of commodities of THC and CBD eventually are declining it's very important to be able to operate your business with very low operational overhead costs to be able to make margin continually as these large players come in and put competitive pressures on the market so we've designed all this in mind when you look at the design of this extraction plant not only does it have the modularity but we'll talk about some of the efficiencies that this plant does as you can see behind me one of the components we have reflux stills so that your reap roofing your ethanol so you're not having ethanol loss we have a number of different high efficiency methods to take the ethanol back out of the biomass and any a number of these small problems that you run into a batch processing all these losses add up and we've designed this with our processing expertise and AMG's industrial manufacturing expertise to be the most efficient most effective way to extract and that's what you see here today [Applause] so now that you understand a bit about the concept of the KPD series of extractors why we built it how we built it how we conceptualized it let's take a look at some of the more technical components on how it operates and why it's so efficient so the first thing that we're gonna look at is our contacts motor control center and basically what this is it's the brain of the entire operation so what's gonna happen is this skid will be placed on a slab somewhere in a warehouse but your motor control center and your plant control center will be separate the reason that that's designed like that is to keep all the components that could come in contact with any solvent that are flammable it keeps the the risk level down basically so that those flammable vapors aren't coming in contact with any of your motor controls so let's take a look inside the control center so inside what you're going to see is you're going to see all your variable frequency drives you're gonna see all of your motor controls and ultimately this is all linked through one interface right so it's all computer-controlled everything on this entire plant you can see all your temperatures all your motor speeds all your input your output your discharge every single function within that plant is controlled from this brain so you can see on your wall all of your shut offs all of your VFDs all of your control panels all of your power input everything is controlled from this room so remembering our HMI interface and our computer brain interface from our con X you also have a display and a touch screen interface on the actual plant so not only can your controllers see what's going on from your control room your operators can see what's going on in the plant from your HMI interface on your actual machine so the process all starts here and basically what this is is you're gonna have your conveyor feeding in your biomass and this is the first step of the process this is a cooling screw conveyor so what will happen is you take your warm biomass and you cool down your biomass in order for when it hits the solvent it's not warming up the solvent obviously you're putting a massive amount of biomass into this extraction plant you're putting a massive amount of solvent so you can understand that the heat energy if the biomass is not properly cooled is going to raise the temperature of the solvent and therefore that affect the extraction efficiency and the extraction quality so what we do is passing it through here this is jacketed and it's controlled to about negative 40 degrees centigrade in order to cool the biomass and take some of that heat energy away to have a nice efficient consistent extraction so the next step in the process once the biomass is cooled you can see that it drops into this first extraction tank and basically what this is is a counter current ethanol extraction so you've got ethanol coming in from one side you've got your biomass coming in from the other if you have a set retention time they mix the solvent strips that cannabinoids from the plant and ultimately you have your micelle a stream coming out so biomass into your first tank solvent into your third tank and through the entire process they mix through the tanks until they're ultimately separated you will have your cannabinoids and solvent go to one area and you'll have your biomass go to another area so let's follow the stream of the cannabinoids through to the next step once your extraction process is started you're gonna have your micellar stream which we call my salad your cannabinoid and solvent mixture in your micelle a holding tank right here this folding tank is constantly going to be processed through your finds filtration which is going to take out most of your fine particulates that might clog your evaporator any residual waxes and we actually do that with not only the Candela filters and the michela but we use a pre-code as well so this precoat tank will have any number of three coats it could be diatomaceous earth it could be any number of absorbance or things like that that will actually pre coat your filtration and allow for a more pure more efficient extraction so let's take a look at how this all works you have your micellar coming here you have your pre coat tank coming here both of these streams are mixed and they're pushed upwards into our filtration mechanisms which are up here so let's have a look at those so once that micelle a stream is coming up here it's being pushed into our filters and these are three candle filters that basically are filtered with precoat coating the filter membrane and then we have our micellar coming right behind that and basically that's creating a filtration mechanism that's taking out all those impurities highly refining your masala stream ultimately your filters will become caked when they become caked after a number of hours could be a day could be three days could be you know 12 hours it really depends on the consistency of your biomass and how you're extracting what you're going to do is do a blowdown on your filters so these filters are extremely easy to clean as you can see the graded bottoms what you're gonna do is we're just gonna take a bucket or some sort of a bag discharge bag you're gonna wrap it around here and you're gonna do a blowdown to blow down the filter and all your discharge cake is gonna come out again same thing you have redundancy so if you're discharging one filter that the other filter is still in use so that you're never losing your continuous process so that takes us through our filtration step what we're gonna do once we have that micellar filtered and we have it clean we're gonna move on to evaporation and evaporation is the process of actually separating that solvent from the original cannabinoids that we have so it's no longer going to be a micelle a stream at this point we're gonna have crude oil and we're going to have solvent so the next step in our process is evaporation and as we stated evaporation is taking that micellar stream of your cannabinoids and your solvent and separating it so we're gonna take our micelle and separate it into two streams ones are going to become crude oil one's going to become our purified ethanol and that's done with this section of the plant right here what you're seeing is you're seeing two giant distillation towers so you can see they started all the way up here and they go all the way down to the second floor beneath my feet about 20 feet tall and what that's actually doing is applying heat to the solvent in order for the solvent to vaporize once the solvents vaporizing it's coming it's separating from the heavier cannabinoid mixture and as the solvent vaporizes it reconned ences on a separate condenser column behind me which creates a liquefied solvent that's been purified and that leaves us with our micelle a stream that's been purified into the purified solvent of course and then our purified cannabinoids which we refer to as crude oil so let's take a look at the next step in the process which is one that's very crucial and often overlooked so once we have our solvent purified from our micellar stream it's very very important that we do a reflux distillation on that solvent and here's the reason why ethanol is what's called a homogeneous azeotrope with water as you know we're extracting a plant there's a lot of water in the plant when it comes out of the field we dry most of that water out through our drying process but you may have anywhere between 2 to 10 percent water and your residual biomass now what's gonna happen because ethanol is a homogenious azeotrope with water those two molecules are just going to want to stay right together the boiling points are so close that they can't be separated with the traditional evaporation why this is relevant is because over time your solvent becomes diluted and becomes less effective at extracting your cannabinoids so you can imagine that you start with 190-proof pure solvent and over time it's going to be diluted with water once you hit around 170 proof or a little bit lower than that your extraction efficiency becomes greatly compromised which is the reason that we have reflux stills so reflux stills are a different type of evaporation they're used with a very tall tower without with a packing material in them and what that does is it allows that very close boiling point to separate from the water and the solvent so we've integrated this into our plant so it's a turnkey system solvent never needs to be replaced in this plant because the efficiency is so high in terms of not only the reclaim rate from your biomass and your evaporation but also the reap roofing of the solvent it's a completely closed system which makes it extremely efficient and extremely easy to before when we were talking about operating your business on really good margins and maintaining efficiency and how you operate your extraction process this is one of the central key components to do that for for your ROI for your business now that we've walked through the evaporation process and the purification of the solvent we need to follow our crude oil through the other output stream so what happens with the crude oil once it comes out of our evaporator as it moves into these holding tanks and basically what these holding tanks are doing is holding the oil and heating it to perform the decarboxylation process D carb is a very very common process that's used in preparation of your crude oil for not only consumption but for final distillation that's what these tanks do right here and ultimately these tanks can be routed and pumped to a distillation machine or any types of popes post-processing that you would like to use so now that we've followed our micellar stream through the entire plant through refinement all the way to D carb and through re proofing of the solvent the other side of the aspect of the processing of this plant is the actual biomass that's coming out so we have a lot of spent biomass that's coming out of this plant and once it comes out of those extraction tanks that we looked at earlier it's ultimately pumped as a slurry up into these separators so we have these rotary strainer separators and basically what they do is they separate that pulpy sludge of biomass it's the first pass that takes the solvent off and what that's doing is it's taking kind of that like I said pulpy sort of really wet biomass and separating the ethanol from it in order for the biomass to then drop into a heated mechanism which is where you're going to regain the remainder of your solvent out of the biomass so let's take a look at that next the last and one of the most crucial processes in our plant is the reclamation of the final solvent from that biomass so as we saw before we separated the majority of the solvent from the biomass using our strainers but it's still think about you know wringing out a sponge you get most of the of the of the moisture out of the sponge by using that pressure but in order to get the remainder of the moisture out of the sponge or in this case our biomass acting like a sponge we need to heat it and that's precisely what this heated screw does here so you can see it's quite lengthy there's a lot of heat energy that goes into that but the flip side is we're taking a typical 94 93 95 percent efficiency and we're taking that efficiency up above 99 percent in terms of reclamation of your solvent now the reason that's important is because obviously we're on industrial scale here we're talking about tens of thousands of pounds of processing per day you can imagine there's quite a bit of solvent that's being used there so when you're losing 5% of that massive amount of solvent you can imagine what the cost is last we checked Evan all's you know 32 dollars a gallon for for azeotropic ethanol around seven dollars a litre depending on your region if you're losing 5% of everything you're processing with which is the case with typical plants typical batch installations batch installations could be even higher than that you can imagine how that's going to affect your effects and how that's going to affect your ROI especially as you have margin compression on your commodity one of the reasons that we designed this in is exactly that so you may have been wondering what are these giant for tanks on the end of this skid and it's very important because these are our CIP tanks CIP stands for clean in place clean in place is a protocol that's used throughout manufacturing throughout GMP throughout any type of protocol that requires food grade or pharma grade compliance now these CIP tanks are meant to hold an acid wash a base wash and then you have a reuse tank so basically what we're doing is we're imagining any sort of contamination that can get into this system based upon what that contamination is you may need an acid rinse in order to dissolve that contamination you may need a base rinse in order to dissolve that contamination you made into ethanol rinse in order to dissolve that contamination which is basically what we have in this entire plant so again through the HMI interface through the control center you have a completely automated CIP process in order to clean this plant the reason that that's extremely relevant is has more regulations and more restrictions come into the cannabis and hemp space you're going to be subject to testing for pesticides for mold for mildews and you can imagine that if any of that stuff's on your biomass and gets into your plant that you're automatically going to potentially contaminate your plant with a contamination source from the field one of the prime examples that we could use is micro butanol in California it's virtually everywhere and in order to remediate micro butanol audit your processing equipment there's a variety of processes that are needed to do that right now in batch equipment everybody does that manual and it's very laborious and time-consuming but as GMP restrictions and regulations come into play you're going to need to have a set standardized process that can be replicated and duplicated in order to be accurate every single time that's exactly what this CI piece kit does and that's exactly what our control center an automation skid does thanks for watching our overview on our KP d series of industrial extraction plants these plants can be engineered to process anywhere from ten thousand pounds a day up to several hundred thousand over a million if that's what you want our engineering partners as well as ourselves with our engineering expertise and our product expertise know every step of the process we know how to make it the most efficient and that's exactly what we've done here and what we've seen today we look forward to working with you and please give us a call if you have any questions you", "dbwoUIE2L8U": "[Music] hi everyone matt clark research analyst here with money markets with your weekly marijuana

it it doesn't make a difference i enjoy just getting the feedback and reading what everyone has to say now this particular uh today for this update i do want to talk about a uh a question i received from vincent a on youtube and he wrote hey matt thanks for all the marijuana market updates we'd like to hear what you think about cannabix tech just recently got a u.s patent for a thc breathalyzer couldn't find much recent financials but wondering what your thoughts are i couldn't find any other publicly traded company that makes a thc breathalyzer and with more states legalizing for recreational use i think this might be a good long-term option thanks well first off vincent thank you for your comments and your questions i really appreciate that you're you guys are the reason why we do this is just to provide you uh with a little bit more analysis in terms of of cannabis related stocks it's not easy to find uh but you know and it provides you with actual information what you do with it entirely up to you but i want to try to provide you with very middle of the road straight line and and no bull no just cut to the chase and tell you what it is give the info and then what you do with it entirely up to you now i'll start with a little bit of background on the company and then i'll look at it stock performance cannabix technologies incorporated trades over the counter on the pink sheets under b l o z f b l o z f and it also trades on the canadian national stock exchange is a canadian company so it's not on the nasdaq or on the new york stock exchange it is over the counter it is on the pink sheets um but it's not a company that that cultivates or sells marijuana so it's not your typical marijuana company it's a company that's in the market of creating tools for law enforcement and employers to test the presence of thc on an individual uh and vincent is correct the company did just receive a patent for a cannabis drug detection device uh it's patent uh it's a patent the company's been working on uh since 2014. it recently just got it just uh a week two weeks ago now the actual breathalyzer has already been produced and is in field testing uh a a with an occupational health clinic in southern california it works the same way an alcohol breathalyzer does law enforcement if you are at a traffic stop or maybe in an accident and there's a question about your your impairedness then they break out a little device you breathe into it and then instantaneously it tells you what your alcohol your blood alcohol level or how much alcohol is in your blood and every state has different legal limits if you are over that legal limit then you can be arrested for driving under the influence the thc breathalyzer works the exact same way if you breathe into it and it's meant to register the amount of thc you have in your system uh whenever whenever legal limits are established uh if they haven't been already then you can determine whether you're driving under the influence or operating a vehicle under the influence or showing up to work under the influence or whatever have you now so it it just works the same way as an alcohol breathalyzer and it's supposed to reduce the thc identification process from what is now days sometimes hours into seconds and minutes as of august the company said results missed breathalyzer uh takes less than five minutes to obtain uh and cannabix officials said they're continuing to work on scaling down the current device it is a pretty good size one it's you know it's more that you know the ones the police use for alcohol are very small rectangles and you know with a little tube on the end that you blow into this is actually a bit bigger it's not huge but it's not necessarily compact uh and they're working on trying to decrease the production costs of that device all in all achieving the patent is really pretty big news for the company um as now it's kind of in the driver's seat to develop this kind of technology ongoing now in terms of the company stock it was trading at a range of around 27 cents to 30 cents a share for most of the last 12 months it ticked up to about 66 cents a share in december that's likely response to the current used political situation involving democrats controlling the house the senate and the white house now as i've said before uh you know investors are the belief that with democrats in control of all three of those entities that federal decriminalization of cannabis is closer to reality thus pushing cannabis stocks up we saw it with even our cannabis watch list holdings which i'll talk more about later that they pushed very high after the election and then after january when the georgia election finally gave control of the senate to the democrats now cannabix got its big boost when news of its patent award became public earlier this month as you can see with the chart here the stock price vaulted to more than a dollar 79 a share that's a 616 jump from march 2020's low of 25 cents a share that's a massive jump now the stock price hit a golden cross that's where the 50 day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average back in december of 2020 that golden cross indicates a potential uptrend could be in the offing but in this instance it's more likely the patent drove the stock higher not the pattern so um just be aware of that that the you know news does dictate stock price and this instance that's exactly what happened it wasn't because the technicals showed that it was time for the price for the stock to start moving in an uptrend um and finally vincent is also correct uh financially rather he is correct there is very little and i mean very little financial information available on this company what i could find is that the company doesn't carry any debt but it also hasn't mass-produced its breathalyzer yet so there's very little reason to have any it's basically raising funds to pay for r d it's not taking any debt because it has no need to um and it doesn't have any cash flow either again because it hasn't sold anything so right now its financials are pretty much on level term it's raising funds and then investing those funds uh in into its research and development when it starts mass producing then you might start seeing this company start taking on some debt uh and and even start generating some sales once that becomes fruition that's when the balance sheet will start to expand and you'll start seeing hopefully what the company would hope for would be a balance if not a tip to the cash side to the good now overall the this company is a little tricky for me in terms of investing there's another company out there called hound labs it started uh on-site testing of its own marijuana breathalyzer and the news of this online field test just came days after cannabix uh announced its patent award so i'm sure there was no surprise there uh hound labs is a private company so you can't invest in it the same way you can with cannabix um now for cannabis i would issue some caution realize that there's not they're not the only player in the game here it just happens to be they're the only player that you can actually invest in um it's not an expensive stock even with the run up i mean dollar 79 still is fairly cheap uh it's not bad but if that momentum isn't sustained a pullback could lead to triple digit losses you see the stock go up 600 percent um if their uptrend isn't confirmed or isn't isn't sustained it can drop right back down to that 25 27 30 level that's a massive loss so you have to really put all that in perspective until they start marketing and putting out a product to sell it's going to be very difficult to gauge whether this stock is something to really invest in at this point at least to me and at least in the cannabis industry r d companies are great but there's always caution that you have to kind of throw yeah you have to factor in here whenever you're investing so i would say it's kind of buyer beware here you know understand that it's an r d company there are no sales uh there's no debt that's great but there's no income either so um yeah you know it's just very very tricky um getting in now on the ground level yeah if that's your strategy that might not be a bad idea because if if they start mass producing and start really building up production of this thc breathalyzer and start building up sales especially in the law enforcement community where in states where adult use and medical use is legal well that could be a huge boom for the company and that could be a huge boom for the stock price um is it going to happen you know i'm not a soothsayer i i don't know i mean the run-up is uh is again because of the patent not necessarily because of the it has a massive new product on hand it's got it because it's now taken a step closer to the potential of creating a patented product that they can put on the market and sell commercially now i want to look at our cannabis watch list on money and markets our watch list continues to perform well uh average gain of our six positions just as at 34 but again you have to understand if you've been paying attention you'll see that the broader cannabis market has been hit with some pressure and that has pushed some of our stocks down slightly nothing to be alarmed at but it's just something you need to be aware of so swipes are mounted international it's up about close to 30 percent uh it was up as high as 40 percent it's paired back uh perk and elmer this is actually a company that's actually increased over over time rather than been suffered by the pullback and that's because it's a little more diversified outside of cannabis it's up about 28 since i recommended it so i put it on the watch list in uh september turning point brands this is another traditional tobacco company like schweitzer mounted uh it's up more than 65 percent uh grow generation uh this was you know was our top performer it has paired back a little bit it's still up 61 since i put it on the watch list in november i think it still has room to grow i think this is just a pullback uh i think i think it's temporary uh and i don't think it's going to last too long i i think once we start seeing hearing more cannabis in the news then i think you're going to start seeing more cannabis stock prices jump um planet 13 holdings this is the most recent addition to the watch list it has struggled not not going to kid around it's down about 11 since i added it uh and that's again because of headwinds that canada the cannabis industry is facing they got a nice run uh after the election uh both in november and then again in january now they're starting to pull back a little bit i still think there's a lot of potential long term for planet 13. i don't think it's one that it's it's not time to sell it's not time to get rid of it if you do own it uh just be steady stay the course and i think you'll be just fine and scott's miracle grow again to illustrate how stocks fluctuate when i added this to the watch list in september it dropped about 10 11 it is now up 34 since i since i recommended that price so it's at about a 44 45 swing in price since i added it so uh again it just goes to show you that you know not everything is stays the same and you just have to you know monitor your strategy and stick to your strategy which is what we do here at money markets with cannabis so with marijuana market update so just hold to it you'll be fine i'm going to keep watching things for you if there is an instance where i think that it's time maybe to back out of a position uh that you may have bought based on on the watch list i'll let you know um and i'll be the first to tell you i'll put out a video and let you know uh immediately when that should happen now you can check out my cannabis watch list on moneymarkets.com uh but there is one more thing i do want to address and this is something that uh is is not not personal but it is something i do takes very seriously i'm all about being transparent um i try to give you all the information that i have afforded to me as a research analyst and and sometimes that information uh that i see and that i that i get access to isn't necessarily correct now last week i answered a question about charlotte's web holdings incorporated and the information i told you about the company's debt that i found from research from research that i looked for was actually not accurate however you have to bear in mind that's not the reason why i told you that charlotte's web is not a buy i told you that charlotte's web is not a buy because it has no stock momentum and it's got very high volatility and it's just not one that i'd want to take a risk on right now does that potential of course they all do um but my reasoning was not because of its debt my reasoning was because of its stock performance but again i want to be very open i want to be very honest with you and tell you uh that this was an incorrect this was incorrect uh and and and explained to you why so uh you know that all aside uh it's a lesson learned but um you know again next week i'm gonna talk about another cannabis stock that's been mentioned in our youtube comments or email you can uh comment on our youtube section right below email me at feedback moneymarkets.com and let me know maybe if there's a sector or a stock you'd like me to take a look at would love to do that coming up later this week we'll have the bull in the bear podcast as well as our money markets week ahead i'm going to give you a little bit of a sneak preview next week's marijuana market update i'm actually going to have a cannabis insider on and we're

provides safe and profitable information for your portfolio i'm matt clark research analyst for money and markets and hosts of the bolden bear podcast until next time everyone safe trading you", "WCZkmm2w3UM": "[Music] we don't know that much right now especially compared to what we know regarding the effects on the brain lungs and heart for example but research on the effects of cannabis on kidney function is largely limited to a few retrospective cohort studies those studies have included smoked recreational cannabis either in healthy people or they've evaluated any lifetime use among people with kidney disease so there are some differences between recreational benefits and medicinal cannabis such as the route of administration uh the dose the frequency of use and all of these can have different effects on long-term outcomes so these studies did not demonstrate any association between cannabis use and the development or progression of kidney disease because of this though in order to answer this question we conducted a study among people at high risk for kidney disease and we did demonstrate an association between chronic cannabis use and a more rapid decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate among people with kidney disease we presented this research at kidney with 2018 and the uh we're planning to submit the manuscript for publication shortly so many people use cannabis to treat a variety of ailments among people living with kidney disease it's estimated that about one quarter to one half of patients experience chronic symptoms such as pain nausea anorexia sleep disturbance anxiety and depression and several of these are approved indications for medical cannabis uh in across the united states in various states additionally anxiety depression and insomnia are the most common psychiatric conditions that people self-treat with cannabis so there's evidence supporting the use of cannabis in the in patient populations without kidney disease for treating several of these symptoms most of the evidence is focused on chronic pain nausea and anorexia or loss of appetite additionally many patients living with kidney disease and those on dialysis experience substantial chronic being it's estimated up to 50 percent of patients can experience chronic pain now over 60 percent of dialysis patients have received at least one opiate prescription annually and approximately 20 of dialysis patients take prescription opiates chronically but we know that the short-term and chronic use of of opiates are associated with increased morbidity and mortality uh among people with kidney disease so cannabis could have a potential therapeutic role in the pain management among these patients and in fact the national academies concluded that there's substantial evidence for the use of cannabis and cannabinoids to treat chronic pain while several meta-analyses and systematic reviews on cannabis use including the prescription cannabinoids have given some mixed results for treating chronic pain well one thing that i could think of is that you know cannabis consumers are no longer the stereotypical lazy stoner the prevalence of cannabis use in the united states and worldwide has increased considerably over the last decade but particularly among people over the age of 50 and even more so over the age of 65 and and this patient population is enriched with chronic illness including chronic kidney disease we know that adults with chronic medical conditions are more likely to consume cannabis than healthy individuals however we don't really know the long-term health effects of cannabis use on some of these conditions so it's that much more important to understand its impact on kidney disease", "LDOLTcTMO2w": "[Music] lmc here i know this is a new format let me know what you all think when we talk about the most popular cannabis brands in the world cookies cannabis is without a doubt in the conversation almost in a class of its own cookie's cannabis is highly sought after and has an almost cult-like following a cookie's cult but who created this massively popular popular marijuana brand founder and chief executive officer gilbert milam jr more familiarly known as hip-hop artist burner and grow expert jai or jiga chang developed the cookie strain which became the foundations of cookies fam genetics in this video we are going to cover burner and has come up to being one of the most influential cannabis entrepreneurs on the planet if you end up liking this video and would like me to do another one of these videos on someone else please let me know down in the comments born and raised in san francisco's sunset district berner attended galileo academy of science and technology before he eventually dropped out but first let's go over his family so his father is mexican and his mother is italian his mother was an office worker and his father was a chef at a mexican restaurant on fillmore street berner has said that that his insane work ethic stems from seeing how hard both of his parents worked when he was younger when burner was 13 his mother and siblings moved to arizona where his father planned to meet them to open a restaurant but his father actually ended up never coming to arizona due to an affair he was apparently having with another woman when burner was 16 he told his mom that he needed to move back to the bay area to finish up high school so he could pursue his music career in his self-produced documentary 11-11 burner says that at a young age he knew he wanted to do something big be around forever and ultimately leave a legacy in his words legacy and immortality could best be achieved through either movies or music and while berner has indeed already immortalized himself as a hip-hop legend with over 37 different projects released to date he may only know now be realizing the scale to which his legacy will impact the cannabis industry after berner dropped out of high school his senior year he continued to work on music it started to become a frequent at some of the medical cannabis clubs and eventually got a job at one of them named hemp center soon burner was not just working at the cannabis club but actually managing it too for five years berner was immersed in the developing medical cannabis industry all the while continuing to make music and battle wrap in 2006 burner linked up with the bay area rap legend equipto where the veteran rapper showed burner the ropes of quality music production after forming his own label burn one entertainment in 2007 burner released his debut album track money and pac money with the crypto one thing that can be said about burner's entrepreneurial instincts is that he realizes the power of networking connectivism and collaboration after track money and pac money he did joint albums with the legends like the jacka and many others he understood that collaborations meant access to another fan base leveraging the relationship symbiotically this strategy would eventually lead burner that celebratism could be leveraged with cannabis and branding steeped in the entrepreneurial bravado of his family burner the mc and berner the businessman were destined to synthesize into a titan of success the first materialized in burner's cannabis club where patrons and acquaintances would meet to talk shop although it was a cannabis club berner and others that visited him would never shy away from sharing their other productive endeavors in fact burner allowed his club to be a space for both among other things the cannabis industry and the music industry this brilliant decision opened up the opportunity for creatives from different industries and backgrounds to intersect and collaborate in ways they may have not if it wasn't for spaces like burners if it wasn't for this many of us might have not even known who berner was or is and he may have faded into relative obscurity as we know this did not happen it was in the context that burner and wiz khalifa crossed paths in 2012 whiz visited burner's club and enjoyed the atmosphere berner shared his recent musical endeavors with whiz which was met with so much enthusiasm that wiz ended up signing berner to his highly sought after label taylor gang records after ingratiating himself in into wiz khalifa's collective burner quickly rose to prominence inside and outside of taylor gang assisting wiz in his development and launch of his own canvas brand khalifa kush if you have had your ear to the ground around this time then you would remember the wave of hype and controversy that orbited khalifa a lot of these moments such as the infamous kanye west slash wiz khalifa beef can be understood as just as pivotal for burner's career trajectory as they were for whiz wiz khalifa said yo man hit that kk and chill and kanye thought he met kim kardashian and then he just completely went off the [ __ ] rails with that thank you mr west to kk cells went crazy i had a great few months after that man i love you oh so so after that khalifa kush just just went bananas it was always going bananas but that [ __ ] just made it even go even more crazy because everyone's like it's weed you crazy bastard and everyone's going crazy on him and i just know that dispensary in las vegas went nuts with the kk after that when burner understood how the celebrity attention translated into building brand equity that could drive business to the kk brand this must have been an enlightening moment potentially giving him an understanding that very few people involved in the cannabis industry had at the time the power of celebrity and music it is here that we see berner develop his own strand of multiplicative branding and thus spreading his wings and establish once and for all that he is the entrepreneur's entrepreneur after this it's only a short hop skip and jump to hemp infused water hemp based clothing slash apparel and the ever so popular girl's cow cookie strains all of which would skyrocket burner and his brand cookies into the future of the cannabis industry [Music] cookies grew more and more popular and started to receive recognition all due to the continuous diversification of its production with the development of the legal cannabis industry and the imminent explosion of hip-hop into the mainstream it was obvious that berner was preparing himself to succeed in the business landscape to come burner would and still does to this day name drop his strains and brands in his own music building name recognition hype and a tailored brand perception for the public to receive let me ask you this what are some of the most commonly recurring consumerist themes in hip-hop designer clothes designer cars designer jewelry are you seeing the pattern hip hop has a hyper focus on exclusive expensive and high quality designer goods now if we have exclusive genetics high quality product that is enough demand for it to be expensive well do we have designer cannabis i would argue yes only does hip-hop create and or validate the designer cannabis perception for a company like cookies but it also amplifies the perception to a massive audience while burner definitely leverages his music to promote cookies and his other brands he is only one rapper with one fan base burner's skills at networking and insight to make strategic partnerships in the music industry allowed the cookies family of brands to be fully embraced by a large portion of the hip-hop industry it wouldn't be long before crowd favorites like migos and up-and-comers like nefta pharaoh would start to associate themselves with burner's brand even name-dropping them in their own songs and rocking their own rocking the cookie's merch burner said in a 2018 vlad tv interview that it takes him two hours to get out of the house every morning because he has to get cookies product and apparel ready to give out to other musicians or celebrities throughout the day while he's working as a musician when it comes to strategic partnerships berner has made i think a great example is when he made the partnership with the legendary hip-hop manager steve lobel otherwise known as we work in and and had him invest into the maywood cookies cannabis store in l.a now for those who don't know who steve lobel is well this man has been working in the music industry for decades and well this man is connected what up baby boy right here kendrick lamar my big honesty feel me yeah just a man yeah get the camera off me oh yeah yeah um how long is this years back waiting for the world even talking about hearing about me uh she's giving me the game i think he goes you know been a young cat in the game earlier so many times you got to bump your head to get where you at and you make mistakes you know being on that first tour with you made a whole lot of mistakes [Music] it was a lesson learned but when you have people like this uh right there over a 70 year old kid a 20 year old kid then you be in good hands by the time i turn 25 i know the game the biggest artist in the world i'm proudest guys kendrick lamar if you don't know i'm sure you know you know i'm the og what's wrong he's most known for being the manager of the legendary hip-hop producer scott storch and a legendary producer like scott storch is always in demand whether it be from the ogs or the new and young artists popping off on the scene [Music] so when you have a manager of a superstar producer that works with the most popular young and old rappers now invested in your cannabis company well those connections are going to come in handy in the same 2018 vlad tv interview i referenced earlier we see vlad bewildered at the long list of world-class features on burner's album that was coming out at the time to summarize burner's response to vlad when you have close friends like steve lebel to call up you pretty much can get any feature you want and burner is right leverage the cannabis into music and the music into cannabis he had garnered such a fluid and organic organization of business flows and ties that it was almost as if he was tending to a garden at this point it was just a matter of time before it would bloom into what we know cookies as today cookie's success was truly materializing as we've seen burner saw the potential in intertwining cannabis brands with hip-hop and celebrity culture now why don't we go over the cookies family of brands so cookies is obviously the flagship flagship brand which sells millions of dollars worth of apparel licensing deals cannabis sales and more he owns exotics and lemonade both of which are popular flower brands in their own right when it comes to cannabis accessories he owns santa cruz shredder a high quality cannabis grinder while he also has his own paper brand vibes then we have hemp duo and what is fascinating about burner's ability to expand m2o was his ability to successfully leverage his social media following he talks about in that same vlad tv interview that he showed a room full of 7-eleven executives the power of social media he went on live and he told his fans to go to the 7-eleven instagram and to post and say on one of their comment on one of their pictures and say please get m2o into your store five minutes later they had around 40 000 comments or so and that right there shows you his ability to leverage not only just celebrity relationships and celebrity endorsements but also leverage his own celebrity leverage being a rapper [Music] now he was also an early investor into weed maps and also owns g pen a popular cannabis vaporizer burner has also recently announced cookies is going to be launching an event services company that offers a mobile dispensary [Music] most cookie stores that burner owns makes 300 000 in sales a day and their flagship store on melrose apparently does 500 000 in sales a day yeah 500k a line around the block every day his licensing deals with multi-state operators have started to expand and spread like wildfire gage cannabis as michigan is licensing cookies green thumb industries is licensing the brand in a multitude of states cookies operates in medical and recreational markets across the country and has 17 retail locations in addition it also operates a medical shop in tel aviv israel and has a cookies clothing store in barcelona spain cookies cannabis has been extremely intelligent in their business expansion approach burner and his team brilliantly use the cookies apparel and accessory stores as a safer more cost effective way to test new market potentials for example they opened a clothing store in seattle almost three to four years before they were even selling recreational cannabis in the state of washington during those two years or so or three years cookies was able to understand and grow local hype for the cannabis brand laying the infrastructure down to have a successful cannabis launch cookies market entry strategy has proven to be extremely effective and their proven standard operating procedures now allow them to license and brand and scale the business at a much faster rate while still maintaining the cookie's brand's integrity and equity a really important point i want to note is that bernie's success comes from a number of different reasons but one of the most important is his ability to cultivate and build a solid team around him he has a team that operates efficiently brands meticulously and thinks uniquely a true entrepreneur knows the extreme importance of having a quality team around them again his tendency towards collaboration helps him succeed now has talked in a number of different videos about turning down 800 million dollars to acquire the cookie's brand you know uh is it true you turned down 800 million dollars to buy your companies yeah did you hold on saying because i got to think about this for a second how the [ __ ] did did you just say no or you said let me think about it and get back because how do you make a decision to say no yeah i mean look it still [ __ ] with me i mean i had to think about it for a while but i'll give you i'll give you guys some game because this is such a good interview i never really talk about business like this but i want people out there to be motivated and i want people out there to know that like the first deal is not the best deal i cannot wait to wait to write my book about it i want to write should write a book called the best deal and so all right i get offered 800 million dollars for cookies in general the whole thing but a lot of it's stock from a canadian lp a private canadian company that's on the stock market um i looked at like this if the first deal i got was 800 million bucks and it's mostly stock and the stock game could be like great and then drop and everyone's going public right now what what what would happen if i turned it down that that day makes me pretty pretty much a boss to do that so instead of taking 800 million i took 10 million dollars in cash for 10 of my company as a friends and family round to invest into infrastructure and the next round we're doing we're evaluated at 400 million and i'll probably take a small investment at that i'm gonna build it up and while everyone else is getting bought out right now with canadian stock they may win but i'm in it to get cashed out for real because i don't want some stock i don't have to learn how to sell stock or wait and play that game i want one of the big alcohol companies who has time to come cash me the [ __ ] out as they should i want heineken to come cash me out i want southern wine to come cash me out i want them to come with that check because they got it constellation just put 400 million dollars into uh canopy um up there in canada they put a check well they could have came and bought me for four no i'm sorry i'm high as [ __ ] four billion canopy just got 4 billion dollars we're talking about a publicly traded company in canada that doesn't have the most revenue i think the revenue was negative a lot or whatever it was they don't have hella money they just have the brands so i'm building a house of brands it's gonna be like facebook and when they come they're gonna have to buy us and they're gonna i would much rather a constellation come give me four billion dollars [Music] cookies is a private company so figuring out its true value is pretty difficult but what we do know is what is with cookies we see genetics and brands that are massively in demand selling at designer prices and this is only going to keep scaling it's hard to see a ceiling for cookies cannabis and its family of brands approaching anytime soon the potential value of cookies 10 to 20 years from now could very easily be in the multiples of billions money sounds great but when you want to be around forever slash leave a legacy like burner said you wanted to i can't think of too many more impactful legacies than leaving behind a company that has revolutionized not just the cannabis space but also the brand development space little more needs to be said to prove burner's prowess as an entrepreneur in this series we're going to continue to explore the lives and business endeavors of the cannabis industry's greatest minds we thought we'd start with burner after all he is a landmark success thank you so much for watching the first episode of the high design documentary series we would love your feedback please drop a comment down below let me know what's the next person you want us to cover and really appreciate y'all we'll see in the next one signing out you", "Nlcr1jd_Tok": "In 1970, marijuana was classified \nas a schedule 1 drug in the United States: the strictest designation possible, meaning it was completely illegal \nand had no recognized medical uses. For decades, this view persisted and set back research \non the drug's mechanisms and effects. Today, marijuana\u2019s therapeutic benefits \nare widely acknowledged, and some nations \nhave legalized medical use or are moving in that direction. But a growing recognition \nfor marijuana\u2019s medical value doesn\u2019t answer the question: is recreational marijuana use \nbad for your brain? Marijuana acts \non the body\u2019s cannabinoid system, which has receptors \nall over the brain and body. Molecules native to the body, \ncalled endocannabinoids, also act on these receptors. We don\u2019t totally understand \nthe cannabinoid system, but it has one feature \nthat provides a big clue to its function. Most neurotransmitters \ntravel from one neuron to the next through a synapse to propagate a message. But endocannabinoids \ntravel in the opposite direction. When a message passes \nfrom the one neuron to the next, the receiving neuron \nreleases endocannabinoids. Those endocannabinoids \ntravel backward to influence the sending neuron\u2014 essentially giving it feedback \nfrom the receiving neuron. This leads scientists \nto believe that the endocannabinoid system serves primarily \nto modulate other kinds of signals\u2014 amplifying some and diminishing others. Feedback from endocannabinoids \nslows down rates of neural signaling. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it slows down behavior \nor perception, though. For example, \nslowing down a signal that inhibits smell could actually make smells more intense. Marijuana contains \ntwo main active compounds, tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, \nand cannabidiol, or CBD. THC is thought to be primarily responsible\nfor marijuana\u2019s psychoactive effects on behavior, cognition, and perception, while CBD is responsible \nfor the non-psychoactive effects. Like endocannabinoids, THC slows down signaling \nby binding to cannabinoid receptors. But it binds to receptors \nall over this sprawling, diffuse system at once, whereas endocannabinoids \nare released in a specific place in response to a specific stimulus. This widespread activity \ncoupled with the fact that the cannabinoid system\nindirectly affects many other systems, means that each person\u2019s \nparticular brain chemistry, genetics, and previous life experience largely determine \nhow they experience the drug. That\u2019s true much more so with marijuana \nthan with other drugs that produce their effects \nthrough one or a few specific pathways. So the harmful effects, if any, \nvary considerably from person to person. And while we don\u2019t know \nhow exactly how marijuana produces specific harmful effects, there are clear risk factors \nthat can increase peoples\u2019 likelihood of experiencing them. The clearest risk factor is age. In people younger than 25, cannabinoid receptors \nare more concentrated in the white matter than in people over 25. The white matter \nis involved in communication, learning, memory, and emotions. Frequent marijuana use can disrupt the development \nof white matter tracts, and also affect the brain\u2019s ability \nto grow new connections. This may damage long-term learning ability\nand problem solving. For now, it\u2019s unclear \nhow severe this damage can be or whether it\u2019s reversible. And even among young people, the risk is higher the younger someone is\u2014 much higher for a 15 year old \nthan a 22 year old, for instance. Marijuana can also cause hallucinations \nor paranoid delusions. Known as marijuana-induced psychosis, these symptoms usually subside \nwhen a person stops using marijuana. But in rare cases, \npsychosis doesn\u2019t subside, instead unmasking \na persistent psychotic disorder. A family history of psychotic disorders, \nlike schizophrenia, is the clearest, though not the only, \nrisk factor for this effect. Marijuana-induced psychosis \nis also more common among young adults, though it\u2019s worth noting \nthat psychotic disorders usually surface in this age range anyway. What\u2019s unclear in these cases \nis whether the psychotic disorder would have appeared \nwithout marijuana use\u2014 whether marijuana use triggers it early, is a catalyst for a tipping point \nthat wouldn\u2019t have been crossed otherwise, or whether the reaction \nto marijuana is merely an indication of an underlying disorder. In all likelihood, marijuana\u2019s role \nvaries from person to person. At any age, as with many other drugs, the brain and body become less sensitive \nto marijuana after repeated uses, meaning it takes more \nto achieve the same effects. Fortunately, unlike many other drugs, there\u2019s no risk of fatal overdose \nfrom marijuana, and even heavy use \ndoesn\u2019t lead to debilitating or life-threatening \nwithdrawal symptoms if use stops. There are more subtle forms \nof marijuana withdrawal, though, including sleep disturbances, \nirritability, and depressed mood, which pass \nwithin a few weeks of stopping use. So is marijuana bad for your brain? It depends who you are. But while some risk factors \nare easy to identify, others aren\u2019t well understood\u2014 which means there\u2019s still some possibility\nof experiencing negative effects, even if you don\u2019t have \nany of the known risk factors.", "ByBSNg5cYDA": "am I the only high one here yeah you're nuts what's a comma he's the only thing I don't do and I'm stoned has come the only thing I don't do

agree on is this it is that all you have we love you both rock a small pause oh yeah that's neither here nor there we enjoy we have big joints and that's the point you think a penis is a joint wait no no we have big joints your big elbows and a small dick you have an elbow on him it isn't a joint it has a joint your penis has been and yours doesn't like a Bionicle yeah like a Bionicle so your dick is like a bent leg oh wait okay do you worry that maybe there's been so much sativa in your life that your dicks are now right angles my penis doesn't necessarily have bad posture it's just like always in downward dog don't word Bulldog give yourself some credit our Bulldog that's a smaller they're smaller but they're thick he's got like a can of Pepsi down there the dimensions on this are honestly a nightmare and I think we should move but am I the only High one here yeah you're not with a comma Jay's the only thing I don't do when I'm stoned has come the only thing I don't do when I'm stoned say it again the only thing I don't only thing I do I thing I don't know you smoke a lot thing I don't do it scum what does that mean I come when I was you saying you're always coming when you're not stoned but just always coming no it's just that the only thing he doesn't do when these fires come when I'm sober I can't stop coming and why you're high you can't start that's why I had the confidence to wear shorts today cuz you know you're not gonna come dry as a whistle the shape of the sativa leaf finger like leaves yeah I think we can all agree that's creepy as fingers are terrifying so if you have to choose between a freaky finger II kind of spooky warming leaf and sort of a cool not gonna freak you out leave I think you're gonna go for the one that's not spidering gonna wake you up in it what's wrong with spooky woman okay listen to this you wake up in the middle of the night Jordan okay it's dark it's darkest and it's earring there's no sound usually there's a car outside your house yeah what's you wish you can't see anything and behind your head Oh God you feel like a tinkling tinkling spindle II finger come behind your ear and trace the outline of your ear with her spindle II finger mom where why are you here are you scared it's a woman spooky or is she fine where are you scared that she's gonna grab your neck so the idea is that that spooky finger is more like sativa and indica sort of like someone just kissing your cheek and falling asleep next to you like a soft hug mom why are you in the couch now that has nothing to do with marijuana I'm touching your nipples here I'm touching a lot more touching the nipple stop it like how was your shirt loose but your nipples so prominent well because I had the sound guy on me putting the wire through here you can't not get excited if you got soft nipples then you're all soulless people just how long are they do you know much whatever bullies and the internet will judge them essa like guys sound off in the comments if you guys think that these guys are bullies I think we're very nice why do you like him because so much what is so great about being a lazy ass sometimes being lazy is nice

aren't you a drug dealer I'm not getting why would you like an indica or sativa looks like Crispin Glover Carol well I'm just chillin on your coffee table you're just like touching everyone okay well just like we'll give you money if you leave we'll give you money if you leave well I'm sure we can agree thank you I think we can agree that it's a TiVo one I made me feel very negative you were like Lebanese Snicket's drug dealers you're like countless freaky brother this is crazy I'm just gonna throw it out there hybrid I got high weird what Hybrid sativa indica maybe like a zoe kravitz where it's kind of like both doing a bi-racial we biracial weed or bisexual wait I'm bisexual cool cool agree the weed will be bisexual and biracial all right I'll agree on this bisexual by race you agree

against the wall what he gonna do to get out", "07wu8tkSokc": "[Music] I have a silver haze here bud unfortunately your camera can't smell if I blow you probably can smell it already it smells like marijuana it looks like marijuana but it's not and we're the only people in the country rolling a hundred percent hemp cigars we're getting a tremendous reaction the hemp industry has exploded in Texas in the last few years there are flower buds oils vape pens gummies clothes ropes dog treats the list goes on hemp is a strain of cannabis the same plant as marijuana but it lacks the chemical compound that produces a high though there's been little research in the US on its usefulness outside of epilepsy treatment many use it for things like pain or anxiety in 2018 federal law was changed to legalize hemp products and the next year the Texas Legislature followed suit Tracy King Texas State Representative has made agricultural hemp an opportunity for farmers and locals here in Texas to continue to grow so let's give mr. King a Warren round of applause what my bill does is it says any type of hemp product is 0.3 percent or less THC and it can be grown in Texas used in the production of a whole variety of products that use him THC or tetrahydrocannabinol is the compound in cannabis that gets you high it's also now what legally separates hemp from marijuana cannabis with more than 0.3 percent THC is marijuana anything with less is hemp that small change has made a big impact the state crime labs can't yet determined THC levels to say if cannabis is illegal or not and some prosecutors started dropping hundreds of pot cases when the law went into effect many stopped accepting new cases that couldn't show that something that looked and smelled like marijuana contained more than 0.3 percent THC criminal defense attorneys watching this law take effect now have a new defense against prosecutors prove what you have is marijuana instead of him some lawyers are starting to advertise on this angle and doing so loudly legislators change the definition of marijuana to require them to move over 0.3% THC good luck proving that those are trees this is pop I'm Brian Wilson better known as Brian Wilson the Texas law Hawk and I'm a criminal defense attorney in Fort Worth Texas the state is in a bad spot right now this law well I think it had good intentions it affects everyone people are making these products to the people that are possessing them police that actually make the arrest and that's because they're having a hard time proving these cases the new law it helps out defense attorneys a lot because now we have a whole other completely separate thing to argue how are you gonna prove this case when you don't have a lab that can prove that it's over 0.3 percent THC good luck with that that's that's what I'd say to new wheelies so today we're going to quality forensic toxicology it is a private crime lab in San Antonio they are one of the ones that can actually distinguish how much THC is in the plant substance and the state labs can do that yet are you working on more fluids or urine so this is a bunch of tubes that are siphoning out different types of ions it's actually getting it's getting rid of everything it doesn't want okay it's only detecting the things that it does okay and one of those is THC look okay the instrumentation that we use for our clinical toxicology is not found in the normal drug identification laboratory in the state of Texas or anywhere really and so the day after the bill was signed we actually had the phone ringing in our office saying hey can you guys do this we felt it was our responsibility to see whether or not this is something that we could do well right now we have the clients in the law enforcement field those are the agencies that didn't really know where to go because the state lab has not developed a test that would adequately determine the amount of THC in a suspected hemp versus marijuana type case so without access to that type of technology that type of instrumentation the drug identification labs were kind of left in a bind while some private labs have a solution for plant testing now it can be expensive costing hundreds of dollars per case in some cities and counties don't want to spend more police time or more police resources on marijuana enforcement that means many cases aren't being prosecuted or are sitting on the Shelf waiting for the government crime labs as they struggle to catch up to the new law Houston's public crime lab is working on a cheaper solution to the new oth see problem that can be used across the state oh I get to wear a coat think we've got a method that looks like it will be reliably able to indicate whether there is more or less than 1% THC in plant material that sound like a whole lot but that's a big feat getting to that point we're trying to build something that's gonna go in probably 25 to 30 laboratories across the state Peter and other state labs plan on using existing equipment to tell if a substance is above or below this 1% marker although it's higher than the legal cutoff it's okay with law enforcement but marijuana cases in the crime lab are still going to take a lot more time and money than they did before and the labs will only be able to test plant material not liquids like Ana vape pen or edibles something that took 15 minutes now it takes hours so yeah if I'm spending time on marijuana that's time I don't have to spend on opioids and PCP and pills and all the other stuff that comes to the lab the whole thing is gonna be more expensive as well in any way you slice this the laboratories have to have more resources that just there's no way we can keep up with what was going on before this much less now it's really easy to overlook the impact that happens in these labs the problem is is when you discount thinking about the laboratories this is what happens did this it is a pinch point in the system that cripples everything else lawmakers were warned that pot cases were going to become a lot more expensive before the bill passed Peters lab and the Texas Department of Public Safety told legislators that they weren't currently equipped to handle this testing and it would cost the state millions we do not currently want to eat THC in samples and so we would have to go through a validation process and procure some instrumentation to be able to do that quantitation right remembers any questions all right thank you very much Brad the very ends the crime lab people came up and said you know we might need more money well that's not an unusual refrain during a legislative session from any state agency but I think a little bit of time and if the whole situation we'll all wonder while we were so worried about this in the beginning the state lawmakers pushing the hemp bill like kings we're adamant that it would not lead to marijuana legalization or decriminalization but some think that difficulties in enforcing this new law might be leading the state in that direction the number of new misdemeanor marijuana cases filed in Texas has plummeted many prosecutors are now demanding lab reports with THC levels before accepting a new case people are being arrested for possessing legal hemp because police think it's marijuana and cities and counties are grappling with how to handle the hemp versus marijuana problem in Austin the City Council has banned the use of any City funds to pay for marijuana testing and low-level cases ones they don't want to be pursuing anyway I think that us spending extra dollars to pursue these low-level cases not only isn't right but I think actually makes us less safe thank you guys it's not the devil's lettuce anymore legalization is coming in Texas a lot sooner than people think is it time to decriminalize marijuana in Texas lieutenant governor Dan Patrick says absolutely not more and more Texas and support decriminalization of marijuana to some extent but figures like the powerful lieutenant governor Dan Patrick are strongly against it still marijuana advocates are hoping to use the hemp laws fall out as momentum for change in the 21 legislative session how this plays out in the future is still unclear but for now state labs are working to implement testing private labs are breaking into the industry and new testing technology is emerging and hemp farming in Texas is set to start in 2020 [Music] [Music] tetrahydrocannabinol nope hold on I wrote it down tetrahydrocannabinol that's what it is I'm saying that one in a million times it's hard to say", "K-ZCzmZLSrc": "[Music] I'm Ian Mitchell I'm an emergency physician in Calais British Columbia at the royal inland hospital I'm also an associate professor in the department of emergency medicine at the University of British Columbia and locally I'm a clinician at the can solve clinic today I'm gonna be talking of a tale of two drugs those drugs are THC and gabapentin we're talking about their history how they've been used their research basis and why physicians feel that those two drugs are so very different and should be treated so different I'd like to begin with some history in the history of cannabis begins millennia ago cannabis is one of the oldest domesticated plants in the world going back it's used in to ancient China and Egypt in the Western world we found out about cannabis through India where physicians brought back cannabis to be used in North America what was used for over a hundred years by some of the best known physicians in the English world including Sir William Osler who believed that cannabis was the best treatment available for migraines at that time Canadian drug companies fought amongst each other over who provided the best quality cannabis to Canadian physicians and patients cannabis was criminalized in 1923 in Canada for reasons that are still unclear the history of gabapentin is much more modern gabapentin was invented in 1974 by drug company called parke-davis parke-davis as well as distributing cocaine and cannabis also invented pcp ketamine and gabapentin ria the party people love drug companies gabapentin was approved for sale in 1993 for the treatment of seizure disorders we look at the mechanism behind these two drugs cannabis affects the endocannabinoid system we all have a system within our body that responds to cannabis and also responds to chemicals within our body that are similar to cannabis these chemicals called anokhin I'm annoyed helped to regulate our mood or sleep and our appetite on the other hand gabapentin works in a different system it was initially designed to work on gaba receptors however lingo research shows it actually affected calcium channels on nerve terminals looking at the research base of these two therapies we find that the research that spend on cannabis is overwhelmingly looking at harms over 90% of the research money that was ever spent was focused while looking at the harms of cannabis very little was spent looking at benefits part of the difficulty in studying cannabis is there is no supply of research cannabis in America to look at the benefits the government give you as much cannabis as you want to study the harms but if you're looking to study the benefits of cannabis you are not allowed to have any that's recently been reversed however the cannabis that the government has been sending to researchers has been of low quality and containing mold and has been unable to be used in research studies ken is not much different in Canada red tape and hurdles mean it is more difficult to study cannabis in Canada than it is to study heroin turning back to gabapentin we can look at the research in gabapentin as being part of a criminal enterprise and that really focus on a physician called dr. scott rubin who's incarcerated for falsifying data in research studies he played a big part in the researching of gabapentin and its uptake by physicians Pfizer the drug company marketing gabapentin realized that there was little money to be made in just the seizure management aspect of gabapentin so they sent sales people out to doctors offices to convince them to use it for many other conditions in populations that had never been approved for children old people as a result gap in and a huge uptake among physicians but ultimately Pfizer had to pay out the largest consumer fight in history four hundred thirty million dollars for their fraudulent Mis marketing activities we find that this pattern continues however with industry paid physicians still be much more likely to prescribe gabapentin looking at what effects these medications have on people both gabapentin and cannabis they have a similar side-effect profile their side effects include dizziness sedation coordination problems cognitive impairment people are often very much more concerned about the mental health aspects of cannabis and how there are some adverse effects associated in that way particularly with schizophrenia what we understand is there is an association with cannabis and schizophrenia if people start using cannabis at a very young age and they are prone to getting schizophrenia their symptoms may come out earlier and be more severe but it does not appear that cannabis by itself can make someone schizophrenic it can only affect people who are already vulnerable to condition there's also the myth of the amotivational syndrome this is an idea that stoners sit around all the time and are very lazy and that just hasn't been borne out by research turning back to gabapentin we find that we have new concerns about mental health and gabapentin from recent research we know that it increases suicidal ideation and that's most often in people between the ages of 15 and 24 people who are much more prone to be suicidal already it's also impairing for driving gabapentin is both drugs can be abused both cannabis and gabapentin we know from older research that approximately 1 in 9 people who use cannabis recreationally may become dependent on it although this is based on old figures and may not be reflective of current conditions physicians were told that gabapentin was not addictive was not abusable and this of course is not the case there is a large illicit market for gabapentin particularly in prison it helps to make the effects of opiates more prominent unfortunate also helps to increase the rate of death associated opiate overdose there is a withdrawal symptom from gabapentin that is not as severe as with alcohol but is still unpleasant and no one should ever stop gabapentin cold turkey because of this withdrawal syndrome cannabis has been very heavy rake heavily regulated since 1923 was made illegal it was made partially GLE in 2001 in Canada with the advent of medical cannabis and we had full legalization of cannabis in 2018 gabapentin remains unrestricted in canada available by prescription it does not require triplicate as opiates do or other addictive medications do gallopin has been rescheduled in the United Kingdom due to epidemic of misuse the Canadian Medical Association the standard for Canadian physicians holds that the evidence is insufficient to use cannabis for neuropathic pain they are supportive of gabapentin and that certain research have called them out on this saying there have been overly cautious about cannabis per se the CMA has been somewhat silent about gabapentin their journal the Canadian Medical Association Journal has articles noting the abuse the over prescribing and the lack of efficacy of gabapentin but the Cana Medical Association at this point has no moves to restrict physician prescribing of gabapentin of note there is no Sunshine Act in Canada so it is difficult to know who is getting paid by companies to help prescribe - gabapentin moving on to some myths there are a rich mythology around cannabis first being that it is common to have cannabis that has been contaminated with fentanyl this has never been proved to be true there's no confirmed samples of cannabis with fentanyl in it fentanyl is actually destroyed if people smoke it in a joint that has to be smoked in a different way off aluminum foil there's also the terms indica and sativa that are still commonly used at one point this represented difference between the two types of plants and Petacchi that type of effect they would have on people however over the last few decades hybridization amongst these plants has rendered these distinctions meaningless and is no longer possible to look at a name to look at a label and tell what is in that plant or what the effect it's gonna have on a person myths around gabapentin are few there was a gentleman in the UK who was claiming that after taking gabapentin he became gay I haven't read any research studies supporting that so far looking at the clinical indications for these medications for cannabis we have indications for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting for spasticity for PTSD and for chronic pain but many people have raised concerns about cannabis being a panacea and applied to every condition out there and we hear this especially for physicians but just for comparison I'd like to read off the indications for gabapentin and what people are prescribing that form and we find the doctors are prescribing gabapentin for acute pain chronic pain post-operative pain neuropathic pain they're prescribed for tremors seizures and muscle cramps they're prescribing for depression mania herpes zoster tardive dyskinesia restless leg syndrome fibromyalgia cancer diabetic neuropathy interstitial cystitis arthritis anxiety pancreatitis chronic cough occipital neuralgia migraine bipolar disease drug dependency alcoholism alcohol at all opiate withdrawal and benzodiazepine withdrawal doesn't work for all these things the evidence just isn't there it's unclear whether gabapentin works for much of anything however we've seen a tremendous rise of gabapentin and that's come from large amounts of pharmaceutical money being used to promote the drug it's being heavily up take it because now physicians are much more concerned about prescribing opiates or restricted by their college for prescribing opiates for their patients so they have to turn to an alternative the fact that it may not work very well sinks to the bottom there's a perception of safety with gabapentin that is really not true we now know much more about its side effects and its impairment risks there's been a tendency of physicians to say well if the gabapentin is working is not working for you that we should increase the dose and there's been many studies showing that increase in the dose does not add to any pain relief but only increase the side-effects nonetheless this is a very common prescribing pattern within British Columbia so if we look at the protocols for treating neuropathic pain which is one of the main reasons that gavin pensions around gabapentin is certainly high up on the list when we look at an algorithm for managing neuropathic pain that comes from your pain family physicians they also include opiate analgesics in tramadol which are terrible drugs for neuropathic pain and have significant side-effects Tanna monoids only appear as a third line agent unfortunately if you look at evidence to support gabapentin which is the first-line agent I quote from a study here there is moderate to high quality evidence that anticonvulsants are ineffective for the treatment of low back pain or lumbar radicular pain there is high-quality evidence that gabapentin oiz have a higher risk for adverse events these are medications that do not work well for the indications they are prescribed and they have significant side-effects and yet they are among the most commonly prescribed pain medications from physicians today so this brings us now to a state of reality pain and evidence-based medicine we have limited evidence-based medicine about cannabis because for many decades we weren't allowed to do the research and we're in a research deficit so we don't know how well cannabis works for many conditions on the other hand with gabapentin it's been researched thoroughly and what we're finding is that it has been well researched enough to know that it does not work for most conditions as prescribed for and it has significant harms so there are many patients with chronic pain and some of them will be helped by gabapentin but is a very small number and certain does not justify the number of prescriptions being written for this medication there are very few prescriptions written for cannabis because physicians shy away from this from lack of knowledge but it can certainly be an effective medication for patients and if we move on to a summary from one of the gabapentin studies it reads even absent clinical trial trial data it is possible that drug X may help some patients who have clinical features of neuropathic pain in the same way that not every patient responds to medication with proven eck efficacy for the condition there are some patients who may respond to medications even though efficacy was not demonstrated in a clinical trial the problem is that throws out evidence-based medicine says you shouldn't pay attention to studies I think you should pay attention to studies but the studies haven't been done for cannabis with this equipoise and what we understand certainly some patients are going to be helped by gabapentin and it doesn't mean that needs to go away but it needs to be far more restricted than what it is and physicians need to consider the cannabis with a similar side effect profile and more effect on neuropathic pain maybe a more appropriate selection for these patients and they should consider where the research comes from and the bias behind these both of these medications thank you", "oKu5SIT2ofI": "[Music] ah there we go something chill to watch the following video is rated r and is intended for an adult audience so if you're under 18 take a

got my face on it look at this i can't line it up very good somewhere around there anyway the other side has me beautiful bunny wife on it and i'll have a nice big fat dab of this at the end of the video so uh let's get on with the lesson and then we can get on with the uh the fun anyway roll it now before we get too deep into this rabbit hole i need to just cover the very very basics of what concentrates actually are now cannabis concentrates are just that concentrated cannabis when you smoke flour a bud a joint a bong rip whatever um you're getting between somewhere on an average between 15 and maybe 25 percent if you're smoking some really hyped flower um but that's your average there's a lot of that leaves you know between bad math here between 85 and like 70 odd per 75 percent um uh uh plant matter that you need to smoke to get to that 20 percent concentration of the cannabinoids that we're after now when you concentrate your cannabis into any of these new concentrates that i'm discussing here um you're looking at more of a 80 thc per volume ratio versus approximately of a 20 let's just round it down to 20 um so if that makes some sense concentrations are getting upwards to 80 to near you know you can get isolates up to 99 isolated uh cannabinoids but 80 is a good sort of discussion point here now that the stoned numbers are out of the way uh let's get into the other side okay if we're going to get into the proper definitions of what extracts are we kind of need to talk about their history for a quick second and where well extracts actually began um a good portion of why we have extractions period is just through the sheer need to minimize the amount and more concentrate hence the name concentrate our cannabis and just get a better stronger stone as well as advancing medical uses of course now the modern form of like dabs and rosin and stuff has only really been in the the limelight if you will for the last maybe 10 years or so give or take now we've had oil that dates back uh into the 70s we've had hash and hash oils uh as late as the 70s and then going back even further than that we've got hashes just straight up hash and and and what do they call um uh cheris cheris i believe um it was more of a hand pressed hash from way back way back but realistically here today when we're talking about dabs we're mostly talking about solvent-based concentrates uh as opposed to the more non-solvent-based concentrates and actually there is some crossover when it gets into the hash rosin it's almost the same thing rosin um is kind of in the same category of smoking however it's a well solvent-less you know one one this whole category uses solvents such as butane propane um even uh h2o h2o and innovation h2o oh come on sitting here after the fact editing it uh i meant obviously co2 anyway and uh innovation is constantly finding new ways to extract concentrates whether it be solvent-less or solvent-based or new types of things i can at least discuss the basics here with you today and categorize and make hopefully make some sense out of the different categories of extractions here and make it a little more clear so i am going to start however with the non-solvent-based concentrates and we're just sort of going to go through the basics here um first off there's like keefe you all know keefe uh it comes out of uh the bottom of your bud buster um it comes out of uh uh your trim trays etc um now you can press this into homemade hash um there's also straight up normal hash that's been made for probably hundreds and hundreds of years i don't actually know how long this has been around for but it's been around for a while um and then there's uh cheris i'm probably saying this wrong but from what i understand this is a basically a fresh hash that is pressed from pushing uh sticky live plant matter together a lot of harvesters will like um bat it uh bat fresh buds against their hands and then scrape off their hands and uh it's kind of kind of gross a little bit but it's a it's a method of concentrates anyway moving on uh we have the modern a little bit more modern bubble hash and this is a really pure clean way to wash your weed it's really good for washing outdoor weed that might have uh pollen or other you know tree particulates and stuff from just you know nature floating around in the air uh it helps wash some of that out um and then here's where the crossover happens if you take a rosin press and press bubble hash or keef you can get rosin uh hash rosin pardon me and hash rosin is borderline shatter it is very similar in uh consistencies to the shatters the waxes crumbles butters etc um but that's a whole different story like i said these are non-solvent-based these are water or uh uh just natural condensing methods for concentration okay now you got to bear with me a little bit if i say things a little strangely you got to remember i just had a big fat dab before i started doing this so uh i'm trying my best to be clear and concise considering how high i truly am moving on so now we're going to talk about solvent based concentrates now obviously these are extracted using solvents such as uh butane or propane or a co2 um there's a few methods like i was saying there's lots of new methods being developed constantly i'm not privy to all of them but i'm going to talk about what is the industry standard for the time of making this video um first off the on the list here let's talk about the most popular the most common shatter now shatter is kind of an umbrella term that really kind of covers a lot of these things most people just call everything kind of shatter or uh or like a butter or wax or something and that just sort of encompasses everything i'm about to talk about but for specifics shatter shatter is generally made with a butane or a propane and is sort of the industry standard like i said when it comes to this kind of a concentrate um it's sort of well known by its glassy type texture that when you bend it it kind of shatters um and that's sort of where it comes from realistically if you want to know what shatter is in a really really dummy kind of uh term maybe not dummy term but layman's term let's say um shatter is extremely clean cannabis oil that's really all this is all of these things are extremely clean cannabis oils when it comes to the solvent based now next we have wax now i'm actually gonna lump butter butter wax all into kind of one category because if i'm not mistaken it's kind of the same thing and it's just sort of the matter of dialect um anyway let's move on uh wax butter whatever um is basically the result of making butane hash oil or propane hash oil bho or pho but not d-waxing your material um and d-waxing is a long story but it basically means separating the fats and the waxes that surround the cannabinoids from well the cannabinoids it's one more filtration step when you don't do this you leave sort of a fattier richer creamier material when you take away all of this uh fats and waxes and stuff you're left with a cleaner material that tends to lean far more towards a shatter another telltale consideration when making butters and waxes is generally this is whipped like like honestly like with a whisk or something like that and because air is whipped into it you get micro bubbles and it just kind of creates a different consistency at least that's one of the ways from what i understand how you make butter um as far as smoking purposes it actually smokes very similar to shatter um maybe leaves a little tiny bit more residue into your uh nail or or like banger dab bowl whatever you're using receptacle system to freaking smoke it with um it can leave a little bit of residue uh compared to shatter just due to the fact that it's not quite as clean but it tends to have a little more flavor now crumbles uh sugar crumbles and things like that are actually kind of uh the same process again it's very similar to your original shatter one of the things that can happen from what i understand again is depending on the terpene value if it's got a high terpene cannabis that you're using sometimes it's hard to really stabilize that into a shatter again i could be kind of wrong on this one so uh i hate to be teaching you wrong but that's my understanding of uh what a crumble is is it's just a terpene rich shatter that won't quite stabilize part way between a crystalline uh format and more of a sauce format sort of right in the middle now live resin is another really good one but requires a lot more process um a lot of these start getting pretty complicated from here on uh live resin is basically the process of flash freezing live material generally within hours or less of being cut down from your medium like soil or hydro or whatever when you cut it down it is immediately going to start to die so they immediately flash freeze it and use a subzero we're talking like 60 below temperatures uh to freeze the water molecules in the plant solid so that when you're using a solvent-based extraction this is the solvent section um the cannabinoids and stuff can be dissolved into the cold uh solvents that won't freeze at these temperatures whereas all the waters will freeze so you can separate the cannabinoids from the wet weed because it's fresh and in doing so you preserve that amazing fresh smell you know how if you've ever grown weed you know when you first cut it down it smells so good and you wish you could taste that well that's what live resin is you can taste it with live resin but it's kind of a complicated process and you need like you know liquid nitrogen or dry ice and some specifics other things that i'm not going to get into here to do it but uh that is the basics of what live resin is and let me tell you if you ever get a chance to try some do it now next is diamonds diamonds diamonds well what the heck are thc diamonds [ __ ] man they're pretty weird looking things um honestly they're a bit of a fad if you ask me i think they're not really as awesome as people make them out to be um however let's discuss what they really are basically uh thc diamonds are when you take a very high quality concentrate and uh basically through using a variety of methods that i'm not gonna get into because i don't fully understand them look up jar tech and some other things uh but basically you crash the thc into itself where it concentrates and starts to form crystals within the the sauce that you were using um it's a big long drawn out process there's a lot more to it than that and i honestly don't understand much of it very clearly so i'm just more talking about what it is basically it is a true diamond is sort of thc a in a pure format that has been separated from most of the terpenes and other things which is why it sort of crystallizes into a rock salt looking chunk of what they call diamonds um again i don't understand diamonds thoroughly enough to really get too deep down this rabbit hole i just wanted to sort of cover what they were they're also some of the strongest uh form of cannabis concentrate that you can possibly smoke so uh be warned okay and as we're saying here we got s f e or a co2 extraction this is quite commonly one of the ones that is used for a lot of the vape cartridges that people are smoking these days those pre-disposable vape cartridges and stuff quite often these are uh full of co2 extraction hash oil um now i got to be 100 honest this is a really complicated one this is one that's very difficult to explain um it's on par with making diamonds as far as some you know discussion complication and i just don't know enough about it to talk very clearly about it but know this it is a cleaner uh form of extraction it is still considered a solvent even though it's not considered like a gas solvent it's co2 it is literally a what they call supercritical co2 which uh uh again i don't want to get into this um but um mostly because i don't know what i'm talking about but know that this is a considered clean method of extraction or at least a cleaner method of extraction than uh the butanes and propanes now finally we get into all the weird acronyms now i'm talking about hittissophy and jessifiki or however you pronounce these things h-t-f-s-e and h-c-f-s-e um what the heck are these things well high terpene and or high cannabi cannabinoid full spectrum extracts now if i'm not entirely mistaken which i have been in the past but these are basically a combination of the previous mentioned uh uh diamonds and terp sauce that has both been kind of mashed back together so this is almost a combination of the diamonds with the sauce been mashed back together so you actually get the full spectrum again and that's where i believe the full spectrum comes um again i could be wrong please let me know in the comments below if i'm missing some major uh acronyms here or if i'm uh if i missed a whole type of concentrate for that matter let me know because all of the new methods and things that are being developed are only going to get better and cleaner as science and research start start to catch up with all of the years of uh uh uh years and years of suppression that have been uh uh uh just well the weed's been suppressed what do you want me to say uh we've been told that it was bad for us for so long and it's not so cannabinoids are our oyster now and we're just starting to discover them there's some serious magic to be had in pairing certain terpenes with certain cannabinoids and when we get into concentrations we can really start separating the things that truly matter away from the things that don't matter like the pulp of the plant we just don't need that anymore uh you don't need to smoke 80 plant matter to get stoned anymore folks times are a change and i swear and there we go that's at least the basics of what cannabis concentrates are in their plethora of formats um i know i've got some of them a little bit wrong um and uh uh uh there's probably a lot that i've neglected or just certain things that maybe i didn't mention that you think that is important uh if you would like me to cover this any of these topics deeper in higher uh uh concentration unattended um let me know in the comments below and i'll see what i can do about it hopefully it won't take me a year to make this next video anyway if you like this dab blaster concept oh crap i'm running out of fuel here if you like these dab blasters i will

pain this began a cycle that lasted over a decade of fentanyl patch neurontin methadone Norco a myriad of pharmaceuticals that at the height had me over the next decade on 26 different drugs a day what I was left with was overweight depressed unable to work unable to even drive a car but more importantly what I was also left with was chronic pain because we're opioids are an excellent option for people that are in acute suffering they are not the best solution for people having chronic suffering such as mine so I went looking for other solutions about this time I met a woman by the name of K kurta Posse and k was a self-described waken Baker each morning she would wake up and she would pull out her little pink Hello Kitty pipe and she would have a couple of Puffy's so I judged K very harshly I saw her as a drug user but she also told me something very interesting and that was that she was making pot brownies for her boyfriend who had chronic neck pain and that he was able to use or eat one of her brownies before bed at night and not have to use any harmful pharmaceuticals to sleep through the night and that got my interest because up to that point we all had heard the hype around this but all of a sudden I'm like there's got to be some science here so I I started looking for solutions and the first thing I did is I went to a doctor in California who was willing to write me a recommendation to use cannabis and I thought great I'm gonna go and I'm gonna see this doctor and I'm gonna walk out of there with a prescription and know exactly what to do but instead what I got was a sheet of paper with a list of dispensaries and he pointed to one of them and he said this is the Nordstrom of dispensaries so I suggest you go there well I love nor DS so of course that's where I headed so I went over to the dispensary I stood in line I walked up to the counter and I said to the young man behind the counter now that I know is called a budtender and I said okay I have chronic pain what do I use what do I do and out from beneath the counter he pulled a rice krispies treat a bag of caramel corn and a chocolate brownie and I'm looking at this and I'm thinking what how do I use it what do I take and he's like well I have no idea you know I just like this one and it no it kind of makes me and I was like okay great this is not science this is not medicine I need to go and find out more information so I then made my next stop was it heme con well heme con fulfilled every stereotype that I had about cannabis I mean you had your young ladies with the body paint and the strategically placed pot leaves you had the I heart vagina signs along the wall you had the the deafening boom box you know boom boo-boom boo-boom and I'm trying to listen to the vendors and I'm asking them questions and they're giving me answers and and I can't hear anything but what I also heard while I was there was the same girl in the body paint was treating irritable bowel syndrome with cannabis you had the person with the chronic pain seeking answers the social anxiety looking for answers with cannabis so I thought there's got to be something here and I'm since I'm obviously not finding it I'm gonna have to go figure it out myself so I went next and I bought a couple of ounces of something called xxx chem dog and I got it at the granny rate and I went home into my kitchen and I started making this I could not believe that my pain had been so affected by this plant that I had gone from level 8 to a level 2 almost instantaneously when I had taken a puff of it and that no doctor up to this point had ever bothered to mention to me that cannabis was an option how was that even possible so I thought what is it going to take for a doctor to be able to recommend cannabis effectively for treating patients just me so I made this in the kitchen and I can add the oil and I'm looking at it and I'm trying it and I thought okay what is it gonna take so that a doctor feels comfortable actually recommending this for its patient so what are the keys that are gonna be there the first thing is there's gonna have to be lab tests associated with this product if you do not have a lab test associated with the medicine you do not know how many milligrams of each cannabinoid is in there you don't know what you're taking you don't know how to take it and you can't be consistent and frankly a doctor is only going to want to prescribe or recommend something that can be done consistently and accurately the next thing is the doctors going to have to do a very in-depth patient intake process because they're going to have to have all of the same questions that they would ask in treating any disease but then they have to incorporate a set of questions that are specific for cannabis use in itself the next thing is they're going to have to very well understand this plant and the properties of it there are over 500 chemical compounds within the cannabis plant and each one has its own medical potential within it and so how they work and how they work together is very important that a medical professional understands when making this sort of recommendation and the next thing is they're going to have to have a way of giving you specific dosing instructions for each disease that you're treating so that once they do start this feedback loop that they can see what's working and what's not working and refine the data and keep making it better and better I'm a process engineer finding patterns and establishing with data is just the logical way to figure out something and turn it from a plant into a medicine so I went out next and I got a whole bunch of different varieties of cannabis and I was very excited I made all these oils I sent them out for lab results our lab testing and lo and behold I sat down and I'm looking through all these labs and I'm like what am I looking at I have no idea what any of this means I do not understand I don't understand what beta carry a saline is I don't know what Elsa PI I don't know what any of these different components are this so I need to get more education on this because the thing that's fascinating about cannabis is that it is really a pharmacy and a flower because you have all these different compounds within there you know everybody knows about THC and CBD you hear about these in the press there's the misnomer that one gets you high and one is the medicine I would flip that and I would say one isn't of much value and the other one is really good medicine meaning the THC that's a different talk but let's go ahead and stick with this but you also have other cannabinoids in there like CBN and CBN is the one that helps to make you sleepy you have THC v which we believe regulates the insulin uptake in the body so there's all these other you then have all these things called terpenes what terpenes are what you taste and what you smell in a terpene for example in in lavender you have something that's called a little lool that's very calming if you've ever picked up a lemon and held it to your nose and smelled it and had that uplifting feeling that it gives you that's limonene that's also in cannabis so we know that it has all these various components within it and we have to see how they work together I learned about something called the entourage effect now this isn't an actor with a bunch of fans hanging around him this is how all the components of the plant work together in the case of cannabis the whole truly is greater than the sum of its parts because you can buy isolated where they just use one component of it but it is not going to work anywhere as near as well as when you have all of the components together so let's talk about a piece of chocolate cake you could have your flour your butter your sugar your eggs your vanilla your cocoa all of the ingredients that go into a piece of care of chocolate cake but you certainly are not going to have have the experience of eating a piece of chocolate cake and that is a nutshell what the entourage effect is so now we know that we have to have the whole plant so that we have this entourage effect we know that doctors are going to be able to have to dose it correctly but what is in fact a dose because people don't understand that so what a dose is is how much you take and how often you take it if the doctor says I want you to take two in the morning and two at bedtime that's your dose if the doctor says I want you to take one three times a day that's your dose if they say take ten milligrams in the morning and 20 milligrams in the evening that's your dose now what is the therapeutic dose a therapeutic dose is how much is required for you to accomplish what your objective is for example if your objective is to sleep eight hours a night the amount of cannabis that is required to get you asleep keep you asleep and allow you to wake up after eight hours feeling refreshed that is your therapeutic dose if you're suffering chronic pain it's not the amount that knocks you on your butt it's not the amount that gets you high it's the amount that gets your pain under control to a point where you were still a fully functional member of society that is the therapeutic dose it's not just how much you can use so now let's take a look at what is not a dose all right because I hear all the time from people I'll say how much are you taking and they'll say oh I take a one-to-one or I take a one to five or I take a twenty to one well that's great that's a ratio that tells me how much you have one component is in relation to another but it doesn't tell me what they are it doesn't tell me how much concentration of each one is in it just tells me the relationship between two different molecules it's also not the number of drops if I say how much do you take and you say four drops or two drops or five drops if I don't know how many milligrams are in the whole I have no way of knowing how much is in an individual drop and then lastly the most important in the United States in particular where we are not on the metric system however the medical community is a milligram and a milliliter are not interchangeable one is a weight and one is a volume so you need to know how many milligrams of the cannabinoids or whatever the chemical compound is within the volume of whatever the product is whether it's an oil or a cookie or a rice krispies treat alright so let's take a look here at a theoretical therapeutic dose now I want to stay right here before I go any further this is not a particular dose for our therapeutic dose for anything for anybody it's strictly for the purposes of the disc demonstration and I have it up here and I want you to also before I go any further I want to say that no doctor in their right mind would ever recommend somebody start out in a dose this high you always want to start out very very very low and increased slowly until you reach your therapeutic dose but let's take a look at this for a minute we have a recommendation here of a THC dominant medicine that from the doctor they want you to take 25 milligrams a day divided into two separate doses with 1 5 milligrams in the morning when you get up and 20 milligrams about 1 hour before bed they wanted to have several of these different terpenes in it if possible and they want you to take it sublingually which means under the tongue thus the picture of the person sticking their tongue out at you a little bit rolling stones so I'm going to take that and say ok now that you've got this how do we take that information and convert that over to going to a dispensary to buy a product to match it so I'm going to take this as a typical infused oil because it's sibling wool we need to use a tincture or something that can be done under the tongue and let's take a look into a blow-up of the label alright so this on this label I'm going to look along with you it says it's an extra-strength THC product it has 30 milligrams weight of THC within each milliliter the volume so 30 milligrams per milliliter tells you how much is in there we also know that this is going to be about one milligram per drop because we know that a rule of thumb is when you have an infused oil it's approximately 28 to 30 drops per milliliter so in this case because it's 30 milligrams per milliliter it's gonna be about one milligram per drop so in order to achieve the five milligrams in the morning it's going to be five drops and for the twenty milligrams before bedtime you're looking at about three-quarters of a dropper or 0.75 milliliters to achieve that and that will give you precisely what the doctor has recommended for you so I encourage you when you leave here to go to your local dispensaries and look at the myriad of products that are available on the shelves today they come in all forms they come in capsules and waters and all sorts of other things and take a look and go up to the budtender and ask to show you what some of these products are you have the benefit now of a regulated market which means that you now have proper labeling so everything is easier to tell what is in it which really makes eases the way for you to begin your exploration of what cannabis products may work for what ails you and I just one last word of caution remember always start very low and increase slowly thank you you", "YHWOpgRz-V4": "it's a health condition that affects one in seven people in the UK and this week my next guest has me at headlines after revealing she used cannabis oil to help cure her migraines on TV presenter Jenny Powell joins us now alongside dr. Hillary and Johnny I mean these were debilitating migraines this was taking days out of every single month for you we just couldn't leave the house yeah it's interesting because it's only very much later on in life for me sort of mid forties when I when I discovered that I was actually suffering from the first of I just thought was a really bad headache or a virus and I remember I was actually filming it was freezing cold I was about 46 bit stressed and it was that time of the month and I just had this awful searing headache I felt sick and actually for the first time ever thought can't work and I had to ask if I could just sit down for a while and start working and since then sort of on a sort of regular basis normally I think for doing my hormones and when my periods start I've just had this awful migraine where sometimes three to four days I just can't can't function can't you know can't make tea for everyone can't do the school around can't go to work and it's something that I didn't really I never thought about it you know with people say I've got a migrant that always she's just got a headache you know but why did you have to lie down you know what why is it so dramatic because you look fine but actually and it changes your character I've been really sort of disgruntled and snappy and you know I just I want to talk to anyone I'm actually not held to live with and it was held to go through as well and had you been to the GP there and and gone down there yes tried various kind of mini yeah I'm not great at popping pills I'm all for being preventative and saying but why am I getting them you know what can I do to prevent them rather than right well every month I've got to have this this stack of pills to stop me suffering so much so you know for me that there was sort of like as a safety box it was you know where I'd have these pills there is sumatriptan yeah which kind of worked but I'm not happy with that really I'd rather find out why I'm getting it yeah and what I can do about it or May a more natural way of getting over it and this is then how the the cannabis oil can abide it with your partner actually suggested it yes yes my other half Martin he sort of researches a lot into system well first of all from nutrition but authored to health and sort of holistic ways of looking after yourself and it was a friend of his who actually was epileptic and she's done a lot of due diligence with it and discovered that it helped her I'm just saying this he's all for everybody's different you know I'm not an expert but you know I started to read up on things and discovered that you know for headaches it could help so I tried and it's been like three four months and I haven't had a migraine which for me is life-changing really yes and it could very well be the placebo effect who knows Hillary but where where do you stand on this because if you're saying you've got three or four months there with like this terrible migraine what Jenny describes really well is menstrual migraine and this is very common so many women in the days leading up to their period and during their period they can get migraines on a frequent basis and part of the reason for that is is a falling off of Eastern and levels just before a period and a rise in chemicals called prostaglandins which can cause inflammation and pain and and normally we treat those we can treat those with Eastridge n' just before the period we treat them with with medicines that can stop the inflammation and that would be the traditional way forward now there's huge hype at the moment about CBD products as sold as health supplements legally in this country things everyone's jumping on the bandwagon and you really don't know what you're buying so some will contain a lot more CBD than other products which may have hardly any and there is research done it being done on how therapeutic CBD can be in things like neurological conditions headaches migraines anxiety depression a lot of works being done but we don't yet know how effective CBD is and what concentration you need yes you can buy it provided it satisfies all the safety and sort of regulatory necessities but you don't know what you're buying and some of it can be really expensive now it's worth trying and you've tried it and it seems to work for you and that's fine what it doesn't have in its THC which is the psychoactive chemical that you're not getting a high but you are getting some pain release with an awful lot of people don't quite know what is that you hear they're trying a health supply which is legal cannabis is a Class B drug and it's still illegal to to use and possess and supply so you know you've got to be there is a big distinction this CBD doesn't contain the THC which which has this that gives you the high is the psychoactive and activity but it may be that for some people when they use a decent concentration of CBD does give them relief against pain and some people even think it could be good for conditions like Parkinson's epilepsy anxiety and depression yeah just drops I just take her you know you sort of work up to what sort of works for you but for me just a couple of drops underneath the tongue for about 60 90 seconds and I do it twice a day but like I say you know it works for me I think and I've been very careful I've done the due diligence on what I've got a sort of certified organic non sort of toxic drops that I use from hemp so you know you have to you have to go out there and do the research yeah but it is tricky because it's you know it's very expensive as well and if you get the wrong one you know and there are plenty you can buy online which will have more concentration and others you can buy and health food shops might have very very little if any you know so just be careful and do you diligently it's a waste of money otherwise you", "xhnM7s4BQRE": "[Music] nothing we're doing is hurting anyone we're so lucky that everything that we create here you're not just creating it to make money you're actually gonna help someone no matter what right now it's all illegal that's the bottom line it is not permissible in country of Canada right now to be selling edibles I have nothing really to lose other than cannabis if I didn't have access to it myself I don't know where I'd be [Music] [Applause] bandanna girl meet the high-five an all-female crew who organized monthly cannabis pop-up markets that specialize in edibles these markets are new phenomenon sweeping Toronto and it's totally illegal come October Canada will be the second country in the world to legalize weed while inhaling dry cannabis will be legal selling cannabis infused edibles will remain illegal into 2019 one of the most interesting things happening now is that big business is dominating the market and pushing out the black market which is full of people who have been part of the cannabis community for years and pave the way for legalization some of those people are in the high five I met up with their co-founder Sarah Gillis at one of her markets and while other black-market pop-ups are male-dominated this one appeals to women and the LGBTQ 2 community so we're gonna bag there should be a hundred what led you to start doing the pop-up market so I have like my own brand of baking and we just thought it's so cool to be able to meet the makers when we started we were very like okay what would a legal market look like and as a entrepreneur how would you showcase your products so we thought of dosing lab testing children's warnings nutritional information your packaging how that looks like to keep it really professional because before you just get it in a sandwich bag you're looking to be unmasked in you know what I mean since selling cannabis infused edibles will remain illegal after October the high five are at risk of being shut down at any time we spoke to Toronto city councilor Joma havoc who says that there is still a lot to consider before making edibles legal how will you control dosage how will you educate the public on the effects we need standards we need to know how we're gonna monitor this and it's not it's not a way of saying no it's a way of making sure that it is done in a safe healthy clean environment and doesn't impact people negatively right now it's all illegal that's the bottom line it is not permissible in the country of Canada right now to be selling edibles [Applause] have you ever had to deal with police we've had them come by and in the past but a lot of time like need to go park outside and they're just making sure everyone's safe I've never had luckily a complaint from a neighbor people take big risks to manufacture and supply consumers with edibles we visited a kitchen and met the head Baker who sells her products at the high five pop up market making some pride Blondie's today this is butter infused with distillate the dosage of our distillate items is 115 milligrams the tray is 32 pieces so it's three point six eight grams of the fluid for the whole tray so it's a lot more precise it's easier to manage because we can use a syringe and we can get a lot of more precise measurements there are huge repercussions if you're caught selling edibles even after the new canvas law is introduced in October selling edibles will be punishable by up to 14 years in prison you're very proud and wanted to be shown on camera why have you made that decision I think it's because I really care and I have nothing really to lose other than cannabis if I didn't have access to it myself I don't know where I'd be [Music] the hi-5 says their pop-ups aren't just for recreational users they have customers who rely on these edible products for medicinal purposes so what brought you to this cannabis event today I can always get access to flower but that's not always good enough I got to be able to medicate in all situations and markets like this allow me to like they're saviors that I can get my are so and that's which is Rick Simpson oil which halfs my opiates and halfs like my Pharma like anxiety meds and it just feels so good to get off of some of those medications why do you think the government is so hesitant to jump in with edibles I think consistency I think testing is not quite perfect yet and you're not just working with food you're working this essentially pharmacy so to have those two like worlds that are on their own so detailed how do I do that together now cannabis has helped me so much I think every human deserves a chance at that these products are my life they give me my life back I can't but encourage folks to respect the law and that if they don't there are potential consequences what keeps you involved in this industry given these risks that are you know you're personally facing yeah I think like I joined when I was like in my teens so it's kind of like what I know now we're giving back to the economy for creating jobs and nothing is worth doing is hurting anyone we're so lucky that everything that we create here you're not just creating it to make money you're actually gonna help someone to MedWatch one thing that is clear from the market is there is a huge demand for edible with cannabis legalization around the corner the Canadian government isn't meeting those needs being a medical patient myself I hope to see the Canadian government quickly figure out the complexities around edibles so people can get access to cannabis in the way they choose to consume it [Music] [Music]",

Woman: They just have\nfollowers on Vine. Lavorato: Welcome to \"Bong App\u00e9tit Cook Off\"\nWeed Week. We are here in Los Angeles,\ncelebrating. We have Dee Nasty with us.\n-Whoop, whoop! Lavorato:\nWe have Miguel Trinidad\nin the kitchen. And of course, B Real,\nhost of \"Bong App\u00e9tit Cook Off.\" Hello, guys. You know, we got some of\nthe best minds in the cannabis industry\nhere with us tonight, and we're gonna have a great\nconversation, so welcome. Matt Barnes --\nretired NBA player, cannabis advocate. My name is Mal of the \"Joe Budden Podcast\nwith Rory & Mal,\" and, uh, a weed advocate,\nfor sure. I'm Cheech.\nI'm the Director of Merchandise and the host of \"Sauce Talk\"\non VICELAND, and, um, yeah,\nheavy weed advocate. I'm Guapdad 4000 --\nalso used to work in the NBA. I used to to scalp tickets.\nI was -- [ Laughter ] I'm a scammer-turned-rapper, and that's what\nI'm here for. [ Laughs ] Uh, Jas Waters.\nI'm a writer/director. I'm on Showtime's \"Kidding.\" I'm DJ Nina9 --\nSiriusXM Hip-Hop Nation. I'm Al Harrington, ganjapreneur, owner of, uh, Viola Brands\nand, uh, Harrington Wellness. [ Indistinct conversations ] -There we go.\n-I'll be right here. Tonight, we're gonna\ntake you on a journey. So, we want\nto destigmatize cannabis through the universal\nlanguage of food. The whole meal is gonna be\nabout 20 milligrams, so you'll be able\nto pull back or consume. It's all up to you\nhow you wanna, you know, go on this journey. So, here we go, guys. It's a take on a fried oyster. This is about 3 milligrams. It's gonna be a little bit\non the saltier side, but I wanted to play with\nthe flavors of the Insane OG that we infused this with. It's piney.\nIt's mineral-y. I wanted to bring out the salt. Enjoy the first course. Harrington:\nSo, what are some of -- of everyone's funniest\nedible experiences? -Mm.\n-Who got funny ones? I met a girl, and she --\nand she -- and she came to go\non a first date with me. She didn't know that\nI would be on that edible.\nRight. Thought it was a first date, so I'm like, \"I'm broke, baby.\nWe're going to Denny's. We finna to chop it up. At Denny's\nis when the edible hit. I said,\n\"I ate all this weed cake. I need help.\" And she told me\nto drink milk. Right. I don't know why I didn't\nget it from Denny's. I said, \"Let's --\"\n'Cause they serve milk. \"Let's go to my house...\" [ Laughter ] -I mean, yeah.\n-\"...'cause my pop's got milk.\" [ Laughter ] I don't live with my pops. He was in jail. There was no milk! I'm from New York, right?\nAnd it's not legal in New York. So basically, anybody who's\nfucking around with edibles, they're just doing whatever\nthey think is what it is. -They do --\n-At least here -- yeah. At least here, you know,\nyou can dose it properly, and, you know,\nyou can take it in a way that you can measure\nwhat you're taking. Alcohol is so regulated.\nAlcohol is cool. Like, you can wake up\nand drink at 11:00 a.m., and it's called Sunday brunch. You know what I'm sayin'? We're in Prohibition\nright now. -Right.\n-Yeah, this is a Prohibition. Again, the whole alcohol of it\nwas about taxes. Once they could find\na system to -- to tax it and make money off of it,\nthen it was legal. See, but with edibles, for so long,\nit wasn't regulated, and I've seen a lot of -- yeah, I've seen it take\nsome of the best people out. -Yeah.\n-And I just -- so I'd never -- I never fuck with it, ever. I don't have no stories for you.\nI can't lie to you. I'll sit there and laugh at the\npeople and get high with my -- but I'm not gonna do the --\n'cause it -- You got no stories.\nYou have no control\nover that shit. Nina9: I'm not mad.\nI was high for like a week. It -- It felt good. Like, you go to sleep,\nyou wake up --\nWhoop-dee-do! [ Laughter ]\nI was good. [Laughs] \u266a\u266a When we think of\nan edible experience, we're always thinking of that\ntime when we got too high. -Mm-hmm.\n-And then with legalization, that's what it will help\nto prevent because there will be\nregulations on the edibles. Barnes:\nI think that's one thing, too, where, you know,\nmyself and Al are working with UCLA on this\ncannabis research program, and we really feel like -- I think, our goal is to remove\nthe word \"high...\" -Mm-hmm.\n...from it and explain\nthe educational -- educational side\nand the beneficial side of it 'cause I think people who don't know enough about it\nare afr-- \"I don't want to be high.\nNo, I don't want to be high.\" I think that they steer clear\nof the word \"high.\" So I think if you can really, you know, obviously,\neducate them and let them know\nthe beneficial side, especially being an athlete -- and we can speak\nfrom experience. Um, this is what it does\nfor our bodies. It hits everyone different,\nyou know. You may take to something\ndifferent, but there's a part on that --\non that plant that can help everybody.\n-Yeah. Harrington:\nYou know, if we left it to a vote of the -- the nation,\nyou know what I'm saying, I think that cannabis\nwould be legal, right? So, we all know that right now,\nthe issue is the politics. You know, they're trying\nto figure out how to tax it. They're trying to figure out\nhow to include big pharma. A lot of these states, they're always trying\nto create environments for the smaller people\nto fail. The one thing is, like,\nwe do know, like, the -- the community that's most\nnegatively affected by cannabis was the black community. -Yeah.\n-Absolutely. So, now we have this industry\nwhere, obviously, you know, our brothers and sisters\nare still locked up, but there's now\nan opportunity. And these black caucuses\nare in this mind-set of, like, \"No, we don't\nwant cannabis.\" And I'm telling them --\nI'm like, \"Look, we cannot miss\nthis opportunity 'cause there's billions\nof dollars at stake, not -- for -- for our communities.\" It -- I'm very aware\nof the fact, like, I'm on television\ncooking with cannabis while people are in jail\nfor much less. -Yeah, facts.\n-Right? -Yeah.\n-So... But what I think\nthat the show does and other\ncannabis content does is push the narrative forward so it's not this thing that, like,\nhas this bad stigma. I think about this\nevery single time I go into a dispensary. How many of my cousins\nare sitting in jail for the same weed? And the truth is --\nis that the only difference\nbetween them and me is state and time. But this is all politics, so it's -- it's --\nit's more than just the money\nthat's out there. It's also access\nto the healing that's out there. It's also being able to\nparticipate in something that makes you better rather than\nsitting behind bars because you got to it\nfirst. B Real: Like they said for years\nbefore it was legal, this is the number-one\ncash crop, right? So it's about convincing\nconservative and religious voters. -Money talks.\n-Yeah. -Right.\n-Lobbyists. -Lobbyists...\n-Lobbyists. ...because realistically, a senator in the South or a congressman\nor a governor -- he might not want\nto risk his seat. The game plan is,\nhow do we convince them? The conservatives\nsee the money behind it, so that's a easy --\nthat's a easy win right there. -But once --\n-I think it's, uh,\nedu-- education. Yeah, and it's all\nabout education. It's ab-- It's about having\nthose conversations you're talking about. But I think, you know,\nwe're in a time where people are open-minded, and they're hungry\nfor information. \u266a\u266a Lavorato: You get curious. Like, when it starts\nto be more around, you're like, \"Huh.\nOkay, well, maybe I could -- oh, it works\nfor my back pain? Oh, I have arthritis.\nI can take a bath in it. I don't have to get high.\"\n-Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Everybody thinks of weed,\nand they're thinking about... -High.\n-...are they getting high, but there's CBD that has\nnon-psychoactive properties, and it's -- like, I put my mom\non to, like, the CBD cream, and now she's always like,\n\"Oh, my God. My neck hurts.\" Like, \"Can you bring me\nthat thing?\" And it's like, there are\nso many properties to this plant that is so stigmatized,\nand it's like -- There are so many things\nthat you can do. But if you don't want\nto get high -- not everyone takes\nto being high. Like, some people\njust can't deal with it. -Right.\n-You know what I'm saying? But there are so many\nbenefits to the plant, and you can do it\nwithout having to be altered. For me, weed was always\nthat thing that made me not feel like\njumping out of my skin. -Mm.\n-You know? And now I know that\nthat feeling of feeling like you're\njumping out of your skin is what anxiety is. A part of the high is, like,\nbefore you actually smoke, like, breaking the weed up,\nyou know, rolling up.\nIt's a ritual. So if you have anxiety\nand you're doing that, that helps you --\nyour mind relax... -The process.\n...calm down. -Mm-hmm.\n-And then you smoke. I died off of edibles\none night, though.\nI came back, though. [ Laughter ]\nI didn't realize\nyou came back? Yeah, I came back.\nYou came back. -How? Explain. Elaborate.\n-I-I was up, and then I was down. [ Laughter ] It's that simple. Dee Nasty: My God,\nthat smells really good. What's up with\nthe second course? Trinidad:\nIt's called a salad. It's called a salad? Well, I can smell it\nfrom over here. That's for the third course,\nbaby. We got some garlic\nand some ginger slowly browning. Bring that salad over here. [ Speaks Spanish ] Alright. So, you know,\nwe are in California. There's a lot of fresh produce. And the the strains\nthat we're using -- there's not only the Insane OG, but we also got some stuff\nfrom Viola, from Al's company. And this shit is fire. I mean, it's strong as fuck.\nAlright? Because it has coconut oil, it's gonna absorb into your\nsystem a whole lot faster, so this is gonna hit you,\nlike, in 15 minutes. What's the funniest shit somebody sent to y'all\non social media? I have a -- I had a guy who --\nhe was like, \"I want you\nto humiliate me on 'Live' with, like,\nthree of your girlfriends.\" And I just was like,\n\"I don't know, son.\" Like, \"I don't know\nif I could do that.\" He's like, \"Yeah, like,\nI'll wear your panties.\" -Oh, wow.\n-Oh, word? Yeah, he wanted me to --\nYeah. He wanted\nto wear my panties. He wanted them to be\nspecifically pink. I s-- I turned it down. That was the craziest thing\nthat I had gotten in my DMs, you know, other\nthan the occasional\ndick pic and shit. -Who's gonna follow that?\n-Which are the worst. Yeah, I hate 'em, even though I did see one\nthe other day that I was like, \"Oh. Okay.\"\n-You get surprised. Nina9: You see it, and you be\nlike, \"Okay, now delete.\" No, no,\nbut that's very rare. Guapdad 4000:\nYeah. That shit is cool, but imagine being a dude\nwho gotta deal with that who don't want to\n'cause that's --\nI mean, look -- [ Laughter ] My whole thing is\nif you get a dick pic, send them one back. -No!\n-Whoa. [ Laughs ] If you're a girl --\nIf you're a girl, they'll be thrown\noff guard. B Real:\nI get the occasional -- the occasional, you know,\nbig weed stunt -- somebody smoking through,\nlike, a turkey or a, you know, cantaloupe\nor this or that, you know. They plague my shit\nwith that. But you know, I re-post it.\n-Right. Yeah. I like that. Like you found it. Some of it's good,\nyou know. You were basically\none of the first people who started\npromoting weed. When you came out, like, you\nwere one of the first rappers, and everybody thought\nthat if you were smoking weed, you was, like, on heroin\nand crack, as well, you know? So, you were\none of the first to kind of break through\nand open that up.\nRight. So, tell us about\nyour journey into that. We for sure rolled up\nand smoked weed, but we also, you know,\nwere fucking with \"High Times\" and getting information\nfrom \"High Times.\" We were constantly\neducating ourselves about the -- the --\nthe cannabis movement, going under the tutelage\nof -- of, uh, Jack Herer, rest in peace. -Which is a great strain.\n-Great strain. -Right, yes.\n-Dude, great strain. But he's also a great man because he educated a lot of us\nthrough a book called \"The Emperor\nWears No Clothes.\" -Mm-hmm.\n-And we started seeing, like, from the -- you know,\nin the '20s and '30s, the propaganda starts shifting\nagainst cannabis. Throughout our career, we had obstacles and blocks,\nyou know, because we were\nthe cannabis group. That's why people\nlook at weed the way they do, because they're looking at\nall these other drugs that kids are\nreally dying off of... Right.\n...and they're putting\nall of these drugs in one lane. I think\nit's also stereotyped as a minority thing. -Yeah.\n-Absolutely. You know what I mean?\nTo keep it real, you know. I mean, people -- first,\nthey want to get their -- th-their foot in a- a-and get their position\nwith the taxes and everything, but it's -- it's stigma as, uh, you know,\nyou see rappers doing it... -Mm-hmm.\n-...or people who are lazy or, like you said,\nit gets clumped in with the lean\nand the other shit...\nYeah. ...'cause you always\nsee people smoking when they're drinking --\nyou know what I mean? So it -- it all gets\nclumped into one. So, like --\n-Is it legal now in New York? -No.\n-No, not yet. It's legal in Jersey,\nright? They just postponed\nthe vote that was supposed\nto happen last month. And even though like 60%\nof the residents and the governor is, like,\ninto it, like, the Senate was, like,\nalso, like, \"nah.\" Harrington: Throughout\nthe licensing process, there wasn't no diversity. And that's a huge issue\nin the industry...\nMm-hmm. ...because there's not enough\nblack representation -- black, brown, women\nrepresentation in this space. So that's what it was about. They didn't want\nto monop--\nIn Jersey? They didn't want to monopolize\nthis process. They wanted\nto make sure that -- you know, that social equity\nwould be addressed before\nthey went recreational. \u266a\u266a Mal: I think Miguel\nwants to give intro. What are we eating? Uh, this is, uh,\npescado con coco, also known as... It's local rockfish, so it's very similar\nto red snapper. Uh, the coconut sauce\nthat you see under it is infused with the Insane OG and the Viola strain\nthat you guys gave us. A little bit of spice,\nlittle bit of ginger, some brightness, coconut,\nall smoothed out -- 5 milligrams. -12 milligrams.\n-Yeah, 12 milligrams. -What about the drink?\n-Yeah, what's the drinks? -The drink was 4 to 5.\n-Hey! Enjoy, you guys. -Thank you, Miguel.\n-Thank you. Harrington:\nI just feel like the only way\nwe gonna affect change is, like,\nwe gotta create jobs. You got-- You gotta\ncreate financial freedom. Like, without money,\nyou're gonna be miserable. Lavorato: Would there be\nsome way to do that with, like,\na co-op system? So, like, everybody could\nhave a piece of -- like, say you did\na manufacturing --\nA co-op in the projects? Well, I mean, like, if you did,\nlike, a manufacturing facility where all of the workers\nwere invested in the facility, you know what I mean?\nWaters: You gotta back up\nfor a second, though, because what\nyou're talking about is the poverty\nof low expectation. So, if I'm\non the street corner, and I'm slinging or I'm doing\nwhatever I'm doing, at the end of the day, my -- I have chronic headaches. I don't know what's --\nwhat's wrong, but I know that I don't\nfeel well most days. I'm also desensitized to\nthe idea of losing someone. So if I'm being told my life doesn't\nactually matter, a co-op does nothing. Um, until you stop,\nlike, surviving, you\ncan't really live. -Yeah.\n-You know what I mean? Like -- like --\nand that's basically what you were saying\nin a nutshell -- Yes, it's desperation.\nLike, just everybody\ndesperate... Yes.\n...needy,\nyou know what I mean? It's like, dead serious,\na crab in a barrel, everybody just trying\nto get to the top or just trying to live. -Yeah.\n-You know what I mean? And you can't --\nyou can't see a hum-- you know, a humorous side\nwhen you -- when your ribs\nis touching.\nNo. You know what I mean?\nAnd you hungry or you're cold. You ain't got no --\nyou ain't got no heat. We all know what it's like. We -- We think it's\nabout raising the bar,\nand it's not. It's raising the ceiling.\nRight. And it's something that --\nthat you take for granted. And, also, in a lot of ways --\nI grew up in the suburbs. I take it for granted.\nLavorato: Right. In that you never --\nyou weren't in a situation where you had\nto actually, like, fight to just be considered\na human being. And now you're talking\nabout black men in low-income\nsituations...\nRight. ...who aren't even\nallowed to cry... -Right.\n-...or to even talk about what's happening\nto them.\nYeah. And then you want to tell them,\n\"Put your guns down.\" Well, \"put it down, why?\nWhy do I even matter? -So someone else can shoot me?\n-Right. Exactly. So, I think you have to --\nyou have to start a long way before you do a co-op\nor any sort of job opportunity. It's -- It's giving people\nhumanity. \u266a\u266a Trinidad: In front of you,\nyou have an olive-oil cake, which we do\nwith the Butter Baby. Okay, the panna cotta, we put some of\nthe Insane OG in that and some orange zest. Uh, the berry coulis\non the bottom are fresh berries\nthat we picked up on Melrose market\nthis Sunday and just, you know,\ncooked them down and made a nice sauce with it. This right here is about\n6 1/2 milligrams. But this is where\nwe give you the choice. If you feel it's too much,\ndon't eat all of the cake. Take a small bite.\n-Well, how do you do that? -Have some of the panna cotta.\n-Right. You gotta -- That's the dangerous\npart 'cause it's too\ndelicious to pass up. If we're gonna\nwalk on ice, we might as well dance,\nbaby.\nYou might as well. Let's do it. [Laughs] -Damn!\n-Damn! Harrington: You've gotta eat\nthe whole thing. Oh, my God. I'm ready to wrap this up and put it\nin my pocket, man. -This is so good.\n-So, check this out. She had --\nShe had a good question while we were on --\non the break for a second. It's a -- It's a trailer\nout right now for 4/20 for \"How High\" part two. -Oh.\n-Oh, shit. The worst part is, Meth and Red\nare not a part of it. They replaced them\nwith Lil Yachty and, um, D.C. Young Fly. Dee Nasty: I think a lot of\npeople do remakes of movies. I think the -- I think it's okay\nto pass the torch. I think that the best way\nwould be... But not -- not that collab.\nLike, that's a -- See, like, you got\ntwo smokers that are like -- Mal: I think they need\nto incorporate them\nin the movie somehow, whether they're uncles now,\nwhether they're -- It's the equivalent --\nIt's not gonna be the same,\nthough. It's -- It's the equivalent of\nhaving a Cheech and Chong movie with other guys\nplaying Cheech and Chong. Cheech and Chong.\nExactly. You put Wiz in it, you put, like,\nsome other guys that are cooler that really are associated with the cannabis,\nlike, culture, and we gonna go see that.\nBut I think -- I think -- -I think they should've just --\n-I'm not gonna go see that just 'cause I don't think\nthat D.C. Young Fly's gonna captivate my...\nBut they could've did it. But they should've just\nrenamed the -- the movie. They shouldn't have used\nthat \"How High\" title. It should've just been\na different name. Even if they -- if they went\nwith another title, nobody was gonna\nsee that. Yo, get this cake\naway from me. -Yeah, please.\n-It tastes mad good. Yo, seriously.\nHey, Miguel, get this -- come get this cake.\n-Come get these cakes, man. -Hey, don't we get servers?\n-We're tapping out. The servers came and picked up\neverything else quick. They ain't gonna --\nthey gonna leave these\nsitting in front of us. Nah, come get this shit, man.\n-This shit is wild good, B. Mal: Y'all not gonna trick me\nat dessert. Nina9:\nI want to eat the whole --\noh, you ate the whole thing. I'm not even gonna\nhold you all. Like, dead serious,\nafter this, I'm probably just gonna,\nlike, lay down and, like, listen to, like,\nTeddy Pendergrass and vibe out. Like, word up. Like, I gotta have\na whole moment. [ Laughter ] B Real:\nHey, we want to thank everybody\nfor participating. We want to thank Chef Miguel\nfor knocking this out. [ Cheers and applause ] I've been thinking\nabout squirrels for like 30 minutes. You ever seen\na black squirrel?\nWaters: Yes. How you feel when you seen\nthat black squirrel? Represented. Exactly. [ Indistinct conversations ] Way higher than I thought\nI was gonna be.", "T7cyZzpyQJ4": "I actually kind of like the spoon yeah there you go okay it's me that you like I'd the way for you like alright now I feel like super self-conscious man I got thought about it for a second that's delicious let's make some cupcakes I'm in legal Washington and I'm leaving Seattle behind to head to Vashon Island where I'm gonna meet a woman who runs the cupcake game here and also has her own line of infused edibles she's gonna show me around a bunch of farms on the island and then she's gonna teach me how to make cannabis infused cupcakes from scratch it's gonna be another weed full day on Bon Appetit so let's find the kitchen and get baked [Music] I hear that you're the cupcake queen of Seattle wow what an honor that's great yeah I have a company called cupcake Royale and we actually work with a lot of local producers we like the idea that we can support local agriculture local economy and create a better Seattle I mean I'm sure you big all kinds of different things what is it about cupcakes that's so special I think there's a nostalgic thing about cupcakes and it's kind of a food around celebration I've heard you also make a line of edibles is that right yeah I have a company called the good ship company so we make chocolate products and cookie products and other confections that we're getting ready to launch wow that's amazing and do you use all like the local ingredients right that's it absolutely and that's why we're here today because we're gonna make some cannabis cupcakes we're gonna use the cupcake RL recipe to make a chocolate buttercream but instead of the usual chocolate reuse we're gonna use good chip chocolate so first stop we need to get some butter and I want you to meet my friend Natalie who has this lovely farm that we're okay great so let's go check it out you know hi baby how are you doing are you doing very well I'm Natalie nice to meet you natalie has a dairy farm and we're going to pick up some cream and we're going to take that cream and turn it into butter and then we're going to infuse that butter with cannabis for our cupcakes and these are your milk factories right here huh exactly so I'm LT eat it this morning and I got her mouth and I have it in the farm stand for you if you like to taste something else that edith made i have some cream on one here this is the savory this has olive oil and salt and freshly ground pepper on it and this is just the fromage blanc with a little drizzle of local Vashon honey actually Natalie I have something to share with you as well some of Washington's finest but I don't know if you'd want to give this a go okay I can do it go yeah we can try okay great and it is from Washington it's called laughing Buddha and it really just one of my favorites on the market in Washington from a flower perspective all right I've never hot box before I'm standing before pretty great I gotta say let's let's get into that cheese okay so let's start off save that's your savory Wow really really creamy texture of it it's just amazing Wow so you guys are all about doing stuff from scratch yeah is that part of food culture here in the Pacific Northwest yes it's almost like a religion yeah I mean you can really taste the difference I'm going honey mmm Wow mmm holy crap okay here's your milk great what do we owe you for that that's okay you can have it oh really yes my gift to you in that case here's my gift to you it's this really fine bud you seem like you enjoyed that Jay I have to say I did excellent so enjoy the rest of that bunch and we're gonna go put this to good use I've got my jar of fresh milk that I picked up from Cornerstone farm and I've headed over to Vashon velvet where one of Jodi's friends an amazing cannabis farm where she grows some really banging buds we're gonna pick our buds and I'm gonna go put this thing down cuz my hands are freezing right now [Music] before we do anything everybody needs a name tag state regulations excellent want to be in full compliance how did you guys get into the cannabis business when the state announced the rules for getting a license to grow cannabis they said there was a 30-day window and they might never have another window open so I thought chance of a lifetime we went for it and never looked back enjoyed every minute of it Bravo that is fantastic awesome and are you a cannabis enthusiast yourself I never know and then if it's a Saturday night I'll try some of the Laughing Buddha yeah so I wanted to show you the strain that I think would make some really great cupcakes this is our platinum blueberry this is a really space-age looking grow right here go ahead and stick your fingers in and take a sniff wow there are so many different flavors going on there I mean beyond just that tart blueberry aroma there's so much else going on like a maple syrup or yeah I can't get enough of that smell and as you can see we use exclusively LED lights which use about a third of the energy of regular standard HID lights so we're trying to reduce our carbon footprint as much as possible so Patrick how far along are these guys right here these are about two to three weeks from harvest at this point oh that good karma is paying off because I mean you've got these incredible looking buds so Jody do you think this is gonna go well in your cupcakes I like the sweetness I'm excited to see what it tastes like when these guys said they make stuff from scratch they were serious I mean every single ingredient comes from the source I met the cow that we got our cream from and I met the cannabis plant that we're gonna get our buds from and now I'm hanging out with the chickens we're gonna get our eggs from and then we'll be ready to make cupcakes [Music] we have all the ingredients right here to make cupcakes and it starts right here and we're going to skim the cream off the top how do we turn that into butter we have to churn it and this is a butter turner it's crazy steam punk jar that looks pretty arduous for one person but here check it out I have an idea if you just hold the jar and I'll go like this Wow don't hit this a little bit how long does it actually take it's gonna take about 30 to 45 minutes yeah that looks like butter all right and what we're gonna do is we're gonna put this butter into this bowl and we're gonna press it against the side to kind of squeeze out more of that buttermilk all right I think we are ready to melt this up and to infuse it with our canvas okay Jody how much weed do we have decarboxylate in here this is one gram of platinum blueberry from Vashon velvet threw it in the oven at 290 degrees for an hour and that allows it to decarboxylate which means it releases the THC what we're going to do with that we're gonna put this in this 1/2 cup of delicious butter we've been working so hard on and infuse it for 30 minutes from super low heat we're starting to smell good already so you're ready to strain it we got some cheesecloth in a strainer here with the bowl underneath it we're just gonna pour this straight through the cheesecloth there's all our spent weed flowers okay so what goes into a cupcake batter we're gonna put in the dry ingredients I have two cups of flour here then we have 1 and 3/4 cup of organic cane sugar so one teaspoon of baking powder and result is this gonna give you a little mix to combine them just a little make them next step we're going to add our cannabis butter yeah we put a lot of butter we get last wrap alright that looks good I like how it's breaking up we're going to take some of our wet ingredients and mix them together we're gonna start with four egg whites so we're gonna add to that a half a cup of warm water we're gonna add a half cup of sour cream we are doing in this recipe one teaspoon of vanilla paste and this is Madagascar per bone vanilla so we're just gonna whisk this together and now

together in the best cupcake I've ever had excellent truly thank you so much thanks for coming out to Vashon Island today barring out the beat thought about defeat mmm that is one good cupcake", "J42pmHV8ZEk": "Transcriber: Almudena Torrecilla\nReviewer: Rhonda Jacobs When I was 33 years old, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. And like so many who've gone before me, that diagnosis changed my life. It changed the way I look at the world. And it led me to two very common questions that one starts to ask when diagnosed\nwith a life-threathening illness. How did this happen? And what do I do now? Now this isn't a story\nabout self blame. These are just common\nand natural questions that come from many in times like these. I actually found the questions empowering. This is actually a story about how those\ntwo questions led to a realization that I think can help\nto change the conversation around what means to be and stay healthy. So back to my first question: how did this happen? See, (Sigh) I felt like I had done\neverything right. What do I mean by that? Well, if I ask you, what does\nit mean to be healthy, to live a healthy lifestyle? What kind of answers do you get? Regular exercise? Balanced diet? Taking your vitamins? Annual checkups? Limiting toxic exposure to chemicals,\npersonal care products? Well, by all of these\naccounts, I was healthy. I had done the work. So I was angry, and I was frustrated that I'd followed the rules\nand I still found myself sick. Now, I had a friend \nwho a few years earlier had been diagnosed with breast cancer. And when it came to being healthy, she put everyone I know to shame. So I knew she would understand\nhow I was feeling. When we got together, \nshe told me something that would eventually change the way \nI think about health. She told me that her journey \nhad taken her to a place where she believed whole-heartedly  that she had not in fact \nbeen truly healthy. Not at a whole person level because \nshe'd overlooked taking care of herself at the level of her thoughts \nand her emotions. So what she was saying \nhad some subjective merit to me because I can relate to suppressing\nmy own thoughts and emotions maybe in order to please others, or taking on the stress\nof trying to juggle a thousand things. But then the pragmatist in me just wanted to brush that off\nas a little too woo-woo. Then again I had, you know, tackled all of these. And here she was standing\nright in front of me, the picture of health and vitality. So what could it hurt\nto look into this a little further? So down I went through\nrabbit hole number one: mind-body medicine. And for those who of you don't know, mind-body medicine\nstudies how our mind, mood, thoughts and emotion affect our body. So that would be things like \nstress management, stress reduction, like going for a walk in nature, \nunplugging from technology, getting a massage, meditation, (Sigh) mindful breath-work, and thought and belief awareness. So this would be something as simple\nas being more mindful of our thoughts, or something more concrete \nlike cognitive behavioral therapy, where you become actively aware\nof your thoughts and behaviors and then replace them\nwith more positive alternatives that in turn elicit\nmore positive emotions. I also started delving into stories that highlight the mind's ability\nto affect the body. Like the peer-reviewed account\ndocumented by Dr. Klockner in 1959 about a man who he called Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright was diagnosed\nwith terminal cancer and given only days to live. With tumors the size of oranges \nhe had heard or a horse serum that was said to be effective\nagainst cancer and he begged to receive it. His physician, Dr. Philip West,\nreluctantly agreed but was astonished to find\nless than a week later his patient was out of his death bed \nand joking with his nurses. Now, this went on for months until Mr. Wright read a newspaper article stating that the serum was a quack remedy and he suffered an immediate relapse. Now, Dr. West, testing out a hypothesis, said: \"Well, don't believe everything\nyou read in the papers,\" and then he proceeded\nto inject him with what he said was a super-refined, double-strength\nversion of the drug. Really it was water. \nBut again, the tumors melted away. Mr. Wright was the picture of health\nand vitality for another two months until he read what he felt\nwas a definitive report stating that the serum was worthless, \nand he died days later. Now, this is just one of thousands\nand thousands of examples that highlight how the mind\ncan affect the body. And, so I had my anecdotal evidence, which\nincluded the example of my own friend, and I'd like to say that I took\nwhat I learned and put it into practice and lived happily ever after. Of course, that's not what happened. And I don't think I'm alone in that, because many of us hear about how stress\nand emotions can affect our health and how mindfulness meditation\ncan make a difference in our lives and all of that, but many of us also \ndon't do anything about it. I had the stories and the theories, but what I really needed\nwas hard evidence, science to prove that it was true. I mean, we've all grown up\nin a world of, you know, Newtonian, science-based thinking, meaning if we can't see it\nor measure it, then it's not real. So I, like maybe, maybe many of you, didn't start to put these ideas\ninto practice just yet. What I did, and this is now getting into \nthe second of the two questions that I alluded to earlier,\nthe \"What do I do now?\". What I did is I started using\nmedical cannabis at the recommendation\nof my nurse and other patients. And it helped immensely with pain \nand nausea and anxiety and all of the really fun staff\nthat come along with cancer treatment. I also started joining online\nmedical cannabis user communities. And I was in awe at the spectrum of issues\nthat cannabis was helping with. Intractable illnesses that weren't\nresponding to other forms of treatment, like MS, fibromyalgia, PTSD,\nTourette syndrome, IBS, epilepsy, chronic pain, autoimmune\ndiseases ... I could keep going. The list goes on. But I started to wonder, how was it\nthat cannabis was helping with all of these unrelated conditions, because I can't think of another\nmedication out there that would be able to help \nwith so many illnesses. So how did it work? Well, down I went\nthrough rabbit hole number two, and this was a deep hole. In a nutshell, I learned that the reason that cannabis was working \nfor so many different conditions is because it interacts directly with \nour body's own endocannabinoid system. The endocannabinoid system is\na little known but massive bodily system responsible for maintaining homeostasis,\nthat's balance, in the body. It consists of a network of \nneurotransmitters called endocannabinoids as well as receptor sites, the most well-known being the CB1 and CB2\nreceptors, and enzymes. Think of it kind of like\nthe traffic lights of a city, keeping the streets moving smoothly. But if a light goes out anywhere,\nit will cause problems. Congestion, confusion. Cars and people will keep moving, \nbut without the guidance and the rules, the flow just won't be as efficient \nand far more susceptible to accidents. It's actually been called the most\nprolific and integrative system in human health and homeostasis, and even dubbed\nour body's own master system because of its role in maintaining balance\namong all the other systems of the body. Now, this is important because all illness\ncan in fact essentially be boiled down to some sort of imbalance in the body, whether genetically induced or otherwise. Now, if you haven't heard of this system\nbefore, you're not alone. And if you are hearing about it \nfor the first time, you may be wondering why on earth you haven't heard of this\nepically important system until now. And it's partly because it's newly\ndiscovered in around the 1980s, but also partly because\nof the stigma around cannabis, for which the system is named. Because scientists discovered the system when they were trying to answer\nthat same question: \"how does cannabis work?\" So they learned that compounds in the\ncannabis plant called phytocannabinoids actually fit near perfectly\nwith the receptor sites of the endocannabinoid system. So used properly, this plant\ncan help to activate, tone and support the endocannabinoid\nsystem when it's out of balance. So it's a pretty amazing plant. To say I became obsessed with\ncannabis and the endocannabinoid system is an understatement. I buried myself in research papers,\nlectures, courses, certifications, learning everything I could about cannabis as well as ways to keep\nthe endocananbinoid system itself healthy and balanced. Because while it's easy to say, \"wow, look at this amazing\nplant that we have; it's able to help\nwith all these chronic conditions and balance the body,\" and obviously I believe that; I've dedicated part of my life\nto spreading the message that cannabis is medicine. But it's equally important\nto look beyond cannabis as a single cure. Because when you look closer, you'll see\nthat cannabis is an important ally, but it's only part of the puzzle. So, let's use that example again\nas the endocannabinoid system and the traffic lights. Except for in this scenario, cannabis\nis like the friendly police officer that comes in to direct traffic\nwhen the lights are out. So the officer's doing their best, and certainly it's helping to keep traffic\nmoving in a more organized manner, but we still have to figure out\nor at least try to figure out how to fix the lights. So how do we go about fixing the lights? How do we support and heal\nthe endocannabinoid system when it's out of balance? Well, it just so happens\nthat one review study in particular looked at 325 other studies that all focused on what helped\nand hindered the endocannabinoid system by focusing on key\nendocannabinoid health factors, and here's what they learned\ndirectly affect the system. Exercise, and notice I wrote\n\"Pleasurable Exercise\" there - it has to be something\nthat you enjoy doing. Okay? Diet and supplements.\nSo a couple examples that I'll give you. Herbs and spices contain\nsmall amounts of phytocannabinoids, the same compound that cannabis contains. And certain healthy fats can actually\nhelp your body to synthesize its own endocannabinoids. Environmental exposures. So some pesticides will actually\ndownregulate the endocannabinoid system, have a direct effect with it. There are a few others\nI'm going to share with you. But before I do, I just want to bring\nyour attention to a sentence that really jumped out at me\nwhen I was reading this study. It said that the endocannabinoid system represents a microcosm\nof psychoneuroimmunology. And I had to look that last word up. In case some of you don't know,\nI'm going to break it down. Psychoneuroimmunology is the study of the interaction\nbetween the psychological processes, \"the mind,\" and the systems\nof the body, \"the body.\" So really it's just a fancy way of saying\nthat metaphorically speaking, the endocannabinoid system represents\na microcosm of mind-body medicine. So now hopefully you can see\nwhere this is all coming full circle and coming together, I hope. Because here's what else was shown\nto affect the endocannabinoid system: Chronic stress. So they looked at stress from pain as well as stress\nfrom thoughts and emotions, so repeated feelings\nlike anger, guilt, depression - something that is chronic\nmeans more long-term. That was shown to significantly impact\nthe endocannabinoid system. And activities that elicit \nthe relaxation response. So that would be, again,\nkind of that walk in nature or doing some yoga, getting a massage. They consider osteopathic\nmanipulation in that study. So why does this matter? Well, I said before that we live\nin a physical world, so for many of us if we can't see it\nand measure it, then it's not real. I told about how I had heard stories\nabout how the mind can affect the body, but I still didn't give it the same weight\nthat I would give to nutrition and movement and medicine. But when I understood\nthat my own endocannabinoid system, my master system for maintaining\nhealth and homeostasis, required me to start taking care\nof my thoughts, my emotions, my stress, my beliefs, it finally clicked for me. So I want to leave you\nwith a scenario to imagine, an idea of how this information can help\nto change the conversation around health, like I said in the beginning. Imagine if the message that we heard from\nour physicians and public health officials sounded like this: \"Listen, what if I told you that there's\nthis really important bodily system, call it a master system, and if you can keep it functioning well, it can do wonders in allowing your body\nto innately keep itself healthy, heal itself and improve the quality of life for those\nwith biological and genetic illnesses.\" If I told you there was\na system like that, would you want to know\nhow to keep it strong and healthy? And I think most would answer yes to that. And then they would go on to say, \"Great, \nso think of this system like a stool. Each of the legs represents\nall that's required to keep the system functioning well. And here's why we compare it to a stool. Each of those legs is an integral part\nof keeping that stool stable and balanced. If we remove a leg, or even shorten a leg,\nthe whole stool starts to wobble and becomes less efficient,\nless stable, less balanced. So let's design a plan for you\nthat incorporates all of these concepts as part of a healthy lifestyle.\" Imagine. Not only is that proactive,\nbut it's empowering. And I invite all of you to consider\nwhere your stool is wobbling. It's been said that mindfulness could be\nthe next great public health revolution. I believe it's only a matter of time\nbefore mindfulness, stress reduction, thought-belief awareness is every bit\nas important as seeing your doctor, taking your vitamins, eating a balanced\ndiet and getting regular exercise. And maybe the endocannabinoid system\ncan help to catalyze that. It's my hope that the more we understand\nthe ramifications of this master system, the more we'd be willing to develop\na truly integrated approach to whole personal health. Who would have thought\nthat cannabis, the gateway drug, could actually form part of the gateway to\nthe next great public health revolution? Thank you.

used for recreational and medical purposes there are over 500 chemicals in the marijuana plant but the most commonly known ones being Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol or THC and cannabidiol or CBD the legality of cannabis differs per country many countries have adopted decriminalization laws to make possessions easier while other countries enforce stricter punishments the countries that have legalized are Canada Georgia South Africa arrghh way and eleven of the United States more areas have legalized the medical use even with the rise and acceptance and usage within the recent years there are so many common misconceptions with the two most well-known being that marijuana is a gateway drug and that it kills brain cells in a 2017 study it was found that 123 million Americans use marijuana while 5.3 use heroin assuming that all heroin users were pot smokers this would result in a value of 4.3% showing a weak correlation thus undefined not biological but more sociological furthermore there is no evidence to support the claim that marijuana has neurotoxic effects however it has been shown to cause short-term memory loss similar to that of drinking alcohol the studies in these regards have been inconclusive with some showing detrimental effects while others show protection against damages caused by Alzheimer's and Parkinson's medical marijuana is the use of the cannabis plant or its compounds to treat diseases and conditions it has been shown to be effective in a host of illnesses and in particular chronic pain and fiber the Center for Disease Control and Prevention found that 50 million Americans suffer from some form of chronic pain this condition is characterized that pain that lasts three to six months or more and has effects on everyday life and mental health a 20-17 study in the Journal of Health Affairs found that the majority are sixty two percent of medical marijuana usages are for chronic pain and these conditions have substantial or conclusive evidence of cannabis being an effective treatment Friday myalgia is defined as widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue insomnia memory loss and mood swings in fibromyalgia the brain intensifies the signals resulting in a greater perception of pain although idiopathic in nature it can be onset by genetics infections of trauma or stress with symptoms increasing over time cannabis works through blocking spinal peripheral and gastrointestinal mechanisms that promote pain in blocking these sensors the perception of pain is decreased or halted they use the underlying biological and physiological pathways to disrupt pain relieving symptoms although most studies focus on marijuana and the effects of pain relief as a whole there are a few that looks specifically at fibromyalgia and a 2011 study it was found that 43 percent of patients reported strong pain relief 43 percent mild pain relief and the remaining seven no changes in the 2014 study by the National Pain Foundation it was found that 62 percent reported cannabis is very effective 33 is helpful and five percent sever had absolutely no effects a 2018 study published in The Lancet showed that cannabis was effective in both lowering pain levels and weaning off other medications another 2018 study published in the Journal of Clinical Rheumatology showed that cannabis had significant favorable outcomes in all tested categories I wish I had received this treatment when I was first diagnosed I returned to who I was before and I regained my health are some of the testimonials there are many other treatments that can be used in the case of chronic pain among them non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs opioids epidural steroid injections sympathetic blockers over-the-counter prescriptions and therapy the other most used treatment method is opioids which are a group of medications derived from the opium poppy they're controversial showing a variety of positive and negative effects the positive effects of opioids are attributed to you fork feeling relieving the sensory and emotional aspects of pain however the negative effects of addiction reinforcement and dependency also persist the CDC and 2016 created 12 guidelines to make opioids safer three notable recommendations are non opioid therapy is preferred clinicians should prescribe the lowest dosage and status of the patient should be re-evaluated every three months in a 2018 study done by the Institute University did you not see them illegal it was found that it takes one week for someone to become addicted resulting in

front is something that's getting a lot more retail into the space but certainly the print here looks generally as expected but there's a number of uh takeaways here that i think are slightly troubling and this is something that i think is consistent with the the sector overall as we're seeing flattened revenue and and and a lot of material write-offs here uh given a significant amount of infrastructure that was invested in this space over the last number of years which looks like is a little bit saturated now matt i know you've got a hold on the rating and these stocks have been super super volatile how hard is it to value them in this environment and what sort of percentage move either up or down from here would it require for you to be able to confidently go from hold to buy or sell well there's a lot of moving parts in there so i can't really uh you know predict exactly you know where these stocks are are going to move relative to fundamentals versus a lot of hype that's in the sector so certainly you have to be very cautious when you're doing that at the end of the day you really want to look at what's the fundamental underpinning of these companies and a lot of it in order to get to maturation here is going to be in their adult use sort of consumer branded cpg type companies and when you look at aurora's print right here about 28 or 29 million of their total revenues for the quarter is really all that's adult use that's down about 17 sequentially so it's a run rate business now at about 100 million when it comes to those types of revenues and that's something that gets harder and harder to justify these valuations as there's a lot of excitement uh and upside going into the space right now so you really have to you know not buy into the hype too

ingredients in weed plants\u00a0\u00a0 this will be right before i talk about the brains\u00a0\nof people who use cannabis frequently and compare\u00a0\u00a0 those brains to those who don't as always you\u00a0\nshould find links in description below if you\u00a0\u00a0 want to read the full science papers yourself in\u00a0\nthe description you should also find chapters in\u00a0\u00a0 case you want to navigate different parts of the\u00a0\nvideo that interest you most i don't expect anyone\u00a0\u00a0 to have to put up with me for the full duration of\u00a0\nthis video but if you find yourself enjoying this\u00a0\u00a0 video then i think what's best for both you and\u00a0\nme would be for you to subscribe to the channel\u00a0\u00a0 doctor tell me why offers its subscribers weekly\u00a0\nscience videos about the latest medical research\u00a0\u00a0 i also tell you guys about all these fascinating\u00a0\nmedical conditions and give you top tips on living\u00a0\u00a0 longer stronger and of course healthier so\u00a0\nreally no reason not to subscribe really\u00a0\u00a0 so don't forget to smash the\u00a0\nlike button and let's get started question time how does weed get you high well\u00a0\ncannabis contains cannabinoids the most prevalent\u00a0\u00a0 being thc which binds the cb1 receptors located\u00a0\nin the central and the peripheral nervous system\u00a0\u00a0 and the activation of cb1 receptors is\u00a0\nwhat is responsible for the high star\u00a0\u00a0 often associated with marijuana use like\u00a0\neuphoria relaxation increased appetite confusion\u00a0\u00a0 and sometimes the delusions and hallucinations\u00a0\nwhich some people experience but thc isn't the\u00a0\u00a0 only cannabinoid that we find in weed the second\u00a0\nmost prevailing cannabinoid is cbd or cannabidiol\u00a0\u00a0 which incidentally has the same molecular\u00a0\nformulae and a very similar structural formula\u00a0\u00a0 to thc yeah the thc there is\u00a0\none small difference however\u00a0\u00a0 thc has a cyclic ring while cbd has an open\u00a0\nring with e hydroxyl group and this small\u00a0\u00a0 difference well it has huge consequences with\u00a0\ncbd not being able to bind the cb1 receptors\u00a0\u00a0 and hence not being able to activate them the same\u00a0\nway that dhc does in fact if you consume cbd alone\u00a0\u00a0 you are unlikely to experience any of the highs\u00a0\nthat are often associated with marijuana use\u00a0\u00a0 and actually cbd works to block the action of\u00a0\nthc on the cb1 receptors cbd plays important\u00a0\u00a0 roles though including reducing anxiety and\u00a0\nhas been found to be helpful in patients\u00a0\u00a0 struggling with chronic pain and it does not\u00a0\nappear to affect cognition in the same way the thc\u00a0\u00a0 does so how do the brains of those who consume\u00a0\ncannabis differ from the brains of those who don't\u00a0\u00a0 two areas of the brain that seem to be remarkably\u00a0\nvulnerable to cannabis consumption at least\u00a0\u00a0 according to mri scans are the hippocampus and\u00a0\nthe amygdala the hippocampus more so than the\u00a0\u00a0 amygdala now the reason why i say they're more\u00a0\nvulnerable is that there seems to be a genuinely\u00a0\u00a0 large amount of research that indicates that these\u00a0\ntwo brain regions tend to be significantly smaller\u00a0\u00a0 in those who consume cannabis frequently and\u00a0\nwho started consuming cannabis at a younger age\u00a0\u00a0 this is really interesting because the hippocampus\u00a0\njust happens to play a really important role in\u00a0\u00a0 learning and in memory yeah i remember that thing\u00a0\ni said about people who've used a lot of cannabis\u00a0\u00a0 having a really bad memory yeah dope this is made\u00a0\nmore interesting by the fact that a number of\u00a0\u00a0 studies were able to show that thc was toxic when\u00a0\napplied directly to neurons from the hippocampus\u00a0\u00a0 using animal models so much so that there is\u00a0\nsufficient evidence to call thc neurotoxic you can\u00a0\u00a0 see on the graph how the cell viability declines\u00a0\nwith time with the greatest declines observed\u00a0\u00a0 with the highest concentrations of applied thc\u00a0\nthe scientists doing these experiments were\u00a0\u00a0 actually able to block this to some degree when\u00a0\nthey administered high doses of either aspirin\u00a0\u00a0 or vitamin e before adding the thc so maybe\u00a0\nsomething to consider the next time you feel like\u00a0\u00a0 having a joint though it's unclear whether you\u00a0\nwould be able to achieve these high concentrations\u00a0\u00a0 of vitamin e or aspirin under normal circumstances\u00a0\nand finally the scientists concluded that for thc\u00a0\u00a0 to be neurotoxic it actually needed to activate\u00a0\nthe cb1 receptors and it just happens to be\u00a0\u00a0 the case that the hippocampus and the amygdala\u00a0\nare particularly rich in cb1 receptors so does\u00a0\u00a0 cannabis result in a decline in iq so the study we\u00a0\nwill be looking at today is a meta-analysis and if\u00a0\u00a0 you're wondering what a meta-analysis is then fear\u00a0\nnot i shall heroically explain a meta-analysis\u00a0\u00a0 is a study that selects a number of high-quality\u00a0\nscientific studies about a specific topic and then\u00a0\u00a0 takes the data from these studies to determine\u00a0\nif there are any overall trends that arise and\u00a0\u00a0 so healthcare professionals and scientists tend to\u00a0\nlike meta-analysis more than they like individual\u00a0\u00a0 studies because meta-analysis tend to only include\u00a0\nthe studies of the highest quality and they also\u00a0\u00a0 tend to have higher sample sizes and so it's\u00a0\neasier to draw conclusions from these studies\u00a0\u00a0 that you can be more confident about so back to\u00a0\nthe video this meta-analysis included a total\u00a0\u00a0 of seven studies from four different countries\u00a0\nthe uk the united states new zealand and canada\u00a0\u00a0 bringing the total of participants to 808 cannabis\u00a0\nusers and what makes this meta-analysis special\u00a0\u00a0 is that they only selected studies that measured\u00a0\niq before that individual started using cannabis\u00a0\u00a0 and then later after a set period of time\u00a0\nwhere cannabis was frequently used or abused and all seven studies largely agreed\u00a0\nwith each other indicating that there\u00a0\u00a0 was a statistically significant decline\u00a0\nin overall iq of around 1.98 points\u00a0\u00a0 now it's important to remember that iq tests have\u00a0\ntwo major components there is a performance iq\u00a0\u00a0 and then there is also a verbal iq the\u00a0\nverbal iq component typically measures\u00a0\u00a0 your capacity to use language to express yourself\u00a0\nand understand narrative stories and tests memory\u00a0\u00a0 meanwhile the performance iq assesses your\u00a0\nnon-verbal skills for solving problem-based\u00a0\u00a0 scenarios involving symbols and pictures these\u00a0\ntwo come together to give you your full-scale\u00a0\u00a0 iq and scientists noted that cannabis use\u00a0\ndid not affect your performance and your\u00a0\u00a0 verbal iq in the same way while verbal iq was\u00a0\nfound to decline by 2.94 points there was no\u00a0\u00a0 evidence of a decline in performance iq whatsoever\u00a0\nfollowing frequent or dependent cannabis use now\u00a0\u00a0 a decline of around two iq points on your full\u00a0\nscale iq or even three iq points on your verbal iq\u00a0\u00a0 is unlikely to be clinically relevant whatsoever\u00a0\nand i'll say this for extra emphasis these small\u00a0\u00a0 declines those statistically significant are\u00a0\nunlikely to be clinically relevant however\u00a0\u00a0 it should be noted that this pattern of iq\u00a0\nchanges remarkably similar to what is observed\u00a0\u00a0 in schizophrenia where male patients who later\u00a0\ndeveloped the condition are reported to show\u00a0\u00a0 a drop of around 6 iq points in their verbal iq\u00a0\nwhile their performance iq remains unchanged this\u00a0\u00a0 typically happens between the ages of 13 and 17.\u00a0\nhope you guys enjoyed this video if you did then\u00a0\u00a0 please take

episode today which we're quite excited to bring you guys recently elevate seeds sent us some of their brand new strains to try so we figured what better way to showcase these beauties than to do a two-part grow series in today's episode we will be germinating vegging transplanting topping and low stress training all of the key things that will help you to increase your yields so be sure to subscribe down below if you haven't already smash that like button and let's get into it [Music] what up guys pretty neat little mini scrog we got going on huh but before we even get into any of that we'd like to thank elevate seeds for allowing us to test these brand new strains so huge shout out to elevate seeds there are some good people over there doing some even better stuff but we've got a disclaimer though elevate did not pay us to make this video and we also had no say in the strange which was sent to us for testing we were lucky enough to be chosen however and it seems that we got some really fiery strains so that said the first strain is actually called forbidden cake as you can see from the description on their website it's a very loud and gassy strain whose phenotypes produce varying amounts of purple colors heck purple is always cool right the other strain while one name may sound a lot meaner than the other we can assure you that it's no slouch and it's the sherbet cake this strain actually comes in as a higher potency strain and it's a cross between two scoops and wedding cake this combination is said to make for an unforgettable terpene combo so boy are we gassed to see how these babies turn out and no pun intended okay guys so we'll be starting these seeds out using our standard germination process where we simply pop the seeds into a glass of water and place it in a dark cupboard for about 48 to 72 hours we will check back on those later in the meantime let's go prepare our pots okay so we will be using three gallon fabric pots to start we will also be transplanting the seeds directly into the three gallon pots we will not be using small seed starter pots for this grow for our soil we will be using a custom mix of soil which includes fox farm ocean forest amended with black guano and earthworm castings [Music] [Music] 24 hours later and it's time to check up on the seeds which we left in the cupboard and paid absolutely zero attention to as we can see they've all germinated and begun to sprout their taproots [Music] success so now that that's over we simply stick them in the ground and watch them grow [Music] after a few days the seedlings will begin to grow a bit more quickly as the root system establishes itself once the first set of true leaves form we will then move them into the 5x2 bedroom under our mars hydro lights if you're interested in copying these lights for your setup be sure to check the link in the description below to choose the one that's right for you a quick note though with seedlings make sure that the lights are either dimmed down or set at the right height to avoid light burn okay guys so we are now officially in the vegetative stage of the plant's life cycle and for that we should all be grateful and you can show some appreciation by hitting the like button down below if you haven't already and by the way we upload videos every week sometimes twice a week so be sure to hit that notification bell down below so that you don't miss our next upload as we were saying we're finally in veg and that means time to get to work we've actually taken some preventative steps and sprinkled some de or diatomicus earth around our ladies to help with any unwanted pests as you can see these strains show vigorous growth nice internal stacking and thick green fan leaves to kick things off early in terms of low stress training we simply placed a green metal mesh on top of the plant no rocket science here more bro science actually literally we just dropped a piece of metal frame onto the plant pot this is essentially a mini scrog or screen of green and as the plant grows upwards we will continually bend the tops down under the mesh in order to create bud sites and to maintain a low even canopy we will also only be using this technique on the two sherbet cake strings so fast forward a few weeks and we are now quickly progressing through the vegetative stage we are only aiming to veg these ladies for a short period of time so training is key we will do some lst but not just quite yet we have also begun to feed these ladies nutrients as those in the fox farm ocean forest would have started to wear off by now our nutrients of choice for this grow during the veg phase only as the fox farm grow big liquid nutrients we found this to work quite well during veg but we usually switch to something else during flower stick around to find out what that is do you use fox farm nutrients drop a comment down below and let us know what you think or do you not use it if not then drop a comment down below and let us know why not we'd love to hear what you think as you can see however these ladies are growing vigorously and they're producing some nice green leaves we will just continue to do some housekeeping for now as we go on in the vegetative stage [Music] [Music] on to week seven of this grow and we are nearing the end of our planned veg phase in anticipation of going into flower soon we will be transplanting and starting some low stress training for this grow we will not transplant all four strains but rather we will only transplant the two forbidden cake strains from their three gallon pots to their new five gallon homes we will also be using mycorrhizae in rich soil mycorrhiza for those who don't know is a beneficial bacteria that helps to promote robust root growth to see how this works be sure to check out our video on this we will put a link in the top right hand corner of the screen be sure to check it out [Music] [Music] okay by now you may be wondering to yourself but what about low stress training topping filming well to be honest we topped the ladies a few times during veg but apart from setting down the metal screen on the sherbet cakes we haven't done much in terms of training for this grow at all so on today's to-do list yep you got it lst and defoliation well actually we'll be tying down the tops of the forbidden cakes so that we can create an even canopy things may look a bit funny at first but trust us it'll work out for the best we will not be doing any tying of the sherbet cakes however because the screen has helped us to achieve our desired shape and the branches have begun to harden off due to the constant bending so we will actually just be removing the metal screen from the sherbet cakes to allow them a chance to breathe and just to stretch a bit [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] so guys as you can see we have done a significant amount of training using very inexpensive materials such as gift wine this training will be massively beneficial to the plant as it will spread out and allow for deeper light penetration now it may look a bit funny or a bit sad but it will recover trust us this is also an ideal time to do some light defoliation just to allow light to reach lower areas of the plant [Music] so we're at the final rundown before we put these ladies into the 5x3 flower room these plants are looking super healthy and show no signs of slowing down at all they have all recovered nicely from the individual training and new growth has already begin to form as a result the transformation is truly amazing and we can't wait to see what sort of quality and yields these ladies throw off but we have to wait until we head into flower and that's for another episode so if you enjoyed this video

don't forget stay high and stay fly [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you", "2reXTNFWmd4": "all right in this tobacco university video we're going to be investigating marijuana and the history of the og kush a very famous variety you might have heard of before so while marijuana is high in thc content that is important to know and while this channel does focus more on the hemp it's important to understand that while marijuana is associated with that recreational use in general following and understanding the history of the famous og kush strain can provide great insight into the marijuana culture in general and a lot of the information is spread through oral history and kind of explanations of things so this just kind of serves as an example of that also the og kush has become a worldwide staple used for numerous famous trains like girl scout cookies and there's also many different phenotypes of the og kush that exist the following that i'm going to present here is the history of the og kush is based on an interview with matt bubba berger who found a bag of seed in florida that would later become known as the og kush the original interview came on the adam dunn show as you can see right over here adam dunn right there and i was been very fortunate to meet him both in denver colorado and also on the east coast if you want to hear the interview for yourself i have a link to the youtube uh description there as far as how to look it up and the link to provide if you want to look at the original interview but here i'm going to provide a kind of summarized version so the history of the og kush just in general looking at its original this originated in orlando florida and the seed came from an unknown bag of wheat in miami in 1991. we just was called crippy which was really just a generic term for good weed and it's the start of the generation that started naming and breeding around this time frame only one plant was kept and propagated from the limited amount of seeds that were present in the once original weed and it was just called kush since the first batch was said to look like cushberries that's an important note to make that there's really no such thing as a cushberry but they like the name so it stuck and it became a popular popular in the cannabis industry in 1996 it's made its way to los angeles so while a lot of people think the og kush is a west coast california-based strain the original seed did come from orlando florida in 1991. now become how would become the og kush here well in 1988 star to actually be called the og kush in an attempt to identify it as the original strain grown in los angeles ground in la there in general it tends to be a viny morphology and can have homogenic tendencies as well originally to prevent the strain from being lost seeds were the main form of distribution and this is how the og kush got spread across the united states now looking at the og kush it's a quality over quantity example here so the cush is generally a poor yielder in quantity it's not going to give you like an example of the tomatoes over here it's not going to be a ton of tomatoes but it's going to give you high quality um end results there so the quality was above average in shops in amsterdam i did not want to pay any more for originally since it was not well known it's hard to get a premium price even though the quality was higher in amsterdam however during 1997 to 1999 in los angeles california it was getting top dollar for the cush due to the great demand and limited supply to give you an idea of what the price is going for around that time frame you're looking at 500 plus dollars per ounce and it was sold even before it was grown that's his shows you how high in demand it was now cush is very much a west coast strain sour diesel was dominant on the east coast so these kind of develop the west coast as more og kush east coast more that sour diesel strain now limited starting materials mentioned so the kush strain can be traced back to an original literally few seeds that were found in an ounce of weed way back in the early 90s very rare for this limited starting material to become such a successful strain but remember it is possible if you think about developing your own there are some people who have feminized it and generated their own versions of it but original uh has been kept for these special unique terpene profile that it does um possess here to find that true and original og kush now past the present and i gave you that kind of like just quick summary matt bubba berger has been growing the same plant propagated via clones for about 18 years up to this up to the publication of this video overall the end product is unchanged but the leaf morphal morphology has gone from more of the traditional kind of five-fingered leaves to more funky random morphology over that many years of propagation yield has dropped a little bit but over this time however the chemical profiles remain like the original so that's the importance of kind of clones or maintaining a strain over a long period of time at the point of he interviewed here he was growing up for 18 continuous years and like i said it's a slight difference in plant morphology but the key part is that chemical and terpene profile remain the same giving that og kush the reason for why it's still around to this day is it's for its unique terpene profile and uniqueness to the market and that's why it's still respected and known to the present day", "BjQcbPAd884": "welcome welcome welcome to another stream I'm your host as always Justin this one's gonna be a fun one hi this is this is one of those episodes that has been heavily heavily heavily requested so I think this is one that y'all are going to enjoy a whole lot today we're going to be talking with my good friend Kevin Chen he runs a very fascinating company that is engineering yeast to produce all sorts of interesting things we've talked about yeast engineering many times on the streams and in videos and generally a lot and so it's I think this is gonna be really cool to talk to someone who is doing this sort of professionally and and commercially and also just making a really interesting compound so without further ado let me introduce right your life my life okay oh there we go knocking okay cool ah I'm on TV hi everybody tonight today I introduce myself first or how do you want to yeah just start cool so yeah pleasure to be here and pleasure to a see you all I guess on this nice Saturday afternoon you know it's it's a this I guess just asked me to do this a while ago and that to think about it a bit just because like I got my own obligations with my my company and it's a some professional that I do so there'll be a bunch of stuff that I won't necessarily get into and of course you know opinions are my own when it comes to talking about a lot of the stuff that we'll get into here but yeah we're a company were called hyacinths we've been around for a while now since 2014 working on this particular pathway and doing a lot of yeast engineering we've done some really really interesting stuff with this pathway which we'll talk a little bit about but otherwise you know the whole cannabis industry has been amazing to kind of watch it grow with the past six years and watch the science of it grow and watch the companies kind of develop and being in Canada and watching belts happen it's been super interesting just coz it's like weird yeah that nationwide like legalization or regulation in progress kind of a thing do you remember daddy has been do remember getting the little little card in the mail like saying like it's officially gonna be legal soon oh really I don't know I don't wanna get in that car no oh my god I I don't know if I saved mine but I wanted to frame it yeah and that's like one I mean it's super super interesting to kind of watch all this happen and and we'll talk more about the science stuff but the whole policy around this stuff and and everything is is also huge and it's you know interesting for Canada as a country you know nationwide to kind of create this stuff and kind of force it out in some ways like a lot of people you know we're pretty reluctant about the whole topic and want things to go longer you're not go so fast or whatever else but I guess the the government at the time then he wanted to push it out and for many you know for many reasons it makes a lot of sense to legalize cannabis but anyways yeah so so pleasure to be here you know we I thought this was like a nice thing to do just cuz like it's it's an interesting and fun for me a lot of the reason why I do what I do is because like I like to talk and share and promote science and stuff my my day job as the CEO of hyacinth involves a lot of more like business development in finance related stuff unless so like technology stuff so you know if there's any deep technical questions then I probably won't be able to answer those necessarily anyways it's cuz I haven't been in the lab in a while but I do follow all the tech very closely and watch how everything develops but anyways I think I think that was kind of like you know how how I first met you Justin as well we're like we just we just people who like to do science and people who would like to share what we do and in science and and that's why it's like super fun to kind of be here and and spend a Saturday afternoon with all 411 people I can probably be more by the end of all this cool but yes I mean so so in Kevin Kevin's a very cool guy he does very cool stuff and I like so I mean especially because I'm also working on engineering yeast he has been a fantastic resource just to just to like Santa Santa D Chuck stuff and and just be like hey you know am I am I going crazy am I doing this right he's like and so you know that's been that's been really great so I've got a hyacinth page open write a link to it in the description if you want to check it out it's a really cool company they make so let's talk about the the obvious thing the you know the the stream title says THC but as THC the only thing that you guys are working on no definitely not I mean we like THC is one of a hundred different cannabinoids that exist in cannabis over hundred I guess there's a whole bunch of stuff going on there finding more to like every every time we're like we know all the cannabinoids and they were like no wait there's a new functional group on that one yeah yeah and there's yeah it's all the time new stuff so I mean it's almost I think what we work on is a good reflection of it's maybe a reflection of like how much interest there is around different cannabinoids so you know of course we read all the papers about new ones coming out and and those ones might be you know years away from the market but it's still something that we kind of put on our radar as like hey you know we'll have some development in that maybe one way or another depending on you know how we're broke those all come together you know there's a lot of that's like we're having a bit of a yes dream for use here we can get back in good okay so before the the stream went to [ __ ] we were talking about there are you know all sorts of different cannabinoids and also lots of other things that you guys were working on so let's let's say we can pick it up up from there and I'm just gonna try and keep my eye on the the thing and see if it freezes again hopefully we're good alright so you're saying so so are you are you just mostly working on the different cannabinoids and things in that pathway or are you also looking at compounds from other organisms as well no I'd say we're pretty much set on the cannabinoid pathway other things they look at in my spare time just for fun but or business business-wise that cannabinoids are yeah I mean and that's more than enough of like industry and and market to kind of you know develop and and to work on so it's huge okay fair enough so cool I'm gonna just bring up my notes and and see what the next topic is oh okay so let's talk about the the legality of derivative products in Canada so that we know that the the plant is now legal I mean there's literally a store down the street where you could just walk in and buy stuff yeah but talking about the derivative products specifically because I remember you were you were working on this before the derivative products were legal for sale so like you know you you could still work on them from like a research perspective but I remember there was like a time when you know you were still kind of waiting for the government to catch up before the things that you're making would be sellable basically so how is how has that changed and like it do you know how does that you know affect your your business now and yeah yeah indeed block these comments I'm reading too many of them they're funny anyways so so yeah with the where we sit with respect to regulations yeah it's been dishing to kind of watch things evolve over the years the derivative products that you're talking about is is it pretty so I guess in the history of Canadian legalization first it was like hey you're allowed to use cannabis and cannabis oils for medical purposes only and under prescription stuff and then in October twenty twenty eighteen it was like okay you're allowed to now buy cannabis and stuff in a store and there's like all nine ways to buy it as well just for consumers and then that evolved recently into you like you're allowed to now sell like you know chocolates that have like you know cannabis stuff in them too and things beverages and like a more broad category of things that that contain cannabis for the work that we do you know in general where we're interested in making THC CBD and other cannabinoids as ingredients so we're not gonna grow anything that would be so Keable necessarily but we might you know do something that or it could end up in like a pill or in like a cannabis oil of some sort or canet have been like you know other consumer product areas depending on you know where we get the most amount of interest but I hope that kind of explains like water derivative product is when we're talking about that stuff it's like anything that's that's not a cannabis flower almost and and I'd be like from a consumer standpoint where we fit the most we hit best okay but I would I would have like one one slight caveat to that which is that we might not necessarily see ourselves as a company going you know having a big role in that direction it really depends on who else we work with and how we decide to go to market in different areas and you know the area where we definitely have like a huge you know edge in is in like pharmaceutical manufacturing where you have to have like really strict call a standards really strict like you know supply chain and it has to be really robust to kind of supply people who are actually like using this as medicine and that's where like of course these production versus planned production start to make a lot more a lot more sense that you're going to be from a genetically modified organism I think we're I think they might be like me again damn it some people were saying it's because of my website yeah I mean I scrolled down that okay yeah the little animation thing was was slowing it down right hold the whole website runs out these little animation things that's what I mean you might wanna okay well Celeste open this page although in a bit like now the freaking site hub thing is gonna have little animation do so alright [Music] yeah okay it's still very present well this is definitely gonna hurt the concurrence but that's okay I'm gonna just you know what I'm just gonna pull up your face [Music] yeah I mean it's kind of frozen hopefully the so it says screen froze audio okay so we're just gonna we're just gonna keep chatting and hopefully that'll eventually the video will catch up or something yeah yes the screen froze audio is okay I don't know what the deal with that [ __ ] is but well we'll figure it out okay so um speaking of so speaking of legality waiting for the streamed video to catch up but as long as the audios fine we can still talk about this so the the thing comes from a genetically modified organism so is there extra restrictions oh there is there like extra paperwork that you have to do and like testing before you're able to sell your product because of that or is it still relatively straightforward I mean it's it you know always like kind of it's it it's complicated it's so complicated and and yeah having a GMO thing doesn't nationally make it that much more complicated than there wasn't a moment I would say it you know we've we've had to go through a lot of different regulatory changes over the years and let me think I feel like when we first started out it was actually easier for us to do it this way then it was for us like you know trying grow cannabis plants and now maybe it's a bit more reversed I guess from a regulatory standpoint and in the end it kind of varies from every every country to country that you're thinking about and this is like you know I think I think in the old regulations it actually took a bigger level of permit to grow cannabis plants for research than it did for like chemical synthesis or for biological synthesis of THC website nowadays I think it's all in the same okay and almost so it's actually being a bit easier to work with plants and and as easy it is to work with like a synthesis and stuff but then so in that sense it was maybe easier over here but I guess when I talk about the game over again they get regulations that usually comes into play more when we're looking at you know manufacturing and sales and and what you're actually selling and you know where you're shipping your strains and stuff and where you're doing all the manufacturing stuff like that and then it gets a bit more hairy city life you know if you wanted to do so yeah so like if you're selling the because I guess you're not selling the the organism itself you're selling one of the products so like chemically it's the same thing there's no difference right like GM like organic sugar and not organic sugar it's just it's just [ __ ] Chuck but so like if you were selling like a genetically modified corn for example that seems like it would be more of a regulatory hurdle than if you're just selling a product from a modified yeast cuz I guess there's a lot of precedent for selling modified yeast because like insulin and all the other and a lot of other pharmaceuticals are made through modified products I mean even even like rennet is made through like genetically modified organisms so yeah I guess I guess that would be a little easier like it there is that that precedent and precedent already kind of yeah and there's even like I mean there's ways a complexity that go beyond that of course and this is where like it's it's been a it's part of what makes the job fun you know here every time you look at a new regulation it's always a bit different or every time you look at a new different country it's a bit different as far as how they weight might classify one thing another thing but you know I guess one day people will figure it out and there'll be like more clear regulations for everything but for now I guess it's a you know we're paving that road you know all right that make sense so so so moving on and I guess the one of one of the big question is when do you when do you expect to see the stuff that you're making in in stores for the first time like are you are you getting closer is it still away a while away or like you know on a scale of like one to ten ten being like it comes out tomorrow one being like in ten years like where do you where do you figure you are on that somewhere between one and ten oh great okay I mean it's it's actually it's funny it depends it turns very much on the product that we were working with and how we which market we end up going on first and of course like you know I would say there's a reasonably good chance that we'll end up having products available in like Canada before we end up in the US for example and and there is like a pretty you know clear route to market in you know that we can take and then have our products coming out here you know soon soonish and by soonish I mean like maybe within the next like 1/2 years kind of thing but I get to some extent again it depends a bit on our depends a lot of different things that might like you know get is there and also depends on which product we end up wanting to you know push that route just cuz each you know each can I mode is different and do we want to like you know have you know do we want to partner with somebody else or do you want to do this ourselves or how do we do manufacturing and it's always different as of things I sort of come together have to come together in order to make this all work so so that's the the long long answer to that question by the way as far as like you know what we're able to do now is already like quite good in terms of producing something that you could put to market so technology wise things like are really working and we're really happy with how how we being able to progress you know on that topic like so I guess the big question have you actually managed because I know there's a lot of like theoretical technical stuff of like you know this is how it could be done or you know there will be companies where you know they will kind of pretend that they've managed to do it and then get all bunch of funding and then proceeded to do nothing so like happiness so have you actually done it like do you have a yeah of course yeah yeah yeah so like you've you've got a you've got a yeast that makes that like makes the compound right yeah cool very very cool so moving moving on this let's talk about why yeast is preferred over say just growing the plants specifically like it so kind of from a couple different different avenues like why why I mean like why why yeast versus just you know a factory full of plants like what what is the the just like most obvious benefit intersect I think it I'm thinking like there's a lot of benefits but like what's the biggest one right because I mean there's been something if you if you went down this route right like what was the what was the thing that really made you think that like yes this is the the way to go yeah I mean the biggest thing I would say is just having control over you know what exactly you're making and all of the processes that are happening like in that system to to do manufacturing is the biggest thing there's other advantages in terms of like scale and efficiency and how you can of course like put yeast in a big steel tank anywhere in the world and they'll don't know how to grow it and stuff there's there's a lot of reasons why why used to make sense but I think having having the ability to turn off on and off certain genes to be able to produce one compound or another compound or to discover new ones all of those you know things are are maybe the one of the most interesting things for right now in terms of growing growing a yeast over going a cannabis plant or trying to breed and you guys plan to do something different yeah okay and also it's so I think it's one thing that's that's kind of interesting like when we think about growing the the plants like there's sort of a bit of a misconception that it's this like super green that I mean you know pardon the pun but it's this like green technology where you know all you need is just sunshine and dirt and you can just grow these things but like the reality is most cannabis is grown inside which means that it's grown primarily using grow lights which is actually really energy intensive like I was I was reading a little while ago about the energy requirements of this specifically the the use case was in Seattle and as they were they were moving towards legalization like the amount of energy that the city was consuming I almost doubled just to like power all the lights whereas if you're doing the yeast thing like there's no there's very minimal in the way of power requirements like it's put yeast in a tank you know keep it mixed at a bubbler like you're not you're not you know burning thousands and thousands and thousand of watts on just keeping the freaking lights on so there is that little bit of a misconception and also like all that power generally I mean because most places are dumb and don't have nuclear so it's not like you're if you relieve you like you know if you're running all those grow lights off a nuclear reactor then yeah sure it's very it you know it's carbon neutral but or even carbon negative but like it's that's an almost not the case like it's almost always like natural gas like generators that are powering all of this stuff so like it's very energy intensive so I guess I guess in that regard like the the East thing is kind of good because you can also rely on the like tried-and-tested technology of essentially it's making beer basically like that's like it's making beer except the the end product isn't the liquid it's the you know the stuff that settles out to the bottom like that's that's really the the difference and like we've spent a lot of yeah like a lot of like thousands of years basically making like perfecting the art of making beer so it's like there's that there's that you know president of like we know what we like we know how that works like you get a big tank and you do the thing and you know and also like you know depending on so we were we were talking briefly before we before we got started about what you're actually using to grow the yeast and so something that you'd mentioned was that right now you're using kind of like the ideal growth media but potentially in the future you can use things that are less ideal but maybe cheaper or more environmentally friendly or you know maybe like offshoots from other production of stuff so so can you tell me a little bit more about that like what are you using I mean I know you probably can't get into like super super specific the secret sauce yes yeah yeah I know you probably can't tell me the secret sauce but like it in essence it's basically sugar water yeah it's like sugar water with some nutrients yeah I mean it's it's a there's there's all kinds of different ways to grow yeast on different kinds of media and and you can have been fine control of all the different components in like your your media composition and part of that is what will give you like more or less maybe yield a product too and so it's all it becomes part of like that the game is to figure out how all these different things and do the science into the research to figure out what the best thing is and and get there I guess but yeah you're absolutely right about like you know growing cannabis being like kind of more expensive process it's not growing like the same way that a lot of other agricultural crops are growing that are that are a lot cheaper to grow of course and and as far as future goes I mean yeah we were I guess but yeah we gotta talk about this but for the sake of the audience yeah once I mean once you have a yeast that does this you know yeast can continually be engineered and optimized in different ways and that could lead to a lot of improvements when it comes to the efficiency or environmental friendliness or sustainability whatever costs of of the whole thing and yeah that's part of the you know among the many reasons why this is like an interesting technology and why why we're doing this is that you can you know actually have these futures exist whereas you can't just kind of like you know suddenly get a kind of as plan to start you know consuming a different substrate you know overnight where like you plants or plants like they kind of they're sort of set in their ways like like engineering a whole plant to do something different is I mean it's much more difficult than like tweaking a gene or two and some yeast yeah so actually speaking of that so the idea of like okay so being able to grow THC in a tank obviously has its benefits and it has its immediate scalability so so why couldn't you say because like suspension culture for example exists for for plants right where you can take a little tissue sample and then grow the plant essentially in a liquid where it sits it doesn't grow as like plant it grows as like you know tank of weird green sooo so so why couldn't you do that for cannabis for example I guess I mean I'll never say I won't say never like somebody might be a figured as I would somehow and get to work properly but generally speaking like we like to use because it grows fast it that you can replicate it quickly plant cells are you're taking them out of like the preneur mole growth environment and trying to grow them in these fermenters and then that's where like you had you have to do a lot of special things to the playa cells to make them grow that way and then is expensive like really expensive yeah I mean I'm not like a plant cell culture expert but it's you know you can look at different products that are made from plant cell culture and I think they end up being like you know hundreds of thousands of dollars a kilo gram versus like you know tens of thousands of dollars a kilogram for example or millions of dollars a kilogram kind of thing you also so I've done a little bit of plant cell culture and like the the plant media usually is composed of what's called more chic and Scoob base because biologists are [ __ ] at naming things but also it's a lot of sugar so like you still need sugar like it it's instead of just yeast where it's like you know sugar and a nitrogen source and some air basically I mean like wine like a tube a wide nutrient for example for like growing what yeast like you need like the tiniest little bit per gallon of liquid whereas for plants like you need the more chickens cook and then you need the buffer and then you still need the sucrose so like it seems like you're kind of cutting out a lot of the the middleman with the the yeast versus trying to do it with with plants yeah and I guess the other idea that's important is that when you're growing like the canvas plant grows and it produces teach seeing this trichomes and that's where the kind of accumulates you know the thing reading right student put these big flowers on the plant that that's where the product accumulates and that's like a physiological property of the plant that's like super super interesting but to get a plant cell to do that exact same like effect in the cell culture then you end up with like a much Carter situation because you know clientele culture you got like at just sugar or sells they're all like flit around there and it's not the same environment as like of course you know a cannabis flower right yeah from some of the reading of it's doing like they don't like when you grow cannabis in suspension culture it doesn't even produce THC so you'd have to engineer the thing anyway to get it to be producing the compound in an organelle like in like in an organ of the plant that it normally doesn't in cells that it normally doesn't so it's like a huge engineering challenge more expensive media and it's finicky er like if something gets in there it like it gets contaminated the whole batch is [ __ ] and then you get to start again and it's like so it really does seem like when it comes to if you're like if you really want to grow THC in a tank like yeast really does seem to kind of be the way for it although I mean then there is a the question of like why yeast right like if you just need a microorganism why yeast versus say bacteria or algae yeah so it's there's a whole interesting interesting bunch of questions that come along with that and it really depends on maybe the product that you're making and that's where like I can I could argue that for some products plant cell culture makes perfect sense to manufacture the thing but it really depends on the the product and the cost of it and the complexity of the the actual pathway and everything like that but this is also like you know part of the reasons why you can choose you can choose which organism you want to do in in many ways yeast is great because it's easy to engineer it grows fast you has a lot of different kind of metabolic parts you can play with and and you don't see as much of that in like other kinds of bacteria or in in algae or whatever else you know you have to you might have to fight harder to get it to like take up different genes you might have to fight harder to get some of the genes to actually make function properly in different cell types and or you might have to like do more engineering with the metabolism to get it to like you know do the right thing that you wanted to do right there's more questions beyond this but like yeah growth growth rate and how they react to different products being made and how well it makes different ya can get into this like fun and complicated science of yeah metabolic engineering and I mean I think there was something important that you mentioned in there where it's like you know basically like yes you could express the genes in sort of whatever organism you want but it's not enough to just have the genes there like there's like all pathways require feedstock so if you can't also mess with the genes that control the feedstock you might like have great expression of the the couple of genes you want in like e.coli but if they don't have the ability to produce enough feedstock it kind of becomes a moot point where like you're just you're just not gonna get a very good yield even if you can express the genes just fine like like e.coli are very easy to get genes into but if they're missing the the like basement and metabolism to get you the the stuff that you need for them to even work like your yield is gonna suck yeah yeah and that's like I mean so many that's where it gets to be like yeah pretty complicated interesting science I mean it's why it it's part of the fun of the scientific job I guess and you can you can have a whole two hour session just on that or something like that right so there's there's been a couple of questions asking about the pathway so we'll get into actually talking about the pathway in a little bit I just wait I've got like a list of questions that I'm just kind of working my way through so once we've kind of talked about all the the background we'll talk a little bit about the pathway closer to the end because I mean it is a very interesting pathway there's some like really really interesting chemistry in there that I'm excited to talk about and also I'm gonna be showing there were some comments about the side link like I've you you provided a paper that from a different group that is doing this and and you know one potential pathway that they're using and because I think one thing that it'll be important to talk about later is that you know there's there's there's many ways to skin a cat right like you can you can get to the same end product chemically through very different rats like their might and and you know one route that might be easier to engineer might not necessarily have the best yield and and that kind of thing so we'll talk about that a little bit later so let's just kind of keeping to the the you know talking about the the industry and the like kind of business aspects of this cuz I mean really like at the at the end of the day the only thing that makes any of this work is the fact that like you've got the you know money and backing to do two thing so where do you see the the industry going like this I mean this is a very new interesting take on the the thing that the industry I mean in in Canada within the first like weeks of them opening the industry up made millions and millions and millions of dollars so like where do you where do you see the the industry going now that things are becoming more legal and and more products are available and all this kind of stuff well yeah for starters all the products gonna be made by yeast one day there won't be any kind of this production going on anymore very soon people will still want to go cannabis in the future someday but a there's I think that I mean the industry as a whole where do I start so one of the interesting ways to think about the industry is you know looking at the alcohol industry you are the tobacco industry and see how those have gone or are going and see where cannabis like could head eventually and you can draw all these like interesting cultural comparisons between like all these different things that exist I mean as a whole it's like a lot of interesting questions that like you know everyone has to ask for themselves culturally and also black politicians have to figure out like how do they see this unfolding and and how do you see you know legalization existing or continuing just kissed or do you see it going or not and what else you know it's it's I think one of the cooler and more interesting ideas about this stuff is that you know it's this industry that's coming from this very like taboo black market into like this legalized market and if you think about like you know the way these compounds actually work and and how beneficial they are or how not beneficial they are for different you know cases and compare that to like you know alcohol for example then you know you could argue that the the health impact of alcohol is a lot worse than the health impact of like you know cannabis related stuff or those compounds that are there that are interesting well I mean like alcohol kills literally millions of people per year whereas I think cannabis is killed zero yeah I think that that's like and also like the only the only reason that like cannabis was illegal in the first place was racism Oh like like yeah back I mean was it was it Nixon I remember but the whole the whole war on drugs started as a way to basically shut down like government dissent because they knew they had nothing on the protesters so they're like well if we can just make there right so it's been it's been really you've been watching at one of the Netflix the 13th cuz that the documentary where they they really I haven't seen owe us that ones no I haven't seen okay you talked about about this stuff which is secret it's actually super cool but I recommend watching it you're gonna happen but but yeah you're right you're right it's this interesting set of laws I can devote which didn't necessarily have a solid basis of like reasoning why or it's just like general you know fear of stuff that people wanted it to go one way or another right yeah I mean I remember back in it what like while I was in university just having like casual conversations with people who were like really against cannabis like they're just like no it's evil and we shouldn't enema like I wish but at the time I didn't know that the whole reason it was illegal was because of racism so like I I'd had that like a little bit of tidbit to be like so so oh you don't like it why well you know it's illegal yes but why was it illegal like well cuz it's bad for you know cuz of racism so you know that's yeah I mean personally I'm and this is totally just my opinion I think the war on drugs is really [ __ ] stupid like just it's dumb like it's it's it exists basically as a way to funnel people into prison and then use them as slave labor like it's really [ __ ] for and it doesn't hurt anybody like like someone smoking some pot is not gonna hurt anybody like there's definitely a conversation to be had of like it's not the like magical cure-all that people pretend that it is and like it definitely has health effects like it can totally [ __ ] your lungs up and that kind of thing but it's also not the like evil boogeyman that that it's it's often made out to be especially by what's the best way to put this older you know politicians in the 70s or something like that right 70s it's still all right like like earlier yeah like politicians still think like love to demonize it as this awful like horrifying thing when it's like it's just a [ __ ] it's just a plant chill and it's cool I mean the cool thing is like how many people maybe are being convinced now of the opposite and the way that this is all being reconsidered where it's like you know you can actually ask the question like how dangerous is this really and and actually have you know science back up some of these things and that's part of you know the cool cool things that are happens in this industry and and now that is even being like you know the the leading edge of these kinds of thinkers are starting to do stuff like oh we can do like clinical trials with like MDMA or without science and treat PTSD and start to push things in that direction too which is really really cool because you can you know it started to see these new medicines that are being considered which whereas in history they would not have been considered at all because it was in the legal taboo around them and seeing this like yeah nice way of stuff in cannabis and even more like newer waves coming in like other areas too which is which is exciting too yeah and I mean as and I mean on that topic like there's other plant or well organism derivatives because I wouldn't I mean a fungus is not a plant but like you know there's all this fantastic research on how like psychedelics can be you used for like like really serious benefit for people with depression and all this other stuff and obviously like I I always like to you know put the little asterisk on that one where people get a little bit too excited about this and then less that becomes their only thing it's like okay like you you still probably could use some antidepressants but the fungi are good too but or you look at the opioid the opioid crisis has a can either case example where like that's something that was you know pushed legitimately by like industry and then turned out to be like the worst thing ever right like you can put them in prison for us yeah yeah it's really crazy right so it's this funny so it's nice to kind of see these stories come out and be be open and be like popping the stories and people can kind of like a look at those and say like oh yeah we did that wrong very obviously and and now we can think differently about things which is nice also there have been some really interesting research on in areas where they've made cannabis legal like the use of opioids goes down because you know people have other methods of I mean because it's not magic like it doesn't just like make pain go away perfectly like that's it's not how biology works but I mean when it does make it better and more tolerable and so like there isn't necessarily as much of that like need for like narcotics so you know that's that's been really interesting and I'm and I'm excited to see kind of how that continues to develop especially I mean especially in Canada where we were essentially becoming this like really fascinating use case although I do find it also very funny when like so in Quebec for example like they tried to make it illegal to grow the plants yourself like you could only get it from and you know they always make the same stupid justifications like we need to protect the children what if the children get into the plants I'm like well then you're with the fight then you can make first of all what child goes around just like chewing on the plants like if your kid does that you have bigger problems because it like if they're doing that with like a cannabis plant oh they're gonna have real exciting time when they tried that with anything that's outside they're going to die yeah but you know so for people who are not familiar with this the federal government set it so that each individual province could set how many plants you're allowed to grow and Quebec being [ __ ] Quebec decided to be dicks about this and decided to set that your the the number at zero but this was struck down by the Quebec Supreme Court where they're basically attempting to make something illegal which the federal government has explicitly said is legal so because they've tried to be dicks when the law got like undone and it got set to the federal maximum so instead of just like being you know kind of conservative about it'd be like you can have one plant they tried to be dicks and now it's four so like I just I find that deeply entertaining like because I mean the the people who are in and I mean this is getting into all the politics and chick which is not particularly interesting but the people who are in charge in Quebec are you know they're they're very you know that you know they're they've got that like old-school stance of like all drugs are bad and and also they're fairly racist but that's another problem for another day but yeah so that's that's been very interesting and it also it like you know they'll make the excuse of like we're trying to protect the children when in reality it's like no they just want to have a monopoly on the sales it's most of what it is but anyway so that's that's that so let's let's move on from the the kind of like politics and vitriol because as entertaining as I find it it's it's probably not super interesting to listen to it yeah you know different guests different Channel just for that yeah right I could have all sorts of people just to like you know [ __ ] on the government that's it's my favorite thing to do moving on so so actually well speaking of the government are you preparing for the eventual legalization in the US and are there are there other countries that you're also lying because I know there's like in like the Netherlands like there's some amount of it's it's some somewhat legal like so are you looking at other markets outside of Canada or like you know what's you know what's it what's your take on that yeah short answer is yes definitely looking at at its South out of Canada and and that's one of the nice things about the East system is that there are many vacuums so inside of Canada that you can leverage to do this very quickly it really like everyone Dreier like everybody well I guess we'll talk to me we'll get any more into that later and then why is different a bit but are there either wait that does the air side there is many packing facilities that you just like around the world that do this kind of stuff with with yeast and the production so yeah a lot of different uh versus we go a lot of different regulatory considerations for each different country and definitely yeah I don't know what will happen in the u.s. like we'll see how that goes I think I haven't heard too much recently about who's the next one pushing for like cannabis related legalization and stuff but there's been a lot of activity there and of course now I think the majority of states have at least some like you know legal access to cannabis and maybe that's the way that'll go will just be that all the states legalize and then eventually a federal you know government has to make a decision but it's all yeah interesting exciting stuff to see see who will do what and there's even some like finer differences between like whether you're looking at like THC at the product or as like CBD is the product and then whether you're going like hemp or whether you're going like cannabis and then it's also gets a bit funny but yeah a lot of a lot of interesting lot of doors that are that are opening very cool very very cool I mean I personally I look very forward to seeing it it all get legalized in the States just because it's I mean kind of getting back into politics it's like it's just funny watching the like old stupid politicians being like there's Brad whereas like I think it's it's the like a significant majority of Americans are like no this is fine the [ __ ] you talking about like so you know that's that's been very interesting okay so let's get into some of the the more technical aspects of this and you know fingers crossed that as soon as I tap off of Skype that the stream doesn't just [ __ ] the bed but okay let's let's start with the the simplest cuz it was something that you sort of just mentioned um when it comes to actually growing the yeast like what does that look like like so I mean it's it's some flavor of bioreactor I assume but like what what does that look like is it a big steel tank is it you know smaller little reactors like how is it is and like do you is it gonna be grown in like a large batch that you then harvest or is it something that you're kind of constantly pulling off you know small amounts of the yeast and media like howhow are you looking at that like what's the because i mean like you said it like you said that it's not like growing beer so growing beer you do it is as big batches so I guess you're doing kind of constant systems no not necessarily and that that's something I'll defer to like you know we it's it's pasta development it's like a workflow that you try to figure out like what's the best way to make something and and maybe it is by doing a batch maybe it's by doing a continuous like extraction process there are different ways to to go about it and and it's a lot of stuff that you know might become like trade secret stuff will become patentable stuff one day someone get too much into exactly what we're what we're doing but it is fundamentally different than like growing a beer yeast where you're trying to get it to produce like you know ethanol and and you have like these you know maybe somewhat similar kinds of feedstocks that are always being used there so you know I wouldn't say we could I would say like our manufacturing will look a lot more like insulin manufacturing right where it's like a big steel tank very sterile conditions very controlled environments very controlled like media and all this other stuff and and less like a like a beer fermentation and that's like a yeah and the students we really want to go that way but I don't think I don't consult I'm just just really quickly we just had a donation from mon stead he says I couldn't afford 420 like 420 and for four dollars and twenty cents seemed a little bit too low so he donated $42 so thank you very much Mon stead greatly appreciate it so so getting back on do it I'm gonna I'm gonna just I'm gonna see if I can pull up some images of what an insulin bioreactor looks like I am very sorry if this bricks the scream and if it does we're gonna we'll switch back to the Skype view so bear with me if this if there's bricks but assuming that it doesn't then it'll actually let us look at some more images you know not not that also I just noticed that you've got a Spira card thing in background yeah which [ __ ] yeah shout-out to to Elliott Spira and Elliott both - very cool [ __ ] we talked about him on the last stream actually so okay let's let's pull some stuff up so this is the so this is the the paper that you linked to me and it says the complete so the name of the paper for those who want to follow along is called the complete biosynthesis of cannabinoids and their unnatural analogues in East so I mean it's exactly what it sounds like it's using yeast to make cannabinoids and included is a wonderful little biosynthetic pathway and it might I mean it's definitely complicated like it's not a you know one enzyme and then it just happens kind of thing like there's a lot of different enzymes in here I mean you can even see that on the you know some of the unlike one one side there's like one two three four five six one eight like there's like nine different enzymes just to get to like one of the initial feedstocks so like it it definitely has its its quirks but I mean the main thing here is basically it's it you get two two different products so GPP and oay and we'll talk about those second I'm just trying to keep out of the corner mud and see if the stream is lagging and it doesn't seem to be so I think we're I think we're good okay so obviously the route that your company is going down is potentially different than this like we said earlier there's lots of ways to skin a cat so which it's a very weird expression but I think about it but don't don't skin your cats leave them as they're cuter that way but you know so this isn't necessarily the pathway that you're going for but it's one example pathway so to me the things that they really stand out here are first off GP p so GP p is actually something that we've talked about in many streams before because it is sort of it's it's one of like two compounds that basically act as the the feedstock for most are not most but many many different metabolites so I've got a window pulled up over here so this is hopefully not gonna break the streaming empty but so for example I'm just gonna I'm gonna move your your floating head here so GP p is geranyl pyrophosphate basically the way that like yeast and plants and and this sort of thing will go about making compounds is very different than the way like we would do this in like a flask in a chemistry lab right so just just the thing that I've got pulled up here I'm starting with this one initial compound like you can make literally hundreds of different compounds depending on which enzymes act on it so the fact that THC is made from GPP is actually I find fascinating because it like I said it's it's something that is you know extremely ubiquitous in in biology um so in this case it's GPP inouye and so the Oh a is a little bit tonic but I'll live tall olive italic acid [ __ ] biology it's hard to browse thanks but so again this is another really interesting example of there is absolutely no reason that we would ever do this this way at a flask but like in a biological system it makes a lot of sense so you can see that it's this really weird long poly key tide this being that the ketone unit polyketide that gets cyclized into the the aromatic group so in this case you've got one long weird compound that ends up with you know aromatic on one end and a dangly hydrophobic bit on the other end and then when you combine these two so like once you've got GPP inouye like a suit is just off the top of your head do you know if away is present in yeast normally or is that something you've got to add so Oh way is not present in this normally yeah definitely at that that's that's the first first recombinant step I guess okay so that makes sense because I know GBP definitely is so okay cool so you'd have to so I guess that the orange is probably stuff that is already in the yeast whereas blue is stuff you have to add and you can see that it all starts from acetyl co a like it's it and or like hexanoic acid these are both like fairly basic simple things we actually looked at hexanol in stream very recently I think was the last week week before so you know all but just to be able to get to this end product because you need this thing you've got to make this whole pathway work which I mean that's a lot of enzymes potentially so I mean I'd like you'd like we said like obviously you can't comment on the exact way that you're going about it but like already just just to get the process going this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 enzymes just to get this first feedstock here like that's a lot of engineering just to get to this point so it's I I'm I just want to convey like how potentially difficult the thing that you guys are doing is like there's a lot of work that's got to go into making these things work and function and just just to make the end product and so I mean it seems like a fairly simple step once you get to this point like you've got your GPP you've got your Oh a and it just looks like it's too in like two enzymes basically just to get to either THC or CBD and this is this is also kind of cool like you can start with these same two feedstocks and just changing one gene dictates what your end product is which so I think that kind of leads into or harkens back to something that you mentioned earlier where you know changing one or two genes lets you tweak the the end product and so you can get these two very different very valuable products using only a small amount of modification like once you've got the like initial stuff set up which I find that very cool and I mean by the by the looks of this this is these are both the THC or CBD a and you can see that it I'm gonna make this little bigger so this is obvious you can see that there's a little T here this is not an enzyme this is just Heat okay good old-fashioned heat so yeah there's just just kind of interesting into it which to me I find this interesting because that's the exact same thing that happens in the plant like when you like it's if somebody is like smoking the plant for example that's where that heat is coming from so it's like the the it becomes the active form when you heat it not necessarily in advance so I just find that interesting so I guess actually that's I mean that that raises an interesting point are you gonna have is one step in your process like say you decide to make your product into a pill or you get is is you gonna have to like roast it at some point like is like to do that that conversion like is there gonna be a like a cooking step and like do you do you expect that to mess with your yield a little bit like cuz I mean as soon as you're heating something like you're definitely gonna destroy it a little bit so like is that something that you're you're already kind of trying to account for yeah it's part of the process overall I'd say and something that also needs to be looked at yeah you're gonna have to deal with that one way or another okay no I think there's something else that we've got going on that's like mainly gonna like you know kind of find an interesting way to cut around that but I won't get into that but basically yeah I mean when people make like cannabis oils for example like you you're extracting from the cannabis plant and then you're ending up with like you know a THC a in this like oil or whatever and then you you have to heat that to to get it to be like decarboxylated and then you actually have the active ingredient in the oil because normally you normally use smoked cannabis right that's where I get me carboxylated but like I'm making an edible like it gets decarboxylated I mean a lot of people will do it before they even start the cooking process but a lot of the time it just happens in the cooking process so it's like at some point you got to put that that energy in there to like knock the blonde off yeah yeah I guess so and there's a lot of actually interesting things beyond that when it comes to like using just see th CA and CB da in their original forms as like more like therapeutic products but you know usually when people talk about these compounds are talking about THC and CBD as being the ones that are the active you know things that that people really want to use that will have like kind of an impact right but you might even go to find more things beyond that so actually speaking of this light so and I mean of course you're you're free not to answer if this is but is there a like because I mean THC and CBD are they like really famous cannabinoids but is there another cannabinoid that you find particularly interesting like something that you're thinking of maybe pursuing one day or has interesting properties like are there any that stand out is basically what I'm asking let me think there there are many best and it would actually maybe I'll think for a second and then come up with something that ferno's maybe more specific but let's see I mean one of the if gonna look at something interesting that's what we're talking about is like a recent publication with a compound called THC they gave it a name which is a bit silly but THC P I guess which most everybody things cuz you never know what's gonna come up yeah hopefully you'll get this paper which is which is talks about this compound just a slightly different variation on th see that that apparently had some kind of like higher affinity for like the receptors which doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna be like better or worse than then THC originally was its but it was like kind of a funny headline to see that come out and then like be like oh that might be like an interesting thing and and then but in reality if you know you're gonna file chemistry you'll be like oh cool that's nice to see that they've proven that and like cell lines and stuff maybe you got on transit to humans then it could be an interesting target but do we actually need a stronger form of THC like maybe not really okay with the regular form of THC that's right that's really interesting kinda like they're like it's it does the same thing it's just stronger like yeah and actually if you want to get into like the history of this whole like industry and it's the the perspective of like you know compounds that are stronger or weaker or whatever it's all said this is you is this found in the plant like as far as this synthetic as this found in the plant so you could I think this is one that the recent so we've seen minor camino it discoveries so like you could breed the I mean this would be a shitload of work but like in theory you could you could breed plants for this cuz I know that like the actual biochemistry of the plant itself like you kid there's a there is a hard threshold of like how much THC you can actually get in the plant before it just dots so like I think it's about 24 or 25 percent it just it plant gets real sad at that point like it does it doesn't like it yeah so I guess that that that raises a really interesting possibility of if you could breed this stuff and select for this rather than the traditional THC you could get more potency in the same amount of like gram for gram worth of stuff and and kind of surpass that strength threshold which sounds kind of [ __ ] like 25 percent cannabis is already very strong thank you you'd have to be like have a heroic tolerance to be able to even like deal with that casually without it just knocking you on your ass for a week but you know hyperbole obviously but like it's that's a really acting concept as as people like especially now that it's legal and people are able to study this more that it'll open up these like new discoveries of like hey you know maybe we've been selecting for this the wrong cannabinoid all these years maybe there's you know maybe there's something better so that's that's really interesting and I think it's yeah I mean it's like one difference of bond-like it's a trans instead of a syst bond or something like that's that's yeah wild you could get into actually I had two things to say on that one is that it's it's a fun thought experiment think about like why why wasn't this compound not already selected for in the book history historical of like you know use of cannabis like people say like oh yeah you know kind of busy be so much weaker like years ago and then people selected for it now you have like these high THC strains or whatever but why why wasn't why it was THC P not the high you know high THC strain or whatever and I guess I'd ties back to like you know some fun name is a evolutionary geneticist watching and who can dig into this and sugar and seven or something like that but I guess like Brussels sprouts like how Brussels sprouts used to suck and then people kind of went back through all the old heirloom varieties and found ones that were not gross and so like those became suddenly this is why like there's been this weird Renaissance and Brussels sprouts so I almost wonder if that would happen with this compound like if people start going back through the old like weaker strains finding one that's much higher THC P content and then just like using that as a new breed stock like that could be fascinating maybe but this is a this is my other point there's a there's a big big asterisk there which is which is that you don't you don't want to mess with this system almost in that and that in that in that way and if you look at the history of of the endocannabinoid system I guess and you can you can google around like all the the drugs that came up for the system and basically long story short there was a compound that people try to develop which is for when you've lost them for obesity and it did hit like the same receptors that THC hits and hit them pretty hard and it's kind of like optimized for that almost like it's one ease designer you know when when you look at the the structural biology of it and you designs things right and what ended up happening is that that drug got to mark it and then got recalled and eventually cut out I think altogether just cuz it was one of the big side effects was like really hard depression suicidal thoughts okay so you can look at the story it's the park is called Ramona bunt and think it was Sanofi that that was the one working on it and I don't get into the too much of the complications of how big firmer works but basically yeah you don't you know they want to have this compound exist and and have it you know be the main driver this industry because you might start to see those kinds of things and that also gets into the argument of like you know the term like synthetic cannabinoids which are like you know chemically synthesized compounds that are hitting the same receptors but they're not TV and also you need enough coming from plants and just these new compounds and that's where like yeah you have these stories of like I think it was the bath salts stuff that was a huge controversial in these new black market drugs that are coming out and causing all these problems so I mean THC is good because of the history of it like there's literally thousands of years of safety data in the sense that like people have been using it for thousands and thousands of years whereas all this new stuff you don't have that like historical precedent so yeah maybe THC P is way stronger but like like you say it could have horrifying side effects that maybe that's not what you want necessarily so that's that's really a thing that but I mean you could say yeah but I I look forward to those clinical trials like yes like but this is also the most fascinating so interesting things about this the endocannabinoid system thing right it's like this this system of receptors that you know does it seems like it has its hand in a lot of different things related to like human development related to like psychosis and all this other stuff obviously but there's there's it's still people are still trying to piece together these different receptors and how they all work together and whatever else it's not like a super simple system and for example like CBD people like CBD doesn't hit these two yeah you're looking at I guess looking at the live stream but I know this is like a few seconds behind so I'm like I don't know where we're at now see you on CB t receptors if you look at those receptors in like what hits them that's not like it's not like if you hit the cb1 and cb2 receptors harder you're gonna get more or higher or whatever you might just have like you know worse things happen is sometimes it breaks yeah yeah and then that then you had like these yeah stories that people using cannabis for things and so it's like this weird all those like weird backwards stuff happening with this this plant and what people are using it for and how that might one day become like mapped out from like a receptor standpoint but for now you know it's still a lot of science that's being done a lot of figuring out like how each compound works with which parts of the you know I like the biology and humans that it's hitting and it's one of the big challenges and I think if it was a simpler system than like you might not even have a as much attention towards this this stuff but because it would be solved to kind of cook the meeting but anyways right I mean it's fascinating I yeah and I mean this is this also like that that really does touch on the like I mean so I took a like a pharmacology like pharmacokinetics course at one point also just we've had a couple of donations that are like 4/20 themed so we just somebody donated four hundred and twenty rubles that was so thank you but you know so it and it was it was really interesting that like you know there's a few main like targets for for drugs generally but it's these tiny little changes can be like the difference between something working really really well and also having a horrible side effects and especially like when you get into the like generic versus like the original thing like sometimes they'll just like stick a functional group on a on a compound and technically it is equivalent and so you know they can there's basically like these these weird examples where if you stick specific functional groups on things like you can just barely shift it enough that it's not patent-protected anymore and you know because it's so similar you have their amount of clinical trial that you need to get it approved is way lower but because you've added this functional group there is the chance that like it might have been really important and then like it can have wildly different effects and so like that can be really really tricky and that's why some people will have [Music] like you know really unpleasant side effects when they switch from like the the name brand to a generic so that's really interesting I'm sorry that we just had a question it says all trips down is this more cool than economical so what do you think is this is this more cool than economical I don't I don't think so I think it's I think it's well you know I mean it's not really cool any cool pretty cool but I also think like it's very economic like my drawings also very very cool like Hank of THC and like swimming around in it sounds entertaining but like also it sounds very valuable yeah I mean I mean very quickly it starts to get a yeah sometimes my depends on my my days like sometimes it feels more cool but but it is still very very cool we got her yeah like I mean the number of days that I've been working on the spider silk thing and I just want to like light everything on fire just you know switch to gardening well I think it's a thing it happens but no okay cool so I mean that's no sort of what I expected like no but one thing just to quickly come back I'll correct you on this that the generic generic versions of a pharmaceutical product are supposed to be identical like factually identical I think what you're talking about is something called biosimilars where it is like a slightly different modification and gets around these like patents and then you end up with like maybe different different effects and but I don't want people to start buying brand-name drugs and that's really changing the economy but that direction is not like a good thing necessarily for like the the main compound isn't necessarily the difference like some sometimes in a generic like the the main compound is the same but they might have added a different like filler or something that [ __ ] with the exact behavior of the hill in the person not that not but I mean that's not to say that a generic is worse than a brand name I mean it is I mean I'm like I'm on a generic and it works just fine but there definitely have been cases of just I mean it's it's biology as soon as you [ __ ] with one thing like somebody's system is gonna respond to it differently so yeah and I guess there's a there's another interesting area of like experimentation that's just around like hey like can we take like yeah again I used to keep these apples DTC is available in like as a pill you can get like THC pills under prescription and so it's a product that exists it's usually used for helping people with appetite and symptom management when they're going through chemotherapy you can also get something that's called Sativex which is a product from a company called GW Pharmaceuticals and that's like a it's actually a cannabis extract that's I think CBD and THC together also available under prescription for the similar kinds of situations and then just recently there's a newer one that came out which is actually a liquid form of of THC essentially which is just like I guess it again it'll get absorbed differently it'll it'll maybe react a bit differently but it's you know all variations on the same same sort of thing and maybe in the end this is better for consumers because you just have like all these nice options that you can choose from and if you if you can't swallow pills and great and take a liquid option right and also I mean either with like speaking of THC specifically like I know lots of people who are totally fine to smoke it but as soon as you put it into an edible they're like nope I'm I'm done like they'll they'll have like you know heart palpitations or whatever whatever the case may be like wildly different effects even though it's exactly the same compound like that that delivery mechanism really can radically change just the way your system responds to things and I find that fascinating I mean it's it's totally not necessarily fun to experience it firsthand but but from like a detached scientist perspective like no this is fascinating apparently if you deliver through one organ it goes this and you know that kind of thing so like that's a find that fascinating totally yeah and this I mean the crazy thing about the cannabis industry specifically when you think about that stuff is that you have so much experimentation already happening when it comes to like you know the different edibles different oils different ways people are dosing themselves at the stuff like both illegally and and legally I guess and that's that's what I mean where things start to yeah it's a little bit backwards where you have a lot of first-hand experience that's coming back and being put into like the pharmaceutical industry maybe and then people developing products like has a reaction almost but yeah I mean like especially because it was illegal first like yeah and and that whole the whole culture of it developed whilst it was illegal and now they're trying to like you know back propagate that essentially like I mean I remember when like concentrates were first becoming a thing and I mean cuz like hashish has been around forever but like the the like the butane extractions and now the the co2 extractions and all this kind of stuff like we have lots of data on what happens when you interact with the plant but we don't have a whole lot of data what of what happens when you're like literally just taking in the pure thing so you know that's that's been very interesting that now there I mean know that it's legal they can actually study this [ __ ] properly which really is what they've needed to do the whole time and like I still think it was done that was illegal the first place but like it's I I hope that now especially now that they're looking at other things like MDMA ketamine all those kinds of things and looking at them for pharmaceutical or like from a pharmaceutical standpoint like I think it's I think people are kind of learning their lesson from cannabis and that like you really do need to like get as much studies done as you can but because I mean inevitably it's gonna be applied to millions and millions and millions of people so you know getting getting as much of that info in advance before you have to find [ __ ] out the hard way is definitely definitely valuable so I think that's yeah yeah so like everybody's learning a bit from how this is uh this whole industry is developing and you know what and this is like why legalization is also such a complicated thing we're like yeah sure it's a you know statistically or whatever else economically you can think of all different reasons but also like you know the hope and dream was that you legalize cannabis nobody gets hurt right but then in reality maybe some people do get hurt and then you have to you know deal with that I guess and I don't know I'm not an epidemiologist or like a policy analyst or whatever else so I kind of can talk about these things and not feel like I'm trimmers are supposed to do anybody I guess yeah and I mean that's the rest the responsible thing like I mean there's there's nothing worse than somebody pretending they're an expert and then being wrong yeah or like I mean there's actually funny if you everything so it's it's all it's all super cool it's all really interesting biochemistry if you want to like you know think another funny thing about you know cannabis legalization stuff I think one of the points that I remember being a the age at which you're allowed to start buying cannabis in Canada was one of the ones that maybe was the gay bigger conflicting point when people had more flexibility on how they wanted to do that and that was like very much a on one hand I think the science was saying like not until you're 25 or like there's like a task force out coming together with within Canada it kind of said like yeah we should set the age here but then the federal government decided that actually should be kind of either 18 or 19 and then of course Quebec I think is 18 and then other provinces are 19 it depends on how they how they match it I mean Quebec is trying to push into the 19 actually I think they wanted to put out like 21 like they really wanted to push it back yeah and actually legitimately that could be the right thing to do of course and that's that's why I like the task force recommended to 25 or whatever something higher and then but I think that might have been I think one of the main arguments against that was that actually you know a lot of the use cases of illegal cannabis end up being that age smaller age range anyway you kind of want to be able to address that with like the legal market and then it becomes an economic decision rather than like a health care one but and also like if you try and restrict it to 25 then you end up with the exact same problems that you have with alcohol or cigarettes or any of the other things it's like yes technically it's illegal but if it's available people are still gonna get it regardless and like I mean it was and that's the thing it was illegal for a very long time and it's not like people in who are like 15 or 16 have any real trouble getting it like it's a thing so you know that's I suspect that they probably took that into account as well like it's like from a science standpoint like yes you should avoid it until at least 25 so because then it can sit as you know interactions brain development and all this other stuff but then from like an economic standpoint and also just a legal standpoint and a like functional standpoint like how do you actually keep it out of people's hands and like because if you make it illegal and people are just gonna get it anyway like now you're just running right like headfirst right back into the same problems you had when it was legal where now you're gonna criminalize people for having it when you know like it's a kind of a personal responsibility thing and also like they're gonna do it anyway so like I think it's one of those like yes you can put out the recommendations of like but you really shouldn't but people are going to anyway like it's yeah yep so it's super interesting super complicated but a part of what it boils down to and this is I mean it's a nice thing to say cuz we have like a big audience here I guess I can say like hey you know when it comes to using this kind of stuff or anything in general in life just like try to be healthy you know you know like you've got you'd be probably everybody has friends or heard of different kinds of people and how they use even like the more psychedelic drugs and you can hear people using those things like really responsibly and having like you know experiences that make sense but of course if you don't do that responsibility responsibly then you're gonna have problems or they're obvious like you know situations that you really want to stay away from like you know you could you could easily argue that you know maybe actually I don't think stupidly like I would say actually a good thing the point that I can point to is like difference between like the culture around maybe alcohol and in different countries yeah where in the u.s. it's a lot higher drinking age in Canada it's a bit lower and in Europe it's even lower and then you have to think about you know which nation that has the most sensible policy and it might be more of a cultural thing where like the people in you know grow up with the right kinds of education and the right kinds of like understanding culturally of how to use alcohol safely or or how to enjoy it I rather than like abused it obviously and the same thing to some extent applies to the the Canada some use a whole and I think that was one of the you know dreading dreaded things about people you know legalization happening is like how many people are going to end up abusing this reason it's the wrong way and having a really bad you know effect and then and then they have to repeal everything which is you're fortunate things happen like that all sorts of problems also sorry not not to cut you off we just had a really big donation so I just need to say a huge thank you to Jack for you we've we've actually just hit our fundraising goal so that's super cool so on the on the next stream we'll be starting the next one thank you so much greatly appreciated I'm glad you enjoy the channel okay so it's back to the back to the discussion at hand sorry I was really exciting I've been so I don't I don't know if you I mean you can see it in the thing the donation goals are I've finally decided that I need a new editing computer because I've been using the same laptop for like five years and it makes very angry noises when I'm editing it doesn't like it so I'm building myself a like a proper tower so just I'm like doing I'm just doing the fundraising like piecemeal cuz you know I want to get good components and I want to make sure that I don't have to do this again for hopefully five or six years yeah you know doing that is greatly appreciated all the people who've been donating by the way super awesome so yeah very very cool so I'm just I'm gonna have just a quick peek into the end of the comments cuz I mean I think we've we'd actually gone through my whole list of stuff that I liked you know we've pre-prepared I don't I don't actually yeah I think we I think we've basically covered all that so I'm gonna just go through the comments and see if there have been any interesting and and also guys if you if you have comments or questions that you want to ask Kevin now is the time so yeah this so let's let's see what we go [Music] this is as soon as you do that like the like comments flood in faster so like as I'm trying to like read one it just the thing keeps moving on its own and [Music] [Music] I mean it's been a lot of like bickering I'm not actually seeing any any good questions yet hey come on like you know now is your opportunity opportunity of a lifetime asked asked the the magical east man some questions I you know I the thing is I saw some some earlier so I'm kind of like scroll up to it to see if I can find them I mean there's there's definitely been some some questions about like you know could other drugs be made this way and I mean the answer is is sort of a resounding yes but it also depends like you can't make LSD just because that's a weird like weird chemistry it just doesn't work but you can make psilocybin and there's been some very interesting papers we were talking about this a little bit before we got the the stream started where there you could totally make psilocybin with yeast you can you can take the genes out of the fungus and express them in yeast and works just fine but you know then it gets into the difficulty of the engineering process and a lot of that stuff oh actually there was one thing it was so you know you're you're selling or you're looking to sell the derivative products so the actual like oil itself but have you considered just sourdough well because I mean then the yeast is dead like you're no one's gonna be you know stealing your intellectual property if you're selling it it's like toast but but is that something that you've considered like or is it I think there's I think there's a some some of the articles that we get featured and had like a picture of bread and then has a quiche or the marijuana leaves on there something like that until I kind of it's just as like a header for like a article or something anyways yeah thought about this I think you don't end up with enough yeast in your dough or in your bread in the end that it actually be interesting in any in any way that's sorry what about like Marmite I mean barbecue grubs but it would do the J like it's not to say that like you know we'd concentrate is any better like yeah I mean if that's something you're looking at like rather than going through that like whole much more difficult process of like purifying the compound like would it be potentially easier to just like make some weird THC Vegemite technically yeah it might be easier to produce a yeast that way but I think you know coming back to like the different processes to use things I don't think you might get enough actually do you think for a second anyway the triceps we thought about this a bit and and but I think it starts to not work actually it starts to break down when it comes to like maybe which yeast is actually used for these different things and like you know do we actually want to try and you know will that Marmite that we might make with our yeast still tastes as good as the Marmite that because I mean because you play so much with the metabolism of the East and the types of yeast that you're using then you might actually end up in this spot where like it really doesn't make any sense to try and do that and and it might be even like fundamentally impossible to like have the metabolisms work you know in such a way that you do end up with both scenario as possible actually and and this is why also like you can't just throw this into like a beer fermenter and get the same amount of product out you but you need some maybe some fire control or different kind of conditions that are gonna really turn up those yields okay so here's an interesting question I've been seeing some questions on like a like a biosecurity standpoint like are you worried about the yeast ever getting out like how are you gonna be controlling to make sure that like nobody accidentally because like if somebody else got a sample of your yeast like they could totally make some but like do you have I mean obviously you're not gonna have to comment on like the specific what are the security features of your warehouse and yes yeah is this something I mean I assume this is something that you you take fairly seriously and this is something that is is on your mind so it is it is something that is on our minds definitely thought about before you know if it were to get out then I think there's it's just get more technically difficult to grow this kind of yeast and that's where I would be like less worried if somebody on the street like happen to get it you there's different this room I could argue different reasons like why it's like make sense or not in the end we're just very careful with how we handle westerns at least and I'm just not gonna let it happen okay but I mean that's that we're only one of a bunch of companies working on this stuff so maybe eventually there will be somebody who does who does get the Jews released and I think I think that's it's a common question in like biosecurity in general is like how does this work and what happens here or there and and maybe hmm I mean have you heard of the the case of the the phage theft but I think we might have talked about this at some point in you know months ago but so there's this with and obviously this is not a one-to-one comparison with yeast because they don't they're not a virus they don't just get on everything but there's this really famous example of there was a lab that was working on a phage that killed a particular type of bacteria and another lab wanted it and you know had sent them an email be like hey would you set share and they're like no so they sent them a physical letter like I'd like an actual like written like please can we have a sample of your phage and so because it was a written letter they had to respond with a written lit written letter so somebody from the lab that had the phage wrote them a letter and was like no sorry we can't give you a phage and then the the lab that wanted it took the letter like sterile e blended it and just plated it and got the phage because there was a little bit like just from the being in the lab like it was just all neatly present and they managed to isolate it off of the piece of paper so like it's a file right like is so is that something that you might be concerned about like are like that may be someone in your production plant might get some on them and like you know so it was like hey man I'll pay you 10 bucks if I could swab your face or whatever like is because I mean that that seems like it could be terrifying from from like a security point of view so yes I guess you but but then again it's also with the yeast so let's someone's like sticking their hand in the VAT like this isn't really like a problem and you wouldn't do that anyway because it's got to be super sterile and all this kind of stuff so yeah yeah basically yes yeah you know it's not it's not so easy to just like get it and then grow it and then you're off to the races you know there's if you are really really smart biotechnologists that maybe you could try and like do something bad but I think we we just it's just part of being a company and having really good security protocols for handling all this stuff and getting gun situations and through it properly so it's not like something we haven't thought of or something that we're like you know particularly susceptible to and yeah you can almost you can also imagine it sort of like the same case where like like Humira or whatever is like this 11 billion dollar revenue drug or something like that imagine if somebody stole the strain that produces Humira and tried to produce that you know on their own probably the company that makes you mad will find out and then also sue the [ __ ] and then you get into trouble yeah but also you might you might have just have like a much does not grow the way that it grows the when we wrote it and then then you end up it's like just it doesn't snot feasible to actually like get a strain that way I mean and I guess like they'd have to be intimately familiar with your process because I assume it's on some weird selection agent with weird media and all this kinda [ __ ] so like unless it was like an ex-employee who like stole a sample and do the recipe and like we're getting into like Willy Wonka territory it's like I will pay you $10,000 for a never-ending Gobstopper kind of thing like yeah the park is like that isn't it yeah right exactly yeah well we all know what happened to the guy in dress the park right yeah I mean the thing is might have not actually seen Jurassic Park so oh really uh which I feel very stupid because like I'm I for all the [ __ ] that I do I really should but I I think it was one of those like it was the best way to put this I have a very low suspension of disbelief threshold and that one does in like it's like the concept doesn't work so like I it's it's hard for me to enjoy it because I'm like that's not that's not that's not how that works that's not how a anything works also like the like then there's the and this this has nothing to do with anything but like the the dinosaurs do not look like that like all of the which admittedly was an older it like especially the original one was an older movie so like some of the newer research where like most dinosaurs had feathers like hadn't been found yet but I just I wish they'd had a big feathery t-rex that would have been so much more fun like so yeah that's that's the thing but I know I'm gonna take a lot of [ __ ] for not saying Jurassic Park so now I'm gonna have to go from now I'm gonna have to go watch it but yeah anyway okay so let's let's see what other what other questions we've got I saw it because I saw a couple interesting ones goodbye I mean there's so there was also a couple of questions from the like offhand and you can't make LSD thing and the reason is that it like LSD is not a biological part like the the precursor is so either like the ergot derivatives or LSA or all these other things like those things can be made bio synthetically they are made by lots of different organisms it's it's that last step where you like take the precursor and actually like chemically transform it into LSD that you can't do by I mean as far as I know I could be wrong maybe somebody's made some weird freaky enzyme thing that does it but like as far as I know there's no enzyme that does that that last switcheroo so you make the precursors be like I mean you could totally make a yeast that makes her got her got amine or LSA it's just the the that is that last step that you just can't do [Music] [Music] oh so so what a question why yeast over algae because algae is also something that's that's typically thought of as you know being grown is the in these huge facts so is there any particular reason why you would go for for yeast over algae like what are their like are there any specifics uh yeah I mean we talked about a bit about earlier but it's kind of depends very much on like process metrics and also like the science going into like how you actually can engineer that organism so for example like the yeast metabolism is fundamentally different from like a holiday metabolism and you could argue that the yeast metabolism is more suited to producing these particular compounds because it has look you know that active you know this was precursors that are need to go into this pathway for example I assume you could get an algae to do this stuff which again there's differences in how you how a yeast will react with like you know being recombinant and having DNA in it versus how in algae would and that's where like this is pretty reliable the so after you've engineered the algae let's say then you can think about how you're gonna grow that and how you're gonna separate out your end product and you know if you think about algae you're more likely thinking about like white and co2 getting into to make it grow faster or better or whatever and that's where like you start to hit some hard like physical limitations you can't get more more light into an algae tank like you can't add more sugar and add more water and that's like even really fast and get it to high density cultures that are really efficient but the algae situation can be more complicated and then you could get it argument like oh but you can grow algae off of sugar too and then right I'll leave it at that like yeah it's processed yeah it is the process in the end and you know yeast is a pretty familiar process and very efficient process and a very vigorous process and then algae you may be like West less so okay I mean I and that makes sense also from from what I know like just the actual engineering of algae is more difficult like it's there I mean they're just kind of they're picky organisms and there just hasn't been like yeast has been extremely well studied because it's used for pharmaceuticals and all this other stuff like there's literally textbooks on all these different kinds of yeast strains on how to and how to engineer them and how to work with them and how to grow them whereas algae like we're good at growing it but actually like messing with its genetics is hard and just things don't don't necessarily cooperate so oh so have you looked at all at terpenes because you you know you've got the the THC have you have you thought about growing the you know the the flavor to go with it or is or are you more focused on the actual like pharmaceutically active compounds definitely more on the the active compounds there although some of the terpenes are starting to let me show some promise of in terms of being actual pharmaceuticals - okay but it that also like those are different pathways that are going to be different you know it could be made more easily by chemistry or extracted from another natural source and then it becomes there's already a process that exists for some of these ones as well like I think women even is it maybe is one of these ones that like limiting this kind of becomes by its industrial chemical it's also forget it yeah yeah we have lemons there's yeah so you know you don't need a yeast that can produce eliminating maybe where you could argue that and work at the economic I have that does that actually okay I got the only reason I haven't tried it is because there's no I think it uses uracil dropout media as the selection or like dropout media with with Europe no yeah it's you're still drop of media so it's it's missing uracil and I just don't have that like I don't I don't have drop up media so it's the only reason I've tried it because like oh my oh my yeast engineering tends to be using gee for Nate just because it's easy and g418 is cheap and drop OBD is expensive and annoying although actually so I bought some tryptophan dropout media I didn't even I didn't even want it I wanted the I came as a I got it as a kit from Carolina they sell the their bio builder kits one of them is a keratin yeast kit and I just wanted it I thought the kit came with this is actually really frustrating that so the kit was supposed to come with pre-engineered keratin producing yeast and that was the only thing of the kid I wanted they don't sell it separately you have to buy it as the kit so i bought the kit and the one thing that was missing that they forgot to pack was the pre-engineered yeast I was so annoyed but it came with a bottle of tryptophan dropout media so I'm like alright well now if I've got anything so I found a plasmid that that's Curie recombinants and the keratin plasmid that I currently have has loxp sites next to every single gene so if I take my pre-engineered yeast that I've already managed to make and I'm you know throw in the the creep plasmid which is on tryptophan selection I can now use that media to make like an integrated version of the thing and then I should actually get like really weird like color differences because depending on which one of the genes is running and in what quantity like you'll get different colors like if the if the keratin synthase stops working but the lycopene synthase is still working you get a red colony whereas if you've got both they look orange whereas if you know you get really low lycopene and really high kara didn't looks yellow so it's all this kind of stuff so that was just something that happened recently but like all so it's it's a very interesting thing of like you know when you've got all in like when you're trying to make a product that requires more than one enzyme like it's very interesting to see the dynamics between them so like especially with something like THC where you've got anywhere from four to eight to ten enzymes that you all need running at the same time like your your yield can vary wildly just in in small changes in the expression and like tweaking the individual enzyme so I think that's what the fascinating if you want to violations an interesting one I think that's another one of these a proof of concept kind of pathways that people like to play with because it makes a purple color and if you if you mess it up and it makes black instead then you play with the enzymes a bit yeah cool and so I'm not really gonna get into like talking about the specifics of Endre enzyme engineering but I suspect that you have had to do a little bit of that like the natural enzymes maybe aren't as active necessarily especially in yeast right like they're the plant enzymes for a lot of them so I assume you've had to do some work and I mean you don't need to go into the specifics but like what what does that process been like like how how do you go about that like what how do you decide like this is the enzyme that we're gonna mess with like you know do you is it done rationally or is it done randomly like do you just kind of like start messing with aminos and seeing like which ones like which end up with an enzyme that works better or is it something that like you find in research and you just try and replicate that so it's it's more like the I guess rational and and irrational approaches on I'm doing is I'm engineering stuff I would say like you know we have done is build like a really efficient way of going about doing that and that we're pretty pretty happy with I would say like our like our genome engineering or and the hydrating platform is really nice the and that's like that's what I get that's all I could save we're good but yeah I mean that's the that's the it's it's an interesting topic to kind of get into like different techniques events and some engineering that you can look at and and how I think if there's any good publications on this clear pathway in general or if anybody's really dug deep into that but anyways yeah getting a bit more technical there but yeah enzyme engineering is fun we do it do it pretty well okay yeah so and and I mean you can you can not answer if this is you know something that you shouldn't talk about but do you spend more or equal time messing with the enzymes in the pathway or have you also started looking at messing with the metabolism of the yeast generally and I this is definitely something we've touched on a little bit but like is like like is it a lot like do you really have to go in and seriously tweak the metabolism or do you more focus on just trying to make the enzymes themselves in in the pathway you care about better it's it's a bit of both and and a lot of like maybe crossover between the different teams that are working on this stuff I suppose yeah what should I say about this so actually I mean that do you have different teams in your company that like focus on the different aspects so like you know one group or some okay so you've got like a metabolism engineering group an enzyme engineering group that kind of thing and then presumably like process engineers and that sort of thing yeah yeah total okay cool how many people do you yeah how many people do you have working at your your company now like because I mean I know when it started there was like three or four you but like it's it's grown quite a bit yeah we were at about over 20 people leading into the month of March and then business is where I stood shut down and stuff and then we've made some like changes to our team since then I guess but that's uh yeah okay so but about about 30 people yeah actually that that brings up an interesting question how has the the the ye old plague affected your ability to do the thing like is it as it like interfere do the research has it interfered with production like how are you how are you handling that because this is I mean your your business is very different than like your average retail business but like it's got to have been affected so like how how has that been handled it's uh it's been okay actually I would say like so so I just thinking about something else for a second we it's been hard because like we're yeah we're kind of a smaller company that's funded from like investors and stuff like that and so a lot of like the support and a lot of like the the way the government was like funding things like you know sporting stuff wouldn't leave applied to us right away in the end you know we we we deal with money in the bank to kind of like lead through the stuff and still make some like really interesting achievements over the course of the past past few months but so I would say you know some hard stuff to deal with being a CEO at this time is like a pretty challenging kind of stressful thing anyway anyone yeah anyone be anyone beating companies through this this period is like under a lot of pressure but but as a whole I would say like we've handled things like reasonably well and and we're doing okay okay fair so actually I think this this actually leads into another interesting question you know let's let's fast forward a few years let's say you're already at at the point of scale and production and you know you've got a product on the market how differently would your company hold up in the case of you know a plague event or serious [ __ ] happening compared to like a more traditional farm like would you have an easier or more difficult time easier okay I would say I mean if you depending on them yeah hypothetical plague in the future like what the next one yeah how's it gonna transfer but I guess you if you think about like you know managing a production plant that does like he's manufacturing versus having to like you know trim cannabis flowers like there's there's interactions at that like you know you don't never have to touch the east if you're ever if you're doing this kind of manufacturing ever when it comes to doing doing this at large scales and so in that sense yeah any also doing you know need to as many staff to kind of run it like a big facility like that compared to you know the number of staff that need to like watch over the plants and make sure that they're all growing the right height and everything like that right so they I can think of all these different reasons why it might make more sense to in the future how's it become more automated right like I mean if you're if you're just processing yeast it's just liquid handling basically like yeah and so that's like right right I mean it's you're handling liquids and goo whereas if it's a if it's a traditional farm like someone has to harvest all the plants someone has to trim all the plants someone has to package all the plants and so it's also more hands-on especially in a the age of hey maybe you don't want to be touching things so you know maybe like at the end of your process it can be mostly automated and you just get like a 55-gallon drum worth of concentrate at the end versus when it's plants you still might get a 55-gallon drum and concentrate but there's a lot more people involved potentially right so that about sum that up yeah basically okay I mean one day we'll have robots that will farm all of our plants too and they maybe it doesn't matter anymore although yeah but farming robots are hard firming a robot very difficult and they're it's very expensive and I mean when you compare the the difficulty of a liquid handling robot on an industrial scale versus you know some robot that has to want like understand and interpret the shape of the plant as its trimming it and harvesting it and working that you know getting it's it's you know hokey bets up and up in the plants space like that is a much more difficult engineering challenge and and like even just computer science chomps like how do you teach a plant what a plant teach a [ __ ] teacher a robot what a plant is supposed to look like and all this kind of stuff and then you know properly interpret all the signals so that it handles it properly and have you know whatever grabby arm thing that you know it's it's a it's a more difficult challenge and it's more expensive and it's probably more parts whereas with your stuff because it's all just liquids like it's just you know turning valves and [ __ ] on and off they tank us up yeah yeah drains fast right like drain every drain into the ground we're being you to go right you know have that tank get hot that that tank is cold you know you know spin that one's a centrifuge that one's solvent you know whatever the case may be yeah that's very interesting so it's theoretically more robust so I think that's also an interesting prospect for both I mean other pharmaceuticals but also just whatever other end products and and cannabinoids and other things they end up making like it adds a layer of robustness in this in the face of the world shutting down which yeah and this is this is the heavy hitters of this in bio hype circle are all in favor of this kind of thing right we're like going good yeah grow yeast in space and then you can do it that way too right and then you have to that's just anything you want uses very true right plants do you look forward to one day sending some stuff up to the space station see if you can t need like a little like petite like you know you know they like the rackmount units they've got on the ISS you know it's like and this is our stove or oh yeah yeah you know do you imagine just having like an itty-bitty one and just like astronauts vaping in space like maybe nothing Esperanza vaping in space or something I don't know what the relevance of bad to you okay I wonder if there might be something there too if you ever wait six months you know in the void of space going to Mars yeah yeah that's something to do yeah somebody is somebody's butt actually bone bone development and degeneration maybe there's something related to the endocannabinoid system there so you might actually have a a therapeutic use okay but for science I like it no no it's your safety babe I mean maybe maybe the astronauts whether you want the video do they do they want this kind of thing up there do they even I don't know what it's like to anyways well cuz I mean they get like weird issues like co2 pockets so it's like if you'd end up like if you if you like hot box your corridor as quarters it just might just hang there okay that's so have you I mean this has really nothing to do with anything but like have you thought about the like the physics of growing pharmaceuticals in space cuz like you're like you know it's fine what it's a tank of liquid on earth like you've got gravity to hold your [ __ ] in place but like I feel like that would be a huge engineering challenge to make that work in in space like things would would slosh around and just float in weird like you'd have to like get the tube into like at the center of the liquid somehow it just did like I don't know it's just I think geometrically it would just be a very interesting a very interesting challenge to like deal with the fact that your liquids don't sink yeah I haven't I haven't really thought about it actually yeah yeah I mean that's fair although although there was I came pretty close to actually this it was a competition that that was gonna be related to some like getting our yeast strains into space as like a research experiment somehow anyway that was like a years ago that I'd tried to do this thing but there there is some interesting stuff when it comes to microgravity and yeast and other microbes and how they grow when else other stuff and I guess there's work to be done and interesting things that I guess all organisms kind of change whether you end up in that environment you know humans I mean it's a trash it also the radiation environment too so you'd have like this is something I've been thinking about like if you try and grow your pharmaceuticals in space like it's a heavier radiation environment you have a mutation it's gonna [ __ ] with your product so bad like it could like it could wreck your batch really really easily I mean there's been a lot of experiments where they try and grow bacteria in space and they get angry like they do not like it why they just they Butte ate really hard and have really nasty products are being produced and it's just it's very strange it's entertaining yeah it from like a from a science perspective it's fascinating but like I would not want to be the guy in charge of that oh man I have they done slime mold in space I feel like they did but also if they haven't they need to because that would be such an interest in your experiment yeah I wonder I haven't I haven't looked into it what else yeah space is weird space is weird stuff it's very weird I like the idea but I'll get there eventually but like yeah yeah I guess you gotta figure out I think so I still frozen at her waist I think moon is probably where a lot of this stuff is gonna end up happening uh yeah anyway cuz I mean that's that's like sorry like [ __ ] Mars thank you the the moon is where it's at and like I'm like I think Mars bases are stupid but I'm a huge fan of moon bases just because it's close and it's it's just a very fascinating thing but I I think you know I mean also there's enough gravity that like your liquids would still probably slosh around in really weird ways but there is still enough gravity that like a tank of liquid will settle and so like I think being able to grow pharmaceuticals in the way that you are will probably be very valuable technology on the moon I almost wonder if that's like because I know there's grants and stuff for for moon project I almost wonder if that's something that would be worth like you considering like if I need a grant all that means I'd be entertaining just like she very fun but III think like long-term like being able to because the only time like that sort of base would really be stable and viable long-term is when you can produce all your own stuff and like pharmaceuticals I think is gonna be one of the most difficult to produce because you know each pharmaceutical has its own quirks but I think you know if you had like a hundred tanks each one produced you had a yeast that produce some different useful thing like that seems like a really viable way of overcoming that problem in this because just cuz it'd be like technically easier than trying to do chemistry interface like well there was there was that I think it was craig Venter that was the one that kind of suggested like oh why don't you put like a DNA synthesis robot on the moon that just like spits out DNA and then you don't even have to have a yeast collection of these various type of DNA being synthesized in here yeah the presumably although that works [Laughter] I guess you could imagine that giving a a you know basic yeast strain and then you transfer me with different pieces of DNA and then depending on what you give it and then it'll it'll make a different public right and then you have to have a right in theory that sounds good but as someone who's actually done like a lot of you know toiled away at yeast transformations like it's not that easy it sounds really good on paper in practice you know but this is this is later in the future when we have a synthetic version of yeast and that actually takes a teenager yeah we yes sure first that and then make that you strain now can can I have it please I want magic yeast that makes my life easy [ __ ] I mean it like forget growing THC that would be way more valuable just magic east yeah make anything that'd be fun okay so let's let's see if there's if there's any other questions but and we've been going for two hours so like if you want to if you're ready to wrap it up we can do that let's just let's just see if there's any other interesting the question was really quick I'm just gonna like skim through so yeah you know it's if anybody's got like a you know a pressing question you know speak now or forever hold your peace we have you a minute or two just cuz I know there's lag on the stream so yeah if you've got some questions leave them in the comments and we will try and dress them but otherwise it's been fun I'm glad we finally I'm glad we finally did this this is things has been a really interesting conversation we got to cover some really interesting ground it seems people have been enjoying it so that's been good yeah I think it was I think there's a pretty significant lag on the stream so it's gonna take them a second to actually start sending some questions if they do that otherwise they're probably just gonna continue bickering amongst themselves as usually goes [Music] okay so there was one question on the stability and reproducibility versus like a cannabis monoculture it's like how's that comparable I mean I don't know that much about cannabis monoculture I would say but like I think like for yeast it's no problem that's easy you do it all the time like it's it's just part of the game for cannabis I think there's a more specific things that you have to do in order to get it - yeah grow consistently and to do that like you know for I guess you think you might be think about like 20 years that you're using this like it's same exact plant in the same exact way to make the same exact compounds for somebody to use for therapeutic whatever and that's I think you know some companies that are doing more the pharmaceutical aspect of this stuff are like you're working towards that or have spent a lot of time like mastering that one aspect of it like for in cannabis consistently and then but that was like I think that's a big challenge earlier on in Canada's industry and still is hard to get like you know uniformity across like every cannabis plant that you grow just about different different conditions that might tweak it a little bit I mean that makes sense Oh will you be doing an IP out like at some point are you looking at taking the company public are you gonna stay private for the foreseeable future yeah good question we'll see who's fair good yeah well when you do that is the question oh yeah yeah of course right a lot of I mean that's like the the whole sort of story right like what do you end up in future and it's like you know hopefully you you find a way to to keep to make the company exist and actually take it like in tests huge a successful thing and then you can decide if you want to sell it or if you want to be doing they don't want to take it public or whatever else right right yeah that's possible fair enough and this I I assume this is something that you'll only be able to be like yes or no but do you do computational analysis to predict the structure of better and more efficient enzymes I think when we talked on that we talked about this a little bit but like short answer is yes yeah but I guess generally speaking you know I did that did this work in my undergrad about like how to use computers to predict stuff with enzymes and it gets to be pretty I like despite many years of computational enzyme discovery in prediction and design whatever else I'll say that the results from computational predictions are like pretty limited yeah so so you know even the best people in the world at this science technology of like particularly protein structures are still still having a hard time with a lot of different cases right I mean that's that's sort of what I expected like do anyways yeah it's a cool topic I love it I love the topic of computation with that prediction that's super cool it is super cool it's just also enzymes are hard yeah and and all the things that we think will work don't often so like a lot of the time it's it's you know you know I've got this great idea and what if we just tweaked is one thing and or you but then you just like mutated randomly change something that makes no obvious sense to you and it just ends up working way better than like okay what right so it's like okay cool there's been a lot of questions like do you are there are there internship possibilities of your company and also like just asking about your hiring practices like are they mostly like PhD and master's student like or people with PhDs masters all sort of thing or do you have kind of more of a like a open range more more open range actually I think we've we've got like a good mix of things and and we don't necessarily you know I mean we have some philosophy where it's like we don't necessary want to hire a PhD to fill like an entry-level role of course that's gonna be more like a bachelor's or master's student that will fill those kinds of roles so you know every rule has its place and person has its place that accompany so I mean yeah that's fair enough but so you're more looking for like talent and skill set rather than like magical piece of paper I say it generally yes yeah I know that's where I'm all about it that's that's good [ __ ] okay that questions already been answered like a hundred times [Music] no okay I've not seen anything particularly interesting so I think we'll probably wrap it up there well either way thank you very much for hanging out this has been a lot of fun I know we were we've been trying to set this up for a little while so I'm glad we finally finally got it done it seems like people really enjoyed it and I mean I think we got to cover some really interesting ground I mean I learned some things this was this was really great so yeah thanks for thanks for hanging out cool yeah this is this as fun as a pleasure hopefully people learned something from this exchange here otherwise people if people have questions is there a spot that they can contact you or and do you have any other I mean there's the the hyacinth link in the description but is there anything else that you want to plug while you have the opportunity good question I don't think so I think just follow that link if you want to hang out with other people who like to do DIY bio stuff and and you can go check out Rico bio I guess that's pretty good bio and we'll I think the websites out of date now but he'll updated maybe and then even the future when people watch this they'll realize like oh yeah this is cool otherwise yeah nobody can send questions to you and I'll answer them through you maybe is it also another approach to that fair enough is there is there a contact page run on Python or is it there is but we're usually pretty slow to answer that just cuz like okay that's that's totally fair alright well thank you very much for hanging out this has been a lot of fun for the the regular viewers and the next stream should be on Monday I think we're just", "O6A7AijPzUc": "[Applause] why stress yourself out creating the perfect strain when you can mix your cannabis instead the holy grail for all domestic cannabis growers is to grow their own perfect strain of cannabis plant for some of you the major thc high is the priority for others the cbd content is the target that makes your choice of plant easy as there are ones already in existence such as xx for high thc and yy for cbd potency but what if you want both the world of cannabis plant classification is adapting to meet this change in demand whereas we previously divided cannabis plants into cultivars cultivated varieties we are now beginning to class them as chemivars chemical varieties consequently many growers have been trying to perfect the double whammy the strain of cannabis that delivers on all fronts why they are doing this isn't so much from a commercial angle but more a botanical challenge the curious thing about cannabis though is that there does tend to be two distinct schools those of you who want the psychotropic high who love getting stoned or who are looking for pain relief while some others crave the mental benefits of cbd especially if the goal is to relieve stress or anxiety however while there are many laws surrounding the cultivation and use of cannabis there is no law which says you cannot enjoy the dual benefits of high levels of thc and cbd together so what are we talking about in terms of mixing strains how about royal demeanor and medical mass if you want psychoactive potency then look no further than royal demeanor with a 20 level you can then temper this with medical mass which has a 10 cbd content the result a high that's not quite out of control mixed with the clear-headed effects of a hefty dose of cbd enabling you to still function while being totally stoned alternatively what about sour diesel and og kush mix here you get bags of flavor and bags of thc while sour diesel is more a sativa strain and og kush is an indica heavy strain the combination will result in hitting the sweet spot time after time fancy a snack before a nap try mixing cheese with blue mystic while cheese gives you a terpenes-rich cheesy flavor in abundance blue mystic will balance this with sweetness sugars and fruitiness the result this time get the pillows handy as you just want to curl up into a ball and go to sleep after trying this cocktail and of course if you

all marijuana or is there a difference our next insider explains what we have to differentiate is between cannabis or marijuana and hemp as well as cbd and thc so those are the the big ones to differentiate so cannabis is actually a plant that has all these different cannabinoids and it produces two of the most prominent thc and cbd hemp on the other hand it comes from the cannabis species but it does also have the cbd molecule which is cannabidiol and so what's legal in the united states in all 50 states would be cbd from a hemp plant and that would mean it would have also 0.3 percent thc or less and so that's really important because the thc is a psychoactive molecule so hemp is legal you can buy it online many people sell it and it contains cbd which has a lot of medicinal properties however cbd from hemp may be similar to the effect you would get from cbd from cannabis however it does have less than 0.3 percent thc so there's no chance of any psychoactivity there so cbd is cannabidiol cbd thc stands for what for tetrahydrocannabinol and what exactly is that again so that's one of the cannabinoids that causes the psychoactive effect and that's because it binds to that cb1 receptor in our brain but it has a lot of medicinal benefits also so people who are going through chemotherapy for example and suffering from nausea and vomiting or need to increase their appetite thc can be very effective it's also great for pain all different types of pain pain from neuropathy or you know the typical sciatic type of pain muscle spasticity patients with ms or a lot of other chronic musculoskeletal issues and uh very beneficial for insomnia as well what is hemp oil and is there any medicinal benefit there too so so hemp oil does contain cbd the problem with hemp oil is that it's not regulated strict enough and now actually i think today trump may sign the farm bill and the farm bill actually would make hemp completely legal so that it's no longer part of that definition where it's part of that schedule one and so you can get cbd from hemp and it would be very exciting if the farm bill does pass and trump signs that because now they'll be able to regulate what happens because the industry similar to supplements there's not a lot of strict enforcement so people are producing hemp oil selling it and it may not have the proper cannabinoid profile it may have things like mold pesticides lead different things that can be taken up from the soil so it has a lot of benefit and it can be bought online or you know in physicians offices however it should be regulated so that we know that the patients are getting accurate amount of what they need and i was hearing in the news that it looked like it was gonna pass but he was going to sign it it seems like it's going to happen today hopefully i think so today exactly uh let's go over cbd hemp oil we have a graphic if you could walk us through this doctor so in order to be considered hemp oil the cbd has to have the the oil has to have less than 0.3 thc which would mean there wouldn't be any chance of any feeling of being high or psychoactivity it should be third party lab tested which means that you can send it to a lab to check the cannabinoid profile and for any other contaminants and then how it's extracted is important there's ethanol extractions there's co2 extractions and the way i look at cbd is it really is more of a wellness type of supplement and i always tell people it's going to be in our multivitamin because we make a molecule in our body that is very similar to that molecule and as we age we make less and so it's really one of the reasons why we get chronic disease because we're not able to regulate and maintain homeostasis so it's something that people should be taking on a daily basis and then if they have specific symptoms like anxiety or pain or insomnia they can take it in specific doses or specific routes of administration and is cpd hemp or illegal in all 50 states it is it is it is legal okay i want to go over some reasons why you would prescribe cbd and thc we have a few examples that we can show our viewers right now and that would be anti-inflammatory i actually will let you take them because there's a few of them so cbd is a great anti-inflammatory so when dealing with joint inflammation or any type of inflammation in our body cbd can be used instead of things like ibuprofen meloxicam different anti-inflammatories it's also great for anxiety so it's a lot of patients are able to get off their xanax their valium their klonopin by using cbd it's helpful for pain and it's a good analgesic as well as an antioxidant to help with the immune system thc on the other hand actually the united states has a patent saying that it can help with apoptosis which is programmed cell death which means that it can help to shrink tumors it can help decrease metastasis so it has this anti-cancer property and also anti-spasmodic patients who are suffering from spasticity or muscle spasms it will help with that as well it's also effective for pain and again it can help with nausea vomiting stimulating people's appetite and if cbd is not sufficient for sleep thc can be used to help patients suffering from insomnia look at that more than i even dreamed of are patients surprised when they see that so they they just come in and go really they are surprised but what happens is a lot of patients actually come to me because i've had success with their friends or their family and so they are understanding the benefits and they're feeling they're seeing people feel better and so they want to know is this an option for me and by the way president trump did sign the farm bill which legalizes hemp you can find out more on cbd just

And we're talking about this. Delving into your investigation, what you see in your practice now because I think that's a valid question. You are a doctor. Emergency medicine\ndoctor, who's now become a cannabis specialist. How do we know the advice\nwe're getting is valid? - That's exactly right. So you have be really\nmindful of who you're getting the advice from. So if it's somebody behind\nthe counter at a dispensary, they're called \"budtenders\",\nlike a bartender, that the budtenders, right now\nin the state of California, have no regulatory standards\nto what they need in education. But that is changing. So the Department of\nCannabis here in Los Angeles is working on creating\na set set of standards for those budtenders to have to undergo. And one of the things we see in the ER, and Travis, I'm sure you're\ngonna see this in the ER as well is edible overdoses. And this is really important to know. It's a non-lethal overdose. You're not gonna die. You will land in the emergency department from six to 48 hours and feel awful. Even have a panic attack. But that being said,\nthere's a couple things we can remember in terms of edible safety. Number one, if you're a first time user, don't use an edible. That's just plain and simple. If you're comfortable with cannabis, go ahead and use, and you\nhave to know your dose. This is what I would leave people with. Know your dose. Are you a one milligram THC? Do you take five milligrams of THC? Where is that dose sit for you? And remember here in the state-- - Sorry to interrupt. Quick question. How does someone find their dose? I realize that this is for\nmore experienced people. But when you said that to me, I was like, \"How would I know what my dose is?\" So I was just curious. - So you have to look at the labeling. So the best part about legalization has been the labeling\nprocess and the consistency. So now all of the edibles are\nrequired to have the label. The max dose in a full\nedible is 100 milligrams here in the state of California. That's right. I hear a lot of whistles in the audience. And that's interesting\nbecause anybody who whistled knows that's a lot of medication. Your dose is gonna sit\nabout one-hundredth of that. So that one chocolate bar is good for a month to three\nmonths for most people. - Is that being well publicized? Because see I feel like that's\nthe issue with the overdoses. I'm gonna eat a whole chocolate bar. (overlapping talk) - You will only hear this\ninformation on this show because the truth is no\none is talking about this. And 100 milligrams is a huge dose. The standard dose, if you go buy a mint, is 10 milligrams, which for\nsome people would be like chugging a six pack of beer. For some people that's a big, big dose. - It would be a pint of\nvodka for some people. - So you know, why do the\nstandard dosages seem so high? - It's really simple actually. So 100 milligrams is a one month to three month prescription so to speak. When you go into a pharmacy\nto pick up your pills you're picking up a month's\nworth of medication. You don't wanna have to go back every week to pick up another round of medication. So remember, for our cancer\npatients, we want them to be able to have a month's\nworth of medication at a time. The key is, is to know your dose, which is what we were talking about, is one-tenth or one one-hundredth of that. So you can start at one milligram. Really. One milligram. - But I think it's important to point out. So then what I think should be happening, or the direction that would be nice is that rather than you going in and getting one chocolate bar, just like when you go to the pharmacy, you get 30 pills. That these things should be broken up, so it's really user friendly and it's obvious to you that you don't just eat the whole bar in one sitting.", "42seKWI0hLY": "[Music] this is an area I want to talk a little bit about synthetic cannabinoids this is an area that I find absolutely fascinating so I might go off in a few tangents here and there but it's also an area that's filled with myths and it's very difficult to the science to keep up with what's happening in the field so I'm going to try and sift through some of the more hysterical things around synthetic cannabinoids now this what's in that it cannabinoids are you might have heard them referred to as noids or chronic or spice or black mamba or synthetic cannabinoids or herbal incense or herbal tea there are a range of products that are designed to kind of with the intent of mimicking the effects of cannabis now the cold and synthetic cannabinoids is a tad misleading because natural cannabis is a plant derived substance with hundreds of different active components and we don't actually know what all of the components are doing one particularly important one is cannabidiol which has protective effects against some of the adverse influences of THC they're probably best thought of as synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists in that they designed from a literature aiming to hit receptor sites both the cb1 and cb2 receptor sites particular cb1 which is located most densely in the CNS however they are quite different to the way the THC effects these receptor sites so THC binds strongly to these areas but it's a partial agonist this synthetic cannabinoids are typically full agonist so they have a greater effect of lower doses and they also have very different kinetics in terms of some of them have very quick modes of onset very different half-lives some you'll get a stoned and it'll be over within ten minutes other not particularly successful ones have had periods of time where you've been intoxicated for over a day which is not something that people are necessarily seeking the other reason that just in theory cannabinoid receptor agonist becomes a little bit of a misleading title is that that assumes that that's all that they do and we're increasingly being aware that some of the newer variants in this family actually have a lot of off-target effects so some of the newer drugs actually have got structures added on to the general backbone which fit quite nicely in certain urging receptors so they also bring the risk of serotonergic syndrome there's also some evidence that some of them will have impacts on monoamine oxidase so where did they come from and and this is one of my favorite things about these it's basically they've come from the general public's hijacking basic science for recreational purposes so there's been a series of very lovely gents that have worked on and and their lab groups or I'm sure and not just gents who has worked on understanding the mechanisms of THC trying to synthesize it trying to use it for medications and they've done a lot of work which they've published in the academic literature or have put out in patent literature with some nice information about how strongly they bind to cannabinoid receptors so people in the marketplace have taken that information and gone oh that's a great target drug cannabis is illegal these things that we don't seem to be explicitly illegal illegal so here's the thing that we can bring to market now I'll talk a bit about regulatory processes around these drugs but basically all of the things where there is any actual basic underlying science have been used in the market so and have exited the market because they've all largely been systematically banned all there's urine tests for them so the things that are currently on the market are quite literally literally designed by just random people on the Internet there's some great websites if you look at isomer design there are people that have created a whole bunch of potential analogs of cannabidiol that of cannabinoids that you may be interested in checking out and so people are going to the market very quickly without having any sense of what's really going on so the pace of these things is quite rapid depending on who's doing the counting they kind of first have popped up on the market in 2004 first were chemically verified in 2008 so it's not a new phenomenon but the number of structures available has increased exponentially over time we're currently in the realm of there's around a hundred and eighty which have come through the illicit market and been identified there's a few more that are there in sort of a bit more of what what the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has examined and we're in the situation where since January we've already got three entirely novel substances that have been identified in the in the world so what we have is we've got a very rapid pace of development the rapid pace is kind of produced by a number of different factors number one is the people that producing these want to keep these legal or at least not explicitly illegal and so when something comes to to market as soon as science catch up with it in terms of adverse events or its tested then governments may try and ban these substances and then the marketplace shifts on very quickly from there another big driver is the ability to pick up certain things by urine drug screens because that's a big driver for why people are interested in these substances there's quite that of an entrepreneurial spirit in that people bring things to market very quickly and happy for it to fail and move on to another substance but also there's also the thing that you see is that there's been a push towards steadily more potent variations of the forms just like you see with genetics growing of natural cannabis so if you look at the structures down the side over here we see J THC is only a partial agonist at the C cannabinoid receptors the JW h compounds which refers to market of a kind of similar and a little bit stronger but now we're dealing with substances as time has progressed that I wanted two orders of magnitude more potent than natural cannabis and also full agonist so what do we know about the prevalence of pasture use in Australia we hear a lot about synthetic cannabinoids particularly in New Zealand they had quite the market and were sort of international leaders in the area and also in Europe that in Australia it hasn't necessarily caught on quite to the extent that it has elsewhere if you look at our national drug strategy household surveys we saw that in 2013 about 1% of the population reported using synthetic cannabinoids in the past year between the two surveys there was a significant decline in the people that had used that and when you look at who was using it it was more common among very young people which is probably the worst time to be trying those things and also what's often referred to as suited booted people people that may not have access to typical cannabis or might be under you know under urine screen our regiments okay so part of the reason for that drop off is that between those two surveys there was a big change in the law whereby previous to that in Australia our regulations had kind of been playing catch-up and when new things come to market they'd be made illegal and so a new thing would come to the market so similar to the UK in 2015 we've got a very broad psychoactive substances bill whereby anything that has a psychoactive effect is effectively illegal to import and that is it's expedient in terms of these homes but it does hold up a lot of progress in science and triangle defense of course that hasn't necessarily changed what you can buy so this is what I did on Valentine's Day I humped it around for Australian sites where I could buy synthetic cannabinoids and my partner does like her Belleci but I didn't think I'd be able to get away with getting her three grams of mind rape extreme I didn't think that it necessarily go down very well but sites are there they're very easy to find it was on the first page in my google search the only information on the site I particularly liked here over a thousand Australian miners swear buyers we keep your minds high and your jobs safe we guarantee we certify that everything's legal and guaranteed undetectable in all the urine tests so these things there was a drop off in the market but it's starting to creep back up luckily I'll skip that how do these things appear in terms of their presentations so they come in a rate and array of form so typically I'm they're sold as herbal incense or herbal tea or herbal products and there might be a list of ingredients on a packet and what it actually is is that just a general combustible herbal matter which has had synthetic cannabinoid C mixed in or sprayed onto it to allow it to be smoked and that is probably the lion's share of the market but we're moving into newer areas which are make things ever more complex we're starting to see in the US there's a big market in legal vape fluids that have cannabidiol in them and some of those products have actually been shown to yes they have cannabidiol but some of the more popular ones including the one that's branded by Tommy Chong from Cheech and Chong has quite a significant amount of synthetic cannabinoid in it as well we're and we're also seeing particularly big in the UK is that synthetic cannabinoids can be impregnated on paper and that's been a mode of access for synthetic cannabinoids into the prison system so that this is a sales pitch from somebody on the dark web that is showing just a four pages that are you know undetectable and easy to write on this has led to the further and dignity of people in the prison system having their mail opened photocopied and people get photocopies rather than the originals so it's caused and in the prison system it has caused in the UK in particular it's caused quite a degree of disruption [Music] you you", "GcLpuOoOS8E": "[Music] it's not uncommon when people come in for them to describe to us that they've been experiencing atypical behavior acting in ways that aren't like themselves and this is not so uncommon with post-traumatic stress disorder [Music] and people with post-traumatic stress symptoms often attempt to take care of their problem on their own people drink they use substances they misuse substances as a way of coping seven to eight percent of the general population each year are affected by post-traumatic stress disorder or ptsd it manifests itself after an individual goes to a shocking stressful or for lack of a better term a traumatic experience leaving an individual in a very disturbed state the disorder can affect people of all ages and is commonly seen in military veterans victims of sexual assault or abuse and even witnesses of terror attacks and natural disasters symptoms of ptsd can begin to overcome an individual three months after the traumatic event and these include flashbacks where you relive the event over and over while even feeling the physical symptoms such as the racing heart and sweating [Music] individuals with ptsd can have difficulty falling asleep difficulty concentrating and can feel socially isolated develop extreme anxiety while also having depression within the brain the hippocampus amygdala and prefrontal cortex are the primary regions that are affected by ptsd while the neurochemicals cortisol and norepinephrine which are responsible for the stress response also tend to show increased activity in ptsd patients imagine the worst possible day of your life now imagine reliving that moment over and over and over and over again and with each passing moment the fear that it may happen again only grows greater for a lot of ptsd patients they only see one solution one effective way to cope with their problem and this leads us to substance abuse in recent years ptsd has been shown to have a link with substance use disorder in which individuals frequently use these substances to cope with their struggles but today we'll be only focusing our attention to one of these drugs cannabis or more commonly known as marijuana so what is cannabis cannabis is a psychoactive drug that can be smoked ate in an edible form and drank in liquid form the psychoactive substance within cannabis is known as thc also known as tetrohydrocannable this is a molecule that is responsible for eliciting the euphoric effects that it is known for cbd is another major component of cannabis however it is not relevant to the studies we will be examining so when canvas is ingested it causes the brain to release dopamine which is the reward chemical for our body and this is the fundamental mechanism by which cannabis affects our brain body and mental state so now we've talked about ptsd and we've talked about cannabis but how do they relate to one another we'll take a look at two studies that examine the effects of cannabis on ptsd does it help or does it hurt the symptoms in a study conducted in 2014 researchers examined 2 276 military veterans who were diagnosed with ptsd their findings were astonishing following an analysis of their symptoms they found that those military veterans that never used cannabis had the lowest level of ptsd symptoms such as depression anxiety and sleeplessness however it is interesting that those who started smoking cannabis following ptsd diagnosis saw a rise in violent behaviors in contrast those who stopped smoking marijuana also saw a decrease in certain ptsd symptoms [Music] in a more recent study conducted in 2020 404 individuals with ptsd were put on a medical marijuana regiment in which they inhaled cannabis these individuals tracked their symptoms on an app for 31 months and had a total of 11 000 responses they tracked symptoms such as intrusive thoughts flashbacks irritability anxiety along with many others after analyzing the results the researchers concluded that there was a 50 percent decrease in all ptsd symptoms immediately after using marijuana like all studies there are some limitations there needs to be more controlled research so we can truly understand the effects this is a new and advancing field and it's necessary to explore all avenues to see how cannabis can improve or deteriorate our mental health now where does this leave us can we say for certain that cannabis cures ptsd definitely not but we can certainly also not rule it out as a potential treatment what we can say though is that for certain individuals cannabis does prove to lessen the severity of their symptoms while for others it may increase them like any medication before taking any course of action it is best to consult your doctor and understand both the possible benefits and the risks this is demystifying medicine presenting ptsd in cannabis help or hurt you",

group of three plants with psychoactive properties known as cannabis sativa cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis these plants are made up of more than 120 components which are known as cannabinoids the main two components being cannabidiol CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol THC CBD is a chemical compound from the cannabis plant it's a naturally occurring substance that is used in products like oils and edibles to impart a feeling of relaxation and calmness unlike its cousin THC it's not a psychoactive THC is the chemical responsible for most of marijuana psychological effects it acts much like the cannabinoid chemicals made naturally by the body according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse THC stimulate cells in the brain to release dopamine creating euphoria according to the institute it also interferes with how information is processed in the hippocampus which is the part of the brain responsible for forming new memories cancer pain is a result of late stage metastatic cancers and primary and metastatic cancers that grow in the bone for a woman with inflammatory breast cancer pain or tenderness often is one of the first symptoms pain caused by cancer itself is more common in people who have metastatic or advanced disease breast cancer starts in the cells of the wrist a malignant tumor is a group of cancer cells that can grow into and destroy nearby tissue cancer cells can spread from the breast to other parts of the body and this spread is called metastasis if breast cancer spreads it usually spreads to regional lymph nodes these are lymph nodes on the same side of the body as the tumor in the following areas under the arm around the collarbone and around the breastbone currently the single lab is investigating the host response to cancer cell release signaling molecules they are currently investigating the mechanisms associated with cancer induced pain and cancer induced depression given the application of breast cancer pain and Canada we decided to ask dr. Gurmeet Singh a professor of pathology in molecular medicine at McMaster University a couple of questions Mead saying I'm a professor of pathology and molecular medicine and a senior scientist with the Hamilton health sciences so most of my research is involved in understanding how cannabis can be used for cancer induce pain and what we found is that currently there are no good treatments for calcium use pain and it appears that cannabis especially CBD might have an effect on cannabis induced pain so we've been looking at preclinical models of breast cancer which is taking marine samples like in in rats and treating them where the with the tumor and once the animals get into pain then we give them different doses of CBD or CBD plus THC or THC alone to see if it has any effects on cancer pain and currently it appears that there is some efficacy and there seems to be some sexual dimorphism that is males seem to be reacting better than females and we're trying to understand the mechanisms by which CBD and THC affect calendar's pain it appears that the immune system might be very important in in the generation of pain and CBD is known to affect the immune system specifically the macrophages and the t-cells and thereby it may have efficacy there are some reports saying that cannabis itself might be effective in limiting tumor growth but we ourselves haven't done any of this work that work has appeared in the literature especially from a group in Israel it appears that breast cancer also involves inflammation and interactions with the immune system and if anything the biological contribution is down regulation of the immune system by cannabis and thereby protecting the individual from cancer news pain most of this pains occurs in individuals who have breast cancer that has metastasized to bone and we in our models we look at what happens to the metastasis and it appears that cannabis limits metastasis and also is able to relieve pain to some degree we haven't really tested it in humans and these are very early preclinical studies we need to do a lot more in trying to understand the mechanisms by isolating the various t-cells and also understanding what happens to the hormonal levels in these individuals my name's Robin guard I'm a PhD student in gamete sings lab I'm in my fifth year and I study cancer pain and neuropathic pain so cannabis is funny because often treatments especially treatments for cancer or sometimes for pain will come from experiments in the lab basic science and they go to preclinical experiments and then they go to clinical trials and then they use them people but cannabis is a bit backwards since it is something that was used by a lot of people and then sort of demanded to be investigated in the lab so there's many reports there's a lot of case reports that cancer works for pain there are some clinical trial reports some small ones and there's a lot of basic science between it now I mean sorry supporting it but it's all very spotty nothing is really put together and cannabis is a complicated thing there's hundreds thousands of chemicals that come out of a cannabis bud and so nobody is quite sure what which of those chemicals are responsible for having an effect if any so the steps that need to be taken are isolating the compounds of interest doing proper preclinical science on them and doing clinical trials that can be reproduced and show an effect for cancer pain so a brief overview of cancer induced pain is I mean imagine imagine a tumor it's it's a clump of dysregulated cells if it's a solid tumor growing somewhere that it ought not to grow so what we often use in the lab is a model is breast cancer is growing in the bone so imagine this this massive", "ATDB4zmZKlE": "CBD cannabis oil has attracted a lot of THC the CBD what is CBD CBD has well and truly brought the cannabis plant into the mainstream it's touted as having loads of health benefits and can be found in all sorts boils creams wine teabags sweets you name it and it's been all over the headlines but for something so talked about there's a lot of uncertainty about how it actually sits within the law CBD is a major compound found in the cannabis plant it's thought to affect the receptors in our nervous system and have broad medicinal benefits potentially treating conditions like anxiety insomnia and chronic pain but it won't give you a euphoric high and it's legal pure CBD is legal unlike its counterpart THC which is the other major compound found in cannabis THC produces the psychoactive effects that get you high and it's not legal in the UK but it's difficult to separate CBD from THC fully as they can come from the same plant now it's important to make the distinction here between hemp and marijuana hemp is legal to grow in the UK with a very low percentage of THC marijuana on the other hand refers to cannabis which contains more than this legal limit the home office says it's legal to grow industrial hemp containing up to 0.2% THC with a license however this is commonly misunderstood as applying to CBD products technically the legal limit of THC in finished products is 0% and research into the industry has found that a lot of commercially available CBD products include traces of THC this strict limit isn't currently being enforced and is unclear how it would be in the future right now the booming CBD market is frankly a of a mess the existing regulations are complex and vague and there isn't a standardized way of testing CBD products or labeling them instead every CBD product out there is subject to different regulations depending on what type of product it is so let's take CBD oil as an example is probably the most popular CBD product and it's classified as a food supplement not a medicine even though that's what most people use it for this means the CBD oil you find on a shop shelf won't have gone through tests and clinical trials like a medicine would have and it can't make any health claims on the bottle plus dosage guidelines and prices vary massively and you have to rely on the manufacturer's assurances that the product contains what it claims to and then other CBD products say cosmetics or veyts are subject to different regulations so at the moment got a situation where we've got a product that is super popular everyone wants to buy it everyone wants to sell it but the problem is no one really knows much about it particularly legal status of it and whether or not it can be used as a food product whether or not can be used as a cosmetic product and if it can whether or not it can be allowed to have a certain quantity of the narcotic element in it in this country technically you shouldn't have any THC at all in the product itself if you want to travel with it then you're going to have to check with the country that you're going to whether or not they will allow CBD oil to be in your possession or for you to use it or even travel with it some places won't even let you take it on a plane and to check that I would say look on the website of the government of the country that you're traveling to and if it isn't clear which in a lot of situations it isn't clear just don't travel with it so currently whether your CBD oil shampoo or tea bag complies to UK regulations or contains what it claims to is far from straightforward but thankfully there is momentum behind initiatives for independent product testing and clearer regulations because the CBD boom looks pretty set to continue and until the benefits are

Igor and Olga Kovalchuk put their efforts into looking at how cannabis could be used to fight Cova 19 they join us this morning from Lethbridge Alberta good to chat with both of you this morning morning good morning so Igor your lab was already testing cannabis I understand strains to combat cancer and inflammation where are you at in your research with kovat 19 right so in the past five years we have developed over 1,500 strains of cannabis and have tested today about 400 and we have actually found around a dozen of cultivars that were able to substantially decrease the expression of the h2 receptor took one that is required by virus to enter ourselves and out of those about two three strains can do it by 75% or more and all go so what would be the next steps here and what made you think that you should make that shift and start to think about kovat 19 well I think we all started thinking about Kovach 19 and when it hit and really disrupted our routines so a lot of scientists like ourselves decided to take a look whether or not something that we already have as Igor said we were already testing cannabis for its biological effects may be helpful so and you know luckily we ended up having some of the very promising strains so right now what's most important for us is to actually find partnerships and develop clinical trials because thus far what we shall we show in the lab and it works in the lab but we have to absolutely have to do a clinical trial to show that it really does translate into clinic that it really works in the scale of clinical trial ego you say the strains you're testing your CBD predominate why does that make a difference in getting a clinical trial up and running faster right so there are many strains that can be active but the main reason is that if you have a psychoactive ingredients like THC in Canada then the dose that you can give is limited so it's limited typically by about 25 milligram of THC day and as I mentioned our strains are predominantly CBD so they have twenty to one ratio to THC so that allows us to give up to 500 milligrams of CBD a day and still be within 25 milligram of THC so that the patients are not or do not feel impaired and it's critically important for patient and for a doctorate 12 although what could be any side effects if any well cannabis is on its own has actually very good safety profile it has been studied its components have been studied very very well separately and so the because again the strains that we are talking about are CBD dominant they have really high levels of CBD and very low levels of psychoactive compound we do not predict there's gonna be any major impairment there of course could be some things like like more positive ones let's say anti-anxiety benefits and some betterment of sleep but those would be not really sight of those actually would be quite beneficial effects that people can sleep and there may be a little bit of improvement of appetite as well so some quality of life aspects may also be improved it's absolutely fascinating we'll be watching very closely your work dr.

Joseph Fink ler he is from the emergency department of st. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver often what happens with people in just one they don't feel any response they ingest another and another and then a couple of hours later when it's metabolized absorbed by your digestive system you get a real bolus of the active ingredient or chemical in your body and it feels weird and more weird than you would expect in people's reaction as a panic attack they feel anxious because this is not what they expected and it's way more yeah not what they expected way more that might have what happened with dion Waiters reports say that he was not familiar with edibles he was not familiar with the side effects we also can tell you that he's now been suspended for ten games without pay because the NBA well they don't allow any kind of THC products to be consumed by their players right it's so important that you're getting this message out there Michael because people do have this terrible reaction and I'm sure you know these things are going to be all over the market there's such a variety of them people are going to be going to the emergency room or whatever clogging up the healthcare system what does Health Canada say about well you're right and there is a concern about people not knowing what to do so they're trying to get ahead of the matter take a look what Health Canada is saying about edible products here they say that when it comes to edible cannabis it can take up to 30 minutes to two hours after consuming a product to feel the effects and sometimes it can take up to four hours before feeling the full effects so it's important to know that while the amount of THC might look small and edible products it does carry quite the punch in fact once consumed by ingesting rather than inhaling the body turns that THC into a stronger form called eleven hydroxy THC so to minimize the risk look for products that contain two point five milligrams of THC or less if you consume stronger doses while exercise caution they say and know that just one of the side effects could be a panic panic attack it could be a lot more so read up know what you're getting into before you actually start consuming edibles okay thank you so much Michael you're welcome", "6DV8CI43r6U": "mail-order we and illegal yet common way to get the drug here in the tri-state and not all transactions involve stereotypical dealers no Tri State Police shared the

It can be used to make clothes, treat\nepilepsy, and help you, you know... ...chill. It can also make a lot of money. With weed being legalized or decriminalized \nin more places than ever, cannabis is becoming the world's\nnewest cash crop. Even in places where it's extremely illegal. - In China, using and growing marijuana \nare strictly illegal. But here in Yunan Zhanyi, a town in South China,\naround me there are hundreds of legal cannabis. Cannabidiol, or CBD, is a chemical compound \nthat can be extracted from the cannabis plant. Believers think it could treat all kinds \nof ailments, but it doesn't get you high. It's already a massive industry in the US, where researchers estimate the market could be worth \ntens of billions of dollars in the next few years. Even though its use is strictly prohibited here, China is poised to be one of the\nworld's leading exporters of CBD. And so far, companies here have been\ngiven a lot of leeway to produce it. But if we look at other emerging industries in \nChina, like online payments or cryptocurrency, CBD seems to be part of a new model\nfor growth sectors in the country. At first, companies proliferate in a\nwild frenzy to get in on the game. But the bigger the industry gets, the more likely it is that the Chinese government \nwill step in and begin heavily regulating it. Cannabis is booming. And those in the business are waiting to \nsee what stance regulators will take. We're traveling around the world to find out \nhow China is changing... basically everything. This week: cannabis. I'm Nikhil Sonnad in New York. And I'm Tony Lin in Yunnan Province. And you're watching Because China. Since the US began loosening regulations \non CBD, American farming of hemp, what cannabis is called when it\ncontains very little THC, the stuff in weed that does \nget you high,has exploded, from around 32,000 acres planted \nin 2018 to over 140,000 today. China, meanwhile, has seen its own expansion. This is Han Sheng Feng, one of the\noldest legal weed farms Yunnan, a province in southern China that\nborders Myanmar and Vietnam. Since 2010, the local government has\nallowed some farmers here to grow hemp for things like textiles and paper. And in 2017, China gave the first license \nallowing companies to extract CBD. Now, China has over half of the\nworld's cannabis patents. And the latest estimates of total hemp \nproduction in China put it right with the US: between 100,000 and 132,000 acres. This is Liu Yang, manager \nof the six year-old farm. They used to only grow hemp for textiles, \nbut for the past three years, it has grown a different strain of cannabis called\nYunnan Hemp No. 7, optimized for CBD extraction. The harvested flowers are chopped down, \nair dried, and sold to processing factories. Each of Han Sheng Feng's 1,100 acres of hemp produces enough for roughly 24 pounds of CBD, around \n$40,000 - $50,000 dollars worth once processed. One of the farm's biggest clients is Hempsoul, \na subsidiary of Hanma Investment Group, the first Chinese company given a\nlicense to extract CBD. Tan Xin is the company's chairman. Unlike its competitors worldwide, Hanma is attempting to control everything, \nfrom cultivation to extraction. Loosening regulations in China place them\nin a strong position to compete internationally. Hanma partners with several farms in Yunnan, \nowns a thousand additional acres of crops, and has CBD extraction plants \nin both China and Nevada. All the CBD oil they produce gets exported \noverseas, mostly to North America. Cannabis is illegal in China. Using it will land you in jail. Selling it could lead to a death penalty. But the plant actually has \na long history in China. Cannabis comes from Central Asia, and the earliest evidence of people\nsmoking it comes from western China. It's been used in traditional Chinese\nmedicine for thousands of years. Here's an excerpt from The Classic of Herbal Medicine, \nbelieved to have been written around the year 200. And throughout China, no place has more \nexperience with the plant than Yunnan. Yunnan's special relationship with cannabis \nis a reminder that parts of the Chinese economy are not as strictly-controlled by the\nnational government as you might think. - The more decentralized, devolved, and \nless-regulated part of the economy, that is also, still, a very huge part of \nthe Chinese economy and has great effects. And I think that the cannabis sector\nis representative of that. This is Roselyn Hsueh, - Hello! a professor who studies economic\nregulation in China. She says that in new industries like cannabis, \ndecisions are made by local governments. - Because it's a sector that is new and emerging, \nwith little regulatory framework around it, these local authorities also have\nmore room to maneuver, for good or bad of the local economy\nand also local interest. Yunnan has every reason to support cannabis. As the second poorest province in China, it's \nin dire need of new economic opportunities. Cannabis is an untapped market. And it's more lucrative than other crops. In October, Yunnan's provincial investment \ngroup put 500 million renminbi, a little more than $70 million, \ninto a state-owned company that will develop the local cannabis industry \ninto \"the new backbone of the local economy.\" The lack of regulation has \nled to proliferation. At the beginning of this year, several Chinese \ncompanies began associating themselves with cannabis. Their stocks skyrocketed as a result. Still, parts of the cannabis \nindustry are tightly-regulated. Even with such small amounts of THC, \nCBD extraction is closely-watched. Anti-narcotics police monitor every\nstep of Hempsoul's extraction process and even dispose of residue themselves. That's why nearly all of \nChina's CBD companies need to emphasize the medicinal \nuses of cannabis, like treating depression, \nanxiety, and epilepsy. If that gets approval, China's\ndomestic CBD market could explode. Other companies are pushing the boundaries \nof what is meant by \"medical cannabis.\" This hemp seed energy drink \nis sold in nightclubs and is marketed for relaxation \nand stress relief. These companies are hoping \nto get a head start, betting that the government and market will\nbecome more tolerant of cannabis products. But that's a big gamble. - I would not be surprised \nthat we will see regulation that will develop around\ndifferent uses of cannabis. Even though Yunnan has loosened \nrules on CBD production, the national government can always\nstep in and draw a line in the sand. The bigger this industry gets, \nthe more likely that is. Just look at what happened \nin mobile payments. In the 2000s, the industry was \nlargely unregulated in China. Alibaba's Alipay amassed hundreds \nof millions of users, even though, technically, it was\ncollecting money in a legal gray area because it didn't have a bank license. Eventually the government stepped in, and now all online payments have \nto go through the central bank. The same thing happened with crypto. Last year, the government banned\nburgeoning cryptocurrency exchanges before announcing that it would release \nits own state backed digital currency. And officials have already reined-in\ncannabis companies once. When cannabis related stocks climbed too high, regulators told the companies to warn\ninvestors that the industry was risky. The stocks plunged as a result. With CBD, China is on nearly equal footing \nwith the US and the rest of the world in terms of manufacturing \ncapacity and know-how. But CBD highlights the many paradoxes\nof China's economy today. Cannabis is taboo. But places like Yunnan want it to thrive. Deregulation is often followed \nby more regulation. Big companies and investors are pouring money\ninto an industry with huge potential. But doing so might draw attention and lead \nto stricter rules or centralization. Whether or not the industry succeeds, will depend\non how well it can navigate those paradoxes.", "WCguL29mDfw": "TAKE TAKE\nANOTHER TAKE\nANOTHER SHOT-- TAKE\nANOTHER SHOT-- AT TAKE\nANOTHER SHOT-- AT LEGALIZING TAKE\nANOTHER SHOT-- AT LEGALIZING\nMARIJUANA TAKE\nANOTHER SHOT-- AT LEGALIZING\nMARIJUANA IN TAKE\nANOTHER SHOT-- AT LEGALIZING\nMARIJUANA IN TEXAS...

to me about the New Year's Day in in Illinois for your company how did you do you know an incredibly exciting day you know uh decades in the making it was it was phenomenal it was a tremendous amount of support we had the the stores open from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. we had we had people lining up at 8:00 p.m. on New Year's Eve and at some of the stores and and you know throughout the day hundreds and hundreds of people waiting in line to get through like you said we service over 3100 customers yesterday was phenomenal Cresco has 30 licenses in seven states and Sunnyside is your national retail brand how important will Illinois be in the overall portfolio you know it's our home state and we're incredibly well positioned here to through the through the existing medical program you know when our operator has a 100% market penetration twenty-five plus percent market share which is by far the largest market share in the state we have three of the 21 existing cultivation licenses we're the only one with three we only have one other appear with two and everybody else has one so we're very very well positioned here in our home state to take advantage and make the most of this this new marketplace this new adult use market in what form do most buyers buy you know I think it was it was across the spectrum you've got your traditional flower products you've got concentrates and bait pens and edibles and you know depending on familiarity I think you've got some consumers who will tend to be in that flower concentrate formats and then newer more exploratory consumers the the vape pens and the edibles are a lot more approachable charlie are you concerned at all about the crackdown on vaping the crackdown on flavors and what it means for the future of marijuana no you know what we heard most yesterday was the consumers were very happy to have a safe tested compliance focused product offering that they could legally buy in the state of Illinois that was one of the one of the comments we heard most yesterday that's that is the benefit of legalized regulated and compliance focused cannabis is safe products educate me because I don't know how the system works how do you know that the products you are selling meet a certain quality standard and our set are quote safe that's number one and I don't mean to get on any kind of moral high horse do you have any qualms about selling an intoxicant in a world where there probably is plenty of intoxication already sure so I'll dress the first question first you know regulated compliance focused programs like Illinois in many of them definitely east of the Mississippi they set standards they set quality control standards they set safety standards as it relates to microbial contamination residual solvents potencies etc so you know not a single product can leave our production facilities until it's been tested and certified by a third-party lab that's also licensed by the state so that's you know one of the benefits of that legalized regulated cannabis is these consumers are coming into a licensed store and every product that they're buying will have the the test results you know again as it relates to exactly what's in that product from the potency of the cannabis related constituents and then also any any sort of supplements along with verification that there's no residual pesticides or solvents left in the product any qualms about selling about selling a product that is yet another intoxicant know a cannabis has been around for 5000 years my background of being a regulatory attorney prior to getting into the cannabis space it was one of the things that I had to address prior to entering the industry but to be honest with you is one of the things that I knew I had to offer to this developing opportunity in the US was a background in regulatory compliance to make sure that this industry was developed in the right way I think it's I think we're seeing the benefit of safe reliable third-party tested products entering into a market you know you see the data in in in most states with regulated cannabis you see a significant reduction in opioid abuse in those states so that the data is now showing great support for greater access to cannabis products and Charlie the fact that you have sales tax that's going up as the th THC content in these products goes up so 10% for lower THC as much as 20% on other THC what does that do to the desire you know I don't know that it has an impact on desire because again those it kind of goes by category by form right so the lower THC products are going to be your traditional flower products the increased potency products are the the concentrates that are for you know the more well-adjusted and familiar consumers that are able to handle the higher tolerance and it's also you know it the the price per milligram at that point is lower too so the increased taxes we haven't seen a we haven't seen an impact from that again one one day of data but we really haven't seen an impact from that graduating tax rate believe it you", "SFDzpNnbk1E": "so what do you think about grow up yeah i know i i had fun i want to invest no you know

world I think we we were we started off planning for a long time and we actually 420 is gonna be almost exactly a year they were on shelves now I know the most important thing for us is quality you know that was the first thing when we wanted to bring Sauceda life this is the quality of the product make sure that when everyone does go out there and spend their hard-earned money for it they get a good experience ROI and they feel like their partisan so for us saucy is more than just his grin like he said gem it's a lifestyle also taking really the the culture that you know that's that we created and keeping it to ourselves not to these corporations and these fortune 500 companies our goal is to keep it where it should be in the culture on the people with the people with the people I like that I like that that's what said now what would you say was an inspiration would you say that was kind of your inspiration behind a brand you know I mean you described it as an elevate and quality product and experience but what do you think separates you from some of these other brands that you know trying to kind of I don't want to say commercialize but more or less brand you know we yeah it's a great question because obviously everyone there's a million people getting into the industry all trying to brand it and they got you know their branding tools and you know art for me I've been smoking for 25 years Jimmy's been smoking for probably the same amount of time my other partners been in the industry for god knows how long and for us we just leave being connoisseurs in this industry and being involved since little kids just on the consumption side we know what a good product is we know what people want to smoke we know what people don't want to smoke well 90% of these other companies out there you know the people that are controlling what you're smoking or guys wearing suits that probably never never dies to shape right it's coming out of college that you know that are going to school for botany and thinking that they can one grow houses right and it's not the same because it's like it's like hands-on experience can never make up for like time but you put into the game that I say it takes 10,000 hours to master some [ __ ] so do you think that there's a responsibility for brands to change the image of like we culture as a whole I mean when it comes to smoking man you you gotta be responsible as a company we gotta be responsible I mean oh it's kind of tricky when it comes to marketing and promoting such a thing that's why we all always gotta let people know the medical benefits of it it does help a lot of people and cures a lot of illness and and put a lot of people in comfort for a lot of anxiety depression and all type of other things and then the flip side you have kids who I might not wanna market to I don't think that it's smart for them to indulge at such a young age and [ __ ] like that but I do not discourage anyone from experiment and what this miracle you know I mean by the same time we must be responsible and we must always give back because we make money off drugs in other so you know when you're making money the proper thing is to give back so people can understand further watching causes and things like that and besides us making money we always love the people we weed itself is a healing a healing component like my man alex is out like my man al says all the time we just wanted a few things that could bring everybody together weren't ever body beefed in when he passed in a blunt you could have a killer and a priest that they get higher they gonna pass each other to blown with no snowpack all different types life plus all the tax money all the schools that are benefiting all the money that's coming in and you're just so much good things that are happening because of cannabis right now is just it's a shame but like Jim says we have to be responsible at the same time tell me a little bit of the science behind selecting some of y'all's products bring it to the table you gotta bring it to the table smoke you know it ain't no other way to do it I mean not you that you can you can separate what's [ __ ] we from what weeds go decent [ __ ] like that but you can't you won't know if that G that decent little weed is the bomb or not until you try it so of course as always a as always it's always great when it's time to try some new weed to pick some new crops it's alright I mean there's so many different flavors out there especially in LA and up in the bay and all the places so it's always a we party going on or test what a research and development that data is restore should be R&D okay the basic way it looks the way it smells obviously you know there's there's certain things you look at when we're selecting and the most important thing is the way it smokes the way it tastes in the way it gets you the way makes you feel but uh you know like right now we're we're on the other side of the country so we're not really it's it's tough for us to really taste so we're kind of just looking at test results looking at what the flower looks like and you know and pretty much right now just kind of you know figure it out with our resources the best things we can so let's talk about you know changing the wheat industry for a second like stakes is starting to like legalize marijuana obviously they're boosting the economy through you know tax and weed dispensary what's your thoughts are the impact on that when it comes to like [ __ ] who was arrested before they decided to make all this [ __ ] legal you know before they side of dipped a hand in the cookie jar take take a little cut how you feel about that everybody shouldn't be let out of jail that's the reality if you have a we defense you've got arrested for weed there's no reason why you should be doing a single day in jail I mean unless you the Pablo Escobar of weed and you just do an ignorant [ __ ] in flying [ __ ] millions of pounds across the country and just being ignorant about it right on you understand in some type of sentence and even then in reality if there's corporation in 100 million dollars or corporations and hundreds all these people making tons of money off of it there's there's no reason one American should be sitting in jail because of marijuana now I agree which are I feel that way but the one thing the one thing good at it is that we we've learned from being in these last week conventions in the past couple of years is the equity program how's that how you say out the social equity programs where what they do it on the west coast now well as the place that I know they're doing it where they take felons who've been locked up for seven weeks and now give them a license to sell weed and open up a dispensary is [ __ ] like that and this is in fact an ADA it's proven it's this now receipts like we've met a few people their own their own dispensary from after being locked up block blocks away from this same spot that they got to be expensive reefer the same offense than that they selling weed legally so it's called a social equity program and it's a pretty dope program so fire I don't even know no [ __ ] like that existed that's dope yeah sounds like that and I think every state is trying to to you know make it and make them like will help people but in reality the problem is the majority that these social equity programs are gonna run into which I don't like is that there's where are majorities people gonna get the funding it's open these places right there's a lot of so what I like to develop eventually is you know try to find communities where we can try to find money and raise money for these people to help them actually do it because saying that they can do it but it's like going to the hood go into the projects where I grew up well where Jim grew up you can give them any license you want but they're not gonna be able to do it for it's it's a very expensive thing to get involved in this industry you know I'm very familiar a couple of my homies like I say a day I don't her some of the issues that they deal with which is some that I actually want to talk about like what any startup you know the weed business is a business so is there any hiccups or any any roadblocks that shot and encountered you know in your journeys a chocolate compared to either any other other industries you know you being a jeweler generally can an artist you know it is what it is just like any other business you're gonna encounter headaches and in this business you're gonna encounter more than one or two it's just it's constantly dealing with these headaches and dealing with these robots because it's a new industry I mean look we're sitting in New York right now and the only way we can smoke and he's in New Jersey but we're in New Jersey the only way we can smoke cannabis is if we get it from Jersey so imagine you're sitting on your in your town your your dinner table today and you want to drink a bottle of wine but the only one you could drink is one that's made in New Jersey well Botswana that's that's a foul line that's what I'm saying so that's that's kind of like the hurdles that we're dealing with from this cannabis space like every single day so we have to deal we have we want to sell weed in California last man we gotta go in in California or deal with people that grow it in California we want to sell weed in Oregon you have to deal with people I can't wait today they free up the floodgate of flour out here in these streets I want to talk about actually um the latest like lean scissor product that saw that these dispensaries done been making you know I actually have tried that [ __ ] some of the like various variations and it will push you on your ass how does your stand out and like how did that even come together what do you hope to see happen firm no y'all's version of y'all's variation in Brandon this is the lean of tremendous you know whatever people like to call it has been around for years and years but it's been a very terrible thing for the body and these kids are kind of killing itself and turn the air actually drug addicts like dope dope things without them yourself knowing so what this TAC can can do is get these kids off of actually using that product and use some natural natural products to get helping live longer feel better and not [ __ ] the body up the way that that other stuff is doing on top of him really can put you on your ass and you have a ball within this [ __ ] like that I put mines of some champagne I'll just just because it's the one is [ __ ] like that but for the most part I think that the components of it being a natural GAC lean as opposed to what these kids been drinking I think is great yeah I think one of the main reasons I think we develop you know majority's products is try to help people get off of the opiates and you know get off of those products and get off of the the real lean and try to substitute with the cannabis product and same thing with you know what we've been preaching this whole time in the sports industry and and just instead of giving these athletes you know opiates finally and the fellows come around and let them gonna let them slow hopefully the NBA is gonna be next and just letting these guys you know indulge in cannabis without having to worry about you know their their their their livelihood being in right us it's important because they're killing them they're killing exactly it's giving them all different types of opiates shooting them up with that you know alter for all shots and all that kind of crazy [ __ ] I mean while that they can't smoke scares oak come on you don't put your kids oh it's crazy go gay as hell at the bar go get it deliberately get drunk out of your face and kill yourself but no I can't smoke and smoke yeah we talked about the saucy lien when I talked about you know some of the saucy flowers a child got from y'all's line that's coming up what else did you all got on deck that y'all is excited to talk about that y'all can talk about maybe you know in essence ship is going down give us give us what's next for ya well 20 we got a big we got a big zoom we've you know smoked guta trying to get as many people at one time to smoke together we got a couple of people coming through her blood Jim got a bunch of people he's going we got a bunch of surprises giveaway his bunch of [ __ ] that we're doing for twenty so hopefully we'll get as many it's possible come smoke at one time at four o'clock Eastern and they will do it again at four o'clock West Coast huh okay so I'll get to smoke two times on 4/20 we want to reach 82 on 4/20 for the for some ass gone faster for sure we don't do it not only just to smoke and get hot but we want to do it with a purpose we won't we don't put it up there we gonna buy I'm gonna raise money and try to buy as many masks for these health care workers and for people that eat it out here this is a very serious situation some people have anxiety so people have real sicknesses that that that helps some people have cancer like this medicine people need to get their medicine and dispensaries are very essential you know me so I took my hats all all essential workers period and I said my head so all the dispense the reason essential work was that all making sure people get their medicine like he said you know just like just like any other drugs or prescriptions before it was recreational in California was only medical purposes so it's just like medicine majority of people in California use it for medical purposes whether it's for your stomach whether it's for your glaucoma whether it's for anxiety like Jim said a lot of reasons that they're like they use capitis for for medical purposes and on top of that if they consider liquor to be essential then they damn sure damn sure gotta consider I feel you own that 100% alright so there you have it thank you to Alex Todd thank you to Jim Jones from saucy farms and extra thanks for coming and taking some time out of a quarantine routine to stop and talk to me now if you got any questions comments leave them below as usual I've been your host right so again for complex news and I'll see you next time stay safe people Squatch why [Music]", "uHYJQ1KXFAw": "\"Does Marijuana Cause\nStrokes and Heart Attacks?\" Does the so-called dark side\nof cannabis include stroke, here said to be associated\nwith non-synthetic marijuana, by which I assume they\nmean, uh, marijuana. There have been case reports of artery\ndamage due to the vasoconstrictor effect of cannabis, something\nthat's been well documented. One study found cannabis users had\n100 times greater odds of suffering from something called\nmultifocal intracranial stenosis, where the arteries inside your brain\nclamp down at multiple points, but that's a rare condition.\nWhat about strokes? The lack of high-level evidence regarding\nthe adverse effects of marijuana usage on brain artery health has led to this notion\nthat recreational marijuana may not be a problem, so they decided\nto put it to the test. \"You want high level evidence?\" they said. Well, how about a study of literally\nmillions of pot smokers? OK, then. And they found that recreational\nmarijuana use did seem to be associated with an increased risk\nof being hospitalized with an acute ischemic stroke, but this may just be among those who\nsmoke regularly, at least once a week. The reason we think it's cause-and-effect\nis that the majority of recorded strokes were during or shortly\nafter marijuana exposure. And there are even cases in which strokes\nrecurred after marijuana re-exposure. So put all that together and it makes\na convincing case, though you'd really have to like randomize people to\nsmoke pot or placebo pot to be sure. It s like the heart disease story. A similar temporal relationship has\nbeen found between marijuana use and the development of heart attacks\nand sudden cardiac death, meaning the heart attacks seemed to happen while\nthey were using or right afterwards. However, this is complicated by the\nfact that cannabis is often used in combination with other drugs,\nsuch as alcohol or cocaine. So you can't just ask heart attack\nvictims if they were smoking pot at the time and make the connection\nwithout asking about other substance use. Within an hour of snorting cocaine,\nfor example, the risk of having a heart attack\ngoes up more than 20-fold. That's about five times more\nthan after smoking pot. The hour after you smoke marijuana\nyour heart attack risk does appear to nearly quintuple, but only for that hour.\nThen your risk drops down to normal. OK, but what does that mean? Even\nthough heart disease is our #1 killer, the risk of having a heart attack every\nhour is only like one in a million in any particular hour. So even if you\nthen light up a joint, that may quintuple your risk, but that would only bump it\nto like 1 in 150,000 risk in that hour, that's just for that one hour. So even if you smoked every day,\nyour annual risk might just go up a few percent. But why\nthe increased risk at all? Well, we've known since the 70s\nthat within an hour of smoking a joint, pulse rate goes up about 35%. Smoking a single joint\nincreases blood pressure too, as well as carbon monoxide levels\nin the blood of angina patients and cuts their ability to\nexercise nearly in half. Now is that just because of breathing\nsmoke, any kind of smoke? No, smoking a placebo joint, a joint\nwith marijuana from which the THC has been removed, only cuts down\nexercise capacity like 9%, compared to cutting the time they could\nexercise before the chest pain started by 48% with the cannabis. So it does\nseem to be a specific drug effect. Now, whether that's as bad as tobacco\nwe'd never know... until a year later. Smoking a marijuana cigarette decreased\nthe exercise time until angina more than smoking a tobacco cigarette, which only cut exercise capacity 23%,\ncompared to 50% after the joint. This may be because marijuana\nputs more demand on the heart; so, no surprise then, it\nwas worse than tobacco. It may also be the carbon monoxide. Smoking marijuana leads to nearly\nfive times more carbon monoxide in your bloodstream than smoking tobacco.\nThis is because pot smokers inhale deeper and then hold the smoke in, allowing\nmore carbon monoxide into your system. So between that and the cardioacceleration\n---the increased heart rate and pressure--- that could account for the accelerated\nchest pain in heart disease patients. Does it have any chronic\neffects on our arteries? Cannabis users do seem to\nhave relatively stiffer arteries for their age, suggesting an\nacceleration of the aging process, and we are only as old as our arteries. Even second-hand marijuana smoke\nmay be harmful, according to this recent study in the Journal of the\nAmerican Heart Association entitled \"One minute of marijuana\nsecondhand smoke impairs vascular endothelial function,\"\nmeaning artery function. And so there was a call to protect\nvulnerable populations, including the elderly and disabled, and\nresidents of multi-unit housing, pregnant women,\nand children even just one minute of exposure to\nmarijuana second-hand smoke in rats. So it's not clear how applicable this is, outside of perhaps not\nsmoking around your pet.", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "lvrvXkDctnM": "what is up Kenna Pham and welcome back so check it out for this video right here I have some different flour for you guys I'm going to show you guys now all this flour right here is different price points this is all different levels of prices some of them actually might be around the same level of pricing but we have you know the more budgeted stuff down here going all the way up to the more expensive stuff and I'm gonna show you guys this as a comparison video so you guys can't compare the really cheap stuff to the really really dank bom top-shelf stuff and then that way you guys kind of got a good overview of what the flour scene is like here in a state of Oregon okay so if you're coming to Oregon if you already live in Oregon this is a great video to kind of give you a good layout of what to expect you know what I mean if you're coming here and you're like hey how much money do I set aside that what do I want to get blah blah blah blah this video can help you so without further ado let's just get into it okay guys so first up let me set some of these ones aside because we're gonna get to those those are not where we're going to start off we're gonna start off with the lowest the cheapest ones and work our way up so the cheapest one I have right now here is this misty mountain days coming in at 16 percent THC this is an indica and this is by green source Gardens okay now this right here runs about four dollars and fifty and over 4.4 dollars and 20 cents sorry so this is a four dollar 20 cents a gram so just imagine what you could get for like a quarter or even an ounce of this stuff because you can't pick up ounces here in Oregon so but anyway that is what it looks like okay [Music] that's what that's what we're dealing with for the $4 20 cent section really cheap really really budgeted I didn't want to go really lower than this even though they do have stuff that is lower than this they do have stuff that's like three dollars a gram two dollars a gram stuff like that but you know this is just I figured you know this is pretty good budget like four dollars come on so anyway I'm gonna open this up so that's what you're dealing with okay [Music] okay not too bad I personally wouldn't smoke this just because that's my personal preference if you are somebody that's on a budget or you don't really give a [ __ ] you just want whatever you know you can get the most of most bang for your buck this is something that you should try out then okay if that's your preference if that's gonna work for you then more power to you however my personal preference I would not waste my money on something like this okay I don't smoke this kind of butter this is really really low grade Bud really really low grade but okay however it's not the worst I have had like nasty green bud that was just awful anyway up next this is at the seven dollar price range so seven dollars a gram so we jumped from four dollars to seven and this is Sookie's by Alta crest and this is a 50-50 hybrid which I kind of doubt that I don't believe that it's a solid 50/50 hybrid it's probably more like 60/40 or something like that anyway 23 percent THC with pretty much no CBD I mean it's going got a point one percent CBD so there you go that is that there's test date let's open it up and take a look at it alright alright so we're just gonna show this big nugget here or vamo it's really dry oh I just lost some of it I just lost a little chunk over here oh shut those right there anyway there's really dry guys this one's really I mean you guys could probably hear it it's just snapping dry and it's not bad I guess it's all I definitely stepped up from the $4 gram you know at least it's more of a dense nug let you know but that is the $7 section so that is what you're going to kind of expect if you're you know looking for that $7 budget-friendly strain you're gonna get stuff like that majority you might you might you might get lucky and find you know something here in Oregon from a certain dispensary that is really bomb at that price point but most of what you're gonna find at the $7 price point is going to be something along those lines okay now we're going to move up one more to the next tier which is I believe here this $10 yeah so we're gonna bring in the $10 ones alright so first up for the $10 actually you know what I'll do this one first actually since this one's opened here at the top we'll do this one first alright so $10 a gram this is probably let me just say this before I get into this $10 and up is probably as far as quality goes as far as good quality this is probably the best bang for your buck $10 now these $10 strains right here I'm about to show you would go like I've seen firsthand in places like California and Nevada I've seen strains just as dank as this if not a little less dank go for like 15 18 dollars a gram in those states so being able to get what I'm least three right here on a buck show you 410 that's phenomenal within itself okay can't beat Oregon prices telling you anyway so look at that this is the hypnotoad 20% THC headrush hills is the farm this is one gram and just look at that purpleness man look at that purple old [ __ ] I dropped it anyway let's do it pull these bad boys out of here oh look at that just beautiful nuts frosty as hell man yeah look at that frost on those nugs beautiful purple in there nice tints of green just what you want when you're looking for nugs and the smell I know you guys can't smell none of this but holy [ __ ] guys this smells great the terpenes are on point with this okay this is some really really good quality for ten dollars a grand okay same with this one this is a 10 gram one two when we open it here so this is the Donnie burger 13 okay you green no-till [Music] and again $10 a gram for this one and I mean just look at that Oh smells phenomenal it's very pungent guys as soon as you take it right out of the bag I mean just phenomenal smell just nice dense nuggets break up nice like if you're rollin blunts or something with this you'd give me you'd be the joint lovers and blunt lovers would love that flower right there it breaks up really nice all right so again Donnie burger 1325 percent THC and then here we go this is the garlic breath now this is probably one of my favorite strains out right now with the GMO if you ask me hey what are your favourite strains right now what what do you recommend uh it would either be the GMO or these garlic breath sorry this garlic breath or the garlic mince uh really I mean I just love stinky strains okay I really do I love that gasps that pungent nest that smell through the bag that's what I like that's what I look for now look at this is a big note look at that Oh beautiful how does one want you to know you're my favorite girl I didn't look at that nice big nug fire ten to ten dollars a gram again I'm telling you that's what to expect here in the state of Oregon okay now so those are the ten dollars set those over here now we're gonna move on to the 12 to $14 arrange now I have a twelve dollar one and then these other two or fourteen so I'm going to show you guys the twelve dollar one so this is the m4 twenty nine percent THC this is super dense that's like a rock I mean that is super dense guys smells great though smells really really good but super dense and just very nice lime bringing some bright orange hairs very nice bug like listen to that listen that listen sit yeah it's dense but so twelve dollars a gram twenty nine percent THC top shelf now we're moving to the last two which are these two $14 a gram and if you ask me my opinion right now they're not that much better than like these are like when I showed you guys these ones that are ten I mean they're almost there they're really not better okay they're kind of the same these just happen to be more expensive I don't know why oh I really don't maybe it's just the flour company or whatever but this is voyager number one from seven points oregon twenty nine percent THC with pretty much no CBD and i'm going to show you guys this 14 dollars a gram for this [Music] or get that nice snug again dents really dental if you you're liking those hard den snugs then you know you want to go for the 12 to $14 sections because that's where you're gonna get a lot of these dents nuggets the smells great phenomenal smell very chirpy very very chirpy I guess maybe that's why it varies in price why this is more expensive than the other stuff is probably because maybe it's more chirpy I don't know but then here we go another $14 gram one strawberry cream 25 percent THC again by seven points Oregon which is a good farm they make good product wash look at that beauty look at that beauty it's the cutie with the bootie I mean seriously though like just nice dense little little tents little very very little tents of purple in there you know just frost it as [ __ ] I mean it looks like somebody took like a salt shaker of tri Chrome's and just shook it all over this bud I mean just drenched it I mean it's super trike City here and I really like that I enjoy that again smells super good it's got like a fruity strawberry smell so that that's really good so there you guys go this has been a comparison video of the cheap budgeted stuff versus the more expensive stuff here in the state of Oregon now let me just end the video by saying this okay guys here in the state of Oregon this is kind of the norm of what you're gonna find at most dispensaries now there are gonna be some premier dispensaries I like to come from your dispensaries because they're more high-end so you will find stuff at those kind of dispensaries that are maybe like you know 16 to 18 dollars a grams stuff like that however this is what you're going to find add just your average basic dispensary that you're going to be visiting in your local town or wherever you're visiting a hatch or anything like that this is majority what you're gonna find and you're gonna find dank bud like this at good prices okay here in Oregon we have the cheapest weed in the United States okay I know there might be some people in the comment section that would like to argue that point maybe they're from Colorado and stuff where they also have cheap weed there as well but Oregon is the cheapest in the United States we have the cheapest and the best bang for your buck okay as you guys can see these $10 grand ones you can't like that's phenomenal that's phenomenal okay so I like I said I just want to do a comparison video show you guys comparing the budgeted stuff the cheaper stuff the the B stirs the whatever you want to call it the low end low grade cannabis versus the high grade you know top-shelf stuff you know that way you guys can get a good idea of kind of what it is you're dealing with here in the Oregon cannabis market okay now I've done a lot of

weekday afternoon in Los Angeles the epicenter of cannabis in the United States this busy dispensary is open for business but if everything looks normal it isn't this is in fact an unlicensed illegal dispensary part of the booming black market in California and around the country it's what the cannabis industry says could be the biggest threat to sky-high expected revenues Aysen Point California early projections of more than 1 billion dollars in annual cannabis tax receipts in 2018 are far from the three hundred forty five million dollars collected that's in large part because the illegal market can easily undercut the costs of running licensed dispensaries it's not hard to see how a team of CNBC producers equipped with hidden cameras visited ten illegal dispensaries throughout LA most aren't hard to find and they're open day and night some have signs others do not but they all have one thing in common they are brazenly breaking the law operating with no license selling potentially untested products and allowing customers to openly consume in this illegal dispensary down the street from the University of Southern California customers are dabbing smoking a highly potent cannabis concentrate and if you want free weed this store and others are happy to give it away as a sign say all you need to do is write a positive review on weed maps an online site that lists both legal and illegal dispensaries around the country [Applause] [Music] despite a daily limit on the amount of cannabis stores can sell to a customer you can buy as much as you want at many of the illegal dispensaries we can get as much as the black market has a huge problem in some states it's 70 to 80 percent of sales and it's a big threat and so a lot of states are thinking about how do we alleviate it the two things is price and convenience attorney Patricia here is the founder of cannabis law digest taking a lot of the profits away from operators and therefore from the tax revenue from a party in Toronto to Miami and New York City the tone is decidedly upbeat at cannabis conferences that optimism faces this reality an estimated 70 billion dollars in illegal marijuana sales nationally 7 times the legal market and know where our legal operators feeling the impact more than in California the country's largest legal cannabis market where voters passed Proposition 64 in 2016 businesses had to be in compliance with a license by January but as we found that clearly didn't happen we found illegal store after store selling cannabis at deeply discounted prices the parking lot is almost full as our producers enter this dispensary that openly advertises on the side of the building thank you we can go in this regular customer says he's a student at nearby USC at another location CNBC producers walk inside our asked for their IDs then our buzzed in a clerk offers a first-timer deal on a popular product called gelato there are more customers dabbing something our producers were told as common in illegal dispensaries elsewhere there are more perks at the illegal stores and easy to see why they are thriving with all the discounts offered we do not buy anything from the dispensaries this store is open past the state-mandated closing time of 10:00 p.m. another convenience for black market sales we showed a compilation of our video to Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer any surprises to you no I know that there are lawful dispensaries operating in the city it might be that some of the locations you just showed me are under investigation right now how big of a problem is this it's a very significant problem and from a public health and safety standpoint it's especially crucial that buyers of cannabis only go to the licensed shops and yet we see a number of illegal dispensaries opening up because the profit motive is so significant an illegal store can rake in ten to twenty thousand dollars a day authorities say so far 151 illegal dispensaries have been shut down with more criminal prosecutions pending is this different or worse than going after the guy in the corner selling weed before legalization oh no it's it's qualitatively different the amounts of money at stake are much more significant for example turning off utilities is a routine tactic as seen in this video shot by a witness during a recent raid at this illegal store in East LA the location was permanently closed but just over half the stores reopen within a week according to police on weed maps we found listings for 229 illegal dispensaries the Los Angeles Police Department puts that number even higher at 259 but no one knows exactly how many are in business there are just 186 licensed dispensaries in LA weed maps was hit with a cease and desist letter from the state of California last year for aiding and abetting in violations of state cannabis laws because it allows unlicensed businesses to advertise weed maps told CNBC it provides patients and consumers with valuable information about all things cannabis and businesses can post their own listings the company says targeting online platforms won't solve the unlicensed dispensary problem in California the danger in these illegal stores is potentially unregulated products like these sold to unsuspecting customers illegal dispensaries are required to sell regulated products which are tested the City Attorney's Office has attacked the problem with a recent civil complaint seeking millions in damages from one illegal dispensary and we've alleged in our complaint that the product contained a toxin something that is used as a pesticide on golf courses this is exactly why legal store owners like Cameron Wald executive vice president of project cannabis is outraged at how bold the black market has become we're facing especially in California and in LA specifically an illicit market that is extremely strong we're outnumbered three to one illicit operator to legal operator so you know we have outrageous price compression that we have to see at our stores how much easier do you think it is to operate as an illegal dispensary compared to what you go through it's a lot easier they have no compliance standards they had no permitting process they had no documentation no no legal process that they had to go through so they're breaking the law potentially threatening the health of consumers and they're threatening your business correct and they're doing this in plain sight in plain sight an illegal dispensary Walt says can charge close to forty percent less than project cannabis which has four locations in LA and must pay cannabis excise and sales taxes well thank you none of the illegal dispensaries we visited responded to our request for comment which isn't a surprise to david welch an LA based attorney who represents the cannabis industry California is the largest market in the world just based on population and consumption rates they are unable to actually realize the profits that people anticipate they're going to make because you have such a large illegal market statewide California's Bureau of cannabis control has issued more than 3900 cease and desist letters to illegal dispensaries and delivery services compare that to a total of 939 legal retailers what you find are dispensaries are not being enforced against even when they're enforced against they simply go and they open up the next day because the penalties are so low it doesn't dissuade them from violating the law and as we found in all the dispensaries in which our cameras captured illegal activity it appears the boom in the black market in cannabis isn't going away anytime soon", "BvGBi78LFaI": "the five strongest THC strains of cannabis plant for 2020 if you know your th C's from UCB TS you will recognize the importance of high levels of THC in the strains of cannabis plant so what should you keep your eye out for in 2020 if you want a high concentration of THC in your cannabis the following is a list of the five most popular THC plants commonly grown at number five there is Girl Scout cookies which is probably one of the best strains of Californian marijuana plants available we also lightly seeds as they are feminized and plants should be ready to harvest within eight to nine weeks of germination you can expect a THC concentration of between 25 and 28 percent at number four there is wedding cake which is at a keen price for such a THC rich strain this plant will give you a great sativa hide and you will find that her little goes a very long way at number three Cali glue Auto joins the list with a more than healthy THC level of around 23 percent we also like this as it flowers within 60 to 70 days and can cope with wide temperature fluctuations it was a close call but at number 2 we have Bruce Banner with origins from Colorado it was registered at the u.s. Cannabis Cup with a THC level of 28% which was the highest at the time pride of place and storming in at number one comes hulk burry the alter ego of the incredible hulk with a THC level of 27% and slightly lower than Bruce Banner this took the coveted crown because of its fruit berry and hint of citrus aromas that makes it a little bit extra special what about you have you experienced a mind

don't forget to check out my instagram top smoker 420 on everything stay late peace out", "wVlIZkbdwF4": "[Applause] the morning of February 12th 2012 started off pretty normally in my busy medical office in Denver with phones ringing patient consultations pretty much business as usual and I was with a patient when my office manager Joyce knocked on my door that was unusual Joyce never knocked on my door when I was with a patient there's a call for you she said you handle it I said little irritated no this is a call you need to take she said that call would change my life and the lives of my patients from then on the woman on the phone was named Paige and she sounded desperate dr. Shackleford she said would you please see my five-year-old daughter Charlotte and my first thought was no I don't work with children and then Paige told me that Charlotte had been having seizures since she was six months old and she had been diagnosed with a rare genetic condition called dravet syndrome none of the medicines that had been prescribed for Charlotte had worked not one of 17 different prescription drugs and now they wanted to try a horse tranquilizer from Europe and then Paige said something that really stunned to me she said she had been reading that medical marijuana might be able to stop seizures and she said dr. Shackleford will you please recommend some so that we can try it for Charlotte and I was dumbfounded I how could I possibly rationalize recommending that a child use marijuana for any purpose and I was concerned that if I did it it might endanger my medical license but then Paige told me that Charlotte had had two cardiac arrests too at the age of five and it made me think of my daughter Vanessa who was swimming in the ocean and ice skating and eagerly looking forward to starting school when she was Charlotte's age and Charlotte had never experienced any of those things and she might never experience them because 73 percent of children with dravet syndrome who have uncontrolled seizures died before their 10th birthday and when I finished medical school I pledged to use all of my skills and all of my training to sustain life to care for the patient's I was privileged to take care of to the best of my ability to use all that training to cure when possible but to comfort always and so I knew that I had to see Charlotte and I wouldn't necessarily promise to recommend that she used marijuana but I would see her and a few days later Paige and Charlotte came to my office and in the two hours that Charlotte was there she had five seizures one in the parking lot two in the waiting room and two while I was examining her now imagine your child having seizures like this again 300 a week 3 an hour every hour of every day for five years now I had heard pretty much the same thing that Paige had that there was a compound in the marijuana plant called CBD or cannabidiol that might be able to control seizures there was one study on it published in 1980 and I just happened to have read that so CBD is remarkable unlike THC it doesn't get you high and I did not want for Charlotte to get high I also didn't want for her to smoke marijuana in fact I don't want anybody to smoke marijuana because oral dosing is much more effective and so I filled out the necessary paperwork so that Paige could go down to the dispensary and buy all of the high CBD low THC cannabis in Enver an ounce and a half for $800 and Paige gave it to an herbalist friend of hers in Colorado Springs who extracted it into an oil and then Paige very nervously put several drops of it in Charlotte's mouth and I was on pins and needles after this waiting to hear what had happened had it had it worked or had it been a dismal failure had the whole thing maybe been a huge mistake it was like waiting for the astronauts to land on the moon if you remember that and then finally when Paige did call me she said dr. Shackleford Charlotte has not had one single seizure for an entire week not one it's like a miracle and Paige was right it was a miracle for Charlotte but I had known long before I met Charlotte that medical cannabis could work wonders I knew it actually three years before because a patient of mine named Joan in an occupational medicine practice where I was working at the time had asked me to make it possible for her to use marijuana for pain and and I Joan was a remarkable patient but she had been injured in a work accident and was taking more than a hundred percocet tablets a month and the pain was still so bad that she couldn't do normal household chores even cook for her family and she was severely constipated and was worried about being addicted but she had read that marijuana might be helpful for chronic pain and she begged me to make it possible for her to do so so very reluctantly I filled out that paperwork so Joan Cattrall and Joan went out and got the medical cannabis now I say reluctantly because I know nothing about it I didn't know anything really about how to recommend cannabis and there was no medical research on it I couldn't find any articles on it in any of the medical journals that I was reading you see on that classically-trained very conservative physician I graduated from the University of Heidelberg School of Medicine where I did research as a medical student and then I did seven years of post-grad training at the Harvard Medical School where I was also a research fellow I don't usually recommend treatments that I don't understand and I want to know exactly how the drugs work but I didn't have access to any of that scientific data that I normally relied on when it came to medical marijuana what I did have was a desperate patient whose pain medicines weren't working very well and to my surprise and I have to say to my great relief it worked extremely well for Joan Joan was able to reduce the number of percocet she was taking from a hundred a month to fifty than the 20 and then she could stop taking it altogether it was really pretty remarkable now today just six years after I first met Charlotte there are lots more articles in the scientific literature on the medical uses of cannabis and on the more than a hundred different compounds found in the marijuana plant that are remarkable for their medical applicability let me give you an example researchers in California have found that cannabis is a particularly good treatment for pain and it is in fact the THC that is so powerful researchers in Israel learned that nearly half of the patients with Crohn's disease who use medical cannabis no longer have any symptoms of the disease at all and there are tantalizing early indications from from research on the plant that some of the compounds found in the marijuana plant may someday be used to treat cancer now a lot more research is necessary and marijuana is not a panacea or a cure-all but the medical community is now beginning to recognize that cannabis may play an important role in taking care of patients for whom conventional therapies aren't working very well and that is something that most of the 20,000 patients I've seen over the last nine years can attest to I had really no idea where that phone call would lead me six years ago when Paige called but I can say from a great deal of experience that miracles are pretty commonplace among patients for whom nothing else has worked nothing but medical cannabis this is not about pot this is about patients now you may be wondering about Charlotte and what happened this is Charlotte about a year after she first started using medical cannabis what Charlotte is saying here is ballerina ballerina you can see her dancing [Applause] and she's still doing very very well now next time you or someone you love is suffering from pain that's not responding to conventional treatments or has another medical tradition that might benefit from the use of cannabis think about medical cannabis think about the thousands of patients who have benefited from it and think about Charlotte at ballerina it changed her life and it just might change yours thank you you", "bohJmMsMMII": "scientists are investigating whether cbd a chemical compound from cannabis plants could fight inflammation in severe covid19 patients the cytokine storm is when the body's immune system attacks itself and it's been linked to the deadliest coven 19 cases people who are also in cannabis field are also trying to find the right strains for covet dr olga kovachuk is a cannabis researcher at the university of lethbridge in alberta canada she's part of a team who believe they have id'd some cannabis strains high in cbd that could help treat the inflammation that comes along with the cytokine storm of some coronavirus infections she says not every high cbd strain was effective though terpenes are important as well as other minor cannabinoids are also important another study from researchers in georgia found cbd reduced inflammation and protected lung tissues in coven 19 patients so far all of that cbd covered research has been done in models animals or replicated human tissue now to be clear scientists at nusey spoke with say this doesn't mean you should be planning a trip to the dispensary much more research is needed including clinical trials in humans like ones that might combine cbd with other antiviral treatments like rum desservier any antivirus therapy probably does like 90 percent of the job or 80 percent of the job or seventy percent of the job he may not doing hundred percent and what we're proposing maybe cbd can do what is left over with that dr sidha byrody is a researcher and pharmacology and experimental neuroscience professor at the university of nebraska medical center he says getting funding is among the challenges holding back cannabis research some labs are even raising their own money the fda just released guidance this week outlining how companies seeking approval of drugs that contain cannabis or its derivatives must follow the traditional drug review and approval process involving clinical trials the agency is still working on cbd specific rules lindsey thiess newsy denver", "EBLmGBlEnMY": "[Applause] [Music] what's the first image that pops into your head when someone mentions the word cannabis for a lot of people it could be this or maybe this and for those of you that are better at planning ahead maybe even this basically we're all thinking joints bongs and getting stoned but modern cannabis has become a lot more complex than that nowadays when we talk about cannabis we're no longer just talking about a plant we've broken that plant down into extracts compounds and building blocks with tremendous therapeutic potential as a result cannabis is starting to look a lot less like this and a lot more like this and that's actually great news for all of us because the new version of cannabis is a lot more exciting than the old one in fact cannabis has emerged into a modern-day superfood and if we can reset our image of this plant cannabis might actually become more important to your daily routine than coffee so let me tell you how cannabis became a regular part of my daily routine when I was in my early 20s I had a moment of what you could call youthful indiscretion that set my life down a very challenging path I applied for a job on Wall Street to make matters more complicated they hired me it was fast paced and high-stress and in certain situations that stress could become pretty overwhelming so I tried everything I could to manage my anxiety including prescription medications but those came with their own side effects on my mood and my energy levels so I searched for a different solution and it took years before I actually found one I stumbled upon a little-known can extract called CBD it toned down my stress levels but still allowed me to feel clear-headed and focused and suddenly I was back in control of my daily routine I felt confident and composed and relaxed and I just sort of felt like myself now before you all get the wrong impression let me clarify that CBD does not get you high that effect comes from a completely different chemical called THC and CBD does none of that you could take all the CBD in the world watch the entire Beatles Yellow Submarine movie and you're still not going to feel high and trust me on that one see CBD doesn't impair you instead it seems to have the opposite effect which sounds a little bit like magic until we dig into the science we all have a built-in system in our bodies that keeps our internal functions in balance despite imbalance in our external environment it's called the endocannabinoid system and it regulates things like stress mood and appetite think of it like the conductor of an orchestra when one piece starts acting out of rhythm for example an overactive stress response the endocannabinoid system can step in and smooth it out CBD happens to be one of the chemicals that supports the function of this system helping that conductor to maintain rhythm throughout the body in the brain and brain imaging studies have actually proven this through these studies we know that CBD can help to modulate activity in key brain regions involved in our stress response like the amygdala in other words CBD helps your brain to function in a more balanced state when stress level spike ok so why am I telling you about biological systems in brain activity well for one I paid a lot for a degree in neuroscience and I'd kind of like to get my money's worth the other reason is that this little-known cannabis chemical it's about to change the way we all think about our daily health it's made such a big impact on my daily routine that I now dedicate myself professionally to creating healthy CBD options for people that want to give it a shot and it's not just for people with extreme anxiety or panic attacks either CBT has this gentle calming effect on mood and stress levels similar to a meditation think of it like the volume knob on a stereo CBT doesn't shut the noise off entirely it just turns that dial down a little bit so you can hear the music and because of that it's being used to help people perform better in a wide range of daily stressful scenarios from interviews to networking people that used to have a drink to calm the nerves are now trying CBD instead it is even effective for public speaking [Laughter] [Applause] multiple studies have actually been done on the effects of CVD on public speaking and have found a significant reduction in stress and discomfort compared to a control group and the potential benefits of CVD you go way beyond stress management to because of the broad function of that endocannabinoid system CPD itself can have a wide range of benefits professional athletes are now ditching prescription pills and painkillers in place of CBD and insomnia acts are turning to CBD is a potential natural remedy for more restful sleep but before you go and toss out any prescription pills I should note this does not mean that CBD is going to cure your anxiety your insomnia or your arthritis there's no one-size-fits-all solution these things and for many people prescriptions will just be the best option but the implications for CVA are pretty fascinating particularly when you consider that we may have stumbled upon a natural remedy to common ailments that affect millions of people every single day better yet you don't have to ingest a handful of pills and supplements to get those results CBD is commonly infused into foods and beverages in a way that's healthy and convenient you can get everything from CBD waters and juices to CBD olive oil and hummus but before we all go run out of here and share a giant bowl of CBD hummus it's important to consider the risk factors is CBD actually safe and what happens if we take a lot of it these are all very good questions unfortunately we do have some answers reports currently indicate that daily dosages of CBD up to 1500 milligrams are well tolerated by the body which means they're safe and to put that number in perspective here's a graph that shows common CBD dosages and food products today versus what those reports deemed to be safe and you can see it's not even close you'd have to spend thousands of dollars every single day on CBD infused food even come close to those numbers the World Health Organization has also weighed in on this stating that CVD has a good safety profile and that no public health problems have been associated with CVD use even the FDA which sets the gold standard for safe food policy in our country seems to agree with all this just last year the FDA noted little indication that CBD has abuse potential or presents a significant risk to the public health even more remarkable CBD doesn't seem to be addicting either the FDA's data also found no evidence that CBD causes physical or psychic dependence so let's recap CBD comes from plants doesn't impair you safe for adults consumed and could help millions of people it's a pretty amazing discovery right I think we should all pop open a bottle of CBD champagne to celebrate well actually not so fast because we currently sit at a pivotal moment in the history of cannabis regulation one that will determine if when and how we're even allowed to purchase cannabinoids like CBD C as a country we don't like to change our canvass laws very often we've really only done it once before when we effectively made it illegal back in 1937 and since then cannabis has been vilified for its recreational use the idea that weed equals scary is so deeply rooted in our culture that it even affects the way we think about versions of this plant that have absolutely nothing to do with its recreational use like hemp so now after an 80 year failed experiment we're finally about to revisit the cannabis question and the decisions we make today will set the course of this industry for generations to come now this is obviously a ton of responsibility and it's very important that we get it right this time part of getting it right means doing more research setting the right market marketing standards right safety guidelines because as much as we know today there is still more work to be done and a lot of products on the Shelf today just don't hold up the right quality standards but we can't continue to put it off to kick the can down the road because the longer we delay our regulatory decisions the longer we deny access to a natural solution to common ailments that should be very treatable we need to move forward based on real science one step at a time now I'm talking you about CBD today because it happens to be a pretty great first step it's healthy its natural and we have a growing database of research to support its efficacy so how do we move forward on CBD regulation well first we all need to determine what it is there are a lot of people out there who will tell us that CBD should only be a prescription medication those people are called pharmaceutical companies and there and they're well aware that this industry is projected to be worth 22 billion dollars in a few short years but maybe we're a little skeptical of those motivations because if we removed the veil of cannabis stigma CP is nothing more than a natural plant ingredient with therapeutic potential it's really more like a superfood and fortunately we already have a pretty good blueprint for that thanks to America's all-time favorite functional food caffeine now I know it might seem strange for me to stand up here and to compare something from cannabis to an everyday item like caffeine but bear with me are they really all that different they both come from plants they're safe for adults to consume and we use them to improve our mood and our energy levels interestingly enough caffeine was once vilified too back in 1909 the United States government filed a federal lawsuit against coca-cola for marketing a product that contained caffeine which they deemed to be unsafe nowadays caffeine can be found in all sorts of products from food and beverages to cosmetics and even medication we ensure that caffeine products are safe and labeled properly and then we let people decide if they want it when they want it and how they want it and since I'm sure everyone here has had some form of caffeine today it's safe to say we're all pretty comfortable with that system we need to take the same step forward with cannabis because cannabinoids like CBD should be no more threatening than a cup of coffee and if we do it the right way this time we have an opportunity now to give millions of people access to something that could improve their work lives their social lives and their overall happiness but we need to take a step back first in order to move forward and toss aside those outdated stigmas because this plant is a lot more than just weed cannabis should be viewed as therapeutic so let's hit the reset button on our image of cannabis starting with a fresh look at CBD and if we can change our perspective on one aspect of this plan maybe we can take another look at the rest of it - thank you [Music] you", "BauIG0oJCDo": "thc and drug testing here's what you need to know let's not pussyfoot around the elephant in the room and it's a pretty big elephant in many countries the smoking of cannabis is illegal but the state of play seems to be changing and in time the laws may well change however here we are talking about today beyond legality there is also the question of being fit and capable for work there are a good number of companies who require staff to take random drug tests what we wanted to do here is to simply inform you how long thc can linger in your system and how for some it can pass through more quickly than others we should also point out that thc can remain in your body for up to 30 days after you have ingested cannabis especially if eaten as opposed to smoked beyond this and this is where forensic science comes in your hair will contain traces of cannabis that will remain for at least 90 days if there is a possibility that a drug test will include hair follicles our advice is to keep away from cannabis for a long time thus unexpectedly shaving your head prior to a very critical and rigorous interview might just give the game away first thing to note is that because thc is a lipid soluble overweight individuals will retain thc in their system for longer than their thinner companions worse still if you smoke cannabis don't go for heavy exercise just prior to any urine test as when fat is broken down thc is released into your system and will come out in your urine however before you think that going for a run might also get you stoned on that thc the levels are detectable but minuscule and have no psychotropic effect tests for thc are actually for the metabolite thc cooh or tetrahydrocannabinol carboxylic acid though that's a bit of a mouthful you should also be aware that thc can build up in your system over time so regular users are more likely to retain thc in their system for longer than newbies who have a relatively pristine metabolism light use would be up to three times a week medium use would be up to five times a week and heavy use would be seven times a week and chronic heavy use would be frequently every day for a urine test and as a rule of thumb light users should see traces of thc disappear after three days but heavy users will need up to 30 days plus if you have to undergo a saliva test then allow 3 days if you are a light user 7 days for a medium user and 15 days for a heavy user but again up to 30 days or even more if you are a chronic heavy user for a blood test the rule is up to two days for it to remain in the bloodstream but thc has been found in blood tests 25 days after smoking cannabis so unfortunately there is no definitive answer we'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter and of course if you enjoyed this video do like and subscribe so you too can become a cannabis expert", "9L7aVpstaLI": "hey what's up literally nothing what's up you want to get together a bunch of us are meeting up by the school later to do what you know just chill smoke or join or two come on man you know i don't place yeah you don't blaze yet just try it you know i'm super cool with you guys smoking weed like i don't mind at all i just don't know if i want to try it how do you know if you're gonna like it or not if you've never done it i'm sure i'd enjoy it you guys always look like you're having a good time but i know myself if i do it once it's probably gonna become a habit you know there's literally no risk to smoking weed no one's ever died overdosing on it yeah i've heard that but i don't know if it has no risk listen people in pain use it to help themselves if it's good for them how could it be bad for you i'm not kidding search it up if you want all right man maybe i don't know though no guarantees all right let me know either way though yeah i'll give you a call peace more and more tanks are beginning to consume marijuana as it becomes decriminalized or even legalized around the world but what is marijuana and what effects can it have on adolescents and young adults if you search up these topics online there are a variety of different claims being made that either exaggerates or understates the effects of marijuana on teens it can be difficult to know who to listen to but not to worry today we'll look at scientific studies to answer these questions for you welcome to demystifying medicine so what is marijuana marijuana is a drug derived from cannabis plants that is commonly used for psychoactive properties in other words marijuana can alter mental states and lead to intoxication and euphoria this effect is more commonly known as being high two important chemicals found in cannabis are tetrahydrocannabinol commonly known as thc or cannabidiol also known as cbd collectively there are known as cannabinoids thc is a psychoactive component of marijuana known for its ability to make you high cbd is more commonly known for its therapeutic uses and is the reason why medical marijuana can be used to treat a variety of different medical conditions medical cannabis products derived from cbd are commonly used for reducing pain inflammation and seizures marijuana can be used in a variety of different ways including smoking in the form of edibles or tea as well as in the form of an oil or extract which contains increased concentrations of thc [Music] whether you've used marijuana yourself or if you've seen movie characters spark up in late night comedies on netflix you probably already know the short-term effects of marijuana but what happens after the high has worn off recent studies have shown that over time adolescent cannabis users may experience a variety of different cognitive declines these include deficiencies in general executive functioning learning memory and motivation general executive functioning takes place in the very front of the brain it helps with planning and accomplishing tasks monitoring emotions and habits and plays an important role in working memory and attention this is also the slowest part of the brain to develop as it continues to mature up until the age of about 25 years old it was found that daily and weekly teenage cannabis users experience impairments in their general executive function compared to adults specifically in attention and working memory which is the ability to retain information over a short period of time teens were found to be more likely to crave marijuana after their high has worn off compared to adults which can lead to binge-like behaviors it has been suggested that the magnitude of impairment is greater in youth than adults for the functions of learning and memory studies have found differences in the way that certain parts of the brain work between teenage cannabis users and non-users these differences were found in parts of the brain that are believed to influence different types of learning and in parts that help form our cognition these differences however between teenage and adult users were most prominently seen among heavy users it has been implied that daily intoxication during young adulthood can impair the successful attainment of education and directly influences the level of income the heavy marijuana users can achieve for adolescents let's start using marijuana later and occasionally the risks are much lower marijuana may also impact motivation which helps us work on our goals and make our dreams into a reality it has been shown that heavy cannabis use during your teens can lower general motivation later in life across studies it seems as though factors that predict worthlin effects include usage and age of onset generally the earlier you start using and more frequently you use the worse the performance in cognitive functions and mental health throughout the video you may have heard phrases such as it is suggested and seems to indicate so why don't we have results that are conclusive and give us more of a clear answer this has a lot to do with current barriers to research and the limitations of studies being conducted in the united states it is illegal to conduct marijuana research under federal law this means that scientists must use chemical formulations that are not derived from cannabis plant as a substitute for marijuana this raises concerns as to how generalizable the study findings are to the real world even in areas where marijuana research is legal the exact amount of thc or cbd is not usually labeled correctly or clearly on marijuana products additionally there are also different strains of cannabis plants each with different potencies and profiles that play a huge role in how marijuana affects the body [Music] because of these limitations we should take the results of these studies with a grain of salt so what is the conclusion what is the effect of marijuana on teens well the answer is complicated only a few countries legalize marijuana research and the legalization of marijuana is still fairly recent so we need a lot more studies to be absolutely sure but based on what we don't know consistently using marijuana as a teen or adolescent may have serious implications when it comes to your cognitive functions so if you're going to use weed make sure that you assess these risks use it sparsely and safely [Music] do [Music] you", "n7cP6YWO_nc": "Hey guys, Nick with Precision here and\ntoday I'm gonna teach you a brief overview on how to make every extract\nunder the sun. So what I want to start off talking about is live resin and why\nlive resin is so relevant in the market and why you guys hear this this term\nbeing thrown around rather commonly. So live resin, the entire process really,\ntakes into account harvesting the plant while it's still technically \"alive\". So\nyou're harvesting the plant, you're not drying the plant, and what you're\nactually doing is taking those flowers and putting them into a vacuum type food\nsaver device and freezing them right away. So you can imagine like harvesting\nfresh blueberries or strawberries obviously you want to pick at the peak\nof ripeness, so that you have the maximum amount of terpenes, the maximum amount of smell, flavor and all the positive attributes of that plant. And you're\nactually freezing that in time by putting it into a freezer once you put\nit into the vacuum bag. Now it's very common for some people to deep freeze\nthat could be all the way down to -40C or -80C. I would say most commonly\nit's somewhere between -10C and -40C, so once we have this\nmaterial harvested and we have it frozen in vacuum bags - ultimately what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to extract it and we're going to extract it with\nhydrocarbons. The reason that we use hydrocarbons is because it's a very\ngentle process. The process of using hydrocarbons will actually take those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes out without disturbing a lot of the other\nplant-based matrices that are in there, and our result ultimately is a extract\nthat is very, very close to the native plant. So when you smell the extract of\nthe plant that we've extracted via a live resin process what will happen is\nyou'll actually smell the original orientation of that plant, it you'll have\nthose original flavors and they'll be extremely robust, extremely profound in\nthe way that you're actually smelling and almost tasting it when you consume\nthe product. Now the best analogy is if we keep that\nfreshness preserved we eliminate the oxidation, the degradation, and all the\nthings that can kind of take that \"fresh fruit\" so to speak or that \"fresh cannabis\"\nand turn it into rotten cannabis so to speak or rotten fruit. And that's\noxidation, that's degradation from the environment that could be disruption or\ndegradation from high temperature solvents. So with live resin were always\nfocused on preserving that natural state of the plant. We're focused on freezing\nthat biomass right away, and we're focused on ultimately extracting it at\nvery cold temperatures to retain our terpenes, to extract the cannabinoids in\na very gentle fashion, and ultimately to have a highly, highly desired end product\nthat's artisanal and a vast majority of consumers enjoy in terms of theirs their\nsatisfaction of consumption as well as their ability to just actually taste and\nsmell the product once it's been on the shelf for a while. So that's just an\noverview on live resin and the next thing I'd really like to talk about and\ngive you guys an overview on is shatter. So you may have seen shatter in the\nretail dispensaries and things like that and ultimately with shatter we're trying\nto get that end product from a sort of a plant-based entrapment of those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes to a glass-like finish. So it's very common at\nroom temperature for shatter you hit it and it'll shatter almost like a piece of\nglass. To get that consistency there's certain aspects of extraction, certain\nthings that you want to deal with. Shatter first and foremost is always\nmade with hydrocarbon, and the preparation of the biomass is almost\nalways under every circumstance dried very, very, very, very well almost to a\nfive percent or lower humidity. We want to avoid a lot of that water that would\nbe pulled out with the solvent, and we ultimately want to extract that product\nat a cold temperature in order to avoid a lot of the lipids and fat profiles\nthat you might create by extracting with a warmer temperature solvent. Hydrocarbon is obviously ideal for this because not only can we extract with hydrocarbon\ncold but it's hydrophobic so that the water is going to be separated very\neasily from the hydrocarbon, but in addition to that it's going to extract\nthat cannabinoid profile and it'll extract those terpenes with leaving\nbehind,  because of the cold temperature, a lot of those fats, waxes, and other\nadulterants that we don't want in our end product. So when making shatter are\nultimately extracting the dry biomass with the cold solvent we're going to\ntake that to a finishing process which is called vacuum oven purging. So once we\nhave our shatter and we want to vacuum oven purge it, what we do is we we spread\nthis out on vacuum oven trays and we go into a very low vacuum, very deep vacuum\nwith a mild temperature increase from atmospheric. So a temperature increase\ndepending on methodologies it ranges vary widely depending an operator but it\ncould be anywhere from 75 Fahrenheit to will say 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be\na common operational range, and we're always trying to get to a very deep\nvacuum we're talking about 28-29 inches of mercury - very, very deep in terms of\nbeing able to purge out those residual solvents. So not only do we have a\nsolvent free product but purging out the residual solvents and the terpenes is\nalso going to take away some of that some of that added viscosity and\nreally get that product to the point where it's like a glass-like consistency.\nAnd we commonly call those as they're coming out of the oven \"slabs\", sometimes\nthey look like Swiss cheese, sometimes they'll they'll be you know a perfect\nslab of glass, sometimes they'll flip over. And it can vary between a\ncomplete glass-like type consistency and it can also vary to you know sort of\nlike Jolly Rancher or warm Jolly Rancher type consistency - but the good part about\nthis process is to make shatter using hydrocarbon you can generally\nstill make a very good end product on biomass that's been properly dried\nproperly preserved even though it does have maybe a little bit of degradation\nit does have a little bit of oxidation of the cannabinoids and loss of the\nterpenes it's okay because you can still make a very very credible saleable\nproduct that's widely consumed in the form of shatter. And optimizing that\nprocess as a way that you can create a lot of revenue for your\nextraction company. So the next thing that I'd like to talk about is diamonds.\nTerp sauce. There's all sorts of crazy names, \"the sauce\" -  that they coined for\nthis type of extract and really what we're after on this type of extract is\nterpene preservation. So it starts off very much like a live resin\nprocess in the fact that we're harvesting these these buds or these\nflowers in a live state, we're freezing them, and we're ultimately preserving\nthose terpenes. Because terpenes are very volatile compounds in general. Too much\nheat they evaporate and they get degraded by heat, they get degraded by processes, they\nget degraded by solvent - so we want to use a very light solvent, like a light\nhydrocarbon, and in this case mostly moving towards a propane dominant blend. Propane has a much lower boiling point which means it's much more volatile in\nterms of removing it from the end product - easier to remove from the end\nproduct is another way to word that. So ultimately extracting this\nlive resin like prepared biomass with a propane dominant or a lighter\nhydrocarbon dominant blend at low temperatures and ultimately what we end\nup with is we end up with this extract that really becomes a sort of miscella of the cannabinoids but also a very amount high amount of terpene\ncontent. And as I stated before the terpenes are quite volatile and any sort\nof heat, any sort of degradation, even just being an atmosphere for too long\ncan degrade those terpenes. So imagine this kind of cannabinoid and terpenes\nsludge coming out of the machine because we've preserved them up to that point.\nImmediately usually what's done with sauce and live resin is you're taking\nthe terpenes and generally spinning them off in a classified centrifuge. The\nreason we use the classified centrifuge is because there's still a little bit of\nsolvent in there, so we just want to be cautious, but what that ultimately does\nis it spins off the terpenes and it separates a terpene layer from the\ncannabinoid layer. You separate those two now there's a variety of different\nproduction processes that go back into this. In some cases if you're if you're\ndoing crystallization you can leave a little bit of solvent in there and you\ncan ultimately recrystallize the THC-a through a supersaturation method.\nYou can ultimately take the cannabinoids off from that terpene fraction and\ndecarboxylate the cannabinoids and then add the terpenes back in - and that's how\nyou make live resin pens. So for example you know once that decarboxylated\ncannabinoid profile is there you take your original terpenes blend them back\nin and it's going to give you the viscosity in order for the pen or the\nvape cartridge to be able to uptake and atomized that extract. And make, again\nthis is an extract that is absolutely in line with the original orientation of\nthe plant, the original smells, flavors terpenes, and the uniqueness. It's very\ncool because you have such variety within these plants and to capture the\nnative essence of that plant and to reconstitute it and to several\nconsumable forms is a massive value add for an extraction business. And if you\nlook at some of the best extraction companies in the world that do this, this\nis exactly what they do and this is exactly how they do it. So on the flip\nside of what we've spoken about here which has mainly been artisanal\ntype extracts and hydrocarbon extracts. Let's talk about crude oil, let's talk\nabout distillate, let's talk about the high-value type extracts. So crude oil is\nexactly what it sounds if you think about crude oil coming out of the ground\nin like petrochemicals or something like that.\nIt's an oil that has a lot of adulterants in it. It needs a lot of\nrefinement. It needs to go through further processes in order to be\nconsumable or in a consumable form. So what we're looking for with crude oil\non an extraction is really any type of biomass but preferred dried biomass\nlow-grade biomass that can be purchased cheap and ultimately refined into\nsomething of high value. So if we've got for example you know a thousand pounds\nof biomass sitting it's been sitting for six months, we're not going to be able to\nmake really a credible shatter product out of that, we're not going to be able\nto make a credible live resin, definitely not going to be able to make any sort of\nhigh terpene extract or anything out of that. But what we can do is we can\nmaximize the extraction of the cannabinoids out of that biomass with a generally\nwarmer solvent - of course there's ways that you can do it with a cold solvent.\nAnd this can be done with hydrocarbon or ethanol. This is where ethanol becomes\nreally applicable it becomes really easy it becomes really user friendly and\ncost-conscious. And this is where you can still use hydrocarbon but not as\nefficient of a method as ethanol for bulk crude oil. So what we actually do is\nwe take our biomass we load it in and we'll saturate it with ethanol for\na given amount of time. Ultimately we take that miscella stream is what we\ncall it which is the cannabinoids and all the other stuff that comes out of\nthe plant along with the solvent and we evaporate that solvent off. Once that\nsolvents evaporated off ultimately we have our crude oil. Now this crude oil\nhas got all sorts of chlorophyll and whatever came along with the plant and\nany sort of adulterants in there. Generally it'll have a lot of fats, waxes,\nand lipids in there that generally come out of the plant in extraction. So\nthere's a variety of refinement processes. One of the most common\nprocesses to refine is to get to distillate and that's what I'd like to\nchat about next. So let's talk about guys how that distillate actually gets made.\nNow distillate is a process that's made through distillation so quite commonly\nor to break it down in really simple terms if you're putting a pot of water\non the stove and ultimately that water is boiling and turning into vapor - \nthat's a process of distillation. That water is being distilled into the\natmosphere in the form of vapors. So that's exactly what we're trying to do\nwith the cannabinoids in the crude oil. We're actually trying to take those\ncannabinoids, we're trying to vaporize them, and ultimately we're going to\nrecollect them in a more concentrated form. But before we can distill there's\nseveral other things we need to do. We need to make sure that there's no\nadulterants in that distillate or in that crude oil that are going to inhibit\nmaking the distillate. So those things can be waxes, they can be chlorophylls,\nthey can be fats, lipids, all sorts of weird stuff that can come over in a very\nrough crude extraction. The way that we refine that is we commonly\nuse winterization processes, we also commonly use fine filtration, there's\nguys that use what are called adsorbent - which could be diatomaceous earth or\nactivated carbons in order to clean up some of these undesirables from this\ncrude oil in order to make it into distillate. But ultimately once it's\npassed through a distillation process it's normally used a what's called a\nfractional distillation, or a wiped film distillation process when you're at\nscale. We're taking those cannabinoids and we're evaporating them and we're re-concentrating them. So what happens is we take this very, very poor quality\nbiomass, turn it into a really rough crude oil, but ultimately extract the\nwe'll call it \"the goodies\" - but the cannabinoids out of that crude oil and\nconcentrate them in a very refined format. That can be remixed in and\nreconstituted into several different products. This process is awesome because it can literally take any grade of biomass and turn it into a shelf-stable,\nreplicatable, scalable, repeatable product that has a consistency across the board\nfor end-users expectations. For example, you get Pepsi every time it tastes like\nPepsi every time you don't want it to taste like Coke one time or taste like\nyou know RC Cola the next time. You want consistency and a repeatable fashion for\nwhich to make your product. So last product that I want to talk about is\nisolates and isolates are made from actually in almost all cases distillate.\nSo we're taking this crude oil remember as we spoke about with distillate,\nrefining it into a distilled product. So we have this distilled product and the\npotency of that can be anywhere from say a little very low-end 75 percent on the very high-end 95 percent - but it's not 100% pure. And what\nwe're gonna do with that distillate is we're actually going to go through a\nsecondary refinement process called crystallization, isolation of\nthese individual cannabinoids. So each one of these cannabinoids has a\nmolecular structure and based upon what that molecular structure looks like we\ncan come up with ideal ways to actually crystallize and crash out of solution\nthese individual molecules. This is a very common process in chemistry. It's\nused very widely and it's ultimately how CBD isolate is made, it's ultimately how\nTHCA diamonds are made, it's a process of crystallization. So how we do that is\nwe use a selective solvent the selective solvent most often used is hydrocarbon.\nVery often it's either butane or pentane in order to make these isolates.\nAnd what happens is you actually take your distillate and you mix it into\neither the pentane or the butane if it's THCA depending on what you're trying to\ndo and you have your distillate or your fine cannabinoids back in matrices at\nthat point it's back in that now that miscella of hydrocarbon and\ncannabinoids. And what happens is over time and over a temperature ramp spike\ncurve and over a slow period of time these cannabinoids will start\nto actually crystallize. And they'll form one little crystal and it will grow upon\nitself. As we reduce the saturation of the solvent they actually fall out of\nsolution. So what will happen is you'll almost see like rock candy or crystal-like formation growing. Once those crystals are fully formed they can be\nharvested and once you optimize this process you actually have nearly 100%\npurity on any given compound. Now there can be adulterants you know that gets\nstuck on the crystals that need to be washed off but in ideal state this is\nsomething that you can refine up to say a good benchmark is 99 to 99.5 percent\nif you're a really good chemist you can get it up close to 99.7 to 99.9. This is where that last little bits very, very\nhard to get, but there is ways to do that. So if we look at you know the the world\nof cannabinoids in conclusion. There's several different ways to make extracts.\nThere's a lot of different ways to make very, very viable market products. There's\na lot of ways to drive revenue in your extraction business with these products.\nUnderstanding this knowledge base and understanding how you're going to occupy\neach one of these market niches, what access to biomass you have, what\ndiversity and methodology do you have in order to create these products and\nultimately drive diversity and revenue in your in your business. And then really\ntaking that to the next step and taking the next level of understanding of how\nto create these products. That's something that we do here all day long\nat Precision. We absolutely understand all these processes very intimately. We\nhave a very robust team of install / integrators that\noptimize these processes, so again not just selling you the pieces of equipment\nbut actually coming out training you on these processes, sitting there with the\npieces of equipment with you in order to get these processes integrated until\nyour business is up and running and on legs.\nSo in conclusion, a tremendous opportunity ,I hope

we got to get a lot of this juice out of here right so we're just pouring that in there for now I've been smoking way too much weed all right and the good thing about this is the fact the lake you could save this juice for later you have like fresh mixer for your vodka when you want to go ahead and have some drinks always have paper towels on exact this is the essence of life things get messy sometime you know I'm saying and next up we're gonna go ahead and cut up a lemon I'm only gonna use half of it because the strange that we're using is lemon curd and also I just don't like to add too much citrus to milk it's good to have cattle milk already made and thankfully already have some like that's in the fridge ready so that we can use for our process now always use very cold milk when you're gonna go ahead and combine it with fruits can you pass me the can of milk thank you so much so we just need 1 cup of canned milk and then I'm gonna go ahead and put my watermelon pulp in the bowl this is has a couple seeds unfortunately for this fine you split them up add a little tiny bit of honey for flavor as well I'm gonna shake it up so you're gonna pour it into the mold we got some chunks in there it's gonna be a textured treat all right so the go ahead and cover up your popsicles and then the next step is obviously to go ahead and put them in a freezer and let them freeze for as long as ICS and tentacles freeze right I already had a couple of them in the freezer so let me present to you my little pop baby look at this water bellicose pop I know I got married in here so I know this is gonna be potent it's gonna be potent baby unless it tastes good Wow this was awesome hey baby can we say ding ding ding ding", "z7rJd1mXAWY": "it says a light spectrometer in it and what it does is it sends a bunch of light waves up and down through the cannabis and it tests the frequency that it bounces back through the thc uh and then compares that against known samples registered by the state uh both in washington uh oregon and california so it's accurate within one percent up or down um but it's circumnavigated so you don't you don't get to circumnavigate the state test but it does give you a really accurate uh understanding of what your thc level is as well as your cbd um plus or minus and the nice thing is you really only need like 0.2 at most uh to test with so you're not you know throwing a couple of grams so at the end it doesn't it doesn't get you like away from your state test but what it does do uh it gives you a really great opportunity to phenom hunt well before you send it off to a laboratory so if you're you know growing for yourself you it's pain in the ass to send it to a lab on its own uh if you are you know a cannabis company then every time you're phenomenal you're sending what 10 tests at 100 250 bucks a piece yeah you're saving yourself a little yeah you're selling yourself a little bit of money at the end of the day you know i've i've had this for now what a year and a half i use it like three or four times a week um and i've had zero issues as far as using it besides like your general connectivity like if you're in a hotel room and sometimes your wi-fi sucks so wait a second it's just the bot what what does this connect to where it works so this is this is plugged in this is just charging also micro usb charger i just plugged in the wall because it's dead because i smoke weed and sometimes i forget to charge my [ __ ] if i'm just being honest if we're being honest about it so you just grind yeah you grind up like 0.2 uh you go to your phone you download a uh application the purple pro application uh i'm gonna measure measure now i'm gonna wait a little while no that's crazy this this used to be done with like computers and yeah this this used to be done in like a lab situation so uh your miracle whip tested at 19 thc and greater than two percent or greater than two percent cbd is that good that's great i mean 19 my opinion is phenomenal uh i don't see any reason why people are buying into the misnomer that like your cannabis needs to be 22 23 27 like at the end of the day the terpene profile on cannabis like this and not understanding the endocannabinoid system to any real major uh level i mean no one can really say that they do who's to say that thc is the only uh vehicle to getting you the medicinal benefits from cannabis let alone the recreational so well that ignore terpenes would be to ignore the vast majority of the plant there's thc thca uh you know and then cbds a few cbn cbgs but it's mostly terpenes and plants so but is the two percent cbd is that considered good discussions are great especially if you have uh if you're looking at a focus of thc and not cbd um if you're growing a hemp plant you're gonna see you know larger five percent to nine percent even twelve percent uh cbd uh or greater than but that's for a implant you're you know when you're looking at thc uh and the response to the endocannabinoid system and what we understand about it is literally cbd counteracts thc so if you're looking for thc you're probably looking to have a lower cbd content unless you're pushing for the you know holistic side of it but recreational weed less cbd more thc okay according to you know the current myth of what is you know cannabis awesome so that's that's the uh the miracle with your favorite yeah no that's fire i absolutely love this miracle whip this this is really impressive no i'm gonna actually delve into this miracle whip later on this year i'll definitely get you a cut um that'd be huge that would be good this this is the wedding cake the wedding cake yeah certainly clean this off so at least we get like a clean test that's not all right so after you're done with with the yeah when you're done you can discard it it's still usable cannabis all you did was run it through a grinder so just kind of clean it out and i used a microfiber towel just because like in the day you know with to try to be as scientific as you can in a hotel room so i said again you you really need very little damage to this you know dance it's probably well more than i actually need but we'll see she doesn't want to go down my grinder it's not the first day that i ground that weed so we'll get this worked out yeah this is actually one of my one of my personal favorites it should be enough if not we'll grind up a little bit more yeah actually when i broke that down fingers are super sticky it smells better than it did just straight out of the drawer to me it smells like like like a lemon so yeah 23 thc yeah it's it's definitely got that like limonene uh back end to it no i really like that and like i said that's 23 thc so and still two percent are the two percent greater than yeah and it we could go big we could go uh you know a little more in depth on that i've got to update uh the tester but yeah 23 cbd for you know you what you're doing that's phenomenal again it's very little bit very little cannabis that you actually have to test so what is up next that is fire this whole hotel room this is not a purple punch yeah yeah let's test that this this purple punch man like honestly i and again i was when you when you said like you had a joint of it and you're like here man and i was really trepidatious about it but just just because i i just don't have a great experience with purple punch in in the past but this uh itself like the bud structure is [ __ ] phenomenal it doesn't have those weird ass spindly leaves uh it's it's fire like i when i first when i first tasted i didn't actually even see the the buds i just saw the uh the joint and i was like man this this tastes really good for purple punch yoga told me it was like i don't know banana hammock and i've been like yeah this tastes great dude but then you said it was purple punch and i was like [ __ ] i don't like purple punch traditionally but you know i do like to concentrate i did say that once it comes to the concentrate it is really good but as far as the flour is concerned i i've never been super impressed but this this does have this does have uh this has like bag of peel nose appeal i'd buy this without having to smell it you could look at it until it was just [ __ ] fire you go oh man that's fine yeah no i have heard a lot of things about the the purple punch and it being a strain that got passed around a lot but then again not everybody also had the right cut of purple punch so that that could be that that very well could be it yeah you know that i was i i found purple punch i think the first time that i saw it was that vhhc in vallejo california not that that's a shout out to him i'm just being you know very honest about it and then i saw it a few times at cloud sesh i picked some of it up um uh a girl that i date her dad really really likes it um but i just wasn't super impressed by it um except for in the concentrate except for the concentrate um and so at the end of the day this this has probably been one of like the more fire cuts i've seen looks like a [ __ ] mess over here this is a this is like a real demo at a real like place i would be ashamed of myself so let's run this no i said and i you know i really appreciate the opportunity to run this thing oh no i think that this is fire and you know if you got 20 19 let's do a new measurement so we've done two in a row and had really great results so you hold your breath on the third holy crap there's a dead that hurts pin dropping here man so 17 and so like i said man 17 every everyone's always telling me like i really want this like 27 percent thc definitely no the taste is is definitely worth it yeah absolutely it's not gonna taste like hash it's not gonna just taste like some some [ __ ] like this tastes like somebody actually cared about what they were doing they're like i'm very interested in this plant let's see what i can do with it and got the most out of it some you know i guess maybe it's when you produce it for for production for out value as opposed to like you know really a connoisseur uh style of growing then then maybe you stray away from it this is really good i'm i'm also really blown away by this both of these both of these the miracles like the miracle whip the miracle whip is crazy this is we have uh we have another test here we have this the lotto this this will probably be like the lesser thc out of uh out of the whole bunch i believe okay okay yeah i thought i always thought the wedding king did have a higher potency just because when i smoke it it has that that hit yeah but that's i'm that's where like you like i said we've we've been lied to and i'm not going to call anybody out by name i'm not going to be like hey guys this is your fault but there's some like these big name hitters there's these big these big grow for these big grow houses that grow exotic cannabis that are like hey man uh my shit's 28 plus percent thc and i'm just like yeah i that's phenomenal great you've really exploited the fact that you can produce thc but what's it taste like yeah how high does it really get you like am i am i again going to be high for 30 minutes where i'm going to be running back to you know hit this again it's it's so so the the argument is is there again like i said i and again don't don't take me for a fact i'm i'm speaking specifically in hyperbole i'm a [ __ ] [ __ ] i i don't know what the hell i'm talking about i'm a [ __ ] all the time but that's that's why i firmly believe from a guy that like i was buying weed back when like you know it was still a felony in california and then turn around and selling it like we had to trust our nose there wasn't you know you kind of go and use a thc tester uh let's pull from the bottom let's let's give this the worst chance possible just because i feel like [ __ ] even that i don't know yeah it still smells like some fire just a lot of smells like some absolute fire you don't need much to test we'll pull this from the bottom this is probably this is probably the worst opportunity to give it i feel bad now i'm like damn damn damn glass i didn't mean to do you like this but i got you it'll be fine i preface this again with like thc uh production like i said if you're if you're up above 16 percent you're dealing with uh some doty measurement yeah no i'm definitely happy with the results especially that that wedding cake i would have never expected it to be that good i mean no but that's like i said that that plays into this misnomer that like everyone's talking about we have to have to see seventeen people wow so i went to what was it in december before covid before the world shut the [ __ ] down we were down in vegas and uh we we ran this tester and i had some stuff that came in 16 and then sitting right next to it had some stuff that was 28 both of them look fantastic you couldn't really tell the difference between one or the other uh we rolled both of them up and i didn't tell anybody what it was and i was like which one did which one do you did you like more and it wasn't like i went here smoked this one here so this one night one i was like here smoke this it was the first smoke after the convention they're like yeah that was good i gave him the other one i'm like yeah that was good and then i asked him which one was better they're like well night one i was like well that was 16 yeah it was 28 the night the first night you could you could lend it to being in vegas or you could lend it to whatever but like i do this [ __ ] regular my guys what's your weed like i have a [ __ ] i have a weed tester man yeah legitimately i can put anywhere in my car so i like to run around i'm like is your [ __ ] good or is your [ __ ] not good and more often than not the more interesting more compelling uh cannabis i find 16 to 22 you get over 22 percent and it's just like yeah you're getting high but you i feel like you start to lure us on terpenes i feel like you lose out on that flavor i feel like this it it's it's it's a real fast up and then it's a real quick down and it has you looking to smoke more weed where like something between 16 22 that that's the world to live in that's real connoisseur weed the", "hOybxMsJIkk": "welcome back in this video we're going to be taking a look at different cannabis etfs so we're going to be taking a look at six of the largest cannabis etfs the reason why it was so important for me to make this video is because the quality of these etfs varies very significantly so unlike other sectors where you can buy different etfs and have relatively similar performance in cannabis you can buy one etf and do very very well and then buy another and do very poorly so we're going to take a look at all the different etfs within the space so the six etfs that we'll be reviewing here today will be mj we'll be looking at msos we'll be looking at yolo hmmj and thcx so without further ado let's hop into this and what we'll be looking at with these companies we're going to take a look if they're actively managed or if they track an index uh we're going to take a look at the management expense ratio how much you're actually paying to hold the etfs we're going to take a look at how much each fund has under management and most importantly this is what we'll be mainly focusing on is the holdings in the fund i don't mind paying a higher fee if the holdings are higher quality so ultimately that's going to be the determining factor of how these funds rank and as always i'm not a financial advisor this is not financial advice this is made to be entertaining purposes only so to start it off might as well go in alphabetical order here starting off we have hmmj management expense ratio of 0.86 with assets under management of 684 million fun fact this was actually the first cannabis etf ever launched uh so what we're going to be looking at here we're not going to be looking at uh if the fund is tradable or the short-term opportunities we're really going to be focusing in on the long-term sustainability of these funds we're going to be taking a look at the actual fundamentals of the underlying holdings within these funds so because hmmj is listed on the toronto stock exchange it actually limits them from owning companies that operate in the u.s but we will still look at this objectively for what it is which is a canadian fund so starting off with their largest holding canopy growth definitely the best canadian operator seemingly the only canadian operator with a meaningful strategy to enter the states uh through acreage and terrace end so without a question the best canadian operator in my opinion uh aphria not super crazy about afria not a terrible operator either uh i'm kind of neutral on afria kronos only thing holding this company together seemingly is the ultria partnership other than that company doesn't seem like it has too much going for them uh gw pharma definitely a great company no complaints there same with iipr big fan of that company these are gw pharma is more of a research related company and ipr is a reit in the states uh that is listed on the new york stock exchange uh scott's miracle grow not really a cannabis company more of a fort fertilizer company only one third of the revenues actually come from cannabis then we have tilray which is merging with aphria village farms probably one of the highest quality cannabis operators as well and then everything under that is relatively small holdings just looking through it we have aurora hexo organogram sundial none of these am i too crazy about um so those definitely take away from the fun but the top holdings are all looking all right as far as canadian operators go next up we have hmus listed on the neo exchange that's when you don't hear too often this is also managed by horizon management expense ratio higher at one percent so now on the flip side from hmm j's uh fund uh hmus is actually 100 in the states so this one i am a much bigger fan of if you're looking at the holdings uh they own some great multi-state operators you have columbia care green thumb true leaf cresco cure leaf paris and jucie all of these names i am a big fan of uh charlotte's web i'm so so on acreage as well uh tuscan holdings is a spack as far as i'm uh aware uh you have air and liberty which are going to merge hopefully within the next uh within the next quarter uh but just looking through the holdings here everything looks fine i'm not seeing anything that sticks out as a really bad holding other than med men at a very low weighting of 0.75 so overall this is a great uh fund only thing that i'm not crazy about here is that it is uh traded on the neo uh so definitely a lot less liquidity than some of the funds that would be listed on the toronto stock exchange or on the new york stock exchange so now next up we have mj for some reason this is the largest cannabis etf in the world assets under management of nearly 1.8 billion with a management expense ratio of 0.75 percent so aside from hmmj which i feel did a great job building a canadian portfolio uh mj we'll take a look at their holdings here uh so you have aphro tilray as a quarter of the whole portfolio not sure why they would have that above canopy grove but they have that as the top holding then we have gw farm growgen that's all fine and then that this is where we run into a hiccup we have chronos aurora hexo and organogram as relatively large positions in the portfolio which i'm not too crazy about now to take a look at msos managed by advisor shares this one currently has assets under management of 684 million which has ballooned since they initially launched with a management expense ratio of 0.75 now if we look at msos's holdings it's actually very similar to what i have as my top 10 cannabis stocks for 2021. i'll actually link that video down below so you can take a look but this is very similar to what i have here so this portfolio is a hundred percent listed in the states and it's quality so you have green thumb cure leaf true leaf and cresco as the big four those are forty percent of the portfolio and then you have all your tier two names that you'd want uh so you have ayer you have tara send columbia care harvest health and juicy then you have the ancillary place as well grow gen and ipr this portfolio is great this is pretty well everything that you'd want i think i couldn't have done a better job allocating this myself and next up we have thcx this is actually the smallest one on this list with assets under management of 126 million and a management expense ratio of 0.95 uh so same thing here they actually have their top holdings as the afria tilray combo uh then you have grogen canopy growth village farms and gw farm which is definitely a fine uh those are all fine names uh but then here's the thing again you have um you have organogram you have aurora you have hexo you have supreme down there so this one's a little bit more spread out it's less concentrated towards the top and it has it's more spread out again uh among some of the uh smaller cap names which are lower quality which i'm not too crazy about and then finally we have yolo also managed by advisor shares an actively managed etf uh this one has assets under management of 367 million and a management expense ratio of 0.75 percent now this one here is a hybrid of both canada and u.s companies uh the thing with this one here is it seems like their weightings are just upside down uh so you have the kind of top names in canada you have vff you have uh gw farm you have aphrya cgc grojan these are all fine names but then the thing is is after these names then you have cure leaf you have harvest health ahead of true leave and then you have cure leaf columbia care cresco labs so it just seems like the waiting on this is a little bit backwards so if we were to rank these etfs from best to worse the way i would rank them is the us names at the top so you would have ms os as the best hmus as number two then the hybrid play which is yolo as number three uh then i would put the best canadian etf which is hmmj as fourth then thc x and then mj so that's my list again not financial advice this is strictly my opinion overall i'm a much bigger fan of the u.s market over the canadian just because you have 10 times the addressable market overall much bigger fan of the fundamentals in the states the canadian names could do better over shorter periods of time sometimes you see short-term outperformance but usually it's just based off of trades and hypes us really delivers the long-term fundamental value the youtube algorithm absolutely hates me so if this provides any value to you at all please consider liking commenting and subscribing so i can fight this youtube algorithm and get to a wider audience but overall thank you so much for watching very much appreciate it and have a great week you", "NcLRkw4ebEc": "THEIR THEIR RECIPES.

in first aid we'll start off with phenylalanine which is also known as PCP and the common street names are AMP ozone and rocket fuel it is extracted from analgesic plant and the mechanism faction is pretty simple who works in antagonizing the NMDA receptor the important side effects is strong analgesia violence hypertension and sometimes psychosis we remove the effects with benzodiazepines and antipsychotics next we have allergic as a die of elamite or LSD for short commonly known as acid Zen or boomer works by antagonizing the d2 receptor the important effects is hallucination depersonalization or derealization and sometimes psychosis next we have MDMA which is commonly known as ecstasy Molly or vitamin X works by releasing serotonin norepinephrine and dopamine it causes this inhibition with hyperactivity hypertension hyponatremia and importantly Surgenor syndrome next we have cannabinoids which is also known as weed pot or dope works by altering neurotransmitters released in various parts of the brain especially in the limbic system hence the feeling of slow time the important side effects include conduct travel injection which is important for diagnosis appetite stimulation impaired judgement and dry mouth alright guys that's everything I've got before I made this easier for you and see you guys later [Music]", "V3FF3u0jfRk": "study presented at the November meeting in the American Heart Association grab media headlines before the meeting even started sources like WebMD would have you believing that smoking pot drastically increases your risk of stroke let's see what sources like healthcare triage think about that too the research the study we're talking about today published in the journal stroke reports that marijuana users between 18 and 44 years of age have significantly higher odds of having a stroke than non users using data from a national survey collected by the CDC the authors concluded that recent marijuana users were 82 percent more likely to have a stroke while the risk of more frequent users defined as those smoking 10 or more days per month went up to almost a hundred fifty percent come on a lot of people smoke pot if those between the ages of 18 and 44 were really a grave danger of stroke don't you think we'd be seeing a lot more strokes in this age group feels like I've mentioned relative versus absolute risk you know once or twice but here I go again 80 to 150 percent are the relative risks and since absolute risk is way more applicable in real life that's what we should talk about relatively risky over on Twitter took the time to figure this out for a lot of studies sensationalizing the news including this one and according to his calculations the absolute risk increase of stroke for frequent pot smokers is point five percent zero point five percent we've covered what we know about marijuana use before we did not specifically mention stroke risk in those videos mostly because there's not much evidence to justify it there just aren't a lot of non case control studies focusing on stroke and marijuana use the few that do exist suffer from the same problems mentioned here along with the fact that it can be pretty hard to get honest self reporting of marijuana consumption which is what all these surveys rely on and finally the studies that do exist contradict each other some studies like this one report an association between marijuana use and stroke another study analyzing only male data reported no association between those two factors the current study reported higher use for frequent marijuana users that also reported cigarettes and as the author's point out in their discussion other studies do not report an association between marijuana and stroke once cigarette and alcohol use have been adjusted for so all we can do for now is remind you of what we've said before the level of harm currently associated with marijuana is much less scary than that of other things like cigarettes or alcohol it's likely real meaning greater than zero so take that into account but don't panic we can always use more data especially with changing marijuana laws and more and more people use it and we'd probably need it to be better data especially for it to be newsworthy hey did you like this episode you might enjoy this other episode where we go through all of the harms of

helping you guys build better futures for yourselves so in today's video what i want to focus on though is marijuana withdrawal this video is by popular request and i want to try and paint a timeline for you guys and what it is you can expect when you're going through weed or thc withdrawal symptoms how to navigate those symptoms and how to get through them now i created the same type of video what that relates to vaping and nicotine withdrawal i put the links in the description so be sure to check out the description in this video because i put the links in there for nicotine and vaping withdrawal symptoms and a timeline for that so let's start by talking about the first 72 hours of quitting marijuana or quitting smoking weed okay and before i do that i actually want to make a quick disclaimer quitting black market thc cartridges is very very different from quitting high concentration thc medical cartridges which is very very different from quitting your regular day-to-day herb that's of high quality and not tainted with a bunch of junk in it so you have your black market cart withdrawals you have your high concentration thc product withdrawals which can include medical grade dispensary carts and then you have your day-to-day herb and the withdrawals across the board for those are going to look different on black market being the worst i then think the high concentration thc cartridges giving you more withdrawals than your day-to-day herb which is a bit more balanced out with some of the other endocannabinoids found in the plant or phytocannabinoids found in the plant my second disclaimer is not everyone is going to experience thc withdrawal or marijuana withdrawal some people are able to quit they can flip-flop on and off of the plant like it's nothing some people really really struggle with thc dependence in thc withdrawal if you don't believe me pause this video go check out cj the kid check out his account on marijuana withdrawal he was uh uh he's used multiple different types of substances and drugs and he rated his experience with marijuana up there with some of the other harsh substances so just just something to check out at cj the kid okay now let's jump right into it one of the most common questions i get asked when it comes to marijuana withdrawal or quitting smoking weed is the insomnia that's usually one of the first symptoms you're going to experience in the first 72 hours of quitting and i like to tell people right off the bat don't make a big deal about the insomnia you have to stop stressing over the insomnia because eventually your bra your body is going to allow you to sleep and that's my first piece of advice when it comes to insomnia when your body does give you the opportunity to sleep take it if it's during the middle of the day if you have to leave work and go take a nap in your car if you gotta skip school for a day or two because you need to sleep do it let your body heal you're sick you're going through a detox process take a sick day because eventually your body's gonna demand that you rest and a lot of people stress really intensely over that insomnia and it's not necessary because it's going to pass one of the most common mistakes i see people make or at least i would not advise doing it if it worked for you that's fine is they start to quit weed they're struggling with insomnia so they start taking melatonin they start hitting melatonin vapes don't do this leave the bottom drill at home leave the bottom drill on the counter did don't go to your doctor and get a script for ambient or xanax we're trying to detox your body from drugs not add more substances into your body your body's detoxing and it's healing and it's trying to restore its natural circadian rhythm something you have to realize about marijuana every time you smoke especially the higher concentration products you're impacting your body's endocannabinoid system if you don't know what that is i put a i wrote it out below google it after this video this system regulates your sleep it regulates your mood it regulates your appetite it regulates your bone growth it regulates your hormone production it regulates all types of things so it makes sense that when you quit using marijuana something that dramatically impacts your endocannabinoid system that you're gonna run into some problems some physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms so again let your body heal naturally don't take stuff for the insomnia just get through it it usually passes within the first week or so and i can almost guarantee you once it passes you're probably going to start to experience much better quality sleep than you were ever experiencing while you were using marijuana and the reason for that is because marijuana prevents your body from entering a deep state of sleep or rem sleep that's why you usually don't dream when you smoke a lot and that's why you experience very vivid dreams as you start to get your body back into that state of rem sleep or deep sleep when you stop using marijuana so that's another thing you can look forward to is the really intense really vivid dreams for the first few nights of marijuana detox or thc withdrawal or you know the first 72 hours of quitting weed so that's thing number one insomnia don't make a big deal about it major problem number two that most people experience in the first three to five days is appetite changes i remember when i first quit i really couldn't eat first thing in the morning i woke up i was always kind of nauseous borderline felt like i was going to throw up in the morning which warning could be a symptom of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome this is where you smoke a lot of weed you're constantly vomiting you're losing a bunch of weight you're having muscle pain and joint pain no one knows exactly what it is that's wrong hot showers seem to help this could be cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome chances are your doctor in the hospital they don't know what it is um different topic i put a video link above on that check that out if that's what you're struggling with whole different topic but anyways my appetite i didn't have much of an appetite so i found that i could really only eat one to two meals a day generally speaking when it came to marijuana withdrawal or weed withdrawal i would really focus on healthy foods and plain foods i was a plain jane when it came to my appetite selection chicken and rice cheeseburger and french fries no ketchup no mustard no sauces plain jane plain jane i tried to focus on eating healthier foods i avoided sugars i avoided caffeine those things really seemed to trigger me when i was quitting marijuana i also avoided alcohol for two reasons reason number one when i first started quitting marijuana i found that i was using alcohol to try and help me sleep at night that was a really bad idea because alcohol just messes up your sleep even more it might put you in a state of wipes light sleep but it prevents you from entering a state of deep sleep so i gave up caffeine i gave up alcohol i gave up sugar when i was quitting i mean like i had none i would just drink hot lemon water or herbal tea which is naturally decaffeinated tea it's naturally caffeine free rattler i avoided all those things and i focused on drinking a lot of water two meals a day my first meal would usually be at two in the afternoon or seven o'clock p.m in the evening i really couldn't stomach anything earlier and give your body the foods that it craves listen to your body of course if you're eating like listen most people who quit marijuana crave exactly what i'm talking about plain foods simple foods i also did things like drink bone broth and i also did protein shakes um those were a big help i was a big fan of sun butter peanut butter almond butter i was really big into the nut butters i ate a lot of pickles and i drank a lot of water that was pretty much my diet when i quit smoking weed one to two meals a day plain jane meals no sugar no caffeine no alcohol a bunch of nut butters in between and that was really it pickles that was really it so appetite changes listen your appetite is eventually going to normalize um usually i'd say after about the first month to two months you'll start to notice your appetite coming back exercise is often discussed and again at cj the kid mentioned this and he said something that really resonated with me he said the only exercise his body could tolerate when he first started to quit was swimming and i was actually in a very similar boat one of the few things i could do without having like excruciating muscle and joint pain when i first quit smoking was swimming and it makes sense because i think your body's pain perception is so thrown off when you first quit thc because what it does to your endocannabinoid system doing any type of like weightlifting or really physical stuff might actually hurt and cause you a lot of pain so if exercise is going to be part of your detoxing process i would recommend sticking to something that's very low impact very gentle on your joints maybe you're doing yoga maybe you're doing swimming maybe you're doing pilates maybe you're just taking a walk for 20 to 30 minutes each and every day during the initial phase of your detox process so i agree with cj the kid be careful when you're quitting weed because hey it might be uh jumping into exercise all gun hoe which i'm a big fan of might be a problem for you might be a problem for you what else is real important your support network during this timeline of quitting marijuana during the first three days especially which is where it's most challenging make sure you have a good support network i understand a lot of people they do they quit on their own just solo they wake up one day and they quit but if you have some friends you have some family that you can trust you know use that support network and rely on it because you're probably going to need it when you're experiencing some of those mood changes in the first few days i know for me my anxiety initially increased a little bit i was a little more depressed as well too when i first quit but long term after the first two weeks after the first month i had way less anxiety than i had ever had before and i had way less depression than i had ever had before i'll tell you when i was getting really heavy into smoking i was starting to get panic attacks i'm not the type of guy that gets panic attacks i had never experienced something like that before horrible feeling um and really i it's weird because i was smoking to help me with the anxiety but i was blinded to the fact that the anxiety was actually getting a million times worse because the only anxiety that smoking at this point in my life was relieving was the anxiety from the craving to want to smoke more weed just like the anxiety that you get from a cigarette right it's not actually relieving the anxiety that you're experiencing it's just taking the edge off of that craving that you have for nicotine so my anxiety was getting way worse and i was probably trashing my endocannabinoid system from all the weed i was smoking too in all the different forms so not shocking that i felt much better after i quit how long did it take for me to feel better after quitting weed i would say total probably about three months i really started to feel myself again and remember weed unlike nicotine can stay in your system thc can stay in there for up to i think it is about three months depending on the amount of fat in your body and remember too for those of you guys that start like exercising right away and doing like crash dieting to detox from weed yes that's an option but remember is that fat uh like decreases and drops from your body those fat stores are going to actually release thc into your system so don't be surprised if you feel a little bit funky in those first few days in that first month of quitting especially if you are dropping body weight and exercising and eating healthier because your body is going to be releasing those that thc from those fat stores so i would say about three months now black market carts i'm gonna make a separate video on that because when i was quitting black market carts the the marijuana withdrawals the thc withdrawal it was on another level the the depersonalization the manic behavior the mood swing i mean that was a whole different story now again not everyone is going to experience these withdrawals i hope you guys found value in this quick recap when it comes to marijuana withdrawal the first three days are going to be the worst if you can get through the first three months you're probably going to be golden don't stress over the insomnia feed your body the foods that it craves probably going to be in a quantity of one to two meals a day exercise but be gentle on your body in the beginning because for that first month exercise might be a little bit dicey i would highly recommend cutting out nicotine caffeine and booze during your quitting process and try your best to use your support groups if you're feeling depressed if you're feeling scared if you're feeling sad the last thing i want to happen to you is to go to your doctor and you get put on a xanax or something like that yes always work with your doctor and consult with your doctor before starting a new thing but hey don't hesitate to contact our offices here at addiction mindset recovery coaching we can hook you up with therapists mds coaches like myself we have it all on our team so i hope that video helped you guys good luck quitting let me know what do you need help with in the comments let me know i'll see you

scientists of pure analytics and chief science officer of Humboldt brand products really excited to share with you today everything that I can about major and minor cannabinoids and how they work in your body along with some great things about current research on PTSD cancer neuropathy and more so let's get started you know cannabinoids are substances that are produced both in plants and in the human body and they're responsible for some but not all of the effects that you experience from cannabis and in fact some of the other effects may be due to things like terpenoids and flavonoids phyto cannabinoids are one type of cannabinoid so you'll hear the terms phyto cannabinoid and endocannabinoid phyto cannabinoids are the ones that are produced by plants the cannabis plant is the only plant that's known to produce really significant amounts of this viscous resin and when you look at close-up shot of the surface of a cannabis plant you can actually physically see the phyto cannabinoids accumulating in the resin glands so the resin glands are those little structures on the plant have a little stalk with a ball on the end and that's where the phyto cannabinoids actually accumulate so the THC and CBD are right there in those resin glands endocannabinoids are a very similar class of substances but what's really interesting about them is that they're made naturally in the human body you know back in the 80s when I was a little kid we used to see these commercials this is your brain and this is your brain on drugs and you'd see the two eggs in a frying pan it was really interesting to me to learn was that we actually didn't even know that there were things called endocannabinoids or something called an endocannabinoid system in our bodies that's a natural architecture for interacting with cannabinoids and that's actually the reason that humans have such strong interactions with cannabinoids is because we have this natural architecture in our bodies to interact with them the endocannabinoid system is a network of receptors in our body receptors we can think of receptors as little docking sites right in your brain and all over your body these little docking sites that cannabinoids connect with and cause all of the different things that you experience from them let's talk a little bit about THC and CBD and CBN those three together are often referred to as the major cannabinoids the reason is is because they're often the most prevalent although current analysis is showing that cbc maybe should be called a major cannabinoid these days as well because it's present in almost every sample and at a decent level sometimes higher than CBD the relative amounts of THC and CBD are of a lot of interest to people right now you hear people talk about ratios one to one and two to one and 15 to one and twenty to one and it matters it matters how much THC relative to CBD there is because those are specific for specific ailments so a 20 to one CBD to THC cannabis flower or tincture for example may be good for addressing one thing like seizure control where a one to one or a two to one CBD to THC substance or tincture might be the best thing safe for pain relief so the ratio is specific to the application so that's why we care about ratio and that's why we talk about it a question I get asked a lot is is there anything you can do during the growing stages of the plant to change it from a THC plant to a CBD plant and unfortunately the answer is no you know I've been asked is there a nutrient can I water starve it can I change the light can I do anything to it to change that THC plant to a CBD plant and unfortunately the answer is no whether a plant is THC dominant or CBD dominant is actually determined by genetics so if it's a 15 percent THC planner is a 15 percent CBD plant the fact that that's the dominant cannabinoid isn't something that you can change but what you can change is the total accumulation of the plant so that can be affected by growing conditions you know if a plant doesn't have the right growing conditions nutrients soil and water it won't produce as much cannabinoid and the final potency percentage won't be as high so that is something that you can affect now there's three main types of cannabinoid ratio that you can consider there's cannabis that's very high THC there's cannabis it's very high CBD and right in the middle there is cannabis where you have equal amounts of THC and CBD and again which bucket cannabis ends up in high CBD high THC or equal amounts of the two is determined by genetics of the plant THC is probably the cannabinoid that we're all the most familiar with it's the one that's been talked about the most it's the one that for a long time people attributed most of the effects of cannabis to this one molecule to THC we know more than that now which we'll talk about throughout this presentation today but the reason that people talk a lot about THC is it has some pretty big effects you know THC is the main psychoactive or intoxicating component in cannabis you know when we talk about that it's to indicate that there's a shift right and the way you feel in your emotional state when you consume THC now THC is referred to in a few different ways out there you'll see THC you'll see Delta 9 THC Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol so those are all the same thing THC is generally the most abundant cannabinoid in cannabis but that's been changing as more people have focused on developing more CBD strains and we'll talk about CBD a lot as well today one of the fascinating things about THC is that it actually exists in different forms in the plant so you actually have THC acid as its dominant form in the growing plant and THC is the form that you find after it's been heated so when you put something in your pipe and smoke it you're actually doing some chemistry converting THC teach the acid to THC now there's a lot of confusion amongst patients about THC acid and THC you know a lot more is known about THC THC acid is just coming into our purview as something that we're interested in and we want to know about the researchers who are the original people who pioneered cannabinoid research when you ask them at the conferences you say ruff Raphael Michelin like why aren't you studying THC acid he was like oh there's nothing to it there's nothing there it doesn't have strong effects in the body near Raphael's around it's because of people who went out there is evangelists and as early adopters and tried this and have built bodies of anecdotal evidence to say there's something interesting going on here with these acidic cannabinoids so THC acid is the form it's in like I said before it's been heated that means in the growing plant or in dried material let's say on the shelf in a jar and dispensary that's the form that most of it is in the conversion of THC acid to THC is called decarboxylation that's a big word I like the word activation more and I think it's a little bit more intuitive so you'll hear me use the term activation and decarboxylation interchangeably at room temperature decarboxylation can actually also occur over time so as your cannabis sits in that jar you can actually have some of that conversion as well so it's not entirely stable smoking or vaporizing activates or D carboxylates THC acid and turns it into THC making it available for those experiences that you're most accustomed to for reliable decarboxylation of THC acid to THC you know a lot of people are interested in that because they're making their own medicine at home if you want to do that my best advice is to heat your raw cannabis you know don't put it into butter first but just the raw cannabis itself on a baking sheet in the oven so if you pre-heat your oven to 212 degrees Fahrenheit and you bake it and keep it in a thin layer to make sure that the heat can actually penetrate all the material he did for 90 minutes and you'll have great THC acid to THC conversion so so why do we care so I've talked about this thing exists we have it how do you convert one to the other so but why do you care about it well the reason you care about THC acid and THC and the difference between them is because the effects are totally different and in many cases the therapeutic application is totally different depending on the patient and their needs and what's right for you it really depends on your desired effects and the relief that you need THC acid has been exciting to people lately because there's a lot of new people coming to cannabis and they want to try it for the first time they've got one hesitation though that's the intoxication component to it maybe they're not comfortable letting go not having control in that moment so THC acid preparations tinctures especially you can find THC acid in are a great way for people to try cannabis for the first time without a whole lot of danger of fear of intoxication there's a lot of interesting findings from these bodies of patient anecdotal evidence that we've been putting together to show that THC acid has some pretty substantial anti-inflammatory properties and may have some anti [ __ ] properties as well more work needs to be done on that but there's some clear indications that there's more to learn there you know when I talk about THC acid patients are really you know interested and concerned how can I get access to that like what kind of products can I find THC acid in well the the most direct way is through juicing so you can actually juice raw cannabis both the leaves and the flowers if you're juicing flowers you do need to add a little bit of water into your blender as well or school turn out quite right wheatgrass juice blenders juicers are actually the best ones to use because of the way that they process the material some juicers can actually activate the THC acid and converts it to THC during the process of juicing because of the amount of heat that's used so you want to use a juicer that doesn't have a lot of heat if you're concerned about preserving your cannabinoid acids glycerin tinctures that are made without any heat or alcohol tinctures made without any heat are another place that you can find acidic cannabinoids water extracted hash will often have a small amount of activation but you can keep the majority of it in the acid form as well and you can capsulize that so you can take it as an oral ingestible as a capsule so those are some strategies in ways that you can access acidic cannabinoids and try them if you're interested one of the other things that's been interesting as i've have worked with several patients concerning the use of THC acid and THC is there's a distinct time-phased effect that's different for THC acid what we've learned is that if you're interested in pursuing THC acid therapy you have to try it for a while to make sure you're actually experiencing the benefit for many patients is actually up to three to four weeks after daily use that they truly start to experience the benefit I have a lot of patients who approached me and they say Samantha you know I'm trying to choose is it THC acid therapy or is it th which one is it that I want you know aren't we funny as humans that way right we want to be an a/b thing but really the answer is it's probably both you know I myself I have fibromyalgia so I deal with chronic pain and there's days where I have really acute days they're really bad days acidic cannabinoid therapy on a daily basis is something that can lower the overall symptom level of someone who has a condition like mine chronic pain condition but on those acute days I probably need some THC and so they can really complement one another so the acidic cannabinoid therapy to bring down that total level of symptoms that you're feeling and the activated cannabinoids to really help you deal with that in the moment situation because THC as you know you feel very immediately and can give you that immediate relief if you need it to help promote your quality of life and keep you functional for that day when you are pursuing THC acid therapy especially if you're doing it to avoid intoxication you really do need to make sure you understand that there is going to be a small amount in that activated form THC present so you may still feel a little bit of psycho activity but it certainly should be a lot less than if the whole thing was activated again most of our evidence around THC acid therapy has to do with patient anecdotal evidence that's been gathered by various clinicians even dispensaries who are doing their own research there's a certain dispensaries have gone on a mission to gather data and figure out what's really happening with some of these unique substances some of the things that we've observed are reduction in inflammation and muscle convulsions in spasticity but the one that fascinates me the most is changes in cognitive development in children who are taking acidic cannabinoid therapies we see some really amazing shifts in their behavior both from THC acid and CBD acid we see changes and emotional intelligence in speech and cognition I'm fascinated to see what the further research on THC acid reveals and we should be really fascinating people often wonder what's normal for THC should it take care of my pain should it take care of my nausea like what is it really supposed to do for me there's been a lot of research that's been done there's certainly more to do but we have some really clear ground that you can stand on and say THC is great for these things it's great for mild to moderate pain relief and it's become because of that has become a great option for people to wean themselves off of opioid therapy say from post-surgical pain for some people they can deal with post-surgical pain using cannabis for many people that's a challenge and they often need the opioids for a few days but cannabis can be an incredible tool for getting yourself off of that addictive medication as quickly as possible so you don't experience those side effects control of nausea is a very significant finding around THC people with cancer and AIDS and who are taking a lot of different pharmaceutical regimens to help get them through their condition off an experience a lot of nausea and also the need for appetite stimulation as we all know THC does a great job at appetite stimulation sometimes when you don't want it to THC can also be a great solution for insomnia for many people helping people go to sleep and then stain is sleep a little bit longer the one thing that we should always consider especially for new users to cannabis who are trying THC for the first time is that for some people it's not always totally a great experience so if you suffer from anxiety or you find yourself on the bipolar spectrum or with schizophrenia or with conditions like that THC may exacerbate your condition so if you fall into that spectrum you really want to make sure that you work closely with your doctor if you're just thinking about exploring THC dominant cannabis and your therapy regimen and make sure that it's the right choice for you and then it's done in a controlled manner because everybody needs to be successful and their therapeutic regimen that one might need a little bit more guidance and some THC levels for flowers are really interesting you know in owning the lab for the last seven years it's been fascinating to actually watch that potency average rise in addition to the the potency average of flowers rising you see all these other kind of new products coming out but a lot of people wonder like what's normal for flowers what's average what's high what's low so in Northern California where my laboratory does testing we see the average range of THC dominant flowers to be about sixteen and a half percent once you get over about eighteen to twenty percent that's near in the strong range and over 21 percent you have a lot fewer strings that qualify and if another dividing line is 25% you do have some strains that perform over 25 percent THC but it's a lot fewer than below so it's good to understand what average ranges are and also that there is actually a value associated with those ranges and so if your economics of cannabis use matter to you then it might be good to understand what things fall into your price range and how you can best use those in your therapy regimen there is a whole class of patience right now who's really interested in the mild to moderate range of THC potency especially older people I know as I get older my response to THC definitely changes we often have a lower tolerance level for it as we get older so those lower THC products say 10% THC and below are becoming more attractive to those new people who are coming to cannabis for the first time so just because it's low potency doesn't mean it's bad it just means it's right for a different person than something that's high THC so we've had this explosion of concentrates especially in California I mean in every legal market I'm sure but I'm here in California so that's where I see it the most I remember the first time I saw a BHO wax I remember the first time I saw a shatter and as a chemist I was fascinated by it and I asked them about it and they wouldn't tell me anything it's top secret in others videos all over YouTube the times I think all of this stuff so it's certainly no secret anymore and as the secret has gotten out the proliferation of it's been amazing and what's really fascinating is it's really changed the potency thresholds that people are accustomed to and that they expect in the marketplace so interesting to know that Keefe you know so that's a cannabis that's been run and over a dry sieve say and the resin glands collected generally doesn't get over about 30 or 40 percent THC and more often it's actually a little bit below that with hash so traditional hash like you used to see coming se out of Afghanistan and Pakistan in places like that which you actually don't see much of anymore generally ranges between about 10 to 60% with average being at about 48 bubble hash which is water extracted hash still popular all it's waning in its popularity as other extracts come into the market co2 extracts and BHO extracts and all these different things that people are doing but water extracted hash you know averages at about 50% and really tops out around 65 or so you do have a few rare ones that go higher than that but the average is a real solid 50 percent wax or BHO or shatter co2 extracts you know those are chemical extracts so bubble hash hash and Keith are all made by what we call a mechanical process right where you physically remove resin glands and gather them and press them together whereas these new concentrates are totally different so they come from a process of chemical extraction so the extraction of cannabis with butane with co2 with propane some with nitrogen there's a variety of things that you can use but that chemical extraction as you might expect as much more efficient so you get much higher concentrates um ranging upwards of 90 plus percent definitely something to be careful with if you're a new user but can be a great source of relief and very concentrated dose of cannabinoids if needed for the right patient let's move on to talking about CBD a lot of talk about CBD people are really excited about CBD you know when I first started speaking to patient audiences seven years ago I would ask people who's heard of CBD in here and I get a couple hands half timidly raised when I asked that question to an audience today everybody raises their hand until they know what CBD is which is a really cool thing to happen in five or seven years so why do we care about CBD and what's the buzz you know what is it all about well it's different from THC in many ways in both the way that it makes you feel and a therapeutic applications so CBD has been called non psychoactive or non intoxicating the way I like to say it is you'll still be able to operate heavy equipment afterwards probably so CBD is a great option for people who again who are seeking cannabinoid therapy are a little concerned about the feelings of intoxication they might experience from THC and would really prefer to take baby steps in to cannabis they feel safer so CBD has become one of those things that people can try in a safe way in a safe place in addition there's a greater level of permissions right they've been created around CBD both legally and culturally in our society and that entry point of that kind of environment of permissions that's being created for CBD is really exciting because it's really been the impetus for changing the conversation around cannabinoid therapy focusing on the medicinal therapeutic and less on the psychoactivity and intoxication components that have historically been our kind of cultural association with cannabis CBD is interesting in that it's usually found at low levels so sub 1% less than 1% but in some cannabis it's the dominant cannabinoid although that does occur more rarely than with THC there's a lot of efforts underway to create more CBD strains their seed collectives there's independent growers there's companies who are making products now and they want the only specific cannabinoids to be present especially CBD so there's a lot of work around developing more CBD strains and creating more access to CBD for patient population so interestingly CBD like THC also has an acid form CBD acid or CBD a fascinating of course that both of course are non intoxicating as CBD is not intoxicating if THC is present though it's good to understand that you may still feel some feelings of intoxication so CBD does really lower the overall feelings of intoxication that you're going to feel from THC because of the way that they interact but you still may feel a little bit so if you do feel some intoxication don't be surprised it's because of the THC present the therapeutic uses of CBD and CBD acid are different a lot less is known about CBD acid fewer people have used it but it has been the one that has shown some pretty incredible shifts in children who are using it again as with THC acid the time to feel the effects are different so with CBD acid therapy you may need to be using CBD acid tincture or juicing three to four weeks before you actually feel that overall reduction of your symptom level one of the best stories that I heard about Beadie acid therapy was out in the village of Mendocino in Northern California and I was visiting a little collective out there called the Leonard Moore cooperative we've done a lot of work to try and promote CBD and there was a patient of theirs that had ALS and it was a fairly far advanced case of it and she was about to go into Hospice and the family was really upset about that they really wanted her at home you know everybody does better at home and so you know there in that moment of desperation and they were gonna try anything and they got some juice to cannabis from Leonard more cooperative and that juiced cannabis being given to her on a daily basis is what kept her off of a feeding tube and kept her out of hospice and so she was able to have really an incredibly higher quality of life through CBD acid therapy and there's there's so many stories like that we don't have enough time to tell but it can be a very powerful alternative to the drugs that people are using or the care regimens that we start to pursue as as people go into end-of-life so like with THC acid there is a recipe for conversion if you need to convert CBD acid to CBD say for a product or a tincture that you're making to help with your own therapeutic regimen and there's some specific conditions so again heating raw cannabis in your oven so not in oil or anything else is the best way to do it you want to spread it out on a baking sheet pre-heat your oven to 295 so it's a higher temperature than with THC and heat it for ninety minutes and you'll get great CBD acid to CBD conversion if you don't go to that 295 degree temperature your conversion probably won't occur or I'll occur in a partial way so really important that you hit that temperature and because it's important you hit the temperature I recommend that people buy an additional temperature gauge for their oven so you can often buy them right in the grocery store and the little gadget aisle you can hang it right in your oven and make sure that you're actually at the right temperature because I'll tell you our oven thermostats are terrible for the most part I have learned so when people are looking for CBD and they're looking for it the flower form they're often kind of restricted to asking about specific strain names some strains that you can look for that are likely to be CBD dominant are things like tsunami Harlequin canna tonic Harless sue can ASSU stinky pink diesel and of course Charlotte's Web that we heard about a lot from Sanjay Gupta interestingly stinky pink diesel was the first I know it's a funny name was the first high bead high CBD strain that was isolated and identified here in California through lab testing that happened at Harbor side it was a strain that came out of very very small growing community in Mendocino County called Koval oh and I remember doing a seminar out in Koval Oh about six years ago now in the public library there and as a very small place about six people came and the woman who actually had created that strain and submitted it for testing and was it was actually there so it was a pleasure to meet her she stills got those genetics and is holding on to him tight you know that's one of the things that's been interesting about CBD is because it's been so limited in supply and there have been so few people who have held the genetics there was a tendency for a long time to hold on to them and and not share them with people what's really exciting is that we've had some producers and breeders and creators like Lawrence Ringo who made all of their genetics available in seed form to whoever wanted to buy them so that's been a really exciting change in CBD is it's now very publicly available for people who say want to grow it themselves or work with it themselves the therapeutic uses of CBD are different from THC complimentary but different so it definitely deals with pain just like THC does but it attacks pain from a different side than THC it definitely reduces inflammation as THC does but it specifically deals with pain due to spasticity and there are a lot of chronic pain conditions that originate from muscle spasticity fibromyalgia multiple sclerosis I mean epilepsy it's origin is spasticity and that's why you've seen CBD become a go-to therapeutic alternative for many people who suffer from these spasticity related conditions CBDs also been shown in some more modern research to be very effective for eliminating chemotherapy induced neuropathy and also neuropathy in general even diabetic neuropathy so that work was done in a very formal setting and was actually very clear so CBD has a lot of different uses especially for people suffering from chronic pain one of its other major applications is as an anti-anxiety substance so CBD for many people who suffer from anxiety really seems to provide them incredible relief now I never recommend that somebody go off of their anxiety medication without consulting their doctor but for many patients they've been able to either find it as a compliment or a substitution for a more traditional pharmaceutical regimen that they were previously on CBD has also been shown in some research to perhaps have some anti-tumor activity for particular types of tumors a little bit later in the presentation we'll talk a little bit more about that research for people who are using CBD and THC together they have some interesting interplay with one another that's good to understand because they become tools in your toolkit as a patient and a user with a therapeutic regimen that you're trying really to have be successful so CBD actually prolongs the effects of THC and the way that it does that is actually inhibits the enzyme that breaks down THC in our liver so when CBD connects with that enzyme it changes its shape and so THC doesn't fit in it very well anymore and can't be broken down and so it recirculates and we experience it for a longer period of time CBD also reduces the feelings of intoxication from THC so when I tell people that CBD is gonna make their THC last longer they're alright I'm gonna get high for longer well it's a little bit different than that you'll probably be less high but your therapeutic benefits will last for longer so it's a point at which we have to kind of separate those two ideas the expected CBD levels for flowers are a little bit different than for THC especially when we're looking at CBD flowers that have a one-to-one or a balanced ratio because think about it you couldn't have 20% THC and 20% CBD in the plant right no one to another they 40% cannabinoid and they just don't accumulate at that level no lab has shown that result yet so the only time that you really see CBD go above 20% or even in that range are in those 20 to 1 CBD to THC flowers oftentimes and say a one-to-one CBD flower you'll see something like 5% CBD and 5% THC or maybe 7% and 7% so the levels are a lot lower than you see in those THC flowers that we've really optimized for potency over so many different years how high the CBD level is again depends on ratio so if you're dealing with a twenty to one you can actually see CBD levels up as high as twenty but with balanced or with lower ratios you're going to see them more in the single-digit range so that doesn't mean that it's poor quality and I know we have this idea that cannabis at a certain percentage means that it's low quality so you kinda have to throw that out the door when it comes to CBD it's just an entirely different thing to consider let's talk about cbn a little bit you know it's gotten kind of a bad rap and you know there's a reason why it's a byproduct of THC degradation so when THC degrades it becomes CBN that usually happens in the presence of UV light and oxygen and I used to say to the growers that I would talk to you so don't put it in the turkey bag and throw it in the corner of your room and little light run across it and back and forth all day because that UV in addition the oxygen the bag is going to cause CBN conversion a lot of dispensaries and people in the kind of open market of cannabis view CBN is a negative indicator of either processing or age on cannabis that's true but it has to be taken with a grain of salt it really only applies to indoor grown cannabis outdoor grown cannabis is going to naturally have a small amount of CBN present due to the UV that's impinging on it from the Sun and the weathering that's happening as it grows in the outdoor environment during the entire grow season so not uncommon to find say 0.5% CBN in an outdoor grown flower that's been perfectly grown and perfectly processed and is very fresh so CBN is not always an indicator of negativity either in the growth conditions or in processing so good to understand that it also has some interesting therapeutic benefits one of the ones that's interesting to me especially is around cardiovascular effects it actually decreases heart rate without decreasing blood flow so can bring your heart rate down some animal model research has also said that CBN induces feelings of grogginess I actually did some consumer testing along the way in developing the humble products to look at CBN and I found very clearly that CBN is a very dose dependent substance and that at low doses can be effective as a sleep aid but as you go into moderate and high doses actually seems to be contraindicated for sleep and can be alerting to many people so there's a very interesting finding and in fact found throughout our work that LOC cbn dose and a dose of THC accompanied with Mersin are virtually equivalent so let's talk a little bit about some of the minor cannabinoids THC and CBD and CBN we hear about those a lot there's other ones that have started to percolate up you know we hear about them here and there but we don't know a lot about them part of its because not a lot of research has been done so there's more work to do but there's some interesting things to look at CBC is one of my favorite I think it has a lot of promise you know CBD has been shown to be a very powerful anti anxiety substance in the preliminary research that's been done CBC has been shown to have 10 times the anti-anxiety effects of CBD Wow interestingly CBC is present and elevated amounts in juvenile plants and then as the plant grows older and matures and flowers you have lower CBC levels there have been some plants that have been isolated that are CBC rich plants and they are actually mutant plants that can't produce THC and CBD very well and so because they can't produce THC and CBD very well the CBC is allowed to accumulate the reason why is that they all share the same starting material so this little pile of something called CBG acid inside the plant and the THC enzyme the CBD enzyme and the CBC enzyme all grab on to that CBG acid as their starting material to convert to become the cannabinoids that they eventually are THC CBD and CBC so when the THC enzyme and the CBD enzyme aren't grabbing any of that b:g acid it's just left there for the CBC in Xiamen it goes to town and starts to accumulate uns that's the only time you really see it at appreciable levels in a mature plant so there hasn't been very many of those identified so that's kind of that's the search right for the ambitious grower out there is that CBC mutant CBC's also been shown to have anti-inflammatory and pain relieving effects as well cannabidiol or CBD is an interesting one as well it's non psychoactive or non intoxicating as a CBC by the way again anti-inflammatory and pain relieving effects seems to be a theme right you hear from almost every cannabinoid THC CBD CBC now CBG we're hearing that pain relieving an anti-inflammatory effects so if you're dealing with pain cannabis is a great solution or a great thing to drive for people you know we often hear about cannabis and glaucoma and I don't know we've all probably heard Peter Tosh this song where he talks about it too right I always associated that especially with the way people express it and talked about it what it had to do with THC but if you look at the research you'll see that what was actually shown to be reducing intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients in the research that's been performed with CBG in many of the cases that have been identified so it's also an interesting molecule to look at therapeutic li CBG acid as I said is the precursor to both THC and CBD in the growing plant but you always have a small amount of CBG that's left over and sometimes it's not a small amount it can actually help growers look at an indicator of whether or not they allowed their plant to mature longer so a mature plant that was harvested in an optimal time probably have 1% or less of CBG maybe up to one and a half percent but you can see plants with as much as five or six percent CBG present in them basically what you're looking at there if it's not a genetic mutant is a plant that was just harvested a little bit too early that balance and that varying balance between the different cannabinoids as well as the other substances of the plant at different points of maturity and harvests are some of the things that shape preferences that people have say for early mid to late harvest products THC v also has a lot of buzz about it tetrahydrocannabinol it's a mouthful there's been limited research on it it's a very rare cannabinoid in my laboratory we've isolated three different cultivars of THC cannabis over 5% by weight so those are very interesting all in one small community in Mendocino so they've been kind of collecting genetics it's sifting through to them to see if they can find th DV and a few of them have the animal model research assist some interesting things about THC v relative to THC and that is is that the presence of THC v is thought to bring on the feelings of THC stronger and quicker so it quicker hi that's more intense but also has a shorter duration I said call it the quickie right if you can actually find the THC v cannabis there's also been research people say hey Samantha where do I get some of that diet weed and I say diet weed well what's the diet weed the diet weed it turns out is th T V cannabis so there's been some animal model research that suggested that it actually prevents the munchies which if you struggle with your weight and you smoke cannabis may be a significant issue for you not being proven out in humans yet so as soon as we get more THC th T V cannabis for everybody to try we'll have to run that one to ground and see if it really is the diet weed but there's a lot of people excited about the prospect of that right now there's also a related compound on the CBD side called CBD V Orkin a bit of Eron CBD v and THC v are both what we call propyl cannabinoids they have a three carbon ring on them that what makes them a little bit different CBD v is also a non intoxicating cannabinoid and it's thought to perhaps be one of the differentiators in CBD dominant cannabis that has greater or lesser efficacy for epilepsy treatment so interestingly in in groups of epilepsy patients who have been trying lots of different CBD strains we find that they don't all work the same some work better than others they maybe have the same CBD to THC ratio so you can tell it's not about that it's not just about the CBD and THC well one of the other things it's present can be CBD v and some preliminary animal model research has shown that CBD v has significant anti spasticity properties so it may be that the anti spasticity properties of CB DV when coupled with CB d really create the best solution for a lot of people when treating epilepsy and spasticity but more to learn on that as well there's a lot of exciting research happening right now and it's an exciting time in that our government here in the u.s. even is allowing more research up to this time a lot of it has had to happen in more international places in Spain and Italy and Israel and Canada who have had a Amsterdam who've had a greater level of permissions than we have there's been a few pioneers here in the u.s. dr. Sean McAllister is one of them he's out of California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco and Sean is a true pioneer you can you two of him and watch him all day if you'd like to what Sean did was he induced tumors into animals into rats so you can actually buy cancer many people don't know that but you can buy cancer and you can give it to things as in a clinical setting so these rats were given cancer and they were allowed to grow tumors in this case breast tumors were the specific case study that I saw from from Sean so he showed a picture of this ugly tumor on this poor rats chest and then he made CBD THC injections into that tumor and after 30 days of the injections at the right ratio of CBD to THC that tumor completely disappeared and the next thing that Sean shows is a picture of a rat with nothing but beautiful pink skin on its belly and if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes I probably wouldn't believe it because it's such an amazing transformation so Sean's work is really exciting he's really diving down into whether the specific cannabinoid ratios that are needed to treat a specific type of cancer Sean was a rebel he got his first research grant under the auspices of actually demonstrating that cannabis wasn't good for you and and bless Sean for that because that was how he got the funding to make these findings now the NIH is willing to fund his research at face value as a benefit for finding cures for cancer so that's an exciting shift as well there's been a lot of research on PTSD we have a lot of people in our society these days suffering from it from all of the wars that we've had recently addition to just the stress and pain of this fast-paced culture that we're all living in right now so there's been a lot of looking at how can cannabis help these people recover and come back to normalcy and enjoy a greater quality of life well we've shown that THC when it stimulates the cb1 receptor can interrupt memories and we all know that cannabis affects our memory wearing work and if personally in anecdotally but it can on a on a more clinical level so when your memories are disrupted that way when you have PTSD it can actually let you have that break where you can get control and get control of your thoughts and control that looping and that focusing on that negative experience you had which is the root of that PTSD so again through animal model research and showing that stimulation of the cb1 receptor eliminates these long term negative memories there's a real prospect of hope for people who are suffering from PTSD using cannabinoid therapy instead of other pharmaceutical alternatives there was some great research at Temple University on chemotherapy induced neuropathy as well neuropathy is the degeneration of the nervous system and there's a lot of pain associated with it the study found that when CBD was administered before the chemotherapy that could actually completely prevent the onset of chemotherapy induced neuropathy so for those people that was you know an amazing amazing shift they in a 2010 FDA clinical trial they actually concluded that inhaled cannabis significantly reduced neuropathy as compared to placebo in human studies so fascinating to see the FDA and 2010 was actually doing this research which is not well known so some great things on cancer PTSD and neuropathy and one that's really been in the press a lot lately has been treatment of epilepsy that's happening through the activated CBD being administered to patients often in tincture form or orally ingestible and it's causing incredible shifts and changes in people who suffer from frequent seizures I had a story from a fellow who called me and he went to tell me about his four-year-old daughter and you could hear the sounds of him making dinner in the background all of San sounds the family I liked him from kind of the first few words he said to me was hearing and he said you know my daughter has 800 seizures a day and basically that means she's in an intractable seizures all of the time I'm really desperate to find something to help her they've got her on all of these drugs or causing all these side-effects and she has no quality of life and no interaction with the family it was a very sad story and he didn't live anywhere near me in my state so I was able to help him with was information about CBD and strain names that he could look for to try and find something to help her he called me back about a month later he said Samantha I want to tell you about what's happening I said you know she was at eight hundred seizures a day and we've had her on a CBD tincture now for a month or so and she's down to one seizure a week and later on that young lady was down to one a month it gives you chills when you think about I mean can you imagine eight hundred seizures a day was no that's one every you know every if you figure out how many minutes there on the day and that's pretty much a constant seizure so the fact that CBD can bring this kinds of relief to people is something that's opening doors and opening minds about cannabis as a therapeutic alternative sir so many of these complicated drugs that are currently being used to treat these very serious conditions so it's I'm excited to be a part of and share with you this current research and maybe help open your mind and your landscape of permissions for trying cannabis and for supporting it in the use of your families", "kxPDtpbK-Q8": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to the duke grows on today's episode i'm super excited to show my first run and my 4x8 tent in my new house so everything that you guys might have seen in the past was at my old house and in this house i decided i'm going to do four by eight tents everywhere and i have some other size tents as well but this is all from clone all basically i'm going to show you from the cloning process all the way to the final yield so yeah hang out and let's take a look so i wanted to show you before we get started kind of what i'm doing here with the setup i have my fans i have uh the intake fans the outtake fans the carbon filter i have a spider farmer 4000 light on one side and an hlg v2r spec light on the other side so yeah it's pretty nice everything is nice and clean right now on my first run um you see there that little intake fan with a little cloth kind of over it i don't really feel like i need a carbon filter fan going in but i do want some kind of little covering so stuff doesn't really get in too much but yeah that's uh pretty much the setup for this tent for this run i was taking a bunch of clones off of this blue dream hybrid plant it's called blue hash or blue hatcheson it really is similar to a blue dream so i've been really happy with the results on this in the past if you guys have seen a handful of my videos you've probably seen this strain pop in and out but yeah i had this uh this mother that needed a bunch of defoliation anyway so i took a bunch of clones from this um the real way to just do clones if anybody wants to see how to do cloning i am not an expert at this honestly i failed this way too often but basically try to get like four nodes down and then do like a 45 degree angle cut and then put them into these rock wool cubes you can also also put them into a root hormone first which i uh do and then put those into those rock ball cubes and after about seven to fourteen days you'll see roots starting to pop out of these things they won't do anything for like a week to 10 days and then you'll start seeing the roots just start exploding out of them and from the rockwool cubes i just put them right into a solo cup once they start rooting i should say then i put them right into a solo cup and let them veg for a little bit before i transplant into a final five gallon [Music] pot [Music] from here really all i'm doing is just watering i'm using this little two gallon hand pump sprayer thing which is pretty pretty soft so it doesn't like disturb the plants too much well yeah they they really do like a lot of water with if you transplant with a heavy root structure already they really kind of transpire quite a bit so you can soak them pretty good and uh it's definitely important to keep the humidity pretty high i like to use a humidity dome to make sure the humidity stays like 80 90 percent and then yeah i mean keep them keep them wet keep them uh water them every day if you can every two days is probably fine if you if you have the humidity high enough yeah they'll start exploding [Music] so from here i just let them veg out for a little while in the solo cups i could have transplanted them into the final five gallon pots a little earlier but i just didn't i mean they got in there pretty quick anyway but um after that i just ended up topping them all when they kind of have about five or six nodes i would top them and that will let them bush out a little bit more if you want to learn more about topping there's other videos out there for i think i have one on that as well but uh yeah it's pretty simple stuff that's about all i really did for these things and then yeah letting them go from there [Music] as far as watering goes i would do water on monday with nutrients i'd water with nutrients on wednesday and i would only give it water on friday and then i wouldn't water again until the next monday so basically three days a week i would water i think i didn't ever really super soak the medium either i think that's a different way of going about it you could maybe water just monday and just friday give it like three days four days rest between but i didn't really really soak the medium i just kind of gave it about you know one pitcher of water about a half gallon of water on each of those days and sometimes on friday when it was just water i might give them like a pitcher and a half [Music] the nutrients that i used for this whole run were the general hydroponics three-part series i would uh just take these nutrients put it right into my five gallon bucket fill it with water and then hand water i ended up doing something a little different after that but i'll show you that later on in the video that being said this is actually the last time i'm going to be using general hydroponics i have not just not been happy with the bud density when it's all said and done and so i have been using nuke heads which uh they sent me some stuff for free a long time ago and i've actually really liked it so um the bud density that i used in the white widow uh was all nuke heads and that was like twice as dense as anything that i've gotten with the general hydroponics stuff so i'm going to be switching over entirely to nuke heads in my future grows however this one i wanted to use just general hydroponics and i have another 4x8 right behind this one which i'm using only new cut so i'm really excited for the side by side when it comes to that [Music] well we're cruising right along here and this tent is just getting filled out like crazy and i'm like i knew that i was probably going to be over planting a little bit in this tent but it's getting pretty pretty jungly in here so i did a big defoliation before flipping over into flour and i knew even after flipping them into flour this tent is going to be absolutely packed so you know i wasn't that sad about it i'm like i think it will be fine i'm just gonna have to really fight things like high humidity and mold and stay on top of my defoliation and maybe if i really pack out a tent like this i'm actually gonna have better results you know more plants more more yield that's not necessarily going to be the case though and uh you'll see why as this continues on it was really helpful though to defoliate every plant before flipping them into flower i give them pretty much a haircut at least a third of the way up the plant like pretty much choose the line everything below that gone so all that stuff doesn't really get enough light anyway and you're not gonna really gonna ever ever have anything that produces decently down there so that's the first thing i did before flip them into flower and as of this point they were looking pretty good [Music] from then i'm still just watering my normal schedule i put up this trellis net uh i knew these things now that they're in flowering are going to be growing right up into these nets into the lights so when you go into flowering from veg you can expect the plants to at least double in size sometimes triple in size as far as growing up growing height i also ran this uh exhale co2 bag try to increase the co2 levels in this tent not sure if it helped a lot or not but i know having higher co2 which it definitely did did have uh should increase your plant growth so yeah i'm going to continue doing that in the future too [Music] and from here they're just filling out like crazy you know you defoliate one week and the next week they just looks like he didn't do anything to him so i didn't defoliate here for a little while right now they're just growing up and up into these trellis nets they're not quite there yet but they're really close and uh yeah they're stretching out [Music] and in just three days they've stretched right up into it so pretty excited about this every time basically they start growing up and through the trellis net i just bend them over somewhere else put them through a different trellis net hole that's that's i'm going to do that as much as possible to try to maintain an even canopy well they're getting wild and at this point i'm like all right i think there's just so much foliage in here i gotta give it another good trim job so ended up taking all these plants out trimmed up a bunch of the undercarriage some more took a bunch of fan leaves off the top as well and uh yeah just trying to trying to fight the canopy to make sure that i give as much possible light coverage to all the bud sites that i can i'm always looking for ways to optimize things do things a little easier too so i ended up getting this like uh sump pump a little submersible pump and a 50 foot hose and a garden sprayer and i fill up this uh 20 gallon tub add my nutrients to it and then i just run the submersible pump right to my garden hose and then i can basically water all my tents with one hose and it's also an extended arm so i can like don't have to get way deep into the back of the plants and all that stuff you don't just reach back there and do it so that thing has been absolutely awesome like watering is one of the pain in the butts when it comes to this kind of stuff and something like this is just super easy i know i've talked before about like auto watering solutions which i'm not currently using i still think they're great and they have their uses but just with my setup i'm actually hand watering everything now but i made a lot easier on myself than filling five gallon buckets and hand watering everything just with a pot too so yeah i think that's a great solution if it's something that you guys struggle [Music] with for now just watching everything grow keeping uh things tucked in trying to keep the canopy as even as possible some of the plants are just growing a lot more than others there are a couple other plants in here outside of the blue blue dream so those are actually growing a little bit differently which i was i mean yeah it's something you gotta expect i guess but yeah tucking and tucking and super [Music] cropping [Music] you can really start seeing these flowers pack on quick though i was uh at this point in the grow i was like man i think this is going to be absolute fire it's like just blowing up and not much time at all so if they kept putting on weight like this i was like this is going to be a record harvest and um yeah we're super happy with what's what's going on [Music] also if you guys have watched a handful of these videos love it if you subscribe you can see a lot of these kind of videos coming up if this is the kind of stuff you like i'll be having a bunch more of these type of videos four by four auto runs two by four a three by three ten it's all coming up in the next month so yeah hit subscribe and uh you'll hit you'll see uh some more videos like this coming out soon and if you want to support me in any way any of the amazon affiliate links down below if you ever buy anything from amazon click one of those links first and uh it gives me a little kickback so it's always appreciated but a like and a comment is more than i could ever ask for definitely like you guys uh sticking with me and appreciate you a lot of people have asked how far away should you keep the light there's so many factors to that but the light itself is probably really dependent on it for these i try to not go closer than like 18 inches a lot of times some of the top buds that are growing up might be within a foot though so as long as they don't get light burned these things have been within six inches of these lights and get very minor light burn at most so yeah i don't know 18 inches a foot is about what i usually run [Music] well here's where start things start to get a little bit more interesting like not bad not great just something so i was leaving for a week in the middle of this grow didn't really know exactly what i was going to do i i had a buddy that was going to come over and water it but i was like hell maybe i can actually just really soak them and so i'm not too worried about that but then i was having high humidity issues this this tent was getting like 80 90 humidity at some points after watering and so i was like man this thing is just so full i'm not so sure that i can i trust i don't want to i don't want to leave these for seven days and come back to a big bold fest you know with high humidity in there and so i talked to a local hydroponic store owner who i'd get a bunch of my stuff through and uh he's super smart when it comes to growing and he's like dude just chop all the top butts right now like if the top buds are looking great and they're like only a week away from harvest anyway maybe two weeks harvest them a little early you won't be sad about it you're still gonna have some great big buds and then let the all the uh lower stuff finish up on its own after that and it's like that's genius i'll definitely do that so what i ended up doing was actually harvesting all of my top buds and i left everything else below that so this is what it looked like right before harvesting all the top buds they looked done to me i mean they were only about eight weeks maybe just over eight weeks some were right right then um but they looked finished they had like nice colors already coming through i didn't give them to two days of like darkness before i only gave them just a night before of darkness so that could have played a factor as well in how they finish up but they were still super frosty they looked really good and i'm just going to let the other lower stuff finish out from here and in about two more weeks i'll harvest all this well here's a lot of the top buds that i ended up taking and then um here is the rest of the plants after they got topped so let those things roll and hopefully all that lower stuff ends up getting a lot more light ends up dense enough a good bit more because that light lower stuff was not even worth touching at this point so definitely needed to give it some more time [Music] [Music] so i ended up having all this stuff dry uh while i was away i put it in this dry drying rack and i was going the next week and had this this drying for the week that i was gone so i felt pretty good about that and came back and yeah started trimming i did hand trim all of the top buds uh i was live streaming for man probably three or four days i was when i was pretty much hand trimming i would just go live and uh a lot of you guys would hop in and talk to me so that's really fun and um yeah i plan on doing that more i don't want to do more than just trimming but it's definitely easy to talk to you guys well there's only 15 15 people in there maybe um yeah it's a lot of fun so if you aren't subscribed subscribe so you can see when i go live if you ever want to chat i love doing that [Music] well back onto this lower stuff i'm really hoping these small buds start to take shape a little bit better and and really uh firm up so i think they're okay they're definitely very light and larfy so i'm not sure how much better they're gonna get because they have been shaded out a lot of this stuff has been shaded out not all of it there's still some pretty good sized buds on here but a lot of lower stuff i'm just hoping will turn into something usable but we'll see [Music] you can really see these fall colors starting to come through like crazy i have been giving them only water since probably week seven so yeah their nutrients are all used up and they're starting to just cannibalize themselves and uh yeah all these fall colors are looking really pretty [Music] well i actually really debated even telling you guys this i always try to be honest with everybody so i'm going to and there's going to be so many that hate me for it but i plan on doing a lot of production so this is a one-man operation this is just me and i needed to figure out some solution for trimming so i ended up getting this i i can remember what it's called some trimmer bowl um i will find it and i'll put it in the description below but i could do about five or six ounces an hour with this auto trimmer compared to maybe an ounce an hour to doing hand trimming and with all this little the larfey little buds and the um just small denser buds doing a wet trim with this thing it saves so much time did i get as good of a product as hand trimming no i don't think i did at all but if i'm doing i mean i can't be spending 40 hours every every week i'm just trimming either so anyway this is what i did for good or bad i actually don't think i'm going to use this again because it seemed to destroy a lot of the very small micro buds that being said i have some really high quality trim which i'm gonna use and maybe turn into bubble hash or just turn into oil and stuff like that so it's not like all is lost but uh i think the final yield actually did get kind of hit because a lot of the smaller buds just kind of got ate by this trimmer either way it is what it is a lot of people have been telling me i need to get this trim bag a a real-life friend of mine uses it and he swears by it and then i've had other you guys talk to me about the trim bag as well it's like 400 bucks for a piece of fabric you know whatever it's fine if it works it's worth the price but uh yeah i'm probably gonna give that a shot once i uh can afford it so yeah i'll i'll keep you up to date if i use some other kind of trimming method if you guys have any other way of trimming that might be cool and helpful and save time and not uh not ruin the bud love to hear from you guys as well [Music] all right so now to the good stuff for the people that skipped all the grow video because you just want to watch cool bud that's all finished here you go so ended up german all this stuff i have it kind of separated into my first batch of hand trimmed top buds and then all my other stuff which is drying in the rack from the auto trimmer [Music] did end up getting some really nice dried buds even off of the lower stuff so i didn't get all the biggest buds i just got the top bud so some of the smaller plants still had some really nice colas from the lower branches so yeah some of these looked really great as you can see here have my setup going and uh yeah just weighing everything up [Music] so when it's all said and done i had 13 ounces from the top buds so i have that all on the right side here and then on the left side i have all the smaller lower branch buds which were also right about 13 ounces so i got about half from the top and half from the bottom my um grams of total grams were 708 grams of dried bud and in trim a lot of that is pretty high quality trim i got a little over 850 grams of trim so gonna be doing a lot of stuff with that 700 and whatever grams of uh bud for this this size tent with this many watts is a bit of a disappointment i was hoping for about two pounds ended up getting just over one and a half and uh i mean my goal was really three pounds for this tent that being said it is what it is i am not going to be using those nutrients anymore i'm going to different nutrients i have the same plants going in a new 4x8 tent uh they are pretty much they're close to done two weeks probably they'll be getting harvested and i gave them a lot more space so they're taller they're fatter they're wider but there's also a lot more light penetration that gets all the way down and so it'll be a nice comparison to see like less plants in the same space just given more room to breathe is the like inner nodal difference something that makes a big difference because if they don't get enough light they're gonna be basically buds more spread out so you know it's all it's all process it's all just learning so i learned something i think maybe i don't know hopefully you guys did if not hopefully you enjoyed it yeah i think that is about it for now i do have a bunch of stuff coming up i am going to be talking a little bit more about my little three plant autoflower grow with the mars hydro ts 3000 and um i have my giveaway which is next week on the giveaway video i think is my last video if you guys haven't done that sign up for a free light there's kind of going to be a neat little twist to that too so uh yes i know just all you have to do is comment on that video on that 3x3 video so look at my last video and uh throw a comment up on there and we're gonna have something fun with that next week yeah i think that's it for now oh yeah and then i have a three by three granddaddy purple four plant tent that's almost done too so yeah there's there's all sorts of stuff coming up anyways hopefully you guys enjoyed it till the next time you guys take care [Music]", "fL6u_fI2bjs": "[Music] hey guys what's going on welcome back to another stream review today we are going to be reviewing gary [Music] payton [Music] and [ __ ] fact district was actually named after gary payton the hall of famer who collaborated with cookies and power generics to commercialize his strength oh man i can't wait to get into it though when i first got it and i put it in this can it smells so good it has this like almost like cookies uh girl scout cookies type of smell i mean you can still smell some terpenes in it but it's quite dense i gotta say breaks up pretty nice and you can see the tricoms on the nuts look at this right there this is a 50 indica 50 sativa hybrid with a 25 gac and 5 cbd the parents are to why or why grega and the hybrid strange snowman look at this beauty man you can't smell the turtle paints into it it's not so potent it's not as loud as all the strings that were reviewing this channel before ah but it smells so good especially we just freshly baked it it has the terpene smells come out a lot more i can't wait to taste it i'm hoping they taste like smells because it smells really good it just has an undertone of gas like like i don't know how to explain like a little gassy undertone but the terpenes the terpenes overpower that it smells so good this is often used to treat conditions like headaches and migraines or chronic stress anxiety depression hdd i mean i mean att and adhd you know literally we're going to be using a clean bow like this is the ball i like to use for my reviews because it hits real smooth and like i always keep it clean so before every review i like to put it on the solvent i don't get it next to me but you know so cleanly eating salsa that way what we taste is the actual cannabis flavor no paper and nothing like that right wow it tastes sweet it has a sweet taste to it horrible but sweet doesn't have any aftertaste so far second hit and still see i had a nice sweet flavor to it it hasn't changed it's real smooth when you hit it this is what's going down does it have a bad aftertaste or an aftertaste at all it just it tastes really good even on the third head you can still taste those terpenes nicely thirsty it almost have like a undertone of diesel i don't know why maybe it's just me but it has like a very little very undertone of diesel even you can smell that i mean the terpenes take over it takes terpenes are tasting really good right now even on the third head okay i just i just finished this one bowl and i've already started to feel it starting to feel body relaxation a little heavy i'm not saying it but it feels a little heavy [Music] i'm feeling clear minded like focus oh this is good one of the things i really like is it even took that long to hit like so straight takes seven minutes because i time them and someone will take seven minutes so it's like three so they take after two hits depending on the strain this one it hit me right away like maybe half the way the ball i was already starting to feel it and then i finished the boat i'm already filling it after the ball and it hasn't even been that long it's only been a couple of minutes so he actually hits really hard i mean really fast the height that i'm feeling right now is really good i don't feel like tired or anything like that actually feel like focus i have my body it is a little a little heavy i don't know why but i am feeling good definitely like i could sit down and start doing something without feeling sleepy or anything like that i feel a little bit energetic i think this is a really good daytime stream i feel like i could smoke a joint before work in a hurry not not work not having to worry about working slow or being like oh slow and tired or sleepy i feel like i want to do something so if i was at work i'll be working just as it should be working honestly this is my second bow i gotta say i am stoned and stoned this is not bad at all so if i have to like recap everything the boat looks really good it's dense has a great smell to it it has a undertone of diesel almost really good small terpenes full of crit trichromes everywhere as you saw in the pictures the bud even though it's already all burnt you can still taste the terpenes or the flavor of the cannabis after a couple of times lighting it up certain strains after the first hit each of three is like burnt cannabis this one even though the whole thing is burnt i was able to taste it i was it was like almost done with the bowl that's when i was starting to taste just burnt cannabis it's really smooth going down and going out no bad aftertaste really good taste actually it's like sweet for her it's like her earthy sweet uh taste to it it's really good you can smell and taste the terpenes so if i had to get this uh i would give it like eight leaves out of ten because it is a really good boat but i have better so we'll just give it eight leaves on this one well guys this is all i got for this review thank you so much for tuning in and watching don't forget there's a twitch channel twitch.tv slash clerk city i like to play games in there and get stoned as well we can hang out there if you guys want and if you liked the video hit the like button and if you really liked the video hit the sub button and i'll see you guys in the next one peace [Music] you", "v7V216UoT0A": "well in today's episode i'm going to be smoking a pre-roll this is from california so it's got one gram of calorie flour and point three of rosin you want to see what this does to us then make sure you check out this video hit the intro i'm about to smoke a 30 quid split i'm burping like it's a bunk all right yeah i'm good [Laughter] there's a good chance you're watching this and you're not subscribed to the channel i spend so much time making these videos and i'll be so grateful if you could just take a few seconds to hit that sub button okay now i'm shutting up hello and welcome to another episode of strangers my name is rizzler and look i've got a new person here what's your name man there's jack what's good people but also you could do it to me name is simba yeah it was a long time ago this is simba look at that give you a lion sound effect [Music] so i've got cindy here in the k which is very very rare do i get someone i have no friends but we've got a very special occasion because look at this peeps when do we get a pre-roll we never have a pre-roll so this is a pre-roll we'll be smoking on the channel right now it says bk for banana crush although that is not the case it's actually a runts one so what am i talking about let's get it out and have a look oh okay that's trouble okay there you go yeah yeah yeah this has one gram of cauliflower as i said the runts also to spice it up a little bit we've got a point free of rosin extract so what is rosin rosin is like a form of extract it's a uh sort of crystally waxy full spectrum extra extract so it gets the whole benefits of the entire flower and i've been told that rosin can really have like the most terpenes if you want to really have all the extracts if you want to taste the flavors of that that strain then rosin's the best way to go yeah apparently the best way to go again i'm not the um most uh uh knowledgeable on my extracts of really i'm more of a flower person yeah yeah exactly so uh we're gonna spot this up so let's do this also here about the um the way rosin is done it's done without any solvent so it's a lot cleaner yeah a lot more natural um this is what we like definitely definitely especially this day and age another little thing i want to say is the technique to get the rosin it's uh done with heat and pressure as opposed to this as i said the solvents so this is why it is so popular maybe the most popular of all the uh extracts won't you let me know in the comment section below what is your favorite extract is it the rosin please let us know it'd be nice to know i'm talking way too much we'll spark it up let's go you got a lighter oh yeah yeah how is this it's nice man yeah the only thing is yeah he's like because it costs so much you're appreciating every single nug a lot more like it's like it's a small child under your cow yeah gold dust in that zoo it tastes nice yeah yeah tastes real good yeah it is gassy fire mate this is really nice and you know what it's also burning quite quite well yeah is it kind of the sizzle at the end yeah i was getting scared because the rosin isn't going to be on one side is it mixed in is it going to burn properly but this is burning beautiful fine yeah look at that smoke anything similar and down before no although they did have some like i did see some moon rock spliffs well uh it was on the outside more or less i think this will work for show but they're on the outside so you can see all the all the um the keys and stuff like that i don't know where the wax was as well the wax of the extract was like in the um inside or the outside but yeah probably on the outside and that made the all the cave stick to it and you would have had the flower inside the slip i think that's more or less the moon oxidized in amsterdam [Music] seeing lots of these now in amsterdam actually yeah look at that they have extractions but i never got one of them neither did i next time no when the last team is in amsterdam oh i've only ever been in holland but never been to damn oh mate you went to holland and you knew amsterdam was there and i wanted to go there for like an educational trip it was more of like a holiday with friends oh friend um this is before i was a smoker oh okay yeah fair enough so i didn't really find all that appealing back then people actually do visit holland yeah and don't actually go to amsterdam beautiful country don't go there for smoke it's really weird i was out there i was in the trees in there having nice walks we stayed at a nice uh holiday park there's wicked water slides and stuff oh yeah if you find yourself out of damn there is actually other places in holland you wouldn't mind visiting so guys what is the most you've actually paid for a pre-roll because i know that i paid 30 quid for this but i have heard that spliffs are going around a lot more in fact i mean a few months ago i was hearing of maybe 40 45 spliffs 45 pounds that is not euros or dollars 45 pounds uh for a pre-roll that's crazy what is the most you've ever paid for a pre-roll do you buy pre-rolls in amsterdam because it's one of them things that i don't do most of the time they're just too packy isn't it a bit weird you can buy pre-rolls with tobacco and smoke them in a coffee shop but as soon as you make a joint with tobacco it's not allowed yeah it's made with cigarette [ __ ] tobacco as well look it's not anything i know i never get the pre-rolls garbage i never get the pre-rolls maybe a good video sugar leaf to make pre-rolls there was no battle in key for anything it was just sugar leaf garbage and the kuji has a mild joint with uh some marshmallow plants and the strong joints were just pureed how was tobacco look at it it doesn't look like a lot tobacco it's like almost like pipe kind of tobacco even the pure ones i'm not even bothered with to be honest and what it is with the pure ones they're usually all the mixture bits of all the last bits of strains that have collected up and they just put it all in one big go yeah that's a crab stick yeah yes it's gonna be like a crazy like you know yeah roller coaster of tastes and stuff like that that's yeah as you take as you take a pre-order yeah always a nice rollercoaster of taste no no no no no i just said we sometimes i've tried a few of them like oh that's so bucky you're really backing it's not worth the money you pay no they probably put like you know you know i'd say at best they put like a 50 50 ratio with bucky and and and flour and that's going to be doing that i think you need to be aiming around about 30 at the most 30 backyards 70 for the uh for the wii but let me know what your ratio is how much you put in a or how much you put in of flour or maybe you don't even [ __ ] around with the uh the baking you go straight pure flour i think this is is this pure flour i can't because we've got the rosie or not it's hard to tell it's an interesting discussion though but i don't notice if it's a pure one yeah usually it's like oh well it doesn't burn as well and it's not you know it's not as you know easy to take but this is very easy to take oh yeah and it's burning well which makes me think there's probably a little bit of tobacco in there do you think maybe i don't know who's putting the words in i don't know i don't know what you can see peeps sure we'll find out well i'll tell you why [Music] i'm talking way too much i'm smoking too much at some of that [Music] and smoking 30 quid splits every day definitely once in a while want to treat yourself yeah maybe this is a good option so on one side be careful [Music] yeah i'm good all right we've got a tray of action here somewhere man oh right yeah there is someone over there slightly occupied slightly full i'm sure you can use i'm sure you can find a bit of space in there mate thanks man you are still over there those things for sure is definitely powerful yeah yeah yeah this is a nice wake of bike in it you know i've had uh did i have a spliff today i thought i did maybe have a half a spliff you had office with earlier when i came around oh did i yeah then about half a splif but yeah apart from that this is like me going fresh in but that was only very small yeah oh you've got a lady near that tiny little bit in here yeah that was nothing that was nothing i'm sorry that's the only bit that i had today then um yeah that was nothing that's saying you forgot about last night no yeah that was it there was a tiny bit there that was it that's all i've had so not even look that and it's like three lugs that i've had before this so this is yeah i'm not gonna include that if you was at a house party and someone said oh my gosh would you be like what the [ __ ] would you know this is like you got your average spliff wouldn't you definitely it's um street like you know one obviously fellow weed smokers such as yourselves you don't tend to smell it too much unless just you know you haven't smoked it in a while or whatever this stuff here i could easily tell straight away from the rest so this bit here i'm taking logs in there it's like i'm taking mini dabs i've got mini dab vibes always do another one dabs is one thing i still haven't done either i have a lot of friends like the internet and stuff they're always telling me about how that's like greatest thing ever like like you guys in the uk you don't do that like what's wrong with you like i'm just like well it's hard to come by here you know i mean it's something i've always wanted to do have you seen my dab attempts i haven't known are they good awesome they're the best i'll check those out yeah you should check them out but i'll tell you what look this is why i'm sort of doing a dab but i'm not i'm worrying about all that bright thai apparatus that was the latin word go with that i think the latin word for rosin actually was something like geek foots keyframes bigfoot or greek foots seriously the latin word from a lot of strange names for things would you pay 30 quid for the spliff i think i would yeah yeah regularly more like a seasonal thing yeah you know i don't care what season it is it could be halloween for like i'll still buy that definitely i'm yeah i'm definitely mash up from this definitely we've smoked what a third a third of a split already don't quite mash up yeah like like like i've had maybe like two or three i think i have two or three spliffs straight away from waking up that's what i feel uh it takes me a while to get stoned yeah it does oh you're hard showing off because it does indeed i remember we were here when you're in your decks and it was just split up the space yeah yeah yeah yeah this is done this has done the job indefinitely i have a couple of warlocks this year and we'll just put this to rest for a bit [ __ ] you know the ones where you just got put down for a little bit just get your bearings yeah get your bearings lit some sugar in you cry inside have a dirty shower oh yeah good [ __ ] yeah okay no yeah i'm struggling to [ __ ] start the rest of this jesus man you got this man we got this going in see what's the same the resin how you feeling yeah you smash it nice mash up yeah yeah oh thanks man the only thing i struggled with really at the first was i hardly hear my throat that's very rare for me to see you do that oh i'm burping like it's a bunk i'm burping smoking's your throat real bad i'm sure it looks like i'm a bit more stone than i was when i first entered the cave definitely oh my life brilliant i'm strong in it it is good oh yeah oh i haven't had a smoke like this in a long whole time i don't think ever wow i know wow yeah yeah you're good though so i mean i thought you quit yeah i mean how much do we need to cost a per lug how many logs how many lugs would we take out of this this work 50p a lot i mean we take we take 50p a lug i haven't got the brain power right now to do the calculation for you but let's say we took did they say we took 100 lugs okay okay then surely 100 logs would that mean it cost us 30 p a lug does it work i'm too hard to work that out right yeah yeah i think it would be be 30 p.m like if we took 100 lugs yeah now are we taking 100 lugs out of that uh i don't think so maybe no maybe like [Music]

consistency is so important is cannabis affects everybody differently and different people have different likes and dislikes and needs for the medicine imagine if you went to your local Walgreens and you bought an advil you went back two weeks later and you got another bottle of advil and it didn't work people should be able to go and buy the same consistent quality medicine that's gonna have the same effect on them time after time I was vice president casino marketing and vice president casino operations at a casino on the Las Vegas Strip called the Tropicana you know in the gaming industry when one person wins someone has to lose and in cannabis it's not like that everyone wins we're at the holy dispensary on the Las Vegas Strip and now we're having our first true harvest so all the plants start out using asexual reproduction cut off of a mother plant then it's put into a clone dome and it's rooted in about seven to ten days then it goes into the veg cycle for about four to six weeks and then it goes into flower for about seven to ten weeks and post-production harvesting for another two to three weeks and then once that's complete then we take them in we weigh them we pack and then we deliver them to the stores we have a 54,000 square foot cultivation facility about 700 flowering lights the facility will produce roughly eight to ten thousand pounds of cannabis a year we achieve consistency on on factors that we can control the first factor is environment everyone that comes that works here wear scrubs it's a clean facility we have a fertilizer irrigation nutrient delivery system it measures humidity measures temperature it helps us monitor and make sure that the delivery of the nutrients are consistent to each plant it's everything it's very important to note that no two strains are the same that's where I guess more of the art comes in being able to know you know the nine pound hammer needs more to drink than the sour banana sherbert just about knowing the flowers that are in your garden if it's a game of roulette every time put you open your container with cannabis in it patients don't like that they want the same thing every single time

that actually mean to answer that question let's take a closer look at the endocannabinoid system to see exactly what it does what marijuana does to it and what that does to you spread throughout the brain the endocannabinoid system is a biological system made up of chemical messengers called endocannabinoids cellular receptors that communicate with endocannabinoids and enzymes that break down endocannabinoids after they've delivered their messages as endocannabinoids communicate with receptors throughout your body they create balance and help regulate many body and brain functions such as helping with memory coping with stress pain and anxiety and keeping hunger body temperature motor coordination and alertness in balance now let's see what happens when marijuana is introduced into this balancing system made from a plant called cannabis marijuana can be smoked vaporized or ingested through food or drink marijuana contains a chemical called tetrahydrocannabinol also known as thc since thc's chemical structure is similar to naturally occurring endocannabinoids the body allows thc to attach to endocannabinoid receptors in the brain when thc enters the body it overwhelms the endocannabinoid system attaching to cannabinoid receptors and throwing the body and brain off balance preventing endocannabinoids in your brain from doing their jobs endocannabinoids work like a well-conducted and highly synchronized orchestra with each one playing at a particular time and place in harmony when thc is introduced the precise coordination is lost and thrown off the endocannabinoids can no longer do their special job this means your brain will have a harder time regulating all of those functions like memory coping with stress and anxiety and motor coordination plus when using marijuana some people may experience fear anxiety paranoia or memory loss while allowing medical and recreational use of marijuana for adults are becoming more common in some states though not in others but as a young person with a still developing brain marijuana can have a stronger more harmful effect on you than adults in fact research has shown that young people who

"Transcriber: Rhonda Jacobs\nReviewer: Tanya Cushman Hello, Portland! (Applause) Can you guys hear me? Hello! And hello to everyone streaming -\nI know a few of you. Have you had your coffee? Are you ready? Alright. Good. Since you're already settled\nin your seats, I want you to lean in because today, I get to tell you a secret. And it's a secret that's been well kept\nfor almost 30 years. And I want to start\nby sharing with you a quick story about a revolutionary named Jill, so let's watch. (Video) Hello. My name's Jill,\nand I have Parkinson's disease. I've taken my Parkinson's\nprescription medication this morning, and this is how it helps ... and it doesn't. This is my oil - cannabis oil. And I'm just going to spread it\non the biscuit like that. It's been 20 minutes since I've had\nthat butter and the biscuit, and I feel wonderful. No shakes, no nothing. (Cheers) (Applause) Alright, so we're all happy\nJill got better, right? But you're probably wondering,\nHow is that possible? How is it possible that her well-researched,\nFDA-approved drugs aren't working for her but something else is? It's because there's\na secret system in your body that no one, like no one, \nis talking about. Now, we know these systems\nreally well, right? They're taught in every health,\nanatomy and physiology class between elementary,\nhigh school and medical school. You guys know these? Yeah, we have our circulatory\nand our pulmonary systems, our skeletal and muscular systems -\njust to name a few. And we all know about our nervous system,\nwhich we once thought controlled them all. But today, I'm going to talk to you\nabout this system. It's a system totally unlike,\nsupreme to and in control of all the rest. And it was completely left out\nof every single medical textbook I read despite its discovery 27 years ago. [W.T.F.] (Laughter) Right? I am not making this up. This is for real. So since it's not in the textbook,\nI'm going to share it with you today. I'm going to share with you\nthe real science and the real history of this system and how you can use it\nto take control of your health. But before I do, I want to share my story. So when I was a kid, I wanted\nto become a doctor like my parents. But as medical school approached and my parents reflected\non the changing medical field, my mom encouraged me\nto \"do something different\" with medicine. So I pursued a dual degree\nin medicine and business to become a doctor entrepreneur because we need entrepreneurs - we can change the world with our ideas, and I wanted to become\na world-changing doctor. Can't you tell? (Laughter) Yes! With that notion, I was eager\nand energized to learn. But what I learned deflated me. Because for me, the salient lesson\nfrom medical and business school was that big medicine is a big bureaucracy\nand paradoxical to health. It was a heavy, really weighty,\nethical dilemma that forced me to confront the dichotomy between wanting to become a healer\nbut becoming a drug pusher. I was training into a system pretty blas\u00e9 and disinterested in addressing\nthe root cause of disease and driven by patent medicine. This is not what I signed up for. And I was this close, literally,\nfrom walking away from medicine. But I found a family medicine program\nwith an integrative medicine track, and that provided me a lens\ninto ancient healing practices. Now, we benefit tremendously from the advancing technologies\nand innovations of today's medicine. But what I found was that people used to be great\nat healing themselves and others and doing so with natural substances\nand simple practices, like herbs and acupuncture\nand yoga and meditation and more. This wasn't witchcraft or voodoo, right? It wasn't then and it's not today. These healers knew what worked,\nand they had sound theories as to why; they just lacked the science. They lacked the biophysical model\ndemonstrating how, and it was hidden\nin this secret system all along. Are you guys ready to know what it is? (Audience) Yeah! Alright, so we're going to start\nwith a word clue. Can anybody pronounce this word? [Endo-can-nabi-noid] Okay, well, let's do it together. So for the benefit of the group,\nlet's sound it out. Ready? Endo can nabi noid. Endo can nabi - noid Endo - can ... Louder, Portland! Endo - can - nabi - noid Endo - can (Audience) nabi - noid (Whoops) Masterful. Yes. Thank you. So, yes, ladies and gentlemen, this secret system is what's known\nas the endocannabinoid system. Or ECS for short, so if I say that,\nyou know what I mean. And now, we get to really nerd out\nas I explain what it is and how it works. So the endocannabinoid system resides within all animals\nexcept the insect. It's a 600-million-year-old\nmessenger and receptor system integral to homeostasis,\nor the management of balance, within your body. From embryonic development\nto immunosurveillance, there is not a single\nfunction in your bodies that is not somehow influenced\nor modulated by the ECS. You can think of it as a switchboard functioning in and across\nall physiologic processes and organs, acting and reacting\nto internal and external stimuli to direct, correct\nand overall manage your health. Although a gross simplification, the endocannabinoid system\ncan be broken down into four core components. First up we have\nthe cannabinoid receptors, like CB1 and CB2 and counting. Next we have the ligands\nthat bind to those receptors and initiate an action\ncalled endocannabinoids, or body-made cannabinoids,\nlike anandamide and 2-AG. And we have the synthesizing enzymes that make these endocannabinoids\non demand when they're needed and the degradative enzymes\nthat break them down after they're used. And it works through something\ncalled retrograde signalling. So illustrated in this diagram\nis the route of an endocannabinoid that's made in a post-synaptic neuron in response to\nneurotransmitter stimulation. It then travels backwards,\nor retrograde, across a synapse, where it binds to a cannabinoid receptor\non the pre-synaptic membrane to initiate an action, in this case, blocking\nthe release of neurotransmitter. So let me break it down\na little bit simpler with an analogy. (Laughter) Yes. So let's say the endocannabinoid system is your dormitory\nor your apartment building, and your neighbor across the hall\nis making a lot of noise, and they're getting really loud. You just walk across the hall, and you politely ask them\nto turn the volume down. So you can imagine\nhow important this function is when cells are sending signals\nof stress, pain or inflammation. Like your noisy neighbor,\nthese processes need to be checked. And it's through this mechanism that the endocannabinoid system\nchecks these processes back into balance so that your body can relax,\nremember to eat, fall asleep, forget traumatic experiences\nand protect itself, along with a host of other mediating\nand restorative processes. The endocannabinoid system\nkeeps your body in balance. Up to now, you guys probably\nthought the brain was the boss, right? We all did. But the brain's not the boss. The endocannabinoid system is. And we had it wrong. So with all that said,\nyou guys might be confused why this really awesome system\nwas kept secret for so long. Well, I'd say that it probably has something to do\nwith the plant they used to discover it. So back in the '80s, researchers\nwanted to know how THC worked. And THC is a plant-made cannabinoid,\nor phytocannabinoid, found in cannabis, and it's responsible for the intoxicating\nand euphorogenic properties that cannabis is so infamous for. And using radio-tagged THC,\nthe endocannabinoid system was discovered as THC locked into and unveiled\nthis extensive receptor network concentrated throughout the brain\nand throughout the rest of the body. And THC did this because, they found out,\nit's a direct analog, or mimicker, of our own endocannabinoid, anandamide. And as an aside, anandamide,\nalso known as the bliss molecule, is what's really responsible\nfor the runner's high, not endorphins. Right? So if any of you have ever experienced\nthe euphoria that's come with exercising, that's your endocannabinoid system -\nthat's anandamide. And we're finding more, each day, about over 100 other phytocannabinoids\nfound in cannabis and other plants that mimic our endocannibinoids and have the potential to supplement\nor modulate the endocannabinoid system in therapeutic and healing ways. So this is where we're at: We have this incredibly\nmind-blowing system, and we have this plant - y'all, a plant - that works on this system\nin therapeutic and healing ways, so what I really hope\nyou're wondering right now is \"What's wrong with that?\" Alright, well, the answer lies within\nthe annals of American medical history, starting with two guys who really wanted to sell\na lot of prescription drugs. And in their heyday\nat the turn of the 20th century, American medicine was based\non homeopathy and herbal medicine, and naturopaths and chiropractors\nweren't \"getting down\" with patent drugs. So with the millions of dollars\nin their pocketbook, a document called the Flexner Report and the full force of state governments, American medical training\nwas consolidated and standardized in accordance with\npharmaceutical drug science to the exclusion\nof holistic care practices, natural substances and remedies\nand natural cures. And this created a system that made patentable pharmaceutical\ndrugs that treated symptoms easy to sell, and that made natural\nholistic care and practices and unpatentable\nplant medicine like cannabis fringe, quackery and illegal. What's surprising the most is that US physicians prescribed\ncannabis routinely to their patients well into the 20th century. Cannabis was once a top three\nmost commonly prescribed medicines, dwindling out of use\ndue to heavy taxation, the prosecution of the doctors\nwho prescribed it, and, finally, it being written out\nof the American pharmacopeia in 1942. You see, big business wrote my textbook. And I can only speculate that the endocannabinoid system\nwas kept secret for so long because its science validated the use\nof unpatentable plant medicine, like cannabis and other natural practices. But the pharmaceutical industry\nwasn't the only big business disrupting the once-free market of health. We Americans spend multiples\nof billions of dollars annually on unhealthy and low quality foods in addition to the prescription drugs\nwe reflexively depend upon, both of which are directly linked\nto endocannabinoid system dysfunction, which we now know is the precipitant\nto most chronic diseases. And as a result, Americans\nare getting sicker and sicker, riding around and round\non a Ferris wheel of big interests that we pay to ride. That doesn't make any sense. We're outsourcing the responsibility\nof our health to the bigs, and they're cashing in at our expense. Staying on this ride is a losing battle. But this can be the past ... if we reimagine our future. And in this future, all we need ... is love. (Cheers) (Applause) Yeah. (Applause) But the type of love\nthat I'm talking about ... is self-love. Because in the battle with the bigs, self-love is the revolution of one. Not until we start taking\ngood care of ourselves do we opt out of\nthe big business of disease. And the revolution of one\nis you choosing to live in balance, and the endocannibinoid system\nis your on-ramp. Now, as powerful and resilient\nas the endocannibinoid system is, it is not immune to aging\nor the assaults of modern living, like those unhealthy foods\nand chronic use of prescription drugs, environmental pollutants and toxins, emotional stress and how all of those things\ninterplay on our genetics. Now, I've just listed\nthe top five contributors to ECS dysfunctioning and disease, and they should be avoided. But caring for yourself\nand your endocannibinoid system requires a bit of understanding\nof what nurtures it and what restores it, and here are your tools: Eat real food because it provides the body\nwith what it needs for healthy cells and the raw materials for building\nthose endocannibinoids. Supplement with adaptogenic\nherbs and spices because they soothe and tone\nthe endocannibinoid system, aiding in balance restoration. Detox because it cleanses the body. It reduces inflammation and rids it of hamful toxins that abet\nendocannibinoid system dysfunction. Incorporate phytocannabinoids\nand cannabimimetic practices. Phytocannabinoids, like CBD and THC,\nwhen taken as whole plant cannabis, have shown helpful in diseases of endocannibinoid system\ndysfunction and wellness overall. And cannabimimetic practices -\nI know, that's another fancy word - like sleeping and exercise,\nyoga and meditation, deep breathing and prayer soothe and tone the endocannibinoid system as though they were\nsupplements themselves. And lastly, maintain\nhealthy relationships. The effects of personal relationships\nacross work, home, your social settings affect endocannibinoid system tone. And y'all, create reasons\nto smile and hug often. Because as it turns out,\nsmiling and hugging, part and parcel\nwith healthy relationships, triggers the release\nof your endocannibinoid anandamide, the bliss molecule. Now, as we're nearing the end of my talk, I know I've given you\na mouthful of information, and it might be a little overwhelming, but I really hope it piqued your curiosity\nand maybe sparked some inspiration as it did for me. And I and my family have been so compelled by the physiology\nof the endocannibinoid system and the care it requires that we're pioneering\nthe nascent fields of endocannabinology and cannabinoid medicine with many other scientists\nand clinicians worldwide. This is our calling. And affecting systemic change\nwith this system is what gets us up and going\nevery morning, and we're not going to stop\nuntil this information is in the textbook. Are you with me, Portland? Right? (Applause) (Cheers) I mean, this is life-changing information. (Applause) (Cheers) Yes. So I encourage us all\nto learn from our past and reimagine our future\n(Whispering) with this system. Because the secret to balanced health resides in the science and total care\nof the endocannibinoid system, and I can tell you\nlike we tell our patients that getting started\nis a lot simpler than you think. You just have to choose one. And you too can be a revolutionary like Jill. Thank you.

And it has a pretty prevalent place in our\nsociety, popping up in our media and on the news. Marijuana has long been considered a gateway drug gateway drug gateway drug Marijuana is a dangerous gateway drug. leading to the use of other, more addictive,\nand more dangerous substances. But what does marijuana actually do to to\nthe human brain? ...and body? And is it as dangerous as D.A.R.E. always\nled us to believe? This is drugs. This is your brain on drugs. Any questions? Well, marijuana has been legalized in several\nstates. And it\u2019s legal for medical use in several\nothers. So it\u2019s becoming more mainstream. In fact, it\u2019s legal right here in California. So we went to a local cannabis dispensary\nto talk to some experts in the field. So my name is Shelby. I am the assistant marketing director here\nat Torrey Holistics. Here at Torrey Holistics, we really try to\ndo a lot of education because that's ultimately where we are going to break down the stigma\nwhere people are going to realize the medicinal benefits of cannabis. Torrey Holistics opened as a medical dispensary\nin 2015. We were the first in the state to get our\nrecreational retail license, but we still serve medical and recreational alike. Marijuana use in the U.S. has a pretty interesting\nhistory. Early white colonists brought cannabis to\nNorth America to cultivate as hemp, which was used for making rope, clothing, and paper\nproducts. During the 1800s, it became popular as a medicinal\ntreatment, and \u201chashish houses\u201d flourished. Until 1906 when the Food and Drug Act required\nlabels on anything containing cannabis. Then, as Mexican immigrants began arriving\nin the U.S. following the Mexican Civil War, they brought recreational marijuana with them. Racist anti-immigration sentiment rapidly\nled to fear of the \u201cMarijuana Menace\u201d. In the 1930\u2019s, a string of very dubious\nstudies linked marijuana use to violence and crime. And states began to outlaw the narcotic. When Harry Anslinger, the Chief of the Federal\nBureau of Narcotics was appointed, they were going through a budget cut because of the\nGreat Depression. So to keep his title and keep funding for\nthe department, they actually kind of created this whole scare around cannabis. He started referring to it as \"marijuana\"\nbecause he knew that everybody was already consuming cannabis. It was in tinctures, you could buy at a local\npharmacy. And so the senators who were voting on this\nprohibition bill didn't realize that marijuana was the same thing as cannabis. So they effectively voted to ban the very\nsubstance that they were using for their own medical needs. Following the release of the famous film \u201cReefer\nMadness\u201d in 1936, the federal government passed the Marijuana Tax Act, effectively\noutlawing cannabis except in specific medical and industrial cases. For decades, despite new and better research\nindicating that marijuana isn\u2019t associated with violent crime and debauchery, marijuana\nuse was increasingly restricted. And the punishments for its possession and\nuse became more and more harsh. Anslinger first pushed it as, like, you know,\nlike you're going to be very lustful and you're going to do crazy things, it's a gateway drug. And then he actually changed his rhetoric\nlater in the century to be, like, cannabis as a lazy stoner drug. Like, you don't get anything done, you're\nnot contributing to society at all. This eventually led to all kinds of government\npolicies, like mandatory minimum sentences, a three-strikes policy, and President George\nBush\u2019s War on Drugs. These have had lasting and damaging effects\non many U.S. citizens and the public\u2019s perception of marijuana. You can learn more about the history of these\nlaws and their effects on our country\u2019s citizens by checking out the links in the\ndescription below. But then in 1996, that started to change. Medical marijuana was legalized in the state\nof California. And now, almost twenty years later, cannabis\nhas a pretty prevalent place in our society. Public perceptions and acceptance of cannabis\nhas definitely improved in the last several years. Especially in light of the opioid epidemic,\npeople are much more receptive to a lot of the research and findings coming out. So it might seem kind of weird that we actually\ndon\u2019t know very much about the risks or benefits of marijuana. See, even though it\u2019s becoming legal in\nmore and more states for recreational and medical use, cannabis is still outlawed by\nthe federal government, so it\u2019s heavily regulated and restricted. That means that it\u2019s difficult for scientists\nand doctors to get marijuana to actually use in their research. And without that research, it can be hard\nto say much about the possible dangers or benefits of using the drug. So what do we know? When you smoke a joint and get that high feeling,\nwhat\u2019s happening in your brain? Even that\u2019s not so simple. Cannabis has two major chemical components. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, and cannabidiol, or CBD. Plus smaller amounts of a whole bunch of other\ncannabinoid compounds. These molecules act on what\u2019s called the\nendocannabinoid system in the brain by binding to cannabinoid 1 and 2 receptors. These receptors were actually named after\ncannabis, because they were identified by scientists trying to understand how the drug\nworks. Both kinds of receptors are found throughout\nthe body, but CB1 receptors are the most common in the brain, found at the end terminals of\nneurons. The brain produces endocannabinoid compounds,\nwhich bind to and activate CB1 receptors. Cannabinoid receptors are g-protein-coupled\nreceptors, so when they\u2019re activated, it kicks off a cascade inside the cell that has\nsome effect downstream. In this case, that means modulating the signaling\nat the synapse. The molecular biology of this is actually\nreally really complicated, but in general, activating CB1 receptors has an inhibitory\neffect on the release of a variety of neurotransmitters including dopamine, GABA, glutamate, noradrenaline,\nserotonin, and acetylcholine. Our best understanding of the endocannabinoid\nsystem is that it plays an important role in regulating other systems in the brain and\nthroughout the body. In the brain, endocannabinoid signaling plays\na role in memory, cognition, pain perception, and motor movements. THC is considered a psychoactive compound,\nmeaning that it affects perception, cognition, or behavior. It binds to CB1 receptors, activating the\nendocannabinoid system, and inducing the feelings of relaxation and euphoria that are commonly\nassociated with cannabis use. As well as impairments in spatial and verbal\nmemory. Your license, where is your license? My license. It's on the bumper man, right back there,\nman. No, I mean your driver's license. Oh. Oh yeah, yeah, I've got my driver's license,\nman. Users of marijuana often report enhanced introspection,\nand sometimes feelings of anxiety or paranoia. Cannabis use can also lead to \u201cthe munchies\u201d. Feeling like you\u2019re hungry. Thought to be a result of the way THC is processed\nby the liver. CBD, on the other hand, is not a psychoactive\ncompound. It has the exact same chemical formula as\nTHC, but with a slightly different chemical structure. This means that it binds to the endocannabinoid\nsystem differently, and doesn\u2019t induce those psychoactive effects. But it\u2019s being explored for treating a variety\nof conditions, and is believed to be anti-inflammatory, like ibuprofen. Most notably, it\u2019s used to help prevent\nseizures in very severe types of epilepsy. And it\u2019s being explored for use in treating\nmigraines and anxiety. Speaking anecdotally, I have friends who swear\nby CBD for treating their migraines. So CBD has become more popular in research. And it's showing that it's a very powerful\nanylgesic, very powerful anti-inflammatory agent, and you don't need to experience any\npsychoactivity with it. So now you can consume cannabis without that\npsychoactivity that some people are kind of put off by. You can have the medicinal benefits alone. One thing I always like to say everywhere\nis that if you ever find yourself too high, say you took an edible that you're just feeling\noverwhelmed with, have some CBD on-hand. CBD will bring you down from that high. The products that are available for medical\nand recreational use contain different varieties of cannabis that have different effects. Some have higher levels of THC or CBD, and\ndifferent \u201cstrains\u201d are reported to have different psychoactive effects. Like how people say that indica is \u201crelaxing\u201d\nwhile sativa is \u201cstimulating\u201d. The difference between different strains like\nindica and sativa involves something called the \"entourage effect\", which we use very affectionately in this industry. It has to do with the over 113 different cannabinoids\nand terpenes in the cannabis plant. They play on each other in very unique ways. If you think about how many different sorts\nof combinations those cannabinoids have, all of these different regulatory compounds are working with each other to create a specific effect. How long the sensation lasts depends mostly\non how the cannabis is consumed. If it\u2019s smoked, it usually takes under three\nhours for the sensations to fade. But oral or edible doses can last much longer,\nwith some of the effects lasting up to 24 hours. The research on the therapeutic benefits of\ncannabis use are so far pretty optimistic. Though the studies are still plagued by small\ngroup sizes and restrictions on marijuana use. The long-term effects and risks of cannabis\nuse also depend on how it\u2019s used. Some risks are obvious. Like if you smoke cannabis, you\u2019re at an\nincreased risk of problems like chronic cough, bronchitis, a weakened immune system, and\nlung cancer. Unlike a number of other drugs, like alcohol\nor opioids, cannabis is not physically addictive. That means that if you stop smoking weed cold\nturkey, you might feel irritable, anxious, and have trouble sleeping, but it won\u2019t\nmake you sick. Or...kill you. It\u2019s also thought to be pretty much impossible\nto fatally overdose on cannabis. Last year, the National Institute on Alcohol\nAbuse and Alcoholism stated that 90,000 people died from alcohol-related causes. Whereas, with cannabis, there's never been\na reported incident of an overdose. So yes, it's much safer in that sense. Consuming an very large amount can lead to\nextremely unpleasant consequences, like psychotic episodes, but it won\u2019t directly cause death. But, that doesn\u2019t mean that using marijuana\ndoesn\u2019t come with other kinds of risks. Or that using marijuana can\u2019t have negative\neffects on other aspects of your life, like any kind of drug or addiction. Using marijuana during pregnancy is believed\nto carry risks like a low birth weight and possibly other developmental problems. Though it\u2019s difficult to say if these\neffects are definitely a result of marijuana use or other external factors. If a person starts using marijuana as a teenager,\nbefore their brain has finished growing and developing, it can have long-term effects\non cognition and memory. Researchers have done small studies using\nMRI scans to look at brain structure in adults in their 20\u2019s with people who are diagnosed\nwith a cannabis use disorder... basically meaning that they use a lot of weed,\nand it has negative effects on their lives... and people who don\u2019t use cannabis at all,\nand found that teenagers who smoked pot daily had abnormally-shaped hippocampi and did worse\non long-term memory tasks compared to non-users. Some research has found that heavy cannabis\nuse starting during adolescence can have long-term effects on dopamine signaling in the brain. Dopamine is a chemical that plays important\nroles in reward and motivation as well as movement control. Scientists think that this is likely due to\nheavy marijuana use interrupting normal brain development, resulting in problems with the\nwiring and leading to problems down the line. And in general, people who use a lot of weed\nhave issues with verbal memory and cognitive tasks. Pretty much all of this research has been\ndone in people who use a lot of cannabis. Like, every single day, for extended periods\nof time. So far, we don\u2019t know much about the possible\nrisks of just occasional usage, like in social settings or on the odd weekend. Our view of cannabis use at Torrey Holistics\nis that moderation is key. With anything. You drink too much coffee, you're going to\nget a stomach ache. If you use too much cannabis, you could have\nmemory impairment. But it all comes down to just consuming responsibly. In places where marijuana is legal, it\u2019s\ngenerally pretty easy to access. There are storefront dispensaries where you\ncan talk to \"bud tenders\" and shop for your favorite varieties. Or online sites that allow you to order products\nfor delivery to your front door. But even where it\u2019s legal, there are some\nrestrictions. It\u2019s highly taxed, for one thing, and you\nmust be over 21 to purchase it recreationally, or over 18 to get a medical marijuana card. Cannabis in California, at least, is more\nregulated than the food we're eating. If it's grown on a farm, maybe a mile down\nthe street from another farm that uses pesticides, the labs will pick up on that and it won't\nbe able to be sold. So the cannabis you're consuming, as long\nas it's from a legal, licensed dispensary, is very very safe. And while some surveys indicate that more\nthan half of all Americans have tried cannabis at some point in their lives, around 163 million people, only 4 million people would classify as having\na cannabis use disorder, a rate of about 3%. In contrast, about 5-6% of Americans who try\nalcohol during their lifetime will become addicted. This could be because it\u2019s just generally\nmuch easier to access alcohol than it is to get weed. And we might see those numbers changing if\nmarijuana continues to become more mainstream in the U.S. And remember how marijuana is considered a\n\u201cgateway drug\u201d? While it\u2019s true that marijuana users are\nmore likely to abuse alcohol and nicotine than non-users, the majority of people who\nuse marijuana will never go on to use \u201charder\u201d substances, like opiods. And even when marijuana users do use harder\ndrugs, it\u2019s at the same rate as people who use other already-legal drugs, like alcohol\nand nicotine. So it\u2019s not an effect of cannabis, so much\nas it\u2019s an effect of any drug that affects the reward systems of the brain. There's a misconception that cannabis is a\ngateway drug. And they're finding now that it's actually\nan exit drug. It can be very helpful, actually, in people\nstruggling with addictions. I see the cannabis industry fulfilling the\nneed for alternative forms of pain management. With the opioid epidemic, I think that a lot\nof people are seeking alternative forms of relief. And they're finding that with cannabis. Ultimately, we know that cannabis is a very\ncomplicated plant with complex chemical components. And we don\u2019t fully understand its effects\non the human brain or the long-term risks or benefits of its use. Scientists are hard at working on studying\nthis topic, trying to better understand the chemistry and neuroscience of cannabis as\nit continues to be legalized in more states and becomes more popular nationwide. I'm so excited about the research coming out. Like I was saying, there's so much to be done. Over 113 different cannabinoids that we've\nonly just touched on. So I think that the findings are just going\nto continue to show the medicinal qualities of cannabis. Because it\u2019s still federally outlawed, there\nare a lot of complicating factors in its use and study. Like it might be legal to use cannabis in\nyour state, but you could still lose your job if your employer has a zero-tolerance\npolicy. One issue that I think about a lot is the\nfact that we don\u2019t really have the marijuana equivalent of a breathalyzer to quickly determine if someone is currently under the influence of cannabis or not. That means that unless a police officer actually\nsees a person using weed, it\u2019s really difficult to know if someone is committing a DUI. Because a person might test positive for cannabis\neven many hours and days after its use. At any rate, it seems likely that marijuana\nis at least as \u201cokay\u201d as any other currently legal substance available to the public. That whole \u201creefer madness\u201d thing was\njust propaganda. We must work untiringly so that our children\nare obliged to learn the truth. Because it is only through knowledge that\nwe can safely protect them. So if you live in a place where marijuana\nhas been legalized, enjoy responsibly. Do you have strong feelings about marijuana\nlegalization or its use? What concerns do you have as it becomes more\nprevalent in our society? Or what benefits do you think it might offer?

Over and out.", "nsfVk-Ixss8": "delta 8 is one of the hottest new products on the market and a lot of people say it makes them feel great without any of the negative side effects well i have some right here and we're about to put this stuff to the test and see what it can really do what's up and welcome back to the strain show if this is your first time here this is the channel where you can learn new fun facts about weed every week so don't forget to subscribe so you can put some nuggets of knowledge into your strain brain my name is matt i'm a medical cannabis patient a cannabis industry employee i love to learn about weed and today we're learning all about delta eight thc first we're gonna cover what delta eight thc actually is then i'm gonna show you all the cool stuff that the studies and research have shown that delta 8 can do then i'm going to try some super fat dabs of this delta 8 thc full spectrum distillate and see if it can get a true smoker like myself high or if this is all just hype let's go delta 8 thc is a cannabinoid produced in small amounts by cannabis plants just like cbd and it's very similar to the more common delta 9 thc that we all know and love since delta 8 occurs naturally in very small amounts in most plants selective breeding combined with extraction and isolation are typically used to make delta 8 products and extracts delta 8 is sold in various different products and it's usually marketed to have all of the same high of weed without any of the negative side effects now when we think of thc we normally think of delta 9 thc that's the one we all love that cannabis plants grow in large amounts the main form of thc delta 9 is so common that we usually don't even specify it as being delta 9. we usually just say thc but that's not the only kind of thc there are actually a few like when you eat edibles metabolites in your liver convert the delta 9 thc into something called 11-hydroxy thc 11-hydroxy thc is much more potent than delta-9 and this along with a few other reasons is why edibles can make you feel so much higher and so much different but 11-hydroxy thc doesn't even exist naturally in cannabis plants it's only formed in your stomach after you eat thc but delta 8 thc is different delta 8 does occur naturally in a cannabis plant and on a molecular level it's very similar to normal thc many people claim that delta 8 gives them a more clear-headed high while others say it makes them feel more energized or motivated rather than couch-locked they like the fact that they can still get all the medicinal benefits without getting too high or feeling anxious and we are learning more about these effects and more about delta 8 thc with every new study that is published and we have already learned some really interesting things we know that delta 8 binds to the same cb1 receptors in the brain as delta 9 and studies have shown that it shares a lot of the same medicinal benefits of regular thc as well as some from cbd with a high that might actually be more enjoyable for some people there have been studies published on delta 8 thc in 1994 2008 and 2014 but a study published through medjin sums it up best when they described delta 8 thc as an analog of tetrahydrocannabinol with antiometic anxiolytic appetite stimulating analgesic and neuroprotective properties and if you're not a damn scientist that means that these researchers found that delta 8 had the properties of anti-nausea anti-anxiety pain relief it could protect your brain cells and it could stimulate your appetite these researchers also found that delta 8 thc exhibits a lower psychotropic potency than delta 9 meaning that it won't get you as high as you would normally get from the same amount of thc these scientists just keep showing us that we still have a whole lot to learn about this crazy plant and all of the things this one plant can do for us but i want to see if this delta 8 will do anything to someone who is an everyday smoker like me with a high tolerance now for this little test we have this delta 8 thc full spectrum distillate this stuff pretty much looks like regular distillate it looks really good sort of like honey i don't smell much of a smell off of it yet and if i get close to it there's still not much of a smell at all i really can't smell anything so for this test i wanted to see what this delta 8 would do to someone who smokes weed every day and who already has somewhat of a tolerance but i did want to make sure that what i was feeling from this delta 8 was just from this delta 8 so i've gone a full 24 hours without using any cannabis products what we're going to do is hit two fat abs out of the turp slurper we're going to give it 10 minutes and then see how we feel right now i'm not high at all and so it will be very noticeable if i get stoned from this but i don't know i'm dabbing regular thc all the time so we'll see let's scoop one of these out and see what it looks like where's my dab tool okay wow it's hard to get a dab out of here this stuff is very thick and very stiff it's like super cold honey okay we got a fat dab put our pearl on got my close-up cam here we go delta eight thc [Music] so [Music] oh it's crazy huge dab no taste like no flavor at all just smoke or vapor whatever it is when you dab but no taste it's crazy all right we're gonna dunk this and clean the banger and hit one more fat dab and we'll see how we feel wow it's so stringy look how long it is that looks like a fat dab all right dab number two here we go [Music] so [Music] it's crazy like there's no taste to this stuff at all but besides that everything else seems like a regular dab but it's just crazy how there's no flavor especially since it says full spectrum but that sort of makes sense because a lot of time distillates don't have a lot of flavor but let's give this 10 minutes and see if we get stoned so it's been about 10 minutes since our two delta 8 thc dabs and after 24 hours of not smoking anything i can definitely tell that i'm stoned i'm like pretty good in stoned actually i think if i would hit two huge dabs like that of delta nine that a i would have coughed for ever and b that i would be a good deal more high than i am right now but nevertheless i am stoned off these two dabs and the only other real differences i can tell is that the oil itself is really really sticky and really thick almost like if you took honey and put it in the refrigerator and also there was no taste and not just like a light taste or almost no flavor it was like no taste at all it was sort of crazy and since this stuff does get you high and a lot of people say that it does it without the side effects from regular thc this stuff could be really popular because you can buy this all over the united states but recreational weed is still illegal in a bunch of places but did you know that they're now actually growing cannabinoids in petri dishes in a lab in an attempt to completely replace weed plants altogether you can learn more about that in this video right here or you can watch this playlist for more fun dabbing videos and don't forget to subscribe for good vibes

been to other inpatient programs I just never got anywhere with his research online led him to a unique substance abuse treatment program remedy recovery in San Francisco south of market I thought wow this is great that that this is an option now it replaces cannabis for opioids it's a game changer Joe shrank the clinical social worker who founded remedy of recovery says cannabis offers a more

debilitating neck pain anxiety and insomnia I have the opportunity to go to job interviews and to meet people and network Schrank adds cannabis is safer than opioids with far less potential for a deadly overdose there are examples of people who have had accidents while under the influence of cannabis but the misuse potential is extraordinarily low in fact the Journal of the American Medical Association reports in states that legalized medical and recreational pot opioid use is down 7% and fatal opioid overdoses have dropped nearly 25 percent but skeptics say it's not clear if cannabis is the reason for the decline clinical psychologist dr.

5 make sure the doctors say there is very little bonafide research on whether cannabis helps with the opioid addiction it's partly because marijuana is still illegal under federal law so federal grants won't pay for the studies", "yf8YU8jyDnc": "hey guys dr frank here the founder of addiction mindset recovery coaching programs we help people quit nicotine thc products energy drinks and other drug addictions including gambling pornography social media gaming and alcohol so we're going to jump into this video today talking about the 12 signs or 12 questions that you can ask yourself to help you determine if you are addicted to marijuana or thc containing products people ask me all the time on my channel hey how do i know if i'm addicted to marijuana is it a dependency is it an addiction are they the same thing if you guys watch my channel you know i say dependency has a shadow and that shadow is addiction right so we're going to talk about 12 questions these 12 questions are taken right from marijuana anonymous i put the link below for the website it's a support group just like you have alcoholics anonymous like you have narcotics anonymous there's enough people addicted out there to marijuana that there is now a marijuana anonymous so we're going to go through these 12 questions and if you answer yes to even one of these questions you might need to consider that you're struggling with a marijuana addiction so let's start right off the bat question number one has smoking pot stopped being fun this is a really important question in my opinion when it comes to marijuana addiction a lot of people romanticize about the good times when it comes to smoking about the fun they were having with friends about the the past times the good old times but the reality of your situation right now might not be that and for a lot of people who are addicted to marijuana it's very very hard to accept that the good times might have ended these might be really really bad times right now that you're stuck in really depressing times addiction is a depressing place so has smoking pot stopped being fun yes or no do you ever get high alone question number two so a lot of people are going to answer yes to this question and i would you could probably argue that if you answer yes this doesn't mean your addiction a lot of people probably smoke alone but i'll tell you the dangers of getting high alone or the dangers of this life and trying to become successful in life is about making connections and a lot of those connections are social connections they're networking connections right it's not what you know but it's who you know in life so if you're starting to live a very isolated life and you have goals and you have ambitions and you have dreams and you're an entrepreneur you want to be an influencer you want to build a business whatever goals you may have probably require a degree of networking social influence and just you can't live in isolation you can't live in isolation in today's world if you want to go accomplish big things you have to have those social skills so getting high alone i think can be a very very dangerous thing okay question number three is it hard for you to imagine life without marijuana i remember when i first started smoking i said to myself i am never not gonna smoke i was all in on the lifestyle the stoner lifestyle i had a pax vaporizer i had a one hitter i had a bowl i had a bong i had a volcano vaporizer and then eventually went into the dab pens and the carts but i i i remember telling myself i'm never gonna quit and i remember being at an age throughout high school college and early adulthood even right up to the age of about 28 saying i'm never going to quit this drug it's an incredible thing i don't want to live without it um unfortunately that was a lie that i was telling myself that was a lie question number four do you find that your friends are determined by your marijuana use dan pena motivational speaker show me your friends and i'll show you your future so if you have big dreams for your your future if you have big goals that you hope to achieve and you you're struggling with an active addiction and you're surrounding yourself with people that promote and encourage that active addiction you you might want to start to question that are you choosing your friends based on your use and if so i would question even more importantly what people are you blocking out of your life what people are you neglecting what people are you isolating yourself from that could potentially be leading you to that next opportunity that next step so question number five do you use marijuana to avoid dealing with your problems a lot of people use drugs to cope i know based on the tick tock videos a lot of people use marijuana to escape reality to cope with problems whether it's anxiety depression and i'm not talking about people using marijuana for medical uses although they still might be addicted to it and the addiction might outweigh the medical benefits i'm not talking about that i'm talking about do you smoke do you use marijuana to avoid dealing with your problems so what are these these problems that you're avoiding dealing with it is this is it a school project is it a work project is it an anxiety that you're suffering from is it a depression that you're suffering from obviously using a substance doesn't fix any of these things in fact i bet if you think about it it's only making these problems worse people say i smoke because i had a stressful day at work well maybe you have work that you're supposed to be doing when you come home i smoke because i don't have money and i'm stressed about finances well maybe you shouldn't be spending your money on this maybe you should be investing your money into something that's going to move that needle forward for your future career for your future self um i always ask myself when i look at an addiction how is this addiction going to get me to where i want to be in life just something to think about do you use pot to smoke with your feelings question number six kind of like we talked about in question number five look a lot of people use marijuana and they say it helps with the anxiety it helps with the depression yet they're still suffering from anxiety and they're still suffering from depression especially those individuals who at this point where marijuana is actually making them sick remember marijuana is a biphasic drug at too low of an amount and won't do anything at too high of an amount it could cost the opposite effects so if you're taking it for anxiety it can actually trigger anxiety attacks in an individual who's using too much i know i certainly was using it to cope with my feelings very dangerous question number seven do you use marijuana to let you live in a privately defined world i never really understood this question i would say this relates closely to isolation do you ever get high alone are you living in a privately defined world i can't talk about that one a lot because i can't relate to it question number eight have you ever failed to keep promises you made about cutting down or controlling your use of marijuana so the answer is probably yes if you're watching this video you're trying to take a tolerance break and you only make it through the first one or two days you only make it for a week and you want it to go through for a month um this is a clear clear sign of addiction this is a clear symptom of addiction you say you're going to stop you tell other people you're going to stop and you don't and i'm going to warn you this is an extremely dangerous thing when it comes to addiction because when we say something and we don't see it through we start to train our brain to accept a lack of success if i say i'm going to do something i want to do it and i want to make sure i give it my best shot because that's ultimately what's going to lead to success in life that never give up attitude if you look at elon musk uh jeff bezos people just the the great people in life who have accomplished things um amazingly huge things people have changed the world they they saw it through they they don't stop they don't give up um and if we're constantly going back on promises that we make to ourselves that wears away at us over time it takes a lot from you mentally and physically question number nine has your use of marijuana cause problems with memory concentration or motivation were you once a great athlete were you once a phenomenal student were you once the the person that remembered everything about everyone which made you more sociable a better individual to be around have you noticed issues in those areas are your grades suffering is your work life suffering are you constantly not knowing where you put your keys or your wallet in the morning clear signs of addiction okay question number ten when your stash is nearly empty do you feel anxious or worried about how to get more are you constantly asking your plug hey are you around i really need some this weekend are you constantly nervous about your stash and how hard are you working to maintain maintain that stash how much time are you putting into going to pick that stash up how much are you overpaying for that stash in times of drought or in times of need something to think about question number 11 do you plan your life around marijuana use if the answer is yes this is probably one of the most important questions on here you should be planning your life around the future that you want to create for yourself and i know you probably dream big i know you're probably an ambitious person i know that success is definitely in the sober version of you future your future if you're planning your life around marijuana use you're not planning your life around your goals you're not planning your life around your ambitions and your motivations you're planning your life around chasing an addiction and not an ambition so planning your life around marijuana use means you're not planning your life around other things that may be very very big opportunities for you or things that you truly cherish and value question number 12 have your friends or relatives ever complain that you're using is damaging your relationship with them this is a great question have you lost relationships due to your marijuana use have maybe your use is holding you back from discovering that amazing relationship we always tell people before you get into a good relationship especially when you're in recovery when you're quitting a substance you have to focus on healing yourself before you're going to be able to connect with someone else at least for uh you know long-term stability purposes so how many times have you lied to family members how many times have you lied to your spouse your boyfriend your girlfriend your parents about marijuana use that constant line eventually

everyone and welcome back to hello hi for another quick and easy cannabis recipe today i have a special treat for everyone that loves strawberries just like me we are making strawberry milk chocolates using infused coconut oil we're also adding freeze-dried strawberries to make the chocolate taste like it really has fresh strawberries added to it so let's get started you'll need white chocolate wafers dark chocolate wafers freeze-dried strawberries can of coconut oil strawberry flavoring cocoa powder and candy molds pour the freeze-dried strawberries into a plastic bag and use your hands or glass to crush the strawberries until you have both fine and small pieces i'll make sure i leave the link below for the strawberries i bought them on amazon but you can get them from your local supermarket make sure you leave some small chunks so each bite tastes like you bit into a fresh strawberry when you're finished put them aside gradually add the white chocolate wafers to a double boiler on low heat and stir every few minutes until the chocolate is melted make sure you stir up chocolate often until it has a smooth creamy texture so it doesn't start to burn once the chocolate is melted add one teaspoon of strawberry flavoring and stir for a couple minutes until combined now you want to make sure you watch this whole video because i'm infusing both the white chocolate and the dark chocolate for this recipe and you don't want to miss a step and if you haven't already give this video a thumbs up subscribe to my channel and turn on those notifications so you don't miss any of my videos two tablespoons of infused coconut oil to the chocolate and stir until combined then grab those freeze dried strawberries and add them to the chocolate too use a spoon or a piping bag and fill your molds three quarters full make sure you don't fill them to the top because you won't have any room for the milk chocolate you want to fill your molds pretty quickly before the chocolate starts to set and with this recipe i made about 30 chocolates after you fill your molds make sure you shake and tap each one lightly on the counter to make sure they're smooth and evenly set in the molds put the chocolates in the refrigerator for about one hour and let's start infusing the milk chocolate add one cup of dark chocolate wafers to a double boiler on low heat and stir until melted next add one teaspoon of cocoa powder to the dark chocolate this step is optional i like to add cocoa powder because it gives it cuts the bitterness in the dark chocolate and gives it a sweeter taste but make sure you stir the chocolate until the cocoa powder has dissolved now pour in that last tablespoon of coconut oil and stir until it's combined now we're going to grab those molds out of the refrigerator and let's add the chocolate on top pour the chocolate in each mold over the strawberry chocolate but make sure you fill the molds to the top and tap each mold when you finish so the bottom of the chocolates will be smooth put the chocolate in the refrigerator for about an hour after an hour your chocolate should be ready to take out the molds you can get really creative with these molds you can get some that got roses and weed leaves and all different types of stuff but i'll make sure i put the link below for where i got these modes on amazon now each chocolate should pop right out of the molds with ease if you try to pop one out and it's difficult they may not be ready and then just put them back in the refrigerator for about another hour we are finished and thank you for watching this whole video and if you haven't already give this video a thumbs up and subscribe below but before we end this video oh my god these chocolates i'm gonna have to pan this camera down so you can see these chocolates because they are amazing now you know i had to put the leaf in there too but do you see these chocolates look how you can almost see the strawberries in the chocolate and when you bite on into that it's going to taste like strawberries and then we got the chocolate on the other side these came out great and thank you guys for watching this video and i'll make sure i leave all the links below for the flip the flavoring and the freeze-dried strawberries um and for the chocolate and the molds everything will be down low and i'll see you on the next video",

textiles medicine and food but what is the difference between it and marijuana here to answer that question please welcome medical doctor and health coach dr. Elaine chin and naturopathic doctor and I mean my goodness we're hearing CBD THC we're hearing it all the time so it's nice for us to just sit down and get a definition of the difference between hemp and marijuana so I'll start with you doc what's the difference well definitely it's all confusing because you've got common names and then you've got scientific names so cannabis is a scientific name and marijuana and hemp is what we call common names okay so I think let's just leave it that because we're not doing biology 101 today okay and both of these plants or all these cannabis plants produce a combination of THC or CBD and they're the active ingredients that we get the stimulation or the relaxation effects okay so there's a difference though between the CBD and the THC and what would that difference be well one is what we call psychoactive such as the tea tea and one would say CBD is generally the one that's not addictive and is calming and you'd never get really high on that you wouldn't okay but you might from the THC you technically you do let's talk about how hemp impacts our bodies and I'm gonna throw this one to you Elizabeth great so as Elaine mentioned both the hemp and the cannabis the marijuana they all contain cannabinoids so you've got your THC and hemp it's very low less than 0.3% so there's none of the psychoactive effects your body also makes its own set of cannabinoids to bind to your brain and to different receptors in your body so they have the effect of regulating hormones and of maintaining overall body balance or homeostasis okay so if people are concerned with things like nausea inflammation chronic pain then hemp can be a really great solution that doesn't have any other psychoactive effects okay interesting so I actually I got you took a swab from me dr. Chynn just the cheek swab and it was you know it was very easy in order to give me an exam and to test me to see what the impact would be of CBD right CBD and THC okay so we got my exam results everybody and they were incredibly boring what did it say and we're being truthful here yeah I've got the right here she's boring because she's normal yeah yeah it's like cannot be normal metabolizer normal metabolizer average average and average this would have killed me in grade six what that fundamentally means is that if I gave you a dose regardless of it's a THC CBD combination or one or just the other for different reasons I would give you the normal standard dose and I would expect a normal metabolism rate and a normal effect rate of how you break down your THC or CBD okay and then we also looked at the psychoactive our anxiety side effect risk factors for you yeah you don't have it yeah and equally important you don't have the effects of a THC dependency risk factor the reason why you would administer or take part in an exam like that would be in order to see how you're going to take on and metabolize it something like CBD or th there's a lot of patients are wondering this is right for me so now we're gonna bring slides into this conversation to say if you're not sure let's look at your genetic predispositions and we also in our office measures something called neurotransmitters which are your brain chemicals okay is the impact of THC and CBD so we'll know what to give you more or less of okay do you have is there such thing as like an average dose that you would start out with if someone had average results yes so most prescribing physicians will start at the lowest dose and titrate you up just to be careful another thing worth mentioning is the the form that you take it in so if you're taking it sublingually under your tongue or in your mouth you're absorbing up to up to a hundred percent more than if you're taking it orally and you're actually ingesting or eating it the potency in eating something is vastly reduced so the four makes it each difference so what are the main benefits do you think Elizabeth like why would people turn to a CBD or a THC or hemp products yeah the main benefits are I mean all the cannabinoids have different profiles and so the product that you're getting is dependent upon the cannabinoid and also another class of molecules called terpenes upon the profile of those but the main benefits are they're anti-inflammatory they could help with sleep with mood with brain conditions those are the big ones and also gut health nausea you know cachexia or difficulty with weight loss around cancer there's all kinds of benefits and more being released as the data comes out any warnings that people should be aware of before they decide that they want to go pursue this as a you know as a remedy i would say go to a physician that prescribes cannabis rather than just go to a recreational snoring like wing it right make sure you with a doctor they know what they're doing they've done this before yeah and I understand a lot of people are saying well my family doctor is dismissing it it's only because I think they haven't got that time yet to kind of do the research do the information so but some of it is prescribing anything else we should know give it a go if traditional medical drugs aren't working for you okay good that's good information thank you for clarifying a lot of that for us both of you", "MDbXwt3lZwI": "tell us a little bit more about what this partnership with jay-z will entail and what you expect it to add to the company from a business standpoint sure thanks so much for having us we're so excited to be partnering up in a multi-year agreement with with mr. Shawn Carter as our chief branch strategist he's obviously a creative genius Andy he's a cultural icon and we've had so much respect for his you know past success that he's had in businesses so we're really looking forward to - mr. Carter really helped in kaliba take our brand to the next level we've really been known as the number one brand in California and we are certainly making no small plans so we look forward over the next couple years to really working with him and bringing the brand out in a national basis okay so that you just mentioned that you have no small plans what are those plans and I guess how does this partnership speak to how you'll get those plans executed yeah absolutely so today we are really known as one of the number-one brands in cannabis in California we've had the top-selling flower in the state the top-selling vape pens in the state one of the top brands in the state and we continue to seek to be the most trusted name in cannabis in California but we obviously have aspirations to go beyond California into other states over the next couple years and we really believe that you know mr. Carter's creative genius and and his ability to to really have the pulse of what a cultural movement is we'll be able to help kleva do that we really believe that people are looking for plant based solutions to be able to really change out their natural health and wellness options to live a better life and we're very passionate about bringing that not only to all Californians but everyone nationwide Dennis obviously a lot of consolidation in your space I'm wondering if you have any shots on canopy CEO Bruce Linton being fired from the company that he created does that make you think twice or think differently about a potential merger acquisition with a big you know CPG player or otherwise it doesn't make us think in any differently vehicle IVA are an independent company and we continue to look and seek to be an independent company and we are growing organically extremely quickly as regard in regards to I would say you know others in the in the industry who have been out there both in Canada and and before us we have a lot of respect for what they've built but we're really focused on building again the most trusted name in cannabis we're doing that organically our growth trajectory is extremely fast and we're just trying to keep up with our own growth and really focused on that Dennis I want to get your thoughts art CNBC's Melissa Lee just released an incredible documentary and investigation today taking a look at the black market in California given the fact that we do have all of this legislative red tape you have these high taxes and it has really not hindered or hurt the black market within that states what is for you as a legal purveyor of cannabis what is the cost of doing business there and how much of a risk is that black market to future business yeah I think you bring up a really good point California specifically is a very tough market it is the largest cannabis market in the world it's almost 35 percent of the entire US market and its really tough to compete and win here manat only it does though is the black market there but for a legal market the taxes are high the regulation is is behind trying to keep up with the with the amount of change that's why you know we believe at kleva our growth in terms of outperforming the market we're very proud of what we've accomplished and what we're moving forward with in what we call the fun for you market which is really subject to the flower black market our prices of flower have actually gone up versus down because we find discerning consumers who are looking for a trusted brand and a trusted service and tested product have sought out indoor flower we're the number one indoor flower brand in the state of California and I think that's why our business continues to outperform the market you you", "AsHXOcp-bdU": "EVENING EVENING I'M EVENING I'M ERIN EVENING I'M ERIN RIGHT.

Tell them if you use cannabis. A recent study found cannabis responded differently to anesthesia medicine than non-users. Marijuana we know has sedative effect. It can also interact with anesthesia, so it's so very important just to be open and honest with your anesthesiologist if you are a user. And it really doesn't matter if you're smoking it, eating it, or using other methods to consume cannabis, talk to your doctor. Interestingly anesthesia drugs, they help people fall asleep during surgery, they help you stay relaxed during a conscious, what we call twilight sedation. But some doctors do say that the cannabinoid receptors, they may suppress the activity of other receptors in the brain, where those anesthetic drugs are meant to interact. And it's so important to be honest, because nowadays that cannabis has been legalized in so many parts of the country, we'll forget right? 'Cause doctors say what medicines do you take? As a supplement or, an over the counter which it is, medication so, and that's not the case. We need to know and we don't judge. We need to know everything that you're on before surgery.\nAlcohol. Supplements.\nCannabis. Well even like herbal supplements, yeah. You're healing.\nVitamin C, vitamin E. Fish oil, they all make you bleed. In this study it actually took three times the amount of one common anesthetic drug which is called propofol, to sedate people properly if they were regular cannabis users. So that's a big deal. You don't wanna wake up during your procedure because it didn't work. Good stuff. And again, I just wanna let you know how much I care about the two of you. Aw.\nThank you so much. We care about you too Travis. Should we talk more feelings? Just, I wanna stay connected. Yeah, I will. I wanna be, I do not want there to be any intimacy issues between the three of us.

SINCE 2015, THE INDEPENDENTLY ACCREDITED AND STATE CERTIFIED LAB HAS BEEN TESTING CANNABIS IN ILLINOIS.

SOME OF THE CONTAMINATING THC COULD START TO ACCUMULATE IN TISSUES. CHUCK: IN ALL EIGHT SAMPLES, THC SAMPLES MET THE LEGAL LIMIT, BUT IN TWO OF THE HEMP EXTRACTS, TECHNICIANS TELL THE I-TEAM THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF CANNABINOIDS INCLUDING THC WAS HIGHER THAN STATED ON THE LABEL. >> YOU MIGHT RUN INTO THE PROBLEM WHERE YOU HAVE TWICE AS MANY METABOLITES IN YOUR SYSTEM AND THAT COULD STILL CAUSE YOU TO FAIL A DRUG TEST.

have a very exciting video that's been highly requested and I'm sorry it was taking so long I'm going to be showing you guys how I make my extra strong green dragon picture this photo has one cup of liquid and 10 grams of wheat and then I reduced it to 1/3 of a cup meaning that now there is 5 tablespoons in 1/3 of a cup so every tablespoon is 2 grams of wheat you're gonna need the carbs wheat for this recipe and I'll post a link of how to do that below here's what you're gonna need alcohol that is 95% alcohol or higher some coffee filters or cheesecloth a funnel some mason jars and 10 grams of the carb to read the first step is to freeze your Dakkar bleed for at least 24 hours I have already done that and now that it's been over 24 hours I'm going to pour in 2/3 of a cup of vodka that has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours the instructions for this can still be followed even if you're not using the same amount of wheat that I am which is 10 grams all you have to do is pour enough vodka to fill just to the top of the weed now you're going to shake it aggressively for 5 minutes then you'll put it in the freezer for at least 2 hours I ended up leaving mine in the freezer for about 20 hours there's no need to leave it for long within 2 hours I did that simply because I ran at a time now I'm placing a funnel into my mason jar and I'm going to poke some holes into my coffee filter so that it flows through a little bit quicker if you don't have any coffee filters you can also use cheesecloth then place that into the funnel now you can take your weed and vodka mixture out of the freezer and shake it aggressively for another 5 minutes pour your mixture into the filter and try to avoid spilling it over the edge like I do here then wait for it to filter through this can take a while sometimes even up to a half an hour you can see how slowly it comes out of the bottom and then once almost all of the liquid has gone through I'll move the weed around to try and facilitate more of the liquid to be filtered through I put some gloves on because if your fingers are touching the weed and vodka it can absorb some of the THC and we obviously don't want that because that would be a waste now that all the vodka has gone through the filter I'm going to scoop back the weed into the jar you can see how much weed is left in the funnel because I spilled it when I poured it in so again try to avoid doing that if you can [Music] now I'm going to pour in 1/3 of a cup of vodka that again has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours and then I'm going to pour it into my jar weed that I had already filtered once now again if you're using different proportions just use enough to just cover the weed you can just pour it straight into the jar I'm just using the funnel so I can try and get some of that weed that's stuck to it the first time now once again I'm going to shake that jar aggressively for five minutes now using that same jar and same filter that I'd use the first time I am going to pour in the mixture that we had just shaken into the jar that we first used [Music] now this step is optional but I'm going to pour in a little bit of that very cold flash-frozen vodka to get the remnants out of my jar again you don't have to do this but I don't want to waste anything so every little scrap I can get I'm gonna take now once again we're going to let that filter through and it is going to take a long time just like the first round did [Music] once that's all dripped through we're going to place a clean funnel into a clean measuring cup or mason jar as well as a new clean coffee filter and we are not going to poke any holes now we're going to pour it in and we're going to wait for this to drip through this step is not necessary but I like mine very clear so I like to filter out any imperfections if you like you can do this step twice but it does take a long time so I only do it once and I find that the one time is sufficient to get it very pure and clean I'm also going to take the filter with the weed that has been filtered already and press it out as much as I can of course make sure you're wearing a rubber glove so that your skin is not absorbing at all yeah and just try and squish oh as much as you can and then that little bit of leftover that is on the parchment paper there I mean if you're just using this for yourself you could just lick it up I don't know if you don't want to waste it anything works yeah so just squeeze out as much as you possibly can it's been about a half an hour and almost everything has filtered through and we have a total of about a little bit under a cup of liquid because some of that vodka is lost in the extraction process [Music] now we need to reduce our tincture to a smaller amount and we're going to use that by using a double boiler thing which I don't have so I'm making my own version and I'm just using my instant pot so that I can do it in the living room where I have better lighting so I am wrapping some tinfoil around it so I can contain the heat as much as possible and I'm just going to put my measuring cup on to the side of it and then wrap the tinfoil kind of around it that way not too much water and heat is evaporating all you want to make sure is that your bottom of your mason jar or your measuring cup like I'm using is not touching the water so same concept as a double boiler so I both to put it in there but I just have to show off how beautiful it looks it's so clear so golden absolutely beautiful I hope you guys appreciate how wonderful it looks because a lot of my friends and family don't really feel the same way as I do so I just love being able to share this stuff with you guys online please make sure you do this any well-ventilated area so I have all windows and doors in my house opened as well as if your dreams on the stove have your hood fan on there is no smell at all so unfortunately my instant pot broke part way through I don't know what happened so I moved it to the kitchen and I made this sort of contraption thing because I could not put the measuring cup on the edge of the pot because I don't have anything deep enough where the bottom of the measuring cup wouldn't touch the water so I just put a metal strainer on top and then created some insulation with the tin foil kind of like how I did it the instant pot so while you're watching it when it's bubbling a lot like this that's a little bit too much so turn your heat down a little bit you do want a little bit of movement but not that aggressively now I reduced it down to one third of a cup and that took me about an hour and a half I believe you can reduce it more or reduce it less it just depends on how strong you want it to be now it's ready to pour into a jar to save you can use this with a dropper or you can put into your gummies or into your drinks there's so many different ways to use it hopefully you guys will check out some of my gummy videos and try it out in one of those recipes and here's the finished product which is absolutely beautiful thank you so much for watching with the measuring cup I didn't want to waste any possible tincture so I heard some iced coffee into there and now I'm drinking that so that's a good way to make sure you're not wasting anything if you guys enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe and please let me know if there's any videos you would like to see me record because I would be happy to do that thank you guys so much for watching have a great day [Music]",

a mars hydro ts 1000 light under this light i have four granddaddy purples all photoperiod plants and uh yeah i'll show you this full seed to harvest what i did right a few things that i definitely did wrong and yeah just the whole thing so yeah hang out let's take a look [Music] i got this 3x3 tent from mars hydro as well as a ts 1000 and uh setting this tent up i have an intake a carbon filter um and then the fans and timers and all that good stuff all set up in this three by three time so yeah it's a pretty decent little setup i'm a little concerned that a basically a 150 watt led is enough to handle this kind of space um but yeah i mean in this three by three tent i thought it was pushing that a little bit but uh i was definitely hoping to at least get one gram per watt that was my goal going into this and i thought it'd be pretty easy to do well i just plant seeds directly into the medium i know a lot of people do germination of seeds a lot of different ways but i have this dial in pretty well i mean seeds know how to grow when they're in the ground so i just uh fill up a solo cup with what i use is royal gold um two pour and uh poke a little hole in the ground in the soil throw the seeds in there and then just keep them wet so they pop up every time i mean not every time you know you get your failure right here and there but uh if you don't disturb the seed and you put them just about a quarter inch under the soil you're going to have really good results doing it this way i've actually had better results blending them directly into the ground than i have doing like soaking them in paper towels or shot glasses for a while and all that stuff it just gives you a lot more room to fail in my opinion if you're super on it and you're really dialed in i'm sure it's just as good as anything but for me personally i plan on writing the soil and i have great luck doing it [Music] and then just keep them moist i think the best way to do it is with a sprayer so you don't disturb the seed if you pour water directly on the medium at this point when the there's no roots involved whatsoever you can make that seed kind of go to a spot that you don't want it you know too low or just off to the side or something like that so spray them once a day and you should be [Music] fine well these things all sprouted pretty quick and i wanted to get into uh their final medium and under this light as quickly as possible too so i took them out of their solo cups popped them right into a five gallon uh medium there one of them looked a little weird i'm not really too sure why but it was really dwarfy and dumb and all the other ones looked fine so i was growing five in here right now but they're still in their early veg phase and uh just basically keeping them keeping them watered i'd do watering twice a week at this point actually i might have been watering three times a week i've kind of adjusted things since then but yeah i'm pretty sure i was actually watering three times a week at this phase of their life on monday wednesday and friday giving them nutrients on monday and wednesday and then only giving uh water on friday and now they're humming right along the little dwarfy plant has bounced back and it's looking kind of more normal i'm not super excited for that thing in hindsight i should have just gotten rid of it but uh yeah right now i'm just keeping all these things in vegetation doing some light pruning i did some topping and yeah just letting these things get a little bit bigger [Music] so at this point you can see these plants just starting to explode i mean this point in the plant's life they just double in size it seems like every week so that's pretty cool but it's about time to flip them into flour too and before flipping them into flour i always take the plants out and give them a big old haircut so i choose a kind of a point maybe halfway up the plant maybe a little under that and just get rid of everything down there there's not going to be a great light penetration down there so the buds are going to be not worth your time at all so the more defoliation you can do at this point the better results you're going to have at the end of the plant's life in my [Music] opinion [Music] at this point i ended up taking uh one of the plants out of this tent too just because it was going to be way too jam-packed and it was one of the bigger of the three and i put that in a different tent that i had basically a spider farmer 4 000 on top of as well as a bunch of other plants too i kind of talked about that one in the last uh last video actually so um that one was out and doing its own thing and i have these four plants growing the back one is like going super tall so i had to do some super cropping on that uh basically just super cropping is bending the branch down you might hear a little little snap you don't want to break it off but you might hear a little little crack and then you just kind of lay it down and it saves you a bunch of space if it's grown up into your lights i should also note that these genetics are from nuke heads i am getting a lot of genetics from them lately and uh also their flower power package which has helped me a ton with bud density i used to really struggle with getting buds that were dense at all they were kind of always loose and laughing and these things are now coming out like golf balls which i always kind of wanted so super happy with the nutrients um the genetics i'm still kind of working with uh gonna have some issues with the genetics in this one actually all coming out as females i am really disappointed to say that i did not really check uh closely for any kind of pollen sacks or anything like that when when i get feminized seeds i assume they're going to be feminized like but uh i've never really had any issues with that ever in the past so i know that feminisie still can be uh come out as male i mean as simple as a seed kind of getting in one package to another could happen but uh that small little dwarfy plant that i wasn't too excited about and almost threw out i am 99 sure either hermed or was a male and i just didn't somehow notice like it still kind of boggles my mind that that would have been a male and uh this whole time i just didn't notice it but you know i mean i i there's there's certain points that i don't really really inspect these uh plants as well as i should so did that happen at this point i really don't know um but i know that when these things were all said and done they were seated so yeah i'm really not happy with uh that those results at all but uh it is what it is so i need to definitely do better with checking on everything the entire time and also how i use uh my nutrients here too i i know i've showed you guys this in other videos but i use the nukeheads flower power dry uh amendments and i put them right into like a 20 gallon tote going to a sump pump and then going to a 50-foot hose that hits a garden sprayer so it allows me to hit the entire house all the different tents and um kind of have an all-in-one solution where i can also reach the back of the tents with that wand it's an awesome watering solution that i am working with right now still hand watering it's not some kind of automatic thing but uh i'm super super happy with uh the way i have the watering and the nutrients kind of dialed in right now [Music] well we're cruising right along still and uh at this point i'm happy as a clam i think these things are coming along just fine i mean working with this mars hydro ts 1000 light i've used this light in a lot of different ways a lot of times i use it in an offset kind of way where i might supplement some light um it is definitely capable of of growing some decent decent buds but uh this 3x3 space is like i'm just not getting as big of density as as i could if i was running more wattage like the mars hydro sp3 3000 that i've ram just did some massive massive buds and i know that thing just cranks out the wattage and i was running that in the 2x4 tent it's double the watts and it was actually being ran in a smaller space so that's that's definitely pushing 150 watts on this thing i think a ts 2000 would be uh much more optimal for a 3x3 space but that being said um from now on i'm probably going to just run maybe a lot less plants maybe one big plant in the 3x3 with this thing and see how that goes i do have that kind of happening right now where i have two plants in there one's just hanging out there for a second but i have the one pineapple express which i kind of have staked down and i'm pretty excited for that thing to come and uh yeah i'll have a video on that one when that's all done but that's going to be i don't know a couple months yet still [Music] well these things are all coming along just fine and uh i'm excited for them but that dwarfy plant has just not taken on the same colors everything else like i said it might be male it probably was female but it hurt because of extra stresses i didn't treat it any different but uh it definitely was the run of the litter so i don't know i'm kind of blaming the issues on this planet it might not have been that plan it could have been a totally different thing and um and pollen got pollen sex got formed on a different one but i don't know i mean i know that herming can happen it can happen and hermine for you guys that don't know is basically when a female plant develops male parts so pollen sacs and things like that where you can have a female plant actually pollinate itself and other surrounding plants [Music] [Music] do and for those of you guys that like these kind of videos the uh seed to harvest videos i have a bunch of tents kind of all going and different different strains um most of the time i don't have these kind of issues so you'll see a lot better not better results but uh i'm definitely love for you guys to comment let me know what you guys think uh if you have watched a handful of these videos and you haven't subscribed do it smash that like button help uh help this video kind of get shown to some other people i always appreciate that for sure also everything that i'm using here you can find in my amazon affiliate links below and uh you can also find the nukeheads genetics and flower power package on nuke heads website and uh if you buy anything from there use the duke grows 10 off and that will give you 10 off of your entire order as well there's some great genetics and uh their flower power package i can't speak highly enough i mean that's that's really changed the way that uh i kind of anticipate my grows going and it's helped with bud density like crazy so i'm sticking with that for now for sure and um i was using the general hydroponics three part and was getting kind of loose larpy not great density buds and since switching over to this flower power package across the board i've had just much better results as far as density goes and yield i would say too but definitely the density is just huge well these things are really done finishing flowering i've been checking on the trichome development and starting to see some amber trichomes so it is time to cut these things down these things are just so gorgeous the purple colors that come through on these leaves are just really really great to see and uh was super excited to get this thing chopped down and hung up i chopped them all put them all in a drying tent and uh it took a lot longer to dry in this tent than it normally does i wanted to have this video up uh by the end of last year but uh it took like two and a half weeks for this thing to actually dry so i was given a shot with the trim bag which i got recently and uh it wasn't working out too well for me either so i pretty much just hand trimmed all this stuff and that's when i saw all the seeds starting to pop out of it like it was i mean it was pretty heavily seated not gonna lie i wish it wasn't and uh trust me i know you guys are watching this thing hoping to see some really great results and the results just weren't there i mean i i've had nothing but great success pretty much in in the past and this one wasn't there so it is what it is i still wanted to show you guys it doesn't it's not all roses it's not always perfect you make mistakes you just got to move on and uh when it's all said and done i had a bunch of buds with seeds in them and i had a bunch of trim which uh also had seeds in it too so i mean it's uh it's not not what you want to see at all this stuff is more or less unusable and uh i'm gonna pretty much turn it all into probably bubble hash or make some oil with it or something like that so yeah i've got these buds that i actually ended up saving that are seated i only got about two ounces off of and the trim is just like so much bud in there as well but anything that had like a lot of seeds i just kind of threw in there so not the greatest well guys i really appreciate you stopping by and watching this video uh like i said i know this wasn't optimal results i really wanted to show you what real life can look like i didn't have to make this video i kind of debated not really going through this just because of this disappointment in growing it is probably just as disappointing watching it so but you know that is that's life man you just gotta just gotta keep at it keep getting better keep trying to learn and uh good things will come so anyways got some cool stuff coming up uh i have a lot of good ideas that are just kind of kind of working in my mind still but i want to get up at least uh one or two videos a week in this next month so that's the plan and uh my next seed to harvest will probably be at least a month but uh got some other other stuff i want to show you guys too so really appreciate you guys sticking with me and uh if you are still hanging out make sure you smash that

He's smiling less than he was smiling when it wasn't working yeah you see this country there's a lot of issues\u00a0\nwith guerrillas with bandits with paramilitaries\u00a0\u00a0 with police, with armies and it's a hard country everywhere\u00a0where you come you see people  going in\u00a0prison people dying the guys we have with\u00a0us they lost their brothers their fathers\u00a0\u00a0 Jose even lost his mother in this war so it just\u00a0\ngives you an idea how difficult this country is Here we have agaves, bananas, yuca, corn, avocado, Naranjilla, tomatoes, blackberries, its a very fertile territory. the first thing we're going to do is we're going\u00a0\nto go into the area of near Cali where\u00a0\u00a0 the limon verde grows, we're going to talk to the\u00a0\nlocal leaders and see um how how how complicated\u00a0\u00a0 it is to go in there because everybody told us\u00a0\nyou cannot go in there but we're going to see\u00a0\u00a0 for ourselves what we're going to do is we're\u00a0\ngoing to go straight into that little village\u00a0\u00a0  what's the name of that village there up there\u00a0\n\"corinto\" yeah corinto and we're just going to\u00a0\u00a0 go to the indian tribes there and see how far it\u00a0\nis and then they'll give us a direction and from\u00a0\u00a0 then we will take it..... if it takes a few days to\u00a0\nget in there what is the possibility we first go\u00a0\u00a0 to another area scout some there and then see what\u00a0happens  but don't forget......we have to keep flexible\u00a0\u00a0 yeah but don't forget that all areas are difficult\u00a0\nbecause one area is FARC the other area is ANL the other area is paramilitaries so we will have\u00a0\nissues all over we just have to face that that this is a very very difficult country you\u00a0\ncan compare it a little bit to uh to Pakistan and\u00a0\u00a0 and Afghanistan we'll have some issues that\u00a0\nwe have to take care of...... let's see how it goes So we stay one night here\u00a0\ntomorrow we fly to Cali.....yeah  No we lost them! I think we should keep getting outta of here though. Yeah lets keep moozying. everything is real.....we had like uh 40 50\u00a0\npeople going mad throwing shit to the car then the cops came and uh we had to make a\u00a0\nquick evacuation with two cop cars but we got\u00a0\u00a0 we got out of there and we're gonna sleep for\u00a0\nfive hours and tomorrow morning at five o'clock\u00a0\u00a0 we're gonna take the airplane to Cali we are in the Cali area um it's the\u00a0\nsouthern part of Colombia it's where  the verde limon landrace is hiding so we're\u00a0\ngonna go see if we can find it  here here We need rocks, no more green, Rocks! [Franco] Rocks? No I don't have rocks here [Arjan]  GAS GAS GAS...GAS GAS!! no no no no no no no nothing owoyo oh my god okay\u00a0forget it guys we are going to walk We try one more time? Ay yack... \nThis is good, it sucks...\nAy man I'm fucking tired.... hopefully we don't have to\u00a0get up at 7am you know we have two more days\u00a0\u00a0 welcome to my world we are at the farm dude....\nFanco you must see this hash machine man!  yeah maybe somebody's\u00a0\ngoing to put an m16 in your culio tonight we are at the farm This is 800 plants per hectare, and there are 2 hectares on this, so 16000 plants,  200 grams per plant that's two tons per crop\u00a0\nthat's six tons per year coming out of this place\u00a0\u00a0 of this quality and i am seriously impressed...i am\u00a0shocked..this is pure porno pure porno really for us it's really really nice to see other\u00a0\nparts of the world people developing themselves\u00a0\u00a0 and becoming great farmers you know and if we\u00a0fight this war all together all over the world\u00a0\u00a0 all these farmers the United States there's\u00a0no way back in canada there's no way back to\u00a0\u00a0 Colombia there's no way back in Holland there's\u00a0no way back in Spain there's no way back and we all\u00a0\u00a0 work together, all the breeders and all the growers\u00a0we can win this battle after 50 years of madness you never stop learning because breeding plants\u00a0\u00a0 is as i said creating something new it's like\u00a0\nyou could you could compare it with a chef\u00a0\u00a0 a michelin star chef who's creating new recipes\u00a0the ingredients are are almost infinite to\u00a0\u00a0 combine and the way you can combine it is almost\u00a0without limit and it's up to the talent and the\u00a0\u00a0 art and the knowledge of the chef to combine it to\u00a0combine them in the way to create something good\u00a0\u00a0 and you can see it a little bit the same way so do\u00a0you consider yourself a chef a green chef for sure Test this haze, the same Kush but with a tint of haze, a pheno, more sativa,  oh perfect man fuck we need a clone of this one mate win the battle against legalization and try to\u00a0\nfind the system that everybody has a benefit of\u00a0\u00a0 this is the most important thing because\u00a0\nnow as we look we are in a great plantation\u00a0\u00a0 but it's still very illegal right you know what\u00a0\nthe people are doing here and they're all\u00a0\u00a0 jeopardizing their life and prison and everything\u00a0you know...so part of your sort of like enterprise\u00a0\u00a0 is making the world a better place well for us\u00a0\nthis this is our core thing you know what we\u00a0\u00a0 like to see that's what we saw in our movies for\u00a0\nexample St. Vincent and Trinidad we did that in\u00a0\u00a0 one movie you go to trinidad you have a curfew\u00a0\nat six o'clock yeah they ban all the marijuana\u00a0\u00a0 on the island all the cocaine is coming from\u00a0\nsouth america through Trinidad, there are shootings\u00a0in the street there's arms disappearing there's\u00a0\ncorruption the whole island went down  compared\u00a0\u00a0to cocaine is there more people for prison in\u00a0prison for cocaine or for marijuana here in Trinidad? For Marijuana! you go next door to see vincent everybody\u00a0can smoke marijuana there's great tourism going on\u00a0\u00a0 the cops are laid back the government is laid\u00a0back there's a whole different vibe in the streets\u00a0\u00a0 so two countries very close to each other yeah\u00a0\n20 30 miles and you see a completely different\u00a0\u00a0 vibe the way the government operates against\u00a0\nthe local drugs and people and the current the\u00a0\u00a0 government should see this this is also one\u00a0\nof the reasons that holland basically kind\u00a0\u00a0 of legalized marijuana a very long time ago\u00a0\nin the 70s because we saw the benefit of it sativa crossed with nicoles kush with this\u00a0\npurplish thing on the leaves beautiful they have a little bit of rust\u00a0\u00a0 a little bit of white fly but\u00a0\nthey're healthy plants overall when you come to a plantation like this what are\u00a0you looking for in the buds and in the pockets\u00a0\u00a0 beautiful....look how much resin already for this\u00a0thing is like four weeks into flowering fire\u00a0\u00a0 first of all we evaluate the general structure of\u00a0\nthe plants we look at the the branching we look\u00a0\u00a0 at the internal space so the distance between\u00a0\none branch and the next branch how uniform it\u00a0\u00a0 is how big it is then we go we move on to the bud\u00a0structure we look how close the bud is how tight\u00a0\u00a0 it gets now these plants considering they are\u00a0three weeks four weeks away from harvest they\u00a0\u00a0 are already very very well developed we examine\u00a0the resin quantity of the resin in general on the\u00a0\u00a0 bud on the leaves leaflets and then we can we can\u00a0evaluate even the calyx relief ratio even though\u00a0\u00a0 it's a little bit early to do that at this stage\u00a0\nbut we can see the proportion between the number\u00a0\u00a0 of Calyx and the number of leaf in the bud\u00a0\nand the more calyx the less leaf the better it\u00a0\u00a0 is of course because the final product will be\u00a0\neasier to manicure right and then we can start\u00a0\u00a0 evaluating the more personal the more the more\u00a0individual side of the of the situation which\u00a0\u00a0 is the smell in this case because plants that\u00a0\nhave this amount of resin already have a good\u00a0\u00a0 smell something that can tell you how good it\u00a0\nis already, how strong so it's and then from here we wait\u00a0\u00a0 a few more weeks and we go on and then when\u00a0the product is finished then you can finally evaluate it & understand. you have the crocodile hunters\u00a0\nsnake hunters and Strain Hunters i love it too much.... in holland until\n95 i would say 80 percent was hash\u00a0\u00a0 still the old generation smokes hash  and then after\u00a0it became marijuana but in other countries in north africa and in malana for example or in nepal\u00a0it's all hash smoking countries, but we smoke both so when Arjan rolls into town why is it such\u00a0a big deal to the farmers here...... it's a really\u00a0\u00a0 big deal you you could say let's let's make a\u00a0\ncomparison with the music industry for example\u00a0\u00a0 just to make you understand if Arjan would be one\u00a0of the biggest music producers in the world and this would be a bunch of upcoming\u00a0talents and artists from a cool\u00a0\u00a0 underground neighborhood they would\u00a0\nlove to have this big producers home\u00a0\u00a0 checking out their the music....right so\u00a0\nthis is like their big shot maybe that's\u00a0\u00a0 because Arjan could walk home with some of this stuff....\u00a0absolutely.... how do you think they've done\u00a0\u00a0 i think uh looking around is pretty impressive\u00a0\ni mean i've been looking at marijuana plants for\u00a0\u00a0 the last 20 years of my life right.. yeah this is\u00a0pretty impressive... so why do you come up to these\u00a0\u00a0 places, like what are you getting out of this?...basically we evaluate what they're doing here the highway of phillips lights from holland...somos number one we see the size of the operation we\u00a0see how good the operation is how technical yes This is impressive, the plants look very good and healthy, everything is organised very well.  what techniques they are using what they're doing\u00a0with the plants they have cleaning the plot and\u00a0\u00a0 new plants are coming now so they have the cycle\u00a0going boom boom boom boom how far they space them\u00a0\u00a0 how how they feed them how they grow them in\u00a0general and it's really amazing to see the\u00a0\u00a0 development here because this is a place that\u00a0is very natural very organic yet very high\u00a0\u00a0 tech in a way even though it's a simple simple\u00a0construction you can see that every technique\u00a0\u00a0 is applied properly and total so it's very well\u00a0planned the logistics are amazing and the size\u00a0\u00a0 like this the logistic is very impressive.... and\u00a0so can you describe like the strain of weed that\u00a0\u00a0 they're growing here like.... this one is the nicoles\u00a0kush it's been created by our friend elgato and it's very particular plant because it's really\u00a0\ncushy you can definitely smell the cushion it but\u00a0\u00a0 it's a lot more fruity a lot more flour in the\u00a0\nsmell than just regular cushion right it loses\u00a0\u00a0 some of that earthy feeling of the kush and it\u00a0\ngains some fruitiness very special it's and the\u00a0\u00a0 fruitiness is about a flavor thing not about like\u00a0\nabsolutely but it's mostly about flavor talking\u00a0\u00a0 about the effect we smoked it already yesterday\u00a0\nyeah it was really strong really physical\u00a0\u00a0 right... like a kush should be very uh very body relaxing very\u00a0couch-locking... right so and it's a sativa or ...no\u00a0\u00a0 it's more of an indica it's a hybrid technically\u00a0\nit's not a pure indica but it's more towards the\u00a0\u00a0 indica side of the spectrum than towards sativa...\u00a0and what does that mean exactly... it means the\u00a0\u00a0 the sativa plant and the indica plant are the two\u00a0\nextreme on the spectrum and then let's say 99.9 of\u00a0\u00a0 all strains that you see around are actually\u00a0\nhybrids in between these two extremes right\u00a0\u00a0 pure sativa and pure indica are very difficult to\u00a0\nfind maybe impossible because of the evolution of\u00a0\u00a0 cannabis ...um and so what are we doing with the land\u00a0races can you explain that in uh in comparison to\u00a0\u00a0 what we're looking at here sure land races are\u00a0\ndifferent than this just because land rises have\u00a0\u00a0 not been influenced by external uh genetics the\u00a0\nland race is typical of one area for example in\u00a0\u00a0 this area we look for the verde limon land race\u00a0of colombia and it's something that is really\u00a0\u00a0 in this area for a long time when we say long\u00a0\ntime we mean maybe 50 maybe 100 maybe more years\u00a0\u00a0 without influences from external genetics so\u00a0\nwithout people bringing seeds from abroad from\u00a0\u00a0 other areas and starting cross-pollination.... and\u00a0why is that important to find those it's.important because it's creating a very important\u00a0database there are many land races around the\u00a0\u00a0 planet that are not preserved at the moment and\u00a0that contain very unique cannabinoid and terpene\u00a0\u00a0 profiles and these are or may be useful in the future\u00a0for creating new medicine ...right ... for sure useful in\u00a0\u00a0 the future to create new recreational strains\u00a0new flavors new effects and cannabis ...so do you\u00a0\u00a0 feel like it gives you a leg up on the competition\u00a0to like go out and find these land races because\u00a0\u00a0 your palette is sort of bigger ....the bigger the\u00a0library of genetics the better the breeding can be\u00a0\u00a0 and so you're excited to see these again\u00a0because you can bring them back to Amsterdam\u00a0\u00a0 sure and then start working on ..working with it\u00a0..of course ....selecting first the individuals that\u00a0\u00a0 deserve attention and then inbreeding them uh with\u00a0themselves so preserving the real genetics right\u00a0\u00a0 or using the genetic from crossings\u00a0\nfinding something that can go good with it\u00a0\u00a0 try a cross see an f1 hybrid generation select\u00a0\ninteresting individuals from that generation and\u00a0\u00a0 create something new ...and why do you love creating\u00a0something new ...because cannabis is about variety\u00a0\u00a0 the beauty of cannabis the power of\u00a0\ncannabis is its variety it's the fact\u00a0\u00a0 that there are so many flavors so many effects\u00a0\nmedicinal and recreational um it's a plant but\u00a0\u00a0 it's not one plant it's thousands of plants and\u00a0\nwe contribute to this and for us for us this is\u00a0\u00a0 what we do this is who we are this this is why we\u00a0call ourselves strain hunters and this is why we\u00a0\u00a0 we put passion in what we do .....then you're kind\u00a0of like crazy scientists too because you're like\u00a0\u00a0 searching the world for all these\u00a0\nthings.... i like to say breeder you know\u00a0\u00a0 farmers that's what we are right\u00a0\nwe're not really scientists so here you have five one two three four\u00a0\nfive six seven eight nine so you have 50\u00a0\u00a0 clones but these are gigantic ones the\u00a0\nadvantage of this stuff is that you have\u00a0\u00a0 a much quicker start you have a very very healthy\u00a0clone with a big root ball the stronger the root\u00a0\u00a0 ball the better the plant goes you know and if you\u00a0\nhave a plant like this going you probably save two\u00a0\u00a0 weeks on the growth because it's like really\u00a0uh vigorous and powerful you know it will boom\u00a0\u00a0 it will shoot up look also they save them\u00a0\nten days of growth had those clones there then\u00a0\u00a0 you can already from this mother cut\u00a0\nthis size yeah directly cut this size look how strong it is you can bend them\u00a0\nand like they don't correct that nothing\u00a0\u00a0 the quality of the clones\u00a0\nis like really really strong\u00a0\u00a0 let's see and also here the old style razor\u00a0\nblade yeah you see still do it yeah look at\u00a0\u00a0 that look here is the old style razor blade yeah\u00a0look look there are all over the place they're all\u00a0\u00a0 over the place you see them lying here so\u00a0you use those the way they clean them they\u00a0\u00a0 take off all the little stuff also like the same\u00a0the same in the glass house this is still how i\u00a0\u00a0 operate and we are one of the few and he took it\u00a0over look also in the clones the air goes through\u00a0\u00a0 you know and you only need the top you know so it\u00a0really shoots up it's fantastic yeah great system\u00a0\u00a0 before they go in the ground you take all what\u00a0you're not gonna need and the only thing we leave is just\u00a0 a little top this is how we put them and then\u00a0they shoot up this big right like this big yeah also you can see the nutrients it's like\u00a0\nreally really perfect here's hardly any red\u00a0\u00a0 hard wood you know it's like fucking strong jeez the only way to get in here is\u00a0\nbecause of our friend El Gato\u00a0\u00a0 otherwise it would be like a mission impossible\u00a0\nyou need trust for months to get trust with the\u00a0\u00a0 local people because through our connections and\u00a0\nel gato here in colombia we can get in very quick\u00a0\u00a0 and very easy unfortunately last night one\u00a0of the second men of FARC got killed so we\u00a0\u00a0 bought the newspaper we just bought the newspaper\u00a0because we got an sms that they wanna have the newspaper and this could give some kind of friction because\u00a0of course when somebody gets kids the tensions are\u00a0\u00a0 a little bit high so we'll see how it goes down\u00a0today...it was not far from here...yeah it was 100\u00a0\u00a0 k's away from here where the second man of the\u00a0\nFARC got killed yesterday with six other rebels so we'll see how this comes out they know better\u00a0than anyone else where we can find the more\u00a0\u00a0 isolated patches the ones that have been really\u00a0inbreeding the areas where one family controls one\u00a0\u00a0 big field and every year they keep planting and\u00a0planting and planting from that field and making\u00a0\u00a0 seeds in the same field ...right ...and that's when we\u00a0know we are on to something really special maybe somebody's going to put\u00a0\nan m16 in your culio tonight so so wow", "iWF9MmiQUA4": "in this study we treated children with dravet syndrome which is a very serious genetic form of epilepsy that unfortunately has a very high seizure burden and a very high mortality from epilepsy that these children who had not responded to often five or ten other treatments were given cannabidiol or a placebo in addition to their existing medications cannabidiol is the major non psychoactive ingredient in cannabis also known as marijuana so cannabidiol does not produce any high or psychoactive properties and therefore has less potential side effects especially for use in children than a psychoactive compounds such as THC we were in the double-blind placebo-controlled phase of the study and we did that for 14 weeks and we were like totally convinced that she was in a placebo because her seizures didn't change at all and then we were able to roll into the open label extension and the second day that we're in open label and we knew that she was getting the actual drug she went seizure free like completely seizure free for two months which has never happened the main findings of the study were that there was a very statistically significant reduction in the convulsive seizure frequency in patients who are randomized to cannabidiol when compared to patients who are randomized to placebo so the message is that cannabidiol does work in reducing convulsive seizures in children with dravet syndrome my hope for the future is that this study will lead to more similar studies to assess cannabidiol and perhaps products containing both cannabidiol and THC in various forms of epilepsy you", "8GsmTFytBYI": "Translator: Rhonda Jacobs\nReviewer: Tanya Cushman So, I've been asked to talk about\ndemystifying the endocannabinoid system. So, I started working on the pharmacology\nof endocannabinoids over 20 years ago, and I had done my PhD,\nand then I'd done a couple of postdocs, and then I actually had a five-year\ncareer break when I had my two children. And I then found myself back in the lab and in the lab of one of the world experts\non cannabinoid pharmacology. And at that time,\nthe field of cannabinoid research was really a relatively\nsmall group of people, scientists, and it was not a particularly\nfashionable research area. People didn't take us\nparticularly seriously. I think they thought we were\nkind of having some fun in the lab in psychedelic lab coats\nor tie-dyed T-shirts, some altar piece, but actually it's a really\nserious group of people who'd been working really hard\nto understand the endocannabinoid system. But now fast forward to 2019, and everyone's interested\nin endocannabinoids, and everyone's interested\nin how cannabis works. So it's kind of like if you keep\nthose old clothes that you love and you're passionate\nabout it for long enough, they will come back into fashion. (Laughter) So let's start, as a kind of introduction, by looking at how clever\nour brains and bodies actually are. So our bodies, our emotions\nand our physical responses are designed to respond\nto our environment. So things change in our environment,\ninternally or externally - there are chemical changes, and that initiates a change\nin our emotions or our responses. And an example of this\nyou probably all have heard of is called the fight-or-flight response. So what happens is something\nfrightening happens, there's a danger, we produce adrenaline; it's rushing through\nour bloodstream, or noradrenaline, and that causes us to either fight\nthat dangerous thing or to fly away and escape. So how does this work? So deep in your brain,\nyour amygdala senses fear and danger, and it sends signals to other parts\nof your brain and body, and then adrenaline's produced, and that's the little chemical\nstructure of adrenaline there. It then courses through your bloodstream - that's in your muscles,\nyour digestive system, all sorts of things; you're poised to fight or to fly, and your heart rate also increases. So let's look at the pharmacology\nunderlying some of that. So the adrenaline, we think of in pharmacology\na bit like a key. And the adrenaline receptor,\nthe adrenergic receptor, is a bit like a lock. So the key of adrenaline\nfits perfectly into this little lock. So that's kind of background there. So what about\nthe endocannabinoid system? So the endocannabinoid system, similarly, is part of your body that is designed\nto respond to your environment, either internally\nor externally around you, and to then initiate various changes\nin response to that. So let's do a little\nmyth busting, first of all, around the endocannabinoid system. It exists throughout life, so we're actually born\nwith an endocannabinoid system, and it's there before we're born. And for example, it's very important\nin brain development, in something called synaptogenesis,\nwhich is the formation of synapses, and these are the little\nelectrical connections in your brain that allow neurotransmitters\nto send information. It's also involved\nin what's called synaptic pruning, which is the other scenario, where actually some synapses\nthat might be superfluous or extra are actually pruned away. So these are two\nreally important functions. The endocannabinoid system is there in people who've never\neven heard of cannabis. So if you've lived a life\nor in a community where cannabis isn't a thing, you still have a wonderful,\nfunctional endocannabinoid system. And importantly, the endocannabinoid system\nhelps us understand how cannabis works. But cannabis is not the reason\nwhy the endocannabinoid system exists. So how does it work? Let's have a look at the endocannabinoid\nsystem in a little more detail. So here's the endocannabinoids -\nthere's two of these - and these are produced in your brain\nand different tissues at specific times. This is the little chemical\nstructure of one of them. The endocannabinoids\nact on CB, cannabinoid receptors - there's two of these: CB1 and CB2. These are found in your brain\nand in different tissues in order to respond to endocannabinoids. When the endocannabinoids\nbind to these, you get a response. So the same lock and key scenario: the endocannabinoids are like the key, and then the receptor is the lock\nthat unlocks these downstream responses. So why do we make\nendocannabinoids and when? So as I said, they're really important\nin this responding to our environment. And we make endocannabinoids in response\nto all sorts of different things, specifically, at the right time\nand the right place. So here are some examples. When we're hungry - you might be feeling\na little bit hungry now, maybe not yet, but when you are\nor you start thinking about food, your endocannabinoids\nand your hypothalamus will start to go up. Exercise, when you're feeling stressed,\npain, depending on the time of day, your endocannabinoid levels are increasing\nin specific parts of your body and brain. So what do they do? They do lots of different things,\nand here are some examples. They're involved, as I said,\nin appetite stimulation. They're involved in de-stressing,\nso reducing stress and anxiety. They're involved\nin pain relieving mechanisms, so they go up in specific parts\nof the brain in response to pain. So you can see here that it's very,\nvery important in balancing things out. So you've got an increase in stress,\nthe endocannabinoids de-stress. You've got an increase in pain, the endocannabinoids\nproduce pain-relieving effects. Fun fact: they're also very much increased\nin response to singing. So we did some singing earlier, and endocannabinoids actually go up\n42 percent in response to singing, and also dancing, so these are two other key mediators\nof the endocannabinoid system. So I'd like to propose to you today\nthat the endocannabinoid system is clever. And one of the examples\nwe can use is stress. So in response to stress,\nwe produce endocannabinoids, and they produce a reduction in stress. So here we've got\na stressful event happening, like, for example, giving a TED Talk (Laughter) or your toddler having a meltdown\nin the supermarket or an exam or a deadline. And so what happens, you get an increase in stress hormone\ncortisol in your bloodstream. And also you get an increase\nof endocannabinoids in response to that. And very cleverly, the system\nactually learns from stresses. So in response to the same stressful event\na second or a third time, you can see there in blue, the endocannabinoid levels\nare actually increasing even further, and with the third event,\nit's going up even higher, so they're learning\nfrom this stressful event. And the levels of cortisol\nare actually being reduced. So you've got this de-stressor\nthat's learning cleverly from repeated stressful events. And another example\nof how the system is really clever is memory formation. So in response to various events\nin life, we form memories, and the endocannabinoids\nare really involved in that in the most quite incredible way. So in various parts of your brain, endocannabinoids are released\nto help with memory formation. And for example, in your hippocampus - it's a part of your brain\nwith lots of endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid receptors. So what happens is the endocannabinoids\nhelp the formation of helpful memories; they're involved in your working memory, like remembering dates\nand names and lists. But quite remarkably, they actually\nhelp prevent the formation of what we call emotionally\naversive memories, so things that may be traumatic. So they prevent\nthe consolidation and retrieval of emotionally aversive memories. So they really integrate\nthe memory formation system so that we have\njust enough emotional memories that are healthy and helpful, and also help with our working memory. So, what about cannabis? So, how does it fit into all of this? So cannabis contains\ntwo primary constituents called cannabidiol - CBD, and THC. So today, I'm really\njust going to talk about THC. For CBD, it really could be\nthe subject of another entire TED Talk. I'll just remain to say that for CBD, we still have lots of questions\nabout how it works - its mechanism of action - whether it works in certain illnesses, and we have questions around its safety. But for THC, we understand\na bit more about how it works. So again, we've got\nthis lock and key scenario. So THC actually acts as an alternative key\nfor the endocannabinoid receptor, so it fits into the lock, as it were,\nof the endocannabinoid receptor. And what it does\nwhen it binds to that receptor is it either mimics\nthe endocannabinoid system or it disrupts the endocannabinoid system. Now, we could ask the question,\nHow can this be? How can we have something in a plant that actually is an alternative key\nfor a receptor in our brain? How did this happen? So if you imagine in your back garden\nyou have a pile of a billion keys. If you were to try all those keys, there's a probability you'd find one\nthat might fit into your back door, and you could give that key\nto someone to get into your house. And in fact, the plant kingdom contains many, many millions\nand millions of little molecules. This is the structure of THC here. And THC is actually only one of over 100\ncannabinoid-like molecules in cannabis, and that's only one plant. So it's a matter of probability that in plants, there are these little\nmolecules that actually fit into receptors that we already have\nin our brains and in our bodies. There are many examples of this. For example, morphine is found in poppies. It fits in perfectly to opioid receptors, which are normally occupied\nby enkephalins and endorphins in our bodies. And clearly that example illustrates that because something's natural\nand found in plants doesn't necessarily mean\nthat it's always safe. So what does THC do\nto the endocannabinoid system? So we've got this endocannabinoid system;\nit's balancing things out, it's responding to stress\nand making memories. What happens when THC's there? You've now got two potential keys\nfor the same lock. So the endocannabinoid system - another very clever thing about it\nwhich applies to most biological systems is it's very tightly controlled\nand designed not to be overactivated. If it gets overactivated, that can be really harmful\nand become dysfunctional. So it's designed to downregulate\nwhen it thinks it's active. So when THC's on board,\nthe system downregulates. So what happens is you get\nlower levels of endocannabinoids; they start to kind of\nswitch off or level off. And you actually get fewer\nof the endocannabinoid receptors. So what this means\nis that, as you may know, that often people need to start taking -\nmay take higher levels of THC in order to have the same effect\nas they had before because of this downregulation happening. So let's have a quick look\nat coping mechanisms. So in response to stress, there are a certain proportion of people\nwho would take THC or cannabis in order to help manage stress. That might have a de-stressing\neffect and it might not. In some people it can cause anxiety,\nbut it might have a de-stressing effect. What does this do\nto your endocannabinoid system? So what happens is your endocannabinoid\nsystem's actually been downregulated now. So in response to stress, it's kind of like scratching its head\na little bit in response to stress because there's fewer endocannabinoids - the spot for endocannabinoid's\nkind of occupied by THC. So your system's not really learning\nfrom the stressful event. So rather than kind of learning\nadaptive coping mechanisms in response to stress, like, for example, exercise that might\nharness your endocannabinoid system, this spot's kind of being occupied by THC. A certain proportion of people\nwho use cannabis containing THC might develop what's called a dependence. And that means they actually\nwant to stop using it. It might be affecting their life\nin some way negatively - they want to stop,\nbut they're finding it hard to stop, and that's called a dependence. And the reason for that\nis THC's kind of occupying this spot where the endocannabinoids were there. If THC's not there, the endocannabinoids\naren't there either, so that can cause a certain amount\nof dependence sometimes. So, we've got the endocannabinoid system. You've got an environmental effect,\nlike a stressor, like giving a TED Talk - you've got stress. And you've got the endocannabinoids being\nreleased in a certain part of your brain to help de-stress things. THC on the other hand,\ncontained in cannabis, isn't responding to the environment, and it has multiple effects at once. So your cannabinoid receptors are found\nin many different brain regions and different places in your body. So THC will activate\nmultiple things at once. It may de-stress. It does affect memory\nand cognition in various ways - it can impair short-term working memory. It may make people sleepy. It may affect motivation,\nincrease appetite. It can also be a bit unpredictable,\nso some people may feel happy or high, but some people can feel anxious with THC,\nparticularly with higher doses. Some people may - with high doses of THC,\nthere's a risk of an acute psychosis. And it can potentially increase\nthe risk of schizophrenia in individuals who may be vulnerable. So it can be a bit unpredictable\ndepending on the dose and depending on the individual. So, to kind of wrap this up. Endocannabinoids are not equal to THC. So what we've got here is the endocannabinoids are produced\nat the right time in the right place; they're very precisely controlled; they're responsive to the environment. THC, on the other hand,\nhas multiple effects all at once; it's not precise; it's not responding to your environment; and it may downregulate\nthe endocannabinoid system. Now all that said, THC and cannabis, also CBD, may relieve some symptoms\nof certain illnesses. But there's still a lot we need to know\nabout potential side effects. And what might happen\nis it may relieve symptoms acutely, so over the short term, but it may make illnesses worse\nover the longer term. So these are questions\nwe still need to answer. Scientists are also working\nat making new medicines that target the endocannabinoid system, so potentially things that can actually\nupregulate the levels of endocannabinoids at a specific place and time. So, finishing with this cartoon - I'm a scientist, so lots\nof research is still needed. This is the chocolate co-op company. And on the board we've got \"The conclusion is that eating chocolate\nwill make you look younger and thinner.\" And the supervisor there, saying,\n\"Look, half the work's done. All you need to do is fill in the top part\nand we can legally say the bottom part.\" So actually what we need\nis we need more data. We need to understand any potential harms\nof recreational cannabis. We need to understand more\nabout the efficacy and the safety of medical cannabis\nfor various different illnesses. Thank you. (Applause) (Cheers)", "69S7ITA3cv8": "[Music] so I thought we'd start off with a little introduction to this topic and be a discussion and when I when I do this in my in-person classes I asked them about their observations about the acute effects of cannabis and where those hooks come from and what explains differences across people and so when I ask that question and then and you can think about it as I'm talking to you know what are the effects of cannabis well some people will say oh it makes you sleepy some people will say oh it makes you super high or energetic or euphoric and and so as you go across the room people have different different observations in terms of what they see in terms of the effects and then I ask them where these effects come from and why the difference is why does one person say oh canvas makes you you know sleepy or slows you down another person will say oh cannabis makes you for it makes you feel good one person will say it makes you know makes you anxious and paranoid so these are very different effects that people are talking about and what explains the difference in those effects and so we're going to talk about that today in terms of the plant and biology of course another important point here is that the biology of the people is quite different to not just the biology but also you know where they come from who they are their environment so there are lots of different factors here that can influence the effects of cannabis but mostly we'll talk about in this lecture the plant and the plant biology so the plant the plant has been under cultivation by humans for millennia approximately 8,000 years and by extension what this means to of course is that it has been interselection from humans so the humans have basically been cultivating this for certain characteristics over all these many years is the overarching family here is kena baisha and interestingly enough cannabis and humulus or hops are relatives in this same extended family now there's been some quite a bit of debate about subspecies of cannabis and that's based on both taxonomic and morphological differences so therein we'll will cover that in this lecture in terms of some of these morphological differences as well as differences in chemistry and so forth here that the point really is that academics you know scientists still debate the fine details about exactly what's going on here in terms of the genetics and of the plant but broadly speaking most people recognize two subspecies sativa and indica and then also there's some recognition for a third called ruderalis this is more sort of the laypeople version of the different plants so this gives you an idea what we're talking about when we talk about sativa and indica and ruderalis sativa was basically originally seen as useful for fiber and oil and food from a medical perspective it has diverse compounds and also the high biomass and you can see here is the tallest of the three subspecies indica is a shorter and bushier plant with higher THC on the medical side and higher yield in terms of the height of the plant and in ruderalis is this sort of scrawny little guy over here early flowering Hardy and northern climates and obviously a very small I'm a smaller plant and you can read more about this on the there's very similar stuff all over the internet in terms of the different subspecies this comes from a presentation at the International kind of a Research Society and so basically here we have the different in the three different version and you can read about the morphology more details about the physiology and the chemistry and what people saw see is this difference in cycle activity across these three and also some of this you know work linkages and I wouldn't say this is based on research in terms of what people basically report anecdotally as the medical indications about why people might use one version versus another again this is all anecdotal and what we're going to talk a lot more about the science of this and throughout the course but this just gives you had a nice overview what kind of the common views of these difference of species okay so now let's get more into the research on the cannabis plant so how does studies how does scientists study the plant right well there's really a couple of three things they're looking at when they're talking about the plant one is morphology what do we know what this is based on the shape of the leaves and shape of the plant and the other is chemical so when we talk about different chemo VARs so different levels of THC versus CBD versus of the terpenes etc and then a third dimension that is useful here is the underline genetic architecture so this really brings us up to date in terms of modern approaches and here there's all kinds of super cool science we can do looking at the genetic architecture and how it differs from plant to plant and then relate that genetic architecture back to the morphology and back to the chemical side or the medical side of this so why is this important because if you're if you're interested in the medical aspects right then you're interested in in trying to basically figure out which compounds are important for which medical indications right so what role does THC play what role does CBD play how those differ in different plants what role do you know other cannabinoids play cbc CBG so or terpenes and so this is you know trying to figure out the genetics and the chemical makeup I think is very important in terms of pushing forward the research on and how these different cannabinoids may be useful for different medical indications and again just in terms of the morphology you see the morphology differences here in the leaves this is a tea believe the the broadleaf and indica and then the ruderalis here very different and then again kind of a summary of how these plants differ in terms of morphology so the structure of the plant is illustrated here on the right in terms of different parts of the plan and the flowers or the female plants are covered with sticky resinous trichomes trichomes are basically what looks like a sort of stock with a bulb on the end right and inside that bulb that's where the THC and CBD and other cannabinoids reside and so tri comes again contain all the sort of important stuff and they're not easy to see unless you have magnification but they basically exist them in the flower of the plant and then we have the other important pieces you know parts of the plant here too you can look at in terms of you know family was the node systems etc okay so THC and CBD s were primarily focused here in terms of this course and I already mentioned that trichomes contain these cannabinoids and trichomes are you know pretty much all over the plant but most concentrated in the buds and the flowers and again the two most cited the two most researched cannabinoids are THC and CBD and so you saw the illustration of the trichomes but these little guys little hairlike things in here those are the actual tri comes in a picture and maybe they're easier to see over here but you see the stock and the little ball right where that contains the cannabinoids so what about the chemistry how does this work in terms of plant chemistry well there's a common precursor here and then that precursor is the CBG and CBG then as a CBGB over here CBG a via synthesis gets turned into th CA and CB da and so what happens after so so CB g becomes TCA in CBA and then those basically through a process called decarboxylation and basically through heat and or such as oxygen converts the THC the a version to THC and CBD a to CBD so here you see this entire process here from the common precursors through the TCA to THC and CBD aid CBD and an oxidation actually there's a kind of another step in here it's not Illustrated on the right but oxidation also turns THC into cbn or can have it all okay so I want to talk to them about some cutting-edge work done by another professor here at University of Colorado and you'll also see professor Nolan Kane in one of the interviews that I did and it was super I think interesting discussion with him and he's done a lot of work on the genetics of of cannabis plants he's analyzed well over a thousand genomes and he's looked at diverse samples from him to landrace varieties to wild feral varieties and modern varieties you know collected from all over the place including dispensaries or mostly dispensaries actually and basically what he's doing here is he's sequencing these genomes and then lining them up to see how they're how they're different and/or related so he's published some papers and not basically summarizing the you know some of this data from those papers in the next few slides but this is the actual you know one of the important citations here you can go back and look at this paper if you're interested in reading more about this and so basically what he's been doing he's been trying to put together these phylogenetic neighbor networks where he's basically on a genetic basis clustering related strains of cannabis and so this is one of the earlier slides with a with fewer samples but you can see here you know that the hemp varieties are clustering together in terms of their genetics and then you over here you have a number of strains that you can find dispensary super Lemon Haze they're been poisoned um kena tonic harlequin Maui Wowi clustering up here and then you have the cushions down here clustering together and that was an earlier version he's obviously as I mentioned thousands of genomes into this now so with thousands of samples these phylogenetic neighborhood network start to get bigger and bigger and bigger and of course very hard to display on a screen so here in though you can't read the strains what you can see is that this is becoming a very sophisticated approach to looking at how these genetics are related to one to know how different strains are related to each other via genetics and also coming up with these sort of broad categories so these cluster of strains up here are more broad leaf drug types this cluster down here more than hip varietals and then we have also the more narrow leaf sativa type drug types down here and then one of the later iterations our latest iterations again completely filling up the space in terms of sequencing these different samples these different strains it starts to get very complicated I blew up some of this just so you can see what this looks like and again you see some of these related strains over here and blue dream pineapple Express and then over here Skywalker og Girl Scout cookies etc and then it kind of just kind of cool is looking at the hemp type strains down here and also I'm called a narrow leaf drug type strains but I always find this fascinating right it's kind of fun the Farrell Nebraska number one so basically no one picked us up in a some ditch in Nebraska somewhere right which goes to show you just how you pick what is that the plant can be in terms of surviving in places where it probably shouldn't shouldn't be surviving so then also looking at some key differences not just in terms of genetics but also in terms of the levels of different cannabinoids and again you can refer back to his work for some of this but looking at for example how broadleaf broadleaf drug type compares to narrow leaf drug type compares to him right and what you see here is very clear differences and the THC a or the broadleaf is higher the narrow leaf is slightly lower and of course the hemp is way way lower and then the basically the opposite for CBD a where the broadleaf is is low the narrow leaf is somewhere you know not quite in the middle but higher and then the hemp Friday is much higher in terms of CBD he's also looking at the other cannabinoids and again how they differ across these different genetic sort of groupings and what you see here again is that you know they're not just different in terms of morphology and genetics but they also differ in terms of their their chemistry and their cannabinoid makeup same with terpenes and i'm not all terpenes are not different but some of them are clearly different merci and as an example of being clearly different across those different groupings so in terms of just kind of summarize the decoration within cannabis there are at least three major lineages and probably more than that that differ genetically morphologically ecologically and chemically and again I refer you back to the interview with Nolan Cain real talk he'll talk more about these issues and then going back to where we started this lecture right why is it that people report different effects well the again one reason is because people are different but the other reason is because the plant you know different types of flower different genetic versions different strains can differ dramatically in terms of the chemical makeup and and not just remember it's not just differing on one thing it's different many things which also means the interaction among those things can be different across different versions so when we talk about those different versions we also can talk about chemo bars as a way to put it also and so you can you know you can view these different genetic groupings as you know what are broadleaf narrowly if we also you can be the most THC type hybrid CBD type just sort of denote the chemical differences across these different versions and then you know it's worth noting too that for many many years the only way to study the effects of cannabis to get your cannabis from the University of Mississippi farm that was designated to grow canvas for the government and so a lot of what you know the studies have been done looking at the effects of cannabis over the last 40 years we're done with cannabis supplied from that one farm in Mississippi and so just some questions for thought for reflection do you think that cannabis grown by the federal government Mississippi reflects the cannabis in the real world you know why or why not and how might it be different and how might that impact our knowledge about the effects of cannabis we've actually done a little bit of work on this side again this is in collaboration with Nolan cane but just looking at how if we take the test results from cannabis produced by the government from Mississippi how's that compared to cannabis results tested from from legal markets this is a paper that was published you saw the citation earlier but basically this is the the night at cannabis this is the national drug abuse and cannabis Lee comes from Mississippi compared to testing varieties from Denver and Oakland and Sacramento in Seattle and basically what you see is that and this was done a few years ago things have changed since then but CBD clearly lower in the government version THC clearly lower in the government version i'm CBG pretty much on par with the other ones and then they didn't provide test results for other camels like other cannabinoids like tcv so we don't really know so what's different about the government grown cannabis well the obviously lower THC and lower CBD and we don't really know about some of the other other cannabinoids of terpenes and again that was done a few years ago and I have to say having worked closely with people at NIDA they clearly have been catching up playing catch-up but and also doing a pretty good job at catching up and so things are different now in terms of the products coming out of neidell more closely marrying the state legalized markets I mean having said that though of course it's almost impossible to keep up it you know to expect one small production facility and government-run facility Mississippi to keep up with legal market as fast it's developing across the nation that's an impossible task so I feel you know some sympathy for them because it's just a very difficult thing to do but then you know the federal government their hands are completely tied by the federal laws and by the DEA so it makes it very difficult to keep up okay so summarize three at least three major lineages of cannabis including camp broadleaf drug types and narrow leaf drug types and these lineages differ in terms of the chemical profile in terms of cannabinoids and terpenoids nation for my people report very you know report differences in effects even though for example THC may be equal across strange people report different effects because it's not just teach you it drives the effects there are other chemicals in the plan to also drive effects and that is all for this lecture", "qqvJOAV7oAc": "it was 2012 at the age of 12 that you then became one of a very very exclusive club one that you never want to get into one in seven billion five people on the planet have Langerhans cell sarcoma what's that there's not a lot of research into it so I'm not too sure on what it is it's it's very confusing yeah so that should treatment you were facing that the doctors recommended was a bone-marrow transplant yeah it was extensive chemo radiotherapy and then yeah and then bone marrow transplant and you didn't have just one transplant this was three that you had to have and and how did you get on with that well they failed until the first free yeah they were not - it's not too trouble so it's not it's not a big problem to have and then after that this isn't as a mum because he then really began to suffer ya have to watch himself and how bad was it um well after the fourth transplant they told us that you know the first three had failed and and literally all they had was one more chance for him they had one more bag of his own cells no more they were there you know they'd stress the the the thing to us that there was no more chances after this and and unfortunately three days after he had his final transplant he tracked his fingers down side of the bed and then picked up some infections now obviously infections with no immune system whatsoever and no way for an immune system to even even start to build within his body he was literally being kept alive by antibiotics that's what they told us he did get incredibly ill throughout his whole treatment he'd been very happy and smiley and he'd always been tried to be quite jovial but actually those last those last couple of months are very very difficult he was in a lot of pain you would given I think three days three days a week at most is what they told me when I asked him the the timescale you planned your funeral haven't you yeah to what extent all of it we're gonna do it was gonna be fancy dress and I'd chosen all the costumes for people and it was gonna be quite embarrassing for some of the people though yeah who actually said you want you wanted to go yeah I did he was looking forward to it after four years of treatment it's enough enough was enough so this story then takes at him yeah entirely different turn how did that happen through lots of research I've done lots of research on to see when his secondary cancer arrived and it was so unknown I then said I turned to the internet inside looking and and over the over the following months and couple of years afterwards cannabis just kept popping up people kept emailing me you need to try this you need to nice if he hasn't got cancer you know the cancers have gone this is now a completely different issue it won't work for him is no but I would dismiss it and dismiss it and actually came to the point where I was in hospital with Darren and he was so incredibly ill and really on a high dose of morphine he was actually now on fentanyl which they can't go any further than that and it wasn't working against his hand and and the other issues he had with his stomach and I asked the doctor for bedrock on which is a cannabis based pain relief so it's available in Europe and because I've done I didn't you know I don't know I wanted to go through the proper measures and she actually told me we can't because it hasn't been licensed for children so you know and and more of it came out but people just kept saying and I thought you know what what to lose and you've got nothing nothing nothing to lose it that's dying anyway you know so they just rejoin your antibiotics at this point there was no other treatment so you took this yeah and you asked him and you said yeah yeah I was happy to what did you notice how quickly to think oh my god I mean I honestly do the effect of it blew my mind it wasn't what I expected all I expected too it's done live a research and some people use cannabis to kind of alleviate their anxiety and and some pain and that's what Devin was really experiencing on day 17 when they said there's definitely nothing in his bone marrow there's nothing there you've now just got to wait seven got very anxious and said well how much longer do I have to wait they started to trying up the morphine introduced sleeping tablets and so that's when I actually gave it and within half an hour's hours it administered under the tongue sublingually it's just a tincture it's it's it's not the oil that people talk about it was just a teenager then what we know it's within half an hour to an hour but he was just chilled out he just relaxed the anxiety stopped he no longer was panicking and he was able to just he was able to be compas mentis which he wasn't able to be on the belly always the health-wise I mean actually things being tested against you your white blood cells began to go up yeah after five days or C they told us nothing in his bone marrow so gave it to him five days later when the bandages came off his hand and we saw a healthy fingers which we were told there was no way they were under there when we saw a healthy finger see the doctor started panicking this was now based 75 after the transplant and he was then Tony be there for three three days yeah and nobody has ever engrafted after fifty days so day 75 and all of a sudden his white count has appeared the doctors start running around frantically doctors from Bristol Children's Hospital were called in to do some more blood tests which I said well there's no point you told me on your week ago there's nothing there and obviously in the blood count it was there it's very small but it was there and to test the theory you actually withdrew the cannabis after a little while and the blood count started to go down okay so where are you now how are you now perfectly healthy I'm glad you're normal you stress this is this is this doesn't work for everybody this is not a cure no this is something that worked for you and you could be prosecuted let's be honest well the under current laws in England the world's cannabis is not registered as having any therapeutic value anyone using the drug if medical reasons could be charged for possession possession carrying a maximum sentence of five years in jail or an unlimited fine fascinating story it was so happy that you're here and healthy good luck with the diner he wants to he

jax finkel director of texas normal that is the texas chapter of the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws thanks for coming on jax how are you thank you so much for having me it's great to be with you this morning definitely thanks for doing it so talk about this session where does texas stand with marijuana right now and what is normal hoping lawmakers will will change this session sure quick overview of where we stand in texas right now currently we have a robust temp program where people are growing hemp plants which have to have less than 0.3 percent thc we have a medical program in texas with a limited amount of conditions and also a restriction on how doctors can dose their patients and also we have basically possession of cannabis is still completely illegal and highly criminalized though there are some patchworks of deprioritization policies first chance programs so that's where we stand right now so you can see that we have a lot of work to do to improve our laws here in texas gotcha what are what are some of the main things that y'all are fighting for this time you know really what is very important important and a core goal for us is to make sure that patient access is improved we want to see people that have conditions like any type of cancer not just terminal cancer ptsd chronic pain included in the program and we also want to restore the ability for doctors to decide dosing and give them that medical freedom to converse on that with their patients additionally we want to remove the collateral consequences that come if you are caught in possession with the cannabis flower currently you can get 180 days in jail a 2 000 fine and then you lose your driver's license and have um you know a record for life that can affect your rental ability your grants through school and then also we want to make sure that we're having a really robust conversation about where do we go in the future with cannabis on a broader retail type of market so i think the main goal is to make sure patients have access and people aren't being arrested and then we also need to have those conversations moving forward speaking of the retail i know governor abbott has said before you know things like we will never become a colorado as long as i'm governor i mean are we are we a long way from seeing dispensaries and things in texas like in colorado you know i think that there is going to take some time to have that conversation and we're going to have to figure out what's right for texas you know we don't have to be colorado we need to do what's right for texas look at the other states around us look at arkansas oklahoma new mexico all of these different places that are instituting different types of programs medical and otherwise and we need to make sure that we are making wise decisions for us so i agree with him that we're not colorado and hopefully we can have a conversation about what is the right path for texas last question here we've got a little bit of time explain what's going on federally is there a chance that something could could completely usurp everything that happens in texas well movement at the federal level is happening as i'm sure you know schumer and harris both promised to make sure that this was a priority for them so if changes are happening at a federal level of course that will affect what happens in texas the safe banking act could be addressed in the next covid legislation and we could see the more act being discussed sometime this year perhaps in the fall so i am hopeful that on all fronts we can have a very fact-based discourse and move forward with some common sense legislation jax finkel with texas normal thank you so much always a pleasure", "g998giWQTyI": "okay and then I have some water getting ready to boil here for rye we're gonna infuse the sweetened condensed milk or the Vietnamese ice cream mm-hmm cannabis bye all right I brought a couple choices for you to smell here tell me what you think so we'll just do the you know so you can really just pick based on okay there's another one okay I know I'm definitely rule out the first one this one's really it's between the second and third but Ryu sounded kind of surprised that I would you up with the first one like I would pick any one of these um this one in the lineup I think is the most kind of a coffee like the second one that used to smell of is called snoop lion oh gee if that one's kind of a sour earthy og and then the last one was the orange believes it does have that sort of leather eNOS that you and then it's also citrus I've had coffee cocktails that have like citrus elements in them and they're super interesting what happens if you like put in all three would that just muddled too much honestly I would smoke all these things together in a joint since you said the first one is what you would do we were kind of going lean towards the bird so maybe we could try some of the first and the third yeah I think that'd be super cool actually so we're gonna use half a gram of each of these will be right at about eight milligrams per personal person and we're putting this on a cup did some corn flakes per oh that sounds amazing I didn't know about that part that's great I go play on breakfast you know it's all stuff you pi-1 eat if you're high yeah I definitely want to eat that and I'm definitely high right now so looking forward to that so this is the amount of condensed milk that we'll use in the recipe right okay great so I'm just gonna kind of sprinkle that in there and then we're going to boil it in a pot for about two hours that'll both activate the THC a and the THC and then it'll also in into the sweetened condensed milk", "xvOEzUvjP94": "[Music] and just that quickly Riley mailer takes from medical marijuana I take it four times a day one in the morning and then during lunch and then during dinner and then at night before I go to bed the thirteen year olds from Delaware says cannabis oil has helped treat the tumor that was eating away at her bones in second grade and my face started to grow and it was getting bigger my mom decided to take me to the hospital the news from the doctor was grim Riley who was seven at the time was diagnosed with aggressive giant cell granuloma only a handful of people in the world have the disease I was just like so uncomfortable because you know like seeing my face in the mirror and it's like Oh big and it made me really sad and stuff I was also in pain because of my seizures that I started having my stomach would cramp up and I would start I started to hallucinate it's an actually like a gut emptiness of when the doctors you know first described to us what was happening and what they thought was gonna happen after surgery Riley's mom decided to give her medical marijuana to see if it would help her symptoms I was so scared anytime you give your child any kind of new prescription you're scared to do you're looking for those side effects we just researched a lot and came across you know medical cannabis as a possible alternative that could help her heal and I couldn't find anything that was detrimental with using that the tumor it shrunk the seizures they stopped the way smaller than it was before I haven't had a reoccurrence in about four I'm taking cannabis oil it made me feel so much better and my bone was growing back the roots of my teeth were growing back before they were held in with stitches and I was told they wouldn't live but the roots regenerated and I still have my teeth dr. Andrew ordered with the doctor says there's not enough evidence to support whether this type of treatment works the key is if you're thinking about trying it you need to see a pediatrician who specializes in using marijuana and especially in dosing marijuana CBD oil for your kid before I took cannabis my brain was normal and then after I took cannabis all of these years my brain was the same and it didn't harm anything Riley's now made it her mission to help other sick kids get the medicine they need speaking in front of legislature she's already pushed to pass three laws in Delaware one makes it legal for kids in the state to be administered medical marijuana another lets children take it at school O'Reilly law was to make cannabis legal for children because it was illegal and when my mom gave me cannabis it made me feel so much better and I didn't understand why other kids wouldn't have it I wanted to help those kids hi she's also created the nonprofit Riley's smile foundation it's very hard knowing what helped you and seeing other people who could be helped by it bringing smiles to sick children and their families by giving them a better quality of life just like she she is very inspiring to a lot of people and I love seeing that but what she's doing changing kids lives one law at the time the chef's for Inside Edition com [Music]", "LCasL-iLUOQ": "i like that we have some questions here from our viewers whoever you want to start here is it true that in general covet 19 death rates have actually gone down okay so it depends what window of time you look at and where at the overall curve you are looking right now according to the department of hhs we're actually seeing those numbers go up but if you compare it to let's say february march april yes we have made incredible progress the learning curve for the critical care of patients with severe and critical cova 19 has been very rapid on the part of intensivists critical care specialists all of the nurse anesthetists etc so we are learning how to treat these patients better but right now our death rate is climbing all right and our final question i've heard rumors cannabis may help treat covid19 complications is there any truth to that so i am a big believer in the therapeutic modality of cannabis i think we're just at its infancy right now in terms of studying it and understanding its benefits as well as its risks the short answer is based on existing data there's potential help but there's also potential harm overall cannabis users can be at increased risk of covid but there is a drug that actually was approved by the fda to go into phase one clinical trials by the end of this year it's a synthetic cannabinoid and it is being targeted to be studied in patients with that so-called cytokine storm to reduce the inflammation so not yet ready for prime time but i do believe there may be some future in this but it is an area of intense research all right doug thank you so

most Islanders prefer it that way they like having a natural barrier to mainland America like much of the west coast bhishan was settled by colonists in the 19th century drawn to its fertile soil rich woodlands my guide here is local entrepreneur Susie Gress Susie spent many a happy summer here as a child and now lives full-time so your mum lived here and you used to come and stay with her yeah growing up here I thought Oh big deal lots of trees but now I realize what a special place it is ready it's so beautiful when you've been to Seattle and fighting traffic crowded streets as soon as you hit the ferry dock all of a sudden you smell the salt air and all your cares drop off your shoulders it's one reason I would never leave just like the islands of regional settlers Suzy runs a farm tucked away amid the forest but there's rather more to her than meets the eye line up and see the boy [Music] [Music] welcome to where the magic happens Martin what do you think when you said you had a farm I thought I sort of imagined fields and things like this word Suzie runs Vashon velvet exists the business growing cannabis on an industrial scale oh wow look at the colors that's not the lights is it no it is that color it is this is called blueberry sapphire looks like autumn doesn't it yeah it does [Music] back home growing this much weed would see you put behind bars but here in Washington State cannabis was legalized in 2012 making it one of the very first places in the u.s. we are allowed to get high this is rude boy whenever boys right each cannabis plant contains over 500 different chemicals and Suzi's developed distinct strains each with their own special characteristics what sorts this this is our kind of suture Martin that I think you'll really enjoy tends to be very sexually arousing so can I pack some comes here gold I think you'll like this one but be warmed though some of her plants can be mind-boggling it has such a crazy high it's almost like LSD oh is it take a whiff mmm I love that smell smells like a gas station in the middle of a lemon grove I'm getting a bit of lemon sorry man how did you get going with this why my husband had died and when that happens it kind of pulls the rug out from under you you know all the plans that we had for retirement go up in smoke and I realized I had to start a new life the state came out with its rules for how to get a license to grow marijuana and I thought I like gardening and what the heck I think I'll try it see how it goes and I've been happier than I've ever been in my life Wow looking for work in your [Laughter] more than half of US states now allow marijuana's medicinal use though most still regard its recreational use as a crime classifying it as an addictive dangerous drug but here on Vashon three out of four Islanders back to more liberal approach as long as you're 21 you could buy cannabis openly Susie sells much of hers at a state licensed store on Basham's High Street I'm getting a whiff now even though it's packaged it comes through I never imagined that cannabis could be sold in so many forms from traditional joints to skin care cannabis cookies to soft drinks what tickles your fancy we have hard candy soft candy normal it is to walk into a store like this a few years ago you would have been in jail for and for some customers this store is changing lives Ashley suffers from severe back pain after a car accident I am NOT from here I was living on the east coast it wasn't away it wasn't legal it was not legal in Georgia I deal with chronic pain on the daily basis so cannabis is my life savings over and over again it's a it's a it's a brilliant painkiller is it's not making you stone it's not making me stoned at all I can function normally I have two kids and they don't notice really other than I'm happier because I've heard people talk about it's making too much cannabis and apparently getting into it you don't get any yeah sometimes people get paranoid but I don't have that problem myself and I smell quite a bit yeah it's not quite a bit yeah memory loss no and what about memory loss I don't have any problems last year Washington State took over three hundred million dollars in tax from cannabis stores like this one more than it earns from alcohol those figures are extraordinary and the sheer number of customers has taken me by surprise the pop business may divide opinion but in this land of opportunity cannabis has become a multi-billion dollar industry [Music] the hippie dream has always been bright along America's west coast and everything feels pretty chilled out here on Vashon [Music] while not everyone approves at the islands cannabis culture so long as it's regulated and policed properly it's probably not going to go away [Music] you you", "b3vBzUMjg60": "good morning everybody or afternoon if it is afternoon for you there's big news out of the senate thank you so much for joining me my name is tom howard and this is another very special episode of once again my name is tom howard thank you so much for joining us on canvas legalization news we have some big news out of the senate there's a whole bunch of senators that are tweeting regarding their uh desires to legalize cannabis in 2021 is isn't gonna happen i'm not sure but that's what we're gonna be talking about today so give us a thumbs up and a like subscribe whatever if you enjoy canvas legalization news tune in tomorrow we'll give an update on west virginia because somebody asked for that so let's go ahead and dive into it we posted it on our linkedin page if you haven't gone over to our linkedin page you should uh you can it's canvas legalization news on linkedin we only have 670 odd people that like it and then you can click over to the the story that we have on marijuana moment big shout out to marijuana moment came out yesterday and so there are all these leading champions in the senate that say that they are going to advance cannabis legalization for example ron wyden tweeted we can't address our country's racial inequality crisis without ending the outdated dangerous war on drugs and its disproportionate impact on black and brown americans and then he starts tweeting at people ooh exciting at senator schumer and at senator booker and i are going to introduce legislation to do just that that's fantastic so uh do you think that there's actually going to be some type of vote anytime soon on the moore act well probably not because the more active 2019 is no more the more act of 2021 has perhaps already been introduced into the senate or into the house and then they are going to vote on it i perceive this to be a political issue in the sense that the last time it was voted on in the house of representatives not only did it pass but it passed essentially against party lines approximately 95 percent of the democrats voted in favor and approximately 95 of the republicans voted uh opposed if you want more than that uh go dig into our videos and you'll be able to see when miggy and i were live watching and counting the votes uh of the moore act when it was voted on in the house of congress so now that the senate is going to get involved do you really think that it's going to move quickly no i don't but senator schumer then goes ahead and tweets out the war on drugs has been a war on people in particular people of color ending the federal marijuana prohibition is necessary to right the wrongs of this failed war i want you to know the ironic thing is that he is the senator from new york which has no legal weed uh and then senator booker new jersey finally got legal weed kind of not still they voted on it but i don't think they've passed the bill yet they're getting closer i really thought that i would spit out my gum before i was able to get live on here just a small just a small moment you know i have not gotten a chance to smoke weed at all today i have just been slammed with these uh 10-day notices they're really starting to shape up nicely we have the transporter ones basically if you got your social equity points you did get your transporter application license uh there might have been some errors in your illinois residency points and or uh the not the types of proof that you put to the state i was not thrilled that the state used to say tax records which presumably could have meant real estate tax records that indicated that you know you own the real estate in the particular area and that perhaps you also live there as it's listed as your address but no they said only income tax records and only pages one and two of illinois form 1040. and so i've just been going gangbusters uh what do we think is actually going to happen here is senator booker he fight he tweets out the failed war on drugs has been a war on people particularly the people of color sounds a lot like senator schumer's tweet and that he's looking forward to joining ron wyden and senator schumer to announce reforms that will ensure restorative justice and protect public health that is fantastic now what's the likelihood that it's actually going to happen right now not very good you want to know why because there's budgets and there's coronavirus relief that's getting negotiated right now in the senate oh i think they were also going to impeach that one guy that used to be president when they already impeached him but i think he has to go to trial really really quickly just a second i know i'm not supposed to do this on camera so i'm gonna give myself a small bumper uh why don't we check the stocks i guess they're still doing fine okay well suddenly i feel a lot more refreshed but uh the senate will actually be moving on this in some way shape or form the senate will probably move on it after the house in my opinion simply because that the senate goes a lot slower and then i think they're going to try to politicize this i think they're going to try to politicize this because it was effective in georgia and they're going to be using it for the 2020 election for example going into the 2020 election what if the house does what the house did before and that passes the more act or the whatever version of the moore act will be introduced by uh senator booker senator wyden and senator schumer well after that happens uh if it's passed in the house and go over to the senate now if if just one democrat doesn't vote it for it or if yeah imagine if one democrat votes against it and one republican votes for it still passes right we have um president vice president kamala harris that could cast the deciding vote probably not i don't think it's going to be that close mostly because it's not a plurality even or a majority of the states that have legal cannabis legal adult use cannabis it's fantastic your state should try it sometime but uh it's only like 15 states right now and so that's just not a majority of the population however if they use it and they try and it's stymied let's say by republicans and the republicans vote 97 against the moore act leading into an election year of 2022 i think the democrats are going to try to politicize it so that they don't lose additional seats and perhaps make up some ground that way um i just think that the 50 50 senate especially with the political capital that joe biden and his administration wants to use right now principally on the coronavirus reform means that uh criminal justice reform while coming and and that's exactly what the the cannabis legalization bill is going to be it's it's a criminal justice reform bill more than it's about legalizing weed uh and so will that happen sure uh when yeah but i'll tell you one thing when it does happen you know what it's going to be somewhere [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's right it's going to be 420 somewhere and then earl blumenhauer even got into it and he said very exciting that our champions in the senate senator schumer senator booker and ron wyden are prepared to move forward together on comprehensive cannabis legislation the more act a product of years have worked with advocates cannabis industry leaders and states is a great foundation and so the more acts is a great reform to reform the 117th congress it looks like maybe senator wyden i'm sorry senator wyden uh earl blumenhauer republican representative blumenhower has maybe already introduced the more act to the 117th congress it's already been january so that makes a pretty darn good a sense and now let's read the full joint statement as opposed to just the tweets if you're here for the tweets give us a thumbs up washington united states senator cory booker ron wyden a democrat of oregon and chuck schumer democrat of new york issued the following joint statement regarding comprehensive cannabis reform legislations in the 117th congress the war on drugs has been a war on people particularly people of color ending the federal marijuana prohibition is necessary to right the wrongs of this failed war and end the decades of harms inflicted by the communities of color across the country but that alone is not enough as states continue to legalize marijuana we must also enact measures that will lift people up who are unfairly targeted by the war on drugs we are committed to working together to put forward and advance comprehensive cannabis reform isn't it interesting that now they refer to it as cannabis but in the previous paragraph they were referred to it as marijuana cannabis reformed legislation that will not only turn the page on the sad chapter in american history but also undo the devastating consequences of these discriminatory policies the senate will make consideration of these reforms a priority in the early part of this year we will release a unified discussion draft on comprehensive reform to ensure restorative justice protect public health and implement responsible taxes and regulations getting input from stakeholder groups will be an important part of developing this critical legislation so there you go that's the full statement that the senate puts out and it appears that yes they are starting to tee this up as making it a very political issue and it's not just about the cannabis unfortunately it's not it's not really unfortunately it's the right thing to do to right these wrongs and to create a larger coalition but i just want to make sure that the patients have access to home growth so here it is what are they going to release in the early part of this year they're going to release a unified discussion draft that's why i don't think there's going to be an eminent vote on the more act because the the senate's not ready for a vote on the moore act they're ready for a unified discussion draft on what comprehensive reform to restore restorative justice promote public health and implement responsible taxes and regulations getting input from stakeholders groups will be an important part of developing this critical legislation did you notice they did not mention the word cannabis or marijuana at all in that now i thought it was also interesting that the official sten statement said both of those things but if you haven't read the more act and you should uh you know subscribe to the channel we'll probably read it one day on the on the news probably already have but one of the aspects of the moore act is it changes the federal term from marijuana essentially kills the term marijuana at the federal level because it's just it's just one line in the controlled substances acts you know in in schedule one so it would delete that and then it would create this new thing called cannabis and so maybe that's what they were doing in that because in one paragraph they refer to it as marijuana but then in the next paragraph they refer to it as cannabis and the more act calls it cannabis but it appears that that might still take months let me think let me just think a little bit about how many months that might take [Applause] [Music] yeah man that's it's a lot of months well okay so they aren't ready for a vote but they are ready for a unified discussion draft and then they want to get input from stakeholder groups and so essentially it appears that the senate after the house has already passed the moore act in the last house they have to pass it again in this one uh the senate now is trying to like gauge the room so they're going to do some talking points to get some input from the stakeholders so tune in in the future episodes in the spring when we go over this particular policy statement the unified discussion draft of it and then there'll probably be some calls to action on the channel about where you can go as a stakeholder to voice your support or opposition to this developing critical legislation and if you think that cannabis legalization is critical pardon me is critical legislation give us a thumbs up click subscribe and then also click the bell some people do oh and by the way we got 15 000 subscribers awesome so why don't you join us tomorrow for the news i have taken i've taken my break that was about 12 hours two minutes and um yeah wouldn't you when you just hate to have a lawyer that writes down minutes as hours sounds like something rudy giuliani would do 20 grand a day he was charging donald trump who didn't pay him hilarious uh the last administration was funny but now we have to do other real things like legalize weed and we're going to be talking all about that tomorrow who is our guest join us tomorrow to find out our guest", "usKoWKCmgJA": "[Music] welcome back everybody thank you for checking out the channel this is sb livesoil bringing it live and alive with another one today we got another quick update on our 2x2 mars hydro grow tent we are getting closer to finishing this grow and i couldn't be happier with the results and quality of these grow kits by mars hydro their supplied carbon filter and inline fan has been amazing at keeping the very strong smell of the mach 1 contained inside the tent i would definitely be using this equipment for another run in a much bigger environment but let's check the mac one out and see how it looks so here we have our oldest mac one it's about a little over five weeks into flowering and so far in this last month inside the 2x2 under this ts600 mars hydrolyte it has been doing great the canopy has opened a lot allowing the light to reach the bottom portions of the plant which has been helping the growth of the smaller bottom flowers that were not receiving the same amount of light as the taller tops this has also allowed the mac one to fill out the area a bit more as i didn't use a net disk growth to help separate the bigger colas the flowers are already becoming very dense and are clearly covered in crystals living up to its famous history of being one of the most photogenic plants on the market capulator the grower who crossed the genetics to produce mach 1 has done an amazing job with this strain and continues to create new flavors so make sure to check him out and see all the new cultivars that will be coming soon the colas are starting to stack up nice and the flowers are becoming more mature and thickening by the day the hairs are starting to turn more orange and with it being around week 5 we can expect this to be finished within the month for my feeding this week i've given the plant a top dressing of kelp worm castings and malted barley i have also done a watering that included some k f inputs such as water-soluble calcium phosphate which was made using fermented brown rice vinegar and i will begin adding ffj to help with the end flower production i've also been doing foliar sprays for ipm to get rid of any possible bugs or diseases such as pm that might be lingering in the grow tent green cure is my number one go-to when it comes to removing pm off the plant so if anyone is struggling pm i highly recommend green cure it's completely organic and can even be used up until harvest the living soil the mac one has been growing in has been doing perfect both the mac one and the cover crop are still thriving as you can see i cleared out more bottom branches and removed the bigger fan leaves that were shading the lower flowers from the light i'm not sure if the cover crop will flower this round but it usually does so i'm sure in the next couple weeks we'll start to see some crimson petals at this point i'm watering almost every day to keep the soil moist with barely or no runoff at all the full spectrum led light from mars hydro has been a great source of light for the plant and with how the mac one has been responding i think this light will give you overall great yields as long as the plants are grown with care as i said in the beginning the smell of the mac one is very strong smells exactly like a cross of a fruity candy and a fruity cereal with high level tones of nuttiness it's a very nice smell and leaves me excited to compare the aroma to the actual flavor once it's finished overall this mac one continues to be a top strain for me and i cannot wait to finish this grow thanks for checking out the video stay tuned for more content coming your way on sb livestock i hope everyone's new year is great and i will see you all soon take care everybody and good luck", "mfXGpVi-YRs": "hi when I was invited here to give a talk on marijuana I wasn't sure exactly what that meant on the subject of or just on I hate to disappoint so I'm doing both my pleasure have you ever really looked at your hand I tell that joke because according to lore people high on marijuana are amazed by their limbs often Wells slow motion speed eating Doritos in their parents basement I hate this joke because it invokes a stereotype that is reductive at best and supports a system of diabolical lies at worst but I'm getting ahead of myself my name is David Schneider and I am a pothead by this I mean that when it comes time to enjoy an adult intoxicant I will forego beer wine and spirits in favor of marijuana which for me offers a world of nuanced delight and inspiration beyond the more crude effects of booze but I am NOT here to proselytize and for a long time I kept quiet about my own enjoyment of weed it was illegal for most of the time I was enjoying it and why make myself vulnerable as an out-and-proud law breaker if I didn't have to I also dreaded being saddled with the stoner stereotype of having my every move interpreted through the lens of pothead a label that calls up images of mr. Magoo levels of forgetfulness and passivity bordering on the comatose so what if I used weed not to escape but to engage with art and ideas and food and dogs and hilariously terrible movies I was but one man and I couldn't reconfigure society's image of the pothead all by myself I stayed in the closet and I'm familiar with the closet I grew up gay in the pre Elin bad old days when the only out gays were those who couldn't or didn't want to hide it drag queens and butch lesbians and gay bar raid victims whose faces wound up in newspapers and these Trailblazers might have been the whole of queer representation if Harvey Milk hadn't urged everyone to come out especially all the non remarkable queers who'd previously flown under the radar only then could an honest portrait of this subculture emerge it's the same with weed only instead of drag queens and Butch's weeds visibility parade is led by Cheech and Chong and Snoop Dogg and unlucky subjects of weed busts and I love drag queens and Snoop Dogg but leaving such exceptional outliers to do the heavy lifting of representation not only skews perception it allows damaging lies to flourish and the primary source of these lies is unfortunately the US government which has strenuously vilified weed and its users for over 80 years in 1930 the head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics declared and I quote marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes and makes [ __ ] think they're as good as white men this type of slander presented as science was codified in 1970 when the Controlled Substances Act scheduled marijuana as a Schedule one narcotic a designation reserved for extremely dangerous drugs with no accepted medical use it is hard to overstate the pernicious effects of this weeds Schedule one classification for one thing by scheduling weed as a dangerous drug with no medical benefit the government makes it extremely difficult to conduct research that would prove that marijuana is a not very dangerous drug with a wealth of medical benefits for example to study allegedly less dangerous schedule to drugs scientists just the schedule to drugs like cocaine or crystal meth allegedly less dangerous schedule 2 to study these drugs scientists just whip up some crystal meth and study it but to study schedule 1 marijuana researchers must be pre-approved by the FDA apply for government grown marijuana from the National Institute of drug abuse and be temporarily deputized by the DEA as only federal agents are allowed to handle schedule 1 narcotics add to this the fact that most funding for drug research comes from the pharmaceutical industry which views weed is a threat and has a vested interest in keeping it labeled as a dangerous drug with no medical benefits but as patients in two dozen Medical Marijuana states can tell you weed has a ton of medical benefits from quashing nausea to minimizing arthritis pain to controlling seizure disorders and in the face of all this cognitive dissonance with the government's lies chafing against the actual experience of humans speaking honestly about my own we'd use seemed like the least I could do so I started doing it I'm a writer who often writes about myself and being honest about we'd was a lot like being honest about gayness both called for greater specificity instead of saying I was on a date say I was out with a guy when writing about celebrating with friends mention the ball when I started this coming out stoner campaign weed was still illegal where I lived but I worked in an alternative news weekly that encouraged radical honesty and where I'd gotten high with the editor and publisher still fixing myself with the stoner label was itchy and I offset dread of stereotyping by stepping up my professional courtesy game I was aggressively punctual ostentatiously well-organized and as reasonably well motivated as every other person on earth and the world turned now it's 2015 and within a five-mile radius of where you sit here in Seattle there are a half dozen stores where anyone over 21 can purchase marijuana for recreational use there are also a couple dozen dispensaries where authorized patients can buy marijuana for medicinal use meanwhile 300 miles east selling the small amount of marijuana for any reason can earn the seller a life sentence an insane state of affairs summed up well by CNN's Mike Riggs it should be cruel and unusual to mete out life without parole sentences for a drug that's so mainstream that Colorado is using state collected pot taxes to build new schools yeah and sorry about the notecards I'm really bad at memorizing so we need to strive for integrity in our nation's pot laws and a good first step is moving beyond the marijuana monster myths peddled by the feds one such myth marijuana is a gateway drug no it's not the gateway drug theory holds that people that smoke weed are more likely to try harder drugs but the main thing pushing weed smokers towards harder drugs our black-market weed dealers selling harder drugs the prohibition creates the connection another myth people just want medical marijuana to get high shut up the most exciting developments in medical marijuana involves strains that are incapable of making anyone high opening a world of treatment for people who want their medicine without a side of stoned like kids with seizure disorders also it is fascinating how this people just want X to get high argument is never applied to prescription painkillers which killed ten thousand people a year prescription painkillers killed 10,000 people a year while no one in the history of the world has ever died from marijuana another myth marijuana will make you stupid and maybe insane this one's harder to dismiss and not because it is true but because it can be true for weeds most vulnerable potential users which are kids for those whose brains and bodies are still developing marijuana can create a lifetime of problems from diminished learning capacities to an enhanced chance of mental illness and humans under 21 should not smoke or otherwise ingest marijuana and actually maybe even 21 is too young if I were in charge people wouldn't be able to start smoking weed until halfway through grad school speaking of white privilege earlier I mentioned Seattle's many weed stores all of them raking in huge legal profits on the same streets where earlier weed entrepreneurs earned prison sentences and if recreational marijuana is ever going to be a truly guilt free pleasure we need to rectify our nation's pot laws and do right by those whose lives were ruined by draconian war on drugs sentencing for now if you are someone who appreciates marijuana either as medicine or diversion or both come out you don't need to cast yourself as a marijuana spokesmodel but stop treating your weed based pleasures as a source of shame to be kept secret and the rest of you stop lazily accepting the old stoner lore I understand that we live in an age of fewer and fewer acceptable stereotypes and we want to cherish those few we have left but the stupid stoner one is just boring seriously if I could get every weed smoking surgeon and lawyer

This is my Zairilla's medicated\nchicken wings made with my Zeewee's\nfrom scratch BBQ sauce. In Chicago,\nwe call it Mouth Sauce. -Mouth sauce? Yeah. -That's right.

Adam: All right, Chainz, we have\na few very special things for you to try, here. -All right, what you got man? I'm ready. Let's give this honey badger\na whirl. I want to show you\nhow this works. [ Roars ] John: It's got a ceramic tip\nas well as a bubbler. Its like a warm straw. It's essentially\na portable dab ring. Pretty cool.

For real, how much\ndoes this stuff cost, man? So the honey badger itself\nis about $250 retail. The sauce itself roughly\nbetween $50 to $60. What makes it special\nis the high terpenes. They've probably got four\nor five different terpenes, like limonene,\nbeta-caryophyllene, myrcene. They're testing around\n13-15 milligrams per, as well as\nyour cannabinoids, so the cannabinoids,\nthe THC is testing probably around\nbetween 75-85%, so you're getting some really\namazing pure stuff there. Cool, so how much does\nsomething like this cost? [ Record scratches ] It's $250 retail. Should we try the buggy? This device here\nis our showpiece, though. Our friends over at Ziggy\nhave been kind enough to provide us this rig\nto be able to play with. Took 14 glassblowers\nseveral hundred hours of work. It's a $150,000 piece. They want\n$150,000 for that? -Yeah. -That's right. You think they would buy it\nand use it or just buy it and keep it\nas an art piece? Typically we wouldn't allow\nsomebody to smoke from this, but, obviously,\nthis is a special occasion. Let's load that up\nwith the King Louis and let's give him\nwhat he wants. Yes, sir. You're going to have to\nput something on that, man, you're going to have\nto put a real boog on that mother fucker\nfor me. -Yeah, I got you. -I've been smoking a long time. All right,\nlet me try this shit. Come on. \u266a\u266a Mm-hmm. \u266a\u266a [ Coughs ] What do you think of\nthe taste and flavorings? [ Smacking lips ] [ Coughs ]\nI like it. Excellent. That's what kind of\nmake this sauce so special. I think\nwe should also try, which one\ndo you want to try, Adam? [ Coughs ]\nOoh. [ Laughs ] -The Alien Bubba. -The Alien Bubba? All right,\nlet's do that one. [ Laughing ] [ Mumbles ]\nI like that flower. You like the flower? Yeah, all this shit\ngets you too geeked.

survive stay tuned more flavours coming soon intuiting turn", "gVRdnEq4in8": "[Applause] today an alarming breaking news report about vaping it's a new piece of the puzzle that may explain the mysterious vaping injuries we've been covering here on the show from double lung transplants to even death I mean big complications is the culprit black-market THC the chemical in marijuana that gets you high and listen products are being sold to unsuspecting customers that have no idea what they're buying may be lethal senior legal and investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden brings us this as an NBC News exclusive our investigation took us to downtown Los Angeles where in a 12 block radius we saw dozens and dozens of storefronts advertising vaping products we're in pursuit of what black market operators come here for the empty packaging and cartridges that they fill with cheap and often tainted substances sold as legitimate THC products within minutes we score we were able to go in one shop one-stop shopping by these dank VAP containers the packaging and a hundred of the cartridges into which you can put whatever you want there's no ID no tax no nothing and it's counterfeit marijuana babes like these that may be making people sick I do believe that I was given black market stuff and I do believe that had a had an effect on me Fabian says his lungs were slowly beginning to shut down he ended up in the emergency room I couldn't breathe I couldn't talk I really couldn't even move my hands so what is lurking in these black market vapes and are the legal ones even safe no one not even the FDA or the CDC had tested the actual vapor people are sucking into their lungs until now we revealed those results Cynthia joins us what exactly is marijuana vape and how do you compare it to the typical East cigarettes or tobacco baby ok so a step backwards vaping is just taking a liquid of the compound heat it up and then that vapor is what you suck into your lung so if it's nicotine like a Joule which has 80% of the market that's tobacco THC the active ingredient in marijuana it's made into a liquid form and then it's heated up and then you suck that into your so again the cartridge looks like this that's what we were buying that's what we were buying on these are the ones we bought on the street so we bought for a hundred bucks we bought a hundred containers and a hundred of these so if I'm a black-market manufacturer of THC oil I'm in business when you walked into that store yeah what actually transpired what was the conversation like you said I got a hundred bucks when you got for me did you have to sort of lead him along how'd you hook that the fish well the first thing I would say is that we had our choice of dozens and dozens and dozens of stores in downtown Los Angeles all of them selling these kinds of illicit products and so we said hey we want to buy some containers we rolled off a few of the illicit names that are popular dank vapes is one you've got it right here dank vapes it is associated with many of the people who got sick it is not a legitimate brand there is no company called dank vapes so the black market on this which is what's concerning to me seems to be dominant there doesn't seem to be any way of digging taking them out less consumers are unsuspecting well even more insidious there are legitimate brands that aren't contaminated of THC oil that you can buy in states where it's legal and these counterfeiters make boxes and carts that look exactly like those legitimate brands so the consumer has essentially no idea what he or she is going to get so the Mac market operators fill empty cartridges with their own substances and then they're selling them as legitimate tested products but what exactly are they putting in there and is it dangerous Cynthia brought the stuff to a lab to find out if the chemist a flabs in Los Angeles considered one of the top marijuana testing facilities in the world can a safe executives Aaron Riley and Antonio Frazier explain they've come up with a brand new test we wanted to design a system that would be able to provide reproducible results to do something they wish the government would do analyze the vapor produced by illicit THC oil Canas they've tested seven THC cartridges from licensed dispensaries and six from the black-market we come back the shocking results from the lab [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I'm back with NBC News investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden and for the very first time a new lab test is able to tell us exactly what is in the vapor produced by THC oil when you vape what's actually going into your lungs to remind everybody what you tested okay we tested seven legitimate products these are licensed brands from licensed dispensaries and then on the black market we tested six black market these are listen what did the kind of safe lab testing show was in the vapor coming out of it okay there were no contaminants in either the oil we also tested the oil previously either the oil or the vapor here if that was used at the temperature that's recommended we can talk about that let's say that the lowest temperature or lower temperature lower temperature because guess what when you crank the thing up which is what kids do because it makes more vapor Oh carcinogens yeah so not safe anymore not safe anybody know what happened to black market cartridges even when it was turned at the right power setting on the low side okay under the best set of circumstances this stuff is dangerous it's contaminated this is just you're asking for it you vape this stuff you're asking for it well they're stealing your money it's not surprising they would steal your health well what percentage of America is given products that are counterfeit yeah you're asking questions really hard to answer because this is the illicit market the black market it's underground law enforcement is having a really hard time getting a Tanz around this think about it I mean the FDA isn't testing this stuff why it's not legal across the country so the FDA doesn't have the authority to test these brands but you know states are doing the best they can but the best they can it's not good enough in my opinion because we've got a population doesn't appreciate I just the things I've read maybe it's a quarter maybe it's half of all the stuff is counterfeit it's being brought basically from a drug dealer all right the THC oil let's go through exactly what kinds of things were found in your testing by the way it's state of the art and I would applaud you for doing this because our own government is in doing this we've finally got the answers from you well some of the things none of them good carbon monoxide formaldehyde pesticides well we're in the counterfeit stuff the ELISA stuff for rat you find a couple things that surprised you yeah it'll surprise you to cyanide yeah you don't want your kids breathing that stuff you just don't or yourself and vitamin E oil which is a little bit confusing it really sounds healthy but what they want though is the consumer to think it's real THC oil so they mix it with vitamin E oil why they pick that one because the viscosity the thickness is the same as vitamin E oil so these are really crafty dastardly criminals so let's talk a little about vitamin E because I think it's exam it's emblematic of the problem here we all know substances like pesticides and sine are dangerous let me talk about it but vitamin E sounds healthy right but when you inhaled the vapor with vitamin E in it it goes into your lungs right at the high temperature it's converted into an oil to a grease in your body once in a long some say that it coats the Airways and when it does that then coats the Airways it starts an inflammatory reaction making it really hard to breathe the information in the oil get into the tiny little sacs these little sacs alright of your lung they're not hard to treat now the CDC thinks vitamin E is that big culprit behind these marijuana vaping deaths and injuries but we're no unsure and if these black markets your products are being sold like this the question I'm having everybody is what can people do to make sure that they're getting something that's safe well don't buy illicit products buy from a licensed dispensary is one thing I just want to add a little bit to your vitamin E oil here's so the Mayo Clinic as you know did a of testing on 17 patients who had that vaping illness and they discovered that the lungs of those patients looked like someone who'd been exposed to mustard gas so it's why it's important they're only state regulated marijuana dispensaries in states were its legal right to your point the government won't regulate it because it's only in these states so when you look at the country if you're in a red state maybe you're buying marijuana from a legitimate place right if you're in a great state guarantee or not then if it in the red states from Cynthia Stella me is there more of the illegal places illicit places than illegal ones which means you're buying the stuff from drug dealers they're not legitimate sellers I don't see a difference between two groups so you've got another big warning which I wanted to point out which is the temperature warning just make that really clear to folks so when we tested the legal product that didn't have the contaminants that are horrifying the cyanide and other things cranked up higher they produce what the lab told us were carcinogens but you know if your kids are doing it tell them making those big vapor puffs is just not worth it it could be killing them so if you're not buying THC cartridges for a licensed dispensary in states where they're illegal here's the picture again right you're buying them from the drug dealer don't do it and if your vape pen is an adjustable temperature setting don't crank it all the way up because it's dangerous lots of data support in this now use the low power setting Cinthia wonderful reporting thank you very much you can catch Cynthia's reporting on today and NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt

an oreo-banana-skittle sandwich. Hello someone who isn\u2019t me, Jules here for\nDNews. Drugs are a mixed dime bag. On the one hand, they get you high. On the other hand, they come with a bottomless\nlist of side effects. From heroin to coffee, drugs are drugs because\nthey change something about you, whether it be your level of pain, your mood, your decision\nmaking skills, and so on. But one of the big effects commonly associated\nwith various drugs, like marijuana or alcohol, is that they make you more creative. Stoners are quick to point out that even though\nthey might be too couch-locked to actually pick up a paintbrush, they feel much more\ncreative when they\u2019re high. And a similar idea follows the consumption\nof alcohol; Winston Churchill and others like Mark Twain and Beethoven have espoused the\nidea that it\u2019s important to get drunk before embarking on anything creative. Clearly, Churchill, Twain, and Beethoven have\nproved their aptitude for creativity, so does that prove them right? Well, interestingly, it might. In 2004, a study at the University of Colorado\nfound that about 15% of Caucasians carried a genetic variant that changed the way they\nresponded to alcohol when compared to the rest of the population. This so-called \u201cChurchill gene\u201d made them\nreact more strongly in mood and behavior. Those with the gene reported feeling happiness\nand elation after taking a shot of alcohol. Sorry, let me clarify: participants were literally\ninjected with alcohol so that absorption rates were consistent. Don\u2019t try that at home. Anyway, this shot was followed by a period\nof relaxation and creativity. In those without the gene, this creativity\nwas not as amplified, and on an aside, those with the Churchill gene were much more likely\nto end up with alcohol problems, like alcoholism. But for those with and without the Churchill\ngene, being drunk can make you FEEL more creative, even if you aren\u2019t. That\u2019s because alcohol inhibits brain activity,\nwhich can lower judgement of your own creative pursuits. So, you might feel like a genius in the moment,\nbut in the morning, you\u2019ll probably be disappointed. And hungover. Now, there is some evidence to show that a\nsmall amount of alcohol can promote creative thinking. In 2012 a study was published by the University\nof Chicago, wherein participants had a blood alcohol level of .075, which in the United\nStates, is just shy of the .08 that is considered legally drunk. They were asked to find word pairs based on\nthree given words. So, given \u201carm\u201d \u201cpeach\u201d and \u201ctar\u201d,\na correct answer would be something like \u201cpit\u201d, creating arm pit, peach pit, and tar pit. When compared to their sober counterparts,\nthe drunk group was able to think of more answers, faster answers, and more insightful\nanswers. So that\u2019s alcohol, but how about Ganja? Dank? Herb? Chron? Kush? The Devil\u2019s Lettuce? What about weed? Just based on the hundreds of different names\nfor it, it MUST make you more creative right? Well, a study from The Netherlands attempted\nto classify \u201ccreativity\u201d as divergent thinking -- the ability to brainstorm, think\nflexibly, and come up with new solutions to problems. In this case, participants were given two\nobjects (like a shoe and a pen) and asked to come up with new uses for them. Using this criteria, they found that when\nparticipants inhaled a low dose of cannabis there was almost no effect on creativity. When they took high doses, researchers found\nthat their creativity actually plummeted. But perhaps more interestingly, instead of\nbeing linked to actual drug use, creativity seems to be linked to expected drug use. Another study found that when participants\nwere tricked into thinking they\u2019d eaten a marijuana laced biscuit, they showed more\ncreativity than participants who hadn\u2019t eaten any biscuits at all. Unsurprisingly, the placebo effect still works. So depending on your definition of creativity,\nhaving a beer or two could make you a little more creative, Churchill gene or not. And for you potheads out there: you\u2019re only\nmore creative because you think you are. And if you\u2019re high enough, that last sentence\nshould keep you busy for the next seven hours, or however many minutes that is. But if you are creative, on drugs or not,\nyou probably like listening to music.

The Monster Blaster has the power to bring\nmusic to life indoors and out. Check it out at themonsterblaster.com/dnews. And for all you potheads out there, you might've\nheard that marijuana is stronger now than it used to be decades ago. But why is that? Find out in this video. THC is also the thing that gives marijuana,\nwell, its high and euphoric feeling. Basically, the more THC the pot has, the stronger\nthe high. Potency has been monitored for about 40 years,\nbut the rumor is lately, that today's pot boasts more THC than in prior years. So what do you think? Are there other drugs that might boost creativity?

When you burn plant material, the charcoaley types of material that comes out of that is laced with carcinogens and really we don't want to ingest carcinogens, and that's where the vaporizer comes in. I'm trained as an aerospace engineer. That's kind of where I cut my teeth and eventually ended up in the satellite industry. There's a lot of special things that are involved in making and qualifying a satellite for use, and I think it really helped us in setting a criteria for what kind of materials we used in the herbalizer. Cannabis is an amazing plant, because it has 28 well known cannabinoids. [Conga Drums] Which are the oils and each one has its own character, its own effect on the human body, and by pushing hot air across it, it'll cause the oil to boil, and create a vapor and that's what everybody's after, is that vapor. You flip a lid open, you put the herb you want to vaporize into the bowl. There's a number of ways to actually consume the vapor: The whip, Balloon systems, there's even freestyle and many, many others. Well if people just wanted to, extract everything out of the plant, and get one kind of experience from it, the temperature is not so important. But if you only want to isolate a few of those cannabinoids, you do that by controlling what temperature you vaporize at. You know maybe early in the day its just a very low temperature, very uplifting. Later in the day, euphoric, and then in the evening when you're ready to go to bed, it's the more sedative effects that you get with higher temperature. The the heating of the herbalizer is accomplished, the main element is a halogen light bulb. If you go back to the Thomas Edison days, when the incandescent bulb was originally created, the little-known fact is that it's actually not really that great of a light source, it's a far better heat source. We maintain that the herbalizer heats up before you're ready to use it. So if you're doing some sort of treatment for a medical condition like epilepsy. While they're in the throes of the stages where the seizure is developing, if you have something can heat up and be ready to administer, vapour in less than one or two minutes, they can actually stave off the epileptic seizure. So that that's a medicinal reason why it's important, but the real reason I think is human nature. We're basically impatient people. With our market research of the vaporizers out on the market - they were taking about oh anywhere from four to five minutes to heat up. We wanted to do a lot better than that, so our goal was to heat up in less than thirty seconds The herbalizer, took a quantum leap above where things were before. You know, we've always heard people talk about their their bad trips.  Well, not to be had here. [Music]", "EXDDDNcCmi8": "CENTER WITH THE NEW RESULTS.  GOOD MORNING.  >> Reporter: GOOD MORNING.

along with the grow series and want to get a more detailed view i'll link that playlist in the top right corner for you to check out we're going to start off in the transplanting stage these plants are currently at day 41 from seed and have been topped one time at day 20. as you can see they have outgrown the plastic party cups since these plants are frodo period it's a good idea to move up in pot sizes as you go giving the plants a solid root system if you were growing autoflowers you wouldn't transplant at all and start the seed in the final pot size we're using a pro-mix hp as the growing medium which is a peat-based medium which also has perlite limestone microariza and a wetting agent in it with this combination of ingredients it's a great selection for growing weed while transplanting the blue gelato 41 plants i like to gently open up the root system at the bottom before placing it into the new pot which is a one gallon in size some people skip this pot size and go directly to the final pot but i've had great results doing it this way with the plants taking up less space since i am vegging them alongside other plants in a different tent than the final one that we're going to be flowering in with that being said mars hydro provided a 4x4 grow tent and a pair of tsl 2000 led grow lights for this grow series so let's go over putting together an entire setup while assembling the grow tent i did put it together a little differently than the directions show but either way assembly is rather straightforward and simple for a budget friendly option the mars hydro 4x4 tent provides great quality the fabric is thicker than most budget friendly tents on the market along with quality zippers that are very smooth to use zippers are where most cheaper tents usually fall short on overall i'm very happy with the quality of this setup i believe this is the best value option on the market for grow tents with the 10 fully assembled we can move inside and start filling in with all necessary items since i have cats i'm not able to put any of the equipment outside of the tent this leaves me with the only option of making sure everything goes inside getting power inside is the most important and first thing to do along with keeping the power outlet up high so it has no chance getting near water i start out by installing all the items from back to front so i'm not working around the different pieces of equipment as i go like i said earlier mars hydro provided us with two tsl 2000 led lights to test and give our honest opinion on we are also provided a six inch carbon air filter and six inch inline fan from vivosun for exhausting the air out of the tent we also have two six-inch clip fans for air circulation above the canopy and lastly we added a eight-inch table fan for air circulation below the canopy we don't add that fan until later on in the grill [Music] uh since transplanting the plants have now spent 10 days in the one gallon pots inside the setup for mars hydro which is now at day 34 of veg with my schedule i needed to get them into the final pot size i was going to be tight on time our final pot size for this grow is a three gallon pot being filled with pro-mix hp while transplanting we remove a couple of the lower leaves that don't help with the growth for this grow we've been using the green planet gp3 nutrients and following the tweeting chart exactly very happy with the results from the green planet nutrient lineup at this point we are experiencing a small ph issue since my ph pen stopped working properly

our goals we are now at the end of week 6 event you can really see the plants have exploded with growth from the combination of transplanting to the three gallon pots along with resolving the high ph issue that we're having normally i would have low stress train the plants by now but for this girl i want to see the results from skipping that step now we're going to clean up all the lower growth by performing a technique called lollipopping this is done for multiple reasons such as to improve airflow below the canopy along with the lower sections not receiving enough light when i do lollipopping all i am looking for is any branch that has no chance of reaching the top of the canopy a good gauge is anything below the top 12 inches of plant can be removed at this point [Music] at the end of veg we install the scrog net which is just a trellis netting stretched across an entire canopy of the plants this is done for two reasons first to support the plants when they get heavy with buds and second to pull over all the branches down making the canopy completely even you really need a second layer of trellis netting 8 to 10 inches above the first layer for later in flower when the coals get much taller and start to fall over with a heavy weight as you can see i started defoliating the plants this is now at the end of week 3 of flower defoliation is done to improve the light to all the bud sites along with allowing air flow everywhere which reduces the chance of mold and other problems that are caused by dense canopy at this point the 4x4 tent is completely filled wall-to-wall with colas and bud sites very happy with how everything is looking don't forget if you're enjoying this video so far to hit that like button it really goes a long way in supporting the channel and helping us grow unfortunately while performing the defoliation i came across a few pollen sacks on one of the blue gelato 41 plants this is always a concern with growing cannabis so be sure to inspect your plants from hermaphrodites during flower so you can catch it early and remove the plant before it has a chance to open any of the pollen sacks throwing pollen everywhere if pollen is released your entire grow will be covered in seeds when a plant starts to produce seeds it also puts most of its efforts into producing a seed instead of thc when i found the hermaphrodite my only choice was to remove it i was a little bit more aggressive than you would want to be while cutting the plant out of the scrog net if i were to do it again i would cut the branches off and remove it out of the top instead of trying to pull it through the bottom luckily i had an extra white widow plant that was in another tent at the same stage of flowering so i put it in as a replacement although it's not as big and doesn't fill the space completely we're gonna make the best of the situation [Music] for the remainder of the grow all we did was follow the green planet gp3 nutrient feeding chart along with giving the plant straight water ph to 6.3 for the final two and a half weeks you can see how important it is to have the second layer of trellis netting as in late flower they have a hard time standing up by themselves when they start to fall over they also start to create shadows which results in a lower yield overall once they have fallen over this also is a much higher risk of mold as they're touching other bud sites that will no longer get airflow overall very happy with the growth and the quality of the grow equipment provided by both mars hydro and vivosun [Music] the blue gelato 41 plants are fat dense buds filling out their portion of the grow space perfectly the white widow plants are being harvested for ice water hash as all that is needed is to remove the families that don't have any trichomes on them along with [ __ ] the buds off the stems i put them straight into a ziploc bag and then into the freezer with this method you skip the entire drying process and curing process which saves a lot of time the blue gelato 41 plants are being harvested for flour all i do is cut off each branch off the plant leaving a small branch attached or small bud site allowing it to be hung off of i like to hang everything for about nine days by the ninth day everything is dry enough to start trimming and curing process with that being said i leave you with shots of the blue gelato 41 buds both wet and after they've been dried and [Music] trimmed until next time happy growing everyone thanks for watching and making it to the end of the video you", "EwcP8NPXUno": "what's up guys it's eg kids so in this video I'm going to cover marijuana withdrawal what helps relieve my symptoms and what made it worse for those new to my channel I'm a recovering Pali addict I have six years of sobriety I share my experiences with addiction recovery in various mind-altering substances to further educate the general public and to give addicts and the loved ones hope that sobriety is possible now I know not everybody gets marijuana which are all highly subjective and even though the people that get it varies in severity some people get symptoms that are worse some people get more symptoms some people just can't sleep for a couple nights and some people don't get anything at all they could stop smoking at any time and they feel completely normal I'm one of those people that got severe symptoms and whenever I went through it people would discredit what I was going through and say it was fake not real not a big deal and I'm going through it I'm like this is pretty bad I mean it's not the worst which are all I went through but it ranks up there I mean it's uncomfortable enough to where I remember I kept smoking simply because I couldn't go through withdrawal at that time so the first thing I'll say relieve the symptoms the most and I can't really transfer this on a videos perspective I went through marijuana which are all numerous times whether it's a tolerance break I had to quit to get a job or I just wanted to quit on my own I can't even count how many times I've been through it in my perspective the more times I went through it the more times I realized I feel so much better when it's over I remember being in it and literally think I'm losing my mind or I was gonna get psychological trauma from this and you know I come out on the other end and I feel so much better and going through it so many times no matter how crazy I feel or how much my thoughts are racing or I can't sleep or I feel like a metal plank is in my head and I can't think straight I always remember that this will go away when it goes away my memory returns I feel really calm I feel more social I'm better at communicating it's literally like being reborn so just going through it as many times as I've had has helped me a lot and if you feel like you're not gonna make it out of this you will and when you make it out of it it feels so good that it's really indescribable one of the ways I really screwed up in the marijuana which role was using benzodiazepines or alcohol to help me sleep at night and I don't know what that did but it seemed to make the withdrawal lasts way longer than normal the time line that's for a typical withdrawal is between one to two weeks that's the intense acute part and whenever I remember taking rest'll which is like temazepam a benzodiazepine it's a sleep medication I remember taking it for the first week and then I had my withdrawal last like literally almost a month so I highly go I don't think it was a good idea for me to use alcohol or any of those things and I really I'm not this is coming out of nowhere this is just my opinion but I think that yes it's uncomfortable not being able to sleep and having those really weird dreams and waking up in night sweats and things of that nature but I think that the body heals itself whenever it's going through that and I think whenever I was taking these medications like benzodiazepines it was almost compounding all the insomnia and anxiety and it was causing rebound insomnia rebound anxiety throughout the day and it wasn't allowing my brain to really heal or go through what it needed to go through to get better so yeah I would definitely if I were to go through it again I would definitely avoid alcohol or benzos or anything that sleep medication stuff like that just tend to prolong it the next thing I'll go over is the struggle to eat the struggle is real I had to avoid anything with a lot of fat in it like what I did that helped me a lot was literally going for smoothies like whenever I went out to dinner to be like going to a smoothie shop like Jamba Juice or smoothie King and that's just so I could get enough carbs in me to have enough energy now I avoided too much sugar and I know smoothies have quite a bit of sugar but that's kind of where I broke the line but I wouldn't eat a bunch of like really thick carbs cuz even that was hard to like chew and swallow and it was gross also it caused my blood sugar to bounce up and down so I would have smoothie king but I also try to have some a little bit more sustainable whether that be salad vegetables whatever so that my blood sugar isn't bouncing all over the place but I also have enough energy to get through it I avoided things like caffeine caffeine was not good I mean it would make me way more anxious it would cause way more insomnia and I would stay very hydrated drink quite a bit of water and that all seemed to kind of help relieve some of the symptoms the next one should come is obvious but not research King are doing things that make me more anxious than I already am so when I was going through marijuana withdrawal I'd feel all these negative thought patterns and I'd be obsessed with when it's gonna go away and I would start researching marijuana which are all I'm reading all these horror stories where people say it lasts five months and literally Drive myself crazy thinking I can't handle this or you know as far as doing things that that cause anxiety I wouldn't want to start a new task our things because it was so difficult to concentrate and I'd get so frustrated so fast so it's like with playing guitar I remember doing that marijuana withdrawal it's fine to play a song that I played a thousand times I'll be calm doing that but if I try to learn a new song I can't concentrate my memory sucks in any task like that that requires concentration and memory would leave me just totally frustrated so I'd avoid those things when I was going through it and I would do things that didn't require concentration for me that would be like rewatching shows that I've watched a thousand times over you know because I would know where the story's going I know what the story is I don't have to concentrate or remember what's going on and I enjoyed the show so it gave me something to do kind of like a mission and for other people might be different might be playing video games or whatever it is that they like to do that really doesn't require them to think too much that's kind of like a pastime activity those seem to help me tremendously but definitely a void of researching and doing things that make me more anxious than I already am because I totally flip out and quit on things like if I'm playing guitar and I'm trying to learn a new song and I get frustrated all of a suddenly it's like I want to break my guitar I want to throw it out the window I want a quick guitar forever like when I get frustrated I blow especially in a marijuana withdrawal and as far as exercise because I hear that a lot and I would go to the gym and start to exercise in a marijuana withdrawal I remember doing that a couple times in my life and I remember just getting like no like my pain tolerance is not high enough for that it would be way more painful than it should be and then I would just go to the sauna and try to sweat it out which is something that kind of helped me but the type of exercise that did work for me and it did it was effective in helping me calm down my body and calm down my mind was swimming for some reason swimming I didn't have to worry about paying was just the easy thing to do and taking hot showers did seem to help a little bit with the insomnia so it'd be like going between swimming the sauna taking a hot shower trying to go to bed and relax and I don't know if you'd call this a form of exercise but pacing seemed to help me I don't know if it's healthier dot but I remember just pacing back and forth you know throughout my place and just literally pacing and just walking forward and walking back I guess that's a form of exercise but for some reason that helped me kind of go through my thoughts and calm down now I've heard it get out of the house and I definitely agree with that I think that's great to get out and go outside to get some vitamin D or whatever in your system but I would avoid social interactions with people that didn't know what I was going through and the reason I would do that it made things worse now sometimes it's unavoidable so I'd be at work because I had to go to work and I would just kind of like stay to myself a little bit more than usual but socially interacting with people that don't know what I'm going through when I'm going through marijuana withdrawal the problem with that that I experience is I struggle with communicating I struggle a short-term memory so it's really hard to concentrate and understand what they're saying and it's really hard to get my points across and also like I'm a long fuse at the big bomb naturally but that fuse just got a lot shorter so I tend to blow up a lot easier and it could cause a lot of damage to relationships where I say things that I probably wouldn't normally have said or do things that wouldn't normally I've done and that other person I can't really tell them what I'm going through I can't say hey I'm going through marijuana withdrawal so like they just think that's me normally and that would cause a lot of shame and it would make things a whole lot worse so I did avoid social interaction is abroad but that being said I did let at least a couple people in and know what I'm going through let them know that I'm going through marijuana withdrawal for encouragement support and accountability and I could sit with them and talk about what I'm going through which is something that I felt like I was good at doing and I didn't feel as alone it was like kind of getting it out there and if I did snap at them then I could say I'm really sorry you know I'm going through this detox things are bad but yeah as a whole I wouldn't go out and hang out with like friends that don't do any drugs or anything it's just no could cause a lot of bad situations to arise and totally flip me out and that's even support group meetings are a good thing or that's why rehab wasn't too hard because it's like everybody there knows what you're going through so I do think it's important to be around people it's just you want to be around the right kind of people and those are the type of people that aren't going to make the symptoms worse and those are the type of people that know what you're going through and on the sleep subject because I know that's really important to a lot of people struggling to sleep is a pain in the ass and I would do it all night and that kind of would make things a lot worse it's not necessarily that I couldn't sleep it was that I was struggling to sleep so if I couldn't sleep I would get up and do something whether that's rewatch a show like I said before or anything I could think to do to kind of just take my mind off it for like an hour then try again I would just not lay there with my eyes closed for like six hours being upset being pissed off you know instead I'd watch something and try again and I would also take afternoon naps I had to be very aware of my body when it was telling me I could sleep I took it didn't matter feels like 2:00 p.m. the next day or whatever and then of course I would like if it was 2 p.m. on sleep for like an hour 2 hours wake up covered in sweat and then I'd wait and you know maybe eight hours later or 12 hours later I could sleep again for another hour or two so it was like being aware and being open mind it's like afternoon an afternoon nap so it's really important for me the last thing and I think this is really important is really just not beating yourself up when you're going through marijuana withdrawal at least when I was going through it I felt like the sky was falling and all these negative thoughts had come in and it would be like you know I haven't accomplished enough in my life I'm a loser you know I hate this I hate that and it's like everything is covered in this gloom and I would feed off that energy and and anytime I fed off that energy it would just make things so much worse it's so much better to you know just just know that you're sick you know and take it easy on yourself that's like an important thing like when people have the flu they tend to have soup try to relax you know and they take it easy on themselves they might call out of work they might whatever it is they do they take it easy they understand they have the flu that it's gonna go away that they're gonna get better but whenever I was going through I wanna withdraw would be like I would beat myself up all day and avoiding doing that or at least recognizing that that is gonna make it worse it's really important and reminding yourself that you are sick it's no different than if you have the flu that things will get better that you know it's all going to return normal that these negative thoughts are part of your sickness and they're not necessarily rational or real so I'm looking forward to reading your comments I'm sure everybody has things that helps them personally relieve marijuana's withdrawal symptoms and I'm looking forward to seeing it yeah I love you guys I hope you got something from this video be sure to follow me on Instagram you could DM me there with any questions to try to respond as many as I can as of now and check out my podcasts on Spotify I'll link to everything in the description just check out the description and I love you guys hope you got something from this looking forward to your comments peace out", "2lsXC-BADyY": "- Nate started taking\nmedication for autism when he was around five years old. As Nate was getting into high school, the aggression levels just really started spiraling out of control. He randomly started running\ninto other classrooms, punching people for nothing. It took four adult men and\nhandcuffs to bring him down to the ground, cuff him and restrain him. At that time, he was taking\n18 pills every single day. And it wasn't even helping. I started researching the\nmedical marijuana states. We were able to come to California. I remembered seeing the\nbig neon cannabis leaf in the window, I'm like, \"Well\nthat's gotta be where we have to go.\" (laughs) (upbeat music) - [Interviewer] Why don't you\ntell me a little bit about your family, you have three kids. - Okay, my name is Jenni Mai. I have three sons on the autism spectrum. Each child is of course so\ndifferent, like any other child, and as far as them being on\nthe spectrum, Nathan is what is considered to be at\nthe very severe end. And rather than trying to\nfind the right medication, they just gave him more\nand more and more of it, and that was really the\nonly solution they had. I did not want him being\nchemically restrained in a bed, being (crying) taken care of by strangers. I'm sorry. I had come across this little video clip of a young boy who was just\nrepeatedly punching himself in the head. - [Reporter] 11 year old Alex\nEkels is severely autistic. His self-destructive\nbehavior brought on by-- - And it caught my attention because it was something that Nate had done. His parents were talking\nabout giving him some kind of an oil. I was confused, because it\nsounded like it was some kind of a marijuana derivative,\nand I was actually shocked and maybe even a little bit disgusted. - [Reporter] And after a\nfew months of treatment, the Ekels say they saw\na dramatic improvement. - Within just a few\nminutes of this boy taking the oil orally, he was\nsmiling, he was calm, and he wasn't hurting himself\nanymore, and I'm like, \"Wait, what just happened there?\" (laughs) I watched it a few more times, and I was completely\nshocked and desperate. - At that point, Jenni\nand her family just moved from Wisconsin to Missouri. Two states where getting pot\nlegally for really any reason is super difficult, but particularly medical\ncannabis to treat autism. Currently only 12 states include autism as a qualifying condition. Five other states and\nthe District of Colombia are considered autism friendly, meaning doctors can\nrecommend medical cannabis for debilitating conditions. So that leaves 33 states\nwhere you can't access medical cannabis to treat autism at all. - I was raised in the Nancy\nReagan \"Just say no\" era. - Say no to drugs, and say yes to life. - I would have never in\nmy life considered this to be a medicine, but I\nbasically told my husband, \"We have to try that.\" - Like most illicit drugs, the scientific and medical research of\nmarijuana has been challenging. But the tide appears to be turning. The first large scale\nclinical trials underway in Montefiore medical\ncenter in New York City. And it may be the key to\nunlocking access to treatment for children with autism, nationwide. Dr. Eric Hollander is leading that study. - I've been involved in research\ndeveloping new therapies and treatments, in\nautism spectrum disorders for about 30 years, and there's a big need to develop treatments for the\npoorer symptoms of autism. - This study focuses on a new\ncompound called Cannabidivarin or CBDV, it's an extract from\nthe cannabis plants similar to CBD, it doesn't include THC, the psychoactive drug that gets you high, and what Jenni uses to treat Nate, but it's the first step\nto studying cannabis to treat autism. - This particular\ncannabinoid has some effects on some of the underlying mechanisms that we think are essential to autism. The problem behaviors,\nthe destructive behaviors, and also in some of the\ncompulsive behaviors, or repetitive behaviors or\nperseverative behaviors, so it gets at a key mechanism\nthat we think is important. - There is reason to be optimistic. This new CBDV based drug is similar to one that's already been approved by the FDA to treat a severe form of\nepilepsy that shares some of the same symptoms that\nDr. Hollander is studying. This new research could\nhelp cement what has largely been anecdotal support of\nusing cannabis to treat autism. But while that research is\nongoing, parents like Jenni are moving to states that\nhave more lax marijuana laws. For Jenni and her family, that\nmeant packing up everything and moving all the way across the country. That decision may sound\nextreme, but for Jenni and Nate, it's been worth it. Their lives have been transformed since first visiting a dispensary. - We got home, and he\ntook a hit immediately. We got this one. - [Nate] Okay. - And within, not even five minutes, it was just like a light switch. He was happy, and just kind\nof looking around like, he had never seen the world\nin that way and he was smiling and looking at me, and\nI just knew right away, 'cause nothing acted that\nquickly or that positively ever. - Jenni has learned a lot since moving her family out to California. There she joined forces\nwith fellow mom, Ronda, to start the non-profit\nWhole Plant Access For Autism. Now it's a team of moms\ndedicating their lives to helping other families\nnavigate the challenges that come with getting cannabis\nfor their autistic kids. - I feel like a lot of people\nthat come to our booth, someone in their lives has\nbeen touched by autism, and they don't know that\nthis is an option for them. Other times we get people that you know, come to us after the event, they email us or they find us on social\nmedia and they want to learn. And that's kind of what we're\nabout, we're about educating. - We decided to take a\ndrive out to Joshua Tree. I had him vape and take an edible right before we left the house. He saw that I saw taking\npictures and most of the other pictures that I've\never taken of him in his life, it was kind of a vacant stare,\nhe wouldn't really look, he wouldn't really smile, and\nhe ran over in front of me and sat down. He sat there and he posed for a picture, like everybody else would\nin a situation like that. (sniffs) And I just, I'm like, \"That's it. That's basically his birth picture.\" You shouldn't have to go\nthrough the whole gamut of medications and side effects\nand long-term consequences of some of those side effects\nin order to get to it. Just look at cannabis as another tool in your tool belt to try. - Thanks for watching.

to be doing a infused caramel dip um i already made it i actually ate too much of it while i was filming so yeah it's a lot stronger than i expected to be honest i think it's because there's so much butter in here but uh it's very good with apples oh good um i think i cooked it a little bit too long when i get the sugar at first because it's a little bit darker than i would have liked it and a little bit like more of a i don't want to say burnt there's like a little bit of a burnt undertone so just maybe just be really careful that doesn't get too dark when you're doing the sugar at very first i'm very distracted right now and struggling to figure out what to say i really should have filmed the intro before i started eating this but all you guys are going to need for this recipe is white sugar heavy cream infused butter and some salt of course you don't have to use salt if you don't want to but i find it tastes better with that salted caramel salt part of it um i just noticed that you can see my bruise when i'm sitting down and i filmed that intro and i assume people are probably going to ask what that is i had a vein removed so it's pretty much mostly healed now but there's still quite a bit of bruising but this is what it looks like it was like pretty much all here in here but yeah that's just healing so that's all that is i need to show you guys the mess that i have going on here because i film everything in my living room of my apartment that i live in with my sister and it's not a very big apartment um so i pretty much know my filming because we have natural lighting right here um in this area and this is usually our um like coffee table i guess you'd call it but yeah i have this whole thing going on it's like a huge mess i make every time i film something and i got like the curtains all messed up just like throwing everything around but i feel like the end result is pretty good like i'm pretty proud of how it looks but yeah just a little um behind the scenes if you guys are interested in these type of things you guys want to know anything about my life i don't know maybe it's not that interesting let me know in the comments so like i have just said here's what you're going to need one cup of granulated sugar half a cup of infused butter half a cup of heavy cream and one teaspoon of salt so we're going to start by turning our stove top to medium i think i have it a little bit higher than medium here so please don't follow that please leave it at medium and you want a bigger heavier pot um and there we're gonna add in our one cup of sugar then i'm just going to lightly shake the pot to distribute the sugar and then break up the large clumps in there we don't want to be stirring and moving this around because if the sugar touches the sides of the pan from the spatula stirring it around it'll create crystals and it'll make the sugar clump so when it is caramelizing it'll make like a chain reaction of a bunch of crystals so try not to move it around too much so just keep an eye on this and watch as it starts melting and again make sure your heat is not too high because that's where i went wrong and it got a little bit too cooked so it was a little bit darker than i would have preferred it to be so make sure your temperature is on low and just let it melt on its own again without stirring a lot at this point i decided i was being impatient and wanted to stir a little bit more and you guys are going to see exactly why we shouldn't do that so as i'm stirring and scraping the sides there i start to get chunks of sugar on the sides of the bowl um so all of that there is what is going to cause it to get grainy in the end so had i not been touching it so much and didn't have it on a higher heat it wouldn't have been an issue it's already too hard and on so i'm just going to try and ignore it and try not to let the rest of my um caramel uh come to contact with it so you guys can see here how dark it is this is darker than you want to be this is because i had it on a higher temperature if you keep it on a lower temperature this isn't to happen because it'll all it'll be able to melt all the sugar without um over cooking it i guess so yeah so just keep doing this until it is all pretty much completely melted and smooth again keeping it on a medium temperature now that it is all smooth i'm turning the heat off and i'm going to add in the butter so any ingredients we add into this we want to be room temperature the change in temperature going from cold to hot in the pan will cause everything to bubble and get really big and possibly go over your bowl it won't wreck anything at all it's just good to know so you don't use a small pot i just um keep everything room temperature so that i don't have this issue so there we go we put half a cup of butter in there the heat is off but there is still heat in there because the caramel is really hot and the um the stove top is hot and then we're just going to stir this in to melt it um at this point i feel like because mine was already darkened so much i should have just taken it off the heat but that's kind of up to you of how dark you want to be because the butter will be able to melt whether it is on or off of the stove top there so i feel like that i'm getting a little bit of separation in the butter so i'm just going to whisk this really quickly again the heat is still off and then once that is all whisked nicely together we're going to pour in our heavy cream and again like i said my heavy cream i taken out earlier so that it was room temperature if you're going to put heavy cream directly from the fridge it's fine but it will bubble up really high so that's why you need a bigger pot like this then you can just stir it all together it should mix pretty nicely without a whisk and once it's all stirred you can take it off the heat just try and do all these steps as quick as possible because the the longer it's sitting on the heat the more cooked it's going to get in the future i probably would take it off the heat once the sugar is melted and all of this can be done just with the remaining heat from the sugar without actually being on the stove top now you can add the salt i'm adding one teaspoon the butter i used was unsalted if you are using salted butter which i feel like most of you probably aren't but i'm not sure if you're using salted butter taste it without the salt and then if it needs some add about half a teaspoon and then you can just stir that in and that's it your caramel is done you can use it as a dip you can eat it with a spoon whatever it's very liquidy because it's still warm but once it cools it gets a lot thicker and more caramel like um i have never made caramel before this is or this was so much easier than i expected so this was definitely a recipe i am going to make again except i'm not going to cook it for as long but yeah so easy and it turned out really tasty i'm just pouring um it into this little mason jar that i'm gonna keep in the fridge and then i have um some that i'm gonna eat right now with some apples and you guys can see how dark it looks it looks like it looks a lot darker on camera than it does in real life actually ideally it would be quite a bit lighter than this but it still tastes really good and it's super strong so i am very happy with the results of it and here it is the next day i just took this out of the fridge right now and this is kind of how it hardens to now if you let it sit outside of the fridge for a little bit it would be even softer but it's a very very nice consistency i was really craving caramel apples but they're way too much work to make which is why i did this so i'm just going to chop up some apples i have my two favorites granny smith and pink lady also known as pink crisp or lady crisp or something um and i just sharpened my knives and it was a bad idea to go on with the apples like this because i almost stabbed my hand like so many times but yeah so i am just chopping up my apples and what is it for apples here i ended up eating all these apples with a dip plus more dip it was bad i could i couldn't stop but it was so so good it's such like a nice combination the the sour and like sweetness from the apple and the crunch and the coldness and then like the delicious sweet caramel anyways i don't need to sell you guys on caramel apples i'm sure you guys love them just like everybody else and i'm just going to squirt some lemon on my apples uh the lemon helps with them not browning so that they stay looking nice and pretty the easier way to do this is to put put them into a container or bag and then just shake them around with some lemon juice but whatever and look how beautiful that looks i would give this a 8 out of 10 for simplicity and a 10 and a 10 for taste or maybe a 9 for me because i cooked it a little too long and then i'm just packing these up to i don't know move to the couch with me to eat um but yeah with the lemon on them the the apples lasted without browning until um into the evening i wouldn't know any longer than that because i ate them all at that point but when i forgot to mention the caramel sauce can be kept in the fridge for probably about a month if it makes it that long it can probably be frozen too but i'm i'm not positive on that i will have to check and yeah so this was super easy to make this is the first time i've ever made caramel i've never made caramel whatsoever in my life so i probably should have tried making this um without the infused butter before like i should have tried making caramel for the first time before i did this because then i would have learned that if i stopped cooking the sugar a little bit earlier it would have been a less a little bit less burnt but it's still good and honestly it's like not as sweet that way so it stopped me from eating like all of it at once i i need to stop eating yet but yeah i'm really loving this for fall it's very festive like caramel apple and it's all about being festive you know um yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this video please let me know if you did

Chen director of the UCLA cannabis research initiative can you lethally overdose on cannabis as far as we can tell there have been no recorded cases of lethal amounts of cannabis ingestion resulting in an overdose not a single lethal overdose but how is that possible I mean cannabis is a drug after all with overdoses we tend to think of substances like alcohol benzodiazepines or opioids and the reason that these can result in overdoses is that these receptors also tend to reside in the area of the brain that control breathing since these drugs influence the part of the brain that regulates your basic life support functions they can potentially end those vital functions too and if you can overstimulate these receptors when you take too much opioids for example or drink too much alcohol you can actually shut down the neurons and the part of your brain that control breathing and as soon as you stop breathing that's when you can have a lethal overdose so what exactly sets cannabis apart from the others with cannabis the cannabinoid receptors the cannabis acts upon they are not particularly abundant in the air of the brain that controls breathing and so for this reason ingesting a large amount of cannabis or cannabinoids as far as we can tell isn't going to shut down the respiratory system but there was one instance that caused a lot of controversy in the medical field in 2015 an infant in Colorado passed away in the hospital after they found high amounts of THC in his blood it's still not clear what exactly caused the child's death the coroner at the time listed as having been related to cannabis overdose so that could be one of the first recorded cases of lethal overdose cannabis and again there's some controversy over whether or not it was the THC that led to the infant passing away that certainly is still an active area that people are wondering about will you die from smoking weed we're gonna say 'no you're most likely not gonna overdose for pot but like any other substance marijuana can be abused and lead to dangerous life-threatening situations so act wisely wait Leslie thanks for watching be sure to subscribe and check out more episodes of weed wise", "7H3pe-bJxqw": ">>> >>> IT >>> IT IS >>> IT IS OUR >>> IT IS OUR MISSION >>> IT IS OUR MISSION WITH >>> IT IS OUR MISSION WITH\nVERIFY >>> IT IS OUR MISSION WITH\nVERIFY TO >>> IT IS OUR MISSION WITH\nVERIFY TO INVESTIGATE >>> IT IS OUR MISSION WITH\nVERIFY TO INVESTIGATE THE VERIFY TO INVESTIGATE THE VERIFY TO INVESTIGATE THE\nSUSPICIOUS VERIFY TO INVESTIGATE THE\nSUSPICIOUS AND VERIFY TO INVESTIGATE THE\nSUSPICIOUS AND EYE VERIFY TO INVESTIGATE THE\nSUSPICIOUS AND EYE BROW VERIFY TO INVESTIGATE THE\nSUSPICIOUS AND EYE BROW RAISING SUSPICIOUS AND EYE BROW RAISING SUSPICIOUS AND EYE BROW RAISING\nTHINGS SUSPICIOUS AND EYE BROW RAISING\nTHINGS YOU SUSPICIOUS AND EYE BROW RAISING\nTHINGS YOU READ SUSPICIOUS AND EYE BROW RAISING\nTHINGS YOU READ ONLINE.

already available in more than half of American states and recreational cannabis nears its cusp of national legalization ensuring that the weed you buy from your local dispensary is as potent and as pure as advertised is still a bit of a tricky proposition especially when it comes to shopping for concentrate when you're buying flowers themselves you can check for the presence of chirping crystals on the surface for at least a rough estimation of its potency and give it a quick sniff to clue in on how it will likely taste but when it comes to concentrates you're generally at the mercy of the person behind the counter to set you straight of course if that sounds like a bit of a bum deal you can always make your own and that's where the rosin bomb rocket comes in this 13 pound tabletop rosin press is designed specifically to convert the THC crystals present on the surface of cannabis flowers into a solvent les dabble hash it does us in the same manner in which diamonds are formed within the Earth's interior through a combination of heat and pressure it's super easy to use just plug in the press turn it on and wait for it to heat up to around 210 degrees Fahrenheit while that's happening you just need to take the biggest stinkiest stickiest nug of cannabis that you can get your hands on and wrap it in a piece of heavy-duty parchment paper once the press is sufficiently hot separate the press plates wide enough to fit the paper wrap nug between them and then press the plates back together over the next two minutes or so the combination of heat and pressure will liquefy the rosin causing it to flow out of the flower and onto the parchment after you've extracted the rosin just wait five minutes for it to cool and coagulate then boom you've got yourself some concentrated resin which can then be scraped together and used in whatever dabbing method you prefer whether that's vaping it straight with a peak or crumbling it into a joint or over a bowl of green to give it a THC rich kick while the rocket is much quieter than similar presses that rely on hydraulics for pressure rather than its electric motor it is purpose-built for home use so don't think that you're gonna be able to start your own hash production business just because you happen to pick one of these up the other stumbling point for the rocket is its price this machine will set you back a solid six hundred dollars roughly the price of a mid-ranged average what's more you can achieve the same general results albeit with a much lower level of accuracy with a standard laundry iron or hair straighteners and some wax paper still if you're serious about your dabs or just don't trust the man with your hash stash the rosin balm rocket is worth a look", "LHJD_GFGkrc": "pot weed bud brass whatever you call marijuana it can produce a euphoric high that comes from one main chemical Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol or THC THC is found in resin produced by the leaves and buds of the cannabis plant and when it's introduced into the human body it has psychoactive or mind-altering effects THC is structurally similar to the naturally occurring brain chemical Ananda by an and amide is what's called an endogenous cannabinoid and it acts as a neurotransmitter sending chemical messages between nerve cells throughout the nervous system and because THC mimics the structure of an and amide it's able to travel through the body and alter these brain communications affecting regions of the brain that are linked to pleasure memory thought sensory perception movement and more the effects of THC can vary between people many experience a pleasant euphoria or relaxation because THC activates the brain's reward system flooding the brain with the feel-good chemical dopamine others may find themselves chowing down on snacks thanks to an increased appetite changes in sensory perception may make the food taste even better and colours consume brighter and textures more interesting

and double ducked Oreos Connor perd\u00f3n is a recreational pot smoker and he's also the manager of this store he's never had a bad experience with weed until this past February when he smoked a more potent variety of marijuana I actually took a hit of what we call concentrates and I thought sure if I rub someone in my eye or what happened but like I had a heavy kind of allergic reaction in my face really underneath a swollen eyes were blotches of a red rash what perd\u00f3n now realizes is he'd had an allergic reaction to pot how is your puss dr. Gordon Sussman is a renowned allergy specialist in Toronto in the past couple of years he's noticed more and more cases of part allergies if you inhale the marijuana you can have running and sneezing and itching and itchy watery eyes and coughing wheezing and shortness of breath if you touch marijuana you can have hives and swelling there have also been reported cases of anaphylaxis an extreme reaction to pot that can include respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms hot allergies are underreported probably because of the clandestine nature of the marijuana industry but expect that to change with the impending legalization of pot in the country Health Canada has licensed about 30 medical marijuana production facilities then there are all those storefront dispensaries operating in a gray zone it all adds up to a wider group of people exposed to marijuana more people are using marijuana and certain a number of people are being sensitized and we have to understand that so we can prevent severe allergic reaction Susman is collaborating on new research in part trying to develop a standard skin test or a blood test for marijuana sensitivity Castro C CBC News Toronto", "4lBu59N17Vs": "recreational marijuana edibles coming to a store near you as of now you can make them at home but it is illegal for anyone to buy and/or sell them to the public Canada's proposed edible pot regulations have been made public and the 60-day consultation process has come to an end under the proposed federal rules a single serving would be limited to 10 milligrams of THC the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis and each serving must be individually wrapped this is considered a low to moderate dose of THC this dosage limit is sugar than in Colorado Washington or California where multiple servings are allowed per package so for example in a chocolate bar each breakable square can contain 10 milligrams each for a total of 100 milligrams pot meant for ingestion cannot have alcohol have limited caffeine and come in a plain child-resistant package the draft regulations say the products must not be appealing to youth and the packaging can't advertise dessert or confectionery flavors so no gummies shaped like bears one of the problems which were legalizing edibles were kids so kids came into the kitchen saw this wonderful nicely colored marijuana edibles and as kids to try it out the proposed rules are an attempt to address one of the main issues with edibles making sure they don't cause risk to public health especially for those who are underage but some are worried the black market will continue to thrive which are strict regulations a major cannabis edibles manufacturing California says it's been difficult to navigate within the legal market because there's still so much competition in the illicit market people that are heavy consumers of cannabis and like to ingest it can ingest you know hundreds if not thousands of milligrams of THC in a day and so if they have products that are available in the illicit market that are much cheaper and have a much higher potency they're gonna tend to go towards that so a problem with edible marijuana is that people are not used to it with edibles the effects can later and the people's oh I have now done this edible marijuana and there feel nothing and they'd more and more to avoid putting people at risk it would be better to start with low dosage and once we have clear evidence the black market is still thriving then we can reevaluate Health Canada confirms they've received 7,000 responses from Canadians industry representatives the provinces and the public health community on the proposed draft regulations Health Canada says cannabis products will be permitted for legal sale no later than October 17 2019", "lJQWfTPBSEA": "good morning this is dr dr patrick live and this morning we're going to talk about something that's highly controversial because here's what we know people who choose to use cannabis right are advocates of it anytime there's anything negative about it they slam it they attack it they you know they have their point of view and and i understand that right because for so long they've been ridiculed attacked and the research just is in its orphan stages right it's just sort of beginning infant stages and so there's not a lot of research to back up what it is you're doing then there's the people that believe there's no purpose to it right it's illegal it should be high classified drug there should be nothing about it right and then there's this middle group that tries to say what's the research right what can we prove what do we know so i kind of fall in the middle right i'm not an advocate and i'm not an opponent i'm somebody that wants to know look if there is research that can help somebody then we should be helping somebody so there is research right whether it's about cannabis or cbd oil right there are some uses for it right and you know i've done a couple of videos on that but today we're going to talk about one of the dangers you know back you know i'm 55 right so when i was in high school and people used cannabis right there was no way you could get addicted to it it the the thc levels were so low right that there wouldn't be a lot of permanent potential damage but through time right people have learned to raise the level of the thc and the thc levels now are you know through the roof it's much more potent as a result in the state of colorado there's people who have od'd on marijuana right on cannabis and people would say that's impossible but they did it primarily by using edibles they ate too much because with an edible right there's a delay before it gets kicked in and then it kicked in and it kind of slowed them down and they just died right and that's documented so it is possible right that that is there well that alone right says okay something has changed about cannabis right but as bad as that is and that could be bad right there's another thing that's starting to show its ugly head so a few years ago right i had this client come into my office and they were basically hallucinating all the time right everything was fine except everywhere they looked they would see spiders and they would feel spiders and see them on themself when they did the research and tried tracing back all the stuff that had happened they realized that she had used cannabis and for whatever reason it had created this psychotic break in her mind and now she was dealing with the psychosis and it was ongoing right it wouldn't end right and so we had to help her kind of process through that i had a 13 year old right who had an episode like that he had been smoking and then all of a sudden had the psychotic break right and now he had the psychosis and he was doing things seeing things that weren't there there was a guy that was walking down the highway right and he was naked and he was out of his mind and he had been smoking and he had been smoking for a long time but this particular day it kicked in and now he was in this psychotic episode so i see quite a few people right who used cannabis and some of them will swear like i've always used cannabis never had a problem then all of a sudden one day they do and so there's a diagnosis that they received called cannabis induced psychosis cannabis induced psychosis and what cannabis induced psychosis is is that because cannabis is in a hallucinogen right a lot of people when they use it will say they're more creative and all kinds of stuff because it does kind of open up that weird kind of part of your brain it can also kick into gear to things that we don't really want it can kick in psychosis and we don't know why we don't know who we just know some people will use it and experience the psychosis and it's not because of hey it's been watered down or there's another drug in it yeah that can be terrible but the thc itself can cause psychosis in some people we just don't know who we just know that some people will have it and then they have to deal with it if you've had the thc psychosis right that means you can't use thc at all ever again because now your brain is going to be going in that psychotic way right and some people don't like that fact but that's a reality so that's one aspect there's another aspect that within all of us are some aspect of the schizophrenia gene and for some people using thc will activate that gene and really move us from having a normal thinking pattern into schizophrenia and once you move into schizophrenia there is no moving back now your brain has permanently changed right so this cannabis induced psychosis can lead even worse right to schizophrenia so you have to be aware that this is a possibility and so you have to be extremely careful and if you tip into that psychosis you have to understand you're done no more use that's just the way it is you can get online google read the research on it right it's becoming a bigger and bigger issue for a lot of people thc is a very potent drug right just like every drug even though it's natural right it's not natural in its state that it intentionally was right normally when in its natural state the thc levels weren't that high so we took a natural substance right and amped it up that's what we do right we destroy the goodness of a lot of things by creating um like lab versions right and so the lab version isn't it affects what the real product was so if you could go back in time right there would be no psychosis but now there is and you have to understand that is a real disorder so if you know somebody struggling with it right pass this video on to them educate them help them to understand there is a real disorder that's connected with cannabis you have to be careful so look if you have any questions put them in the comments we'll do our best to talk about it um if you think this video has helped you like it subscribe to the channel if you want to learn more we really talk about all kinds of issues affecting the brain some issues of faith even some issues of just like how do we get through life right and hopefully a little humor thrown in from time to time just as a break because sometimes that's just too heavy also you can check out our tick tock channel the tick tock is i don't know how many people viewers on it you know some it's just different short consents but it's there right it's also dr patrick live so and instagram as well so anyhow um more than anything remember that you have the power right to encourage another person so whatever you do right when you come in contact with another person seek to encourage and uplift them because together we truly can change the world so hey peace duck out", "BdRgA7K4DcE": "benefits and harms in medical marijuana can be debated but more states are legalizing pot even for recreational use a new evaluation of marijuana's risks is overdue that's the topic of this week's healthcare triage [Music] last year the National Academies of Sciences medicine and engineering released a comprehensive report on cannabis use at almost 400 pages long it reviewed both potential benefits and harms we've talked about benefits before let's focus on the harms cancer the greatest concern with tobacco smoking is cancer so it's reasonable to start there with pot smoking a 2005 systematic review in the International Journal of cancer pooled the results of six case control studies no association was found between smoking marijuana and lung cancer another 2015 systematic review pooled nine case control studies and could find no link to header neck cancers another meta-analysis of three case control studies of testicular cancer found a statistically significant link between heavier pot smoking and one type of testicular cancer but this evidence was judged to be limited because of limitations and the research all of which was from the 1990s there's no evidence or not enough to say of the link between pot use and esophageal cancer prostate cancer cervical cancer non-hodgkins lymphoma penile cancer or bladder cancer there's almost no evidence or not enough to say that pot has any effect on sperm or eggs that could increase the risk of cancer and any children of pot smokers using marijuana while pregnant does pose other risks as we'll discuss in a few minutes heart disease another major risk with cigarettes heart disease isn't clearly seen with pot smoking only two studies quantified the risk between marijuana use and heart attacks one found no relationship at all and the other found that pot smoking may be a trigger for a heart attack in the hour after smoking but this finding was based on nine patients and may not be generalizable lung function it also makes sense to think about the risk of respiratory disease in the short-term after smoking pot a 2007 systematic review found lung function actually improved but these benefits were completely overtaken by evidence that lung function may degrade with chronic use lung function however is a laboratory measure and not necessarily a clinical outcome and what we really care about is lung disease once you control for tobacco use the links between marijuana and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease appear minimal almost no evidence is available to link pot used to asthma impaired driving driving while impaired is a major cause of injury and death in the United States six systematic reviews were considered a fair or good quality by the National Academies and the most recent one pulled three of the others it contained evidence from 21 studies in 13 countries representing almost 240,000 participants for people who reported marijuana use or had THC detected through testing the odds of being involved in a motor vehicle accident increased by twenty to thirty percent to study them this is of course a relative increase and shouldn't be confused with the overall percentage of getting in a car accident which is much smaller regardless driving while impaired is a terrible idea although we have good tests to determine two people are under the influence of alcohol no such tests are currently available for marijuana making enforcement more difficult we did a whole episode on pregnancy effects babies born to women who smoke pot during pregnancy are more likely to be underweight delivered premature and admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit according to a 2016 systematic review but there were no links seen for changes in birth lengths head circumference or congenital malformations there's limited evidence for pregnancy complications for mothers and there's not enough evidence to come in on much else about babies and their outcomes memory and concentration there's moderate evidence from many studies that learning memory and attention can be impaired in the 24 hours after marijuana use there's limited evidence however that this translates into worse outcomes in academic achievement employment income or social functioning or that these effects linger after the pots worn off mental health the possible relationship between marijuana use and mental health is complicated the most recent meta-analysis found that there's a significant connection between heavy marijuana use and a diagnosis of psychosis specifically schizophrenia this mirrored the findings of previous reviews that sought to cover only high quality studies another systematic review highlighted a potentially small but statistically significant link between marijuana use in the development of bipolar disorder heavy users of pot are also more likely to say they have suicidal thoughts what makes this complicated is that it's hard to establish the arrow of causality are people who smoke pot more likely to develop mental health problems or people with mental health problems more likely to smoke pot there's a similar issue when talking about the relationship between using pot and other substances so I'm able see marijuana as a gateway drug leading to other substance user abuse but others and a lot of research see this only as a correlation in which people who are likely to use or abuse substances are more likely to use pot as well secondhand smoke has states legalize the drug for general use more cannabis users feel freed from secrecy they smoke more in public raising worries about secondhand smoke a two-year old study made news recently by arguing that one minute of exposure to pot smoke impaired how vessels responded to blood flow for at least 90 minutes a greater impairment than seen from tobacco this was a study in rats though not of humans out in the world as for the risk of a contact eye the amount of THC detectable in secondhand smoke is negligible almost everyone agrees that children should not use pot but concerns are legitimately raised about whether children might have increased exposure or access after legalization although this issue has not been studied widely it's possible that pot the THC and the metabolites from smoke could have an effect in the developing brains of children these concerns are more applicable to adolescents who use pot regularly however not the accidental ingestion reported in the news once in a while new questions almost all the harms the medical literature focuses on involves smoked cannabis we know little to nothing about edibles and other means of administration nor do we have any consistent manner of measuring the level of exposure bottom line you gotta weigh the pros and cons many of the harms we've discussed are statistically significant and yet they're of questionable significance almost all the increased risks are relative risks the absolute or overall risks are often quite low we haven't focused on the potential benefits especially medical ones here but many people use pot even rationally for benefits they perceive to be greater than the harms we've listed we unquestionably need more research and more evidence of harms may emerge but it's important to note that the harms we know about now are practically nil compared to that of many other drugs and that marijuana's effects are clearly less harmful than those associated with tobacco or alcohol abuse people who choose to use marijuana now that it's easier to do so legally will need to weigh the pros

for three and a half years which cost us almost $900 a month copay and we also did lots of speech therapy and lots of occupational therapy they just got exhausting and he wasn't really changing she says the deciding factor in IANS new treatment was a trip to the doctor where she asked about options for medication and he told me no seroquel and I was like I'm not putting him on an anti-psychotic

marijuana became legal here some parents have looked into the treatment but she says there haven't been a lot of studies on the effects of medical marijuana on children with autism so we are cautioning families about what they read and what they do to make some really wise choices and not do anything without the help of a physician she says she supports medical marijuana but doesn't feel comfortable recommending it just yet it may be that it works with some that marijuana might work with some and not with others just like other medications we will certainly continue to watch the research we want to give out good information and we wanted information that we feel like we can trust but for melody she says so far this is the best choice for her child she says as long as he's

recreationally legal in Canada way to go it's already legal in some American states nine of them including California Colorado and Nevada and in one country Uruguay but if you're one of those people who has a naysayer if you are opposed to legalization or if you're still opposed relax because guess what cannabis can make you healthier sexier and richer we are learning how cannabis can be used as a medicine treating all kinds of ailments from epilepsy to the nausea caused by chemotherapy seniors are using it to improve their quality of life we are becoming friendlier more creative and more relaxed cannabis affects how we interact with one another because it can create a greater sense of empathy it can provide us with a higher level of sensitivity so that the food we eat is tastier and the sex is better cannabis cultivation dates back 12,000 years making it one of humanity's oldest crops and the business of cannabis brings with it so many opportunities cannabis is a disrupter it's going to change the entire wellness industry it has a history of medical use exceeding 5,000 years and now it's finally legal again there are many ways in which we are discovering how cannabis can make us healthier but we don't need to smoke cannabis or even get high to enjoy its benefits CBD is a cannabinoid which does not make you high and it can be taken in so many ways through supplements such as CBD oil tinctures and edibles or it can be applied and absorbed on the skin we are putting CBD in everything these days creams in our makeup in shampoo in teas and other drinks even in pet food and for good reason every part of your body has CBD receptors just waiting to come in contact with CBD and when they do cannabis stimulates your body to produce more of its own endocannabinoids which help your body's cells regulate themselves improving your sleep your appetite coordination and boosting your immune system it balances and aligns your body's metabolic processes cannabis is an effective painkiller it's an alternative treatment to opiates the active ingredients in marijuana calm the secretion of pain signaling chemicals in your body when you're experiencing pain cannabis signals your body to stop hurting and topical creams are being used now to treat pain to treat soreness and to treat inflammation even chronic pain such as fibromyalgia athletes use CBD to ease inflammation cannabis especially CBD oil can treat anxiety in people and believe it or not in pets cannabis is being used now to treat autism ADHD schizophrenia epilepsy social phobia and PTSD we know there is so much potential in what CBD and THC can do and cannabis can make you smarter THC and CBD are antioxidants that help prevent damage and degeneration of brain cells cabin noise protect an aging brain so cannabis can help in treating diseases like Alzheimer's multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's but cannabis doesn't just make you healthier it can make you richer here are some interesting statistics on why you should invest in cannabis right now US legal cannabis sales is expected to rise by fifty percent this year to ten billion dollars but the actual estimated US market including the black market as it's not currently legal everywhere in the u.s. is fifty two billion dollars a year and there is some that say if the entire US was legalized that sales of marijuana would top cigarette sales which are currently at ninety three billion dollars a year cannabis is big business so the hype around cannabis stocks is not surprising it's definitely warranted as the industry really is just getting started there are already six multi-billion dollar cannabis companies but there's still plenty of room to grow in August 2018 Constellation Brands one of the world's largest alcohol brands owning Corona beer made a five billion dollar investment into one of the world's largest cannabis companies canopy growth bringing that company's market capitalization to over thirteen billion dollars and it's not even recreationally legal yet I get asked all the time where should I be putting my money in cannabis is it too late to invest or how do I invest in a cannabis stock before it reaches a billion dollar valuation I'm gonna share a secret with you it's called the Canadian securities exchange on that exchange sir over 80 cannabis companies listed many of which are at the very early stages and any of which could be the next billion dollar enterprise every once in a while we find ourselves in the right place at the right time now is the time to buy cannabis stocks in Canada although there are several billion-dollar companies out there you want to look for the companies that could be targets and could be acquired so buy into those CSC listed companies this is what you need to look for look for companies that are pursuing an international strategy with assets in other countries as recreational cannabis becomes legal as it will hopefully all over the world and look for companies that are growing CBD are conducting research and development to find out how cannabis can heal us and look for companies developing strong brands whether it's in flower edibles or topicals an example of a strong brand that I like is a company I found it called the yield growth Corp and we're launching a cannabis line called urban juice if you want to look at a company that's entering new territories around the world take a look at crop infrastructure it's a public company listed on the CSC under the symbol crop and they've actually bought the Italian rights to urban juice there are so many cannabis companies poised to grow as legal cannabis changes the way we heal the way we play and the way we interact it's a gold rush only this time the gold rush is a green rush but more importantly let's talk about how cannabis can improve your sex life cannabis can intensify feelings and connection with a partner and it can yield better orgasms some people smoked it as an aphrodisiac there are so many strains I need to experiment to determine what works for you experts recommend that adults experiment with smoking or vaping to find out your perfect strain one toke at a time it can be very strong cannabis infused lubricants may well change women's sex lives forever a company that I found in urban truth has filed a patent for a female sexual lubricant that includes ashwagandha oil which is an exotic Indian oil that relaxes combined it with THC and hamper oil and we theorize that that will increase orgasmic activity in women how can that be wrong people have been arguing for 50 years to legalize cannabis the public pressure in the last 15 years has been particularly strong the media has been a big supporter to legalize cannabis and there are still many media companies working hard to educate the world about it such as the Canadian cannabis media if you were one of those people who was opposed to legalization I encourage you to open your mind to it anyway and try to get on board with this you're gonna find that this natural plant is going to be responsible for an economic resurgence and social change when you come to realize that cannabis can make you richer healthier and smarter you may thank me consider educating yourself about how cannabis can heal you cannabis comes in mainly two strains sativa which generally stimulates an indica which often relaxes most strains are a genetic combination of both you can think of it kind of like white wine and red wine on steroids we each have an endocannabinoid system that is naturally set up to receive cannabis you need to find out which strains are right for you sort of like a wine tasting personally I love a good Sauvignon but I won't touch Chardonnay if you're living somewhere that has legalized cannabis like we will be here shortly if you're of legal age and if you find yourself on a Friday night going out for a glass of wine don't be afraid to visit your local dispensary these are the new wine stores check out the various cannabis strains inhaled aromas like you would a good wine consult with your bud tenders they're the somalis of the future for those of you that have already tried cannabis Bravo keep it up responsibly for the rest of you adults please consider giving it a try it's a new world good luck and have fun [Applause]", "ifjcIiolSS8": "[Music] what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to be making cannabis gummy bears so let's get into it [Music] so the first thing you want to do is measure out your cannabis i'm going to be using seven grams of cannabis to make my gummy bears [Music] all right guys i got my seven grams of cannabis so now i'm going to put this in a mason jar and the carpet all right guys so now i'm going to decarb our cannabis for about 40 minutes and the oven temperature that i'm going to be using is 240. [Music] so all right guys so while your cannabis is the carving measure out your coconut oil so for this recipe we're going to be using a quarter cup of coconut oil i'm going to be using coconut mct oil to make my gummy bears so even though we're going to be using a quarter cup of coconut oil i'm going to measure out a half a cup of coconut oil because we're going to lose some of that coconut oil during the infusing process so just keep that in mind all right guys my cannabis is now the carb so now i'm going to add our coconut oil to the mason jar now i'm going to add a teaspoon of lecithin to my mason jar all right guys so now we're going to do is put this in a pot and let it simmer for about two hours add your pot to the stove [Music] add your mason jar now let it simmer for about two hours all right guys so i've been over two hours so now we're going to filter out our cannabis [Music] all right guys my cannabis coconut oil is now done so now let's start working on the cannabis gummies so before we start working on our gummies i'm going to spray my gummy molds with this non-stick cookie spray all right guys so now what i'm going to do is put my pipe on the stove and now we're going to turn the temperature on low [Music] so now i'm going to add in my water i'm going to be using 2 3 cups of water [Music] guys what i actually recommend you to do is turn your stove on like medium heat just so it can speed up the heating process and then once my water get kind of hot i'm going to reduce the temperature back down to two and then add in my cannabis oil and then all of the other ingredients so um so that's what i'm gonna do all right guys so i let my temperature stay on medium heat for about two minutes and now i can see the water is starting to boil a little bit so now what i'm gonna do is reduce the temperature back down to low [Music] all right so now we're going to do is add the candle oil [Music] now i'm just going to mix it together now another thing too guys usually water and oil wouldn't mix but that's why i added the lecithin to my can of oil so if you already have kind of oil made and it's not made with lecithin at this point i would add a teaspoon of lecithin so just keep that about all right guys so we're going to keep the temperature on low and i'm just going to let the water and the wall incorporate together all right guys my mist is fully incorporated so now we're going to add the unflavored [Music] gelatin [Music] and just mix it together so i'm just going to mix for about 2-3 minutes i want to make sure everything is incorporated all right guys so now we're going to do is add in our pack of [Music] jello [Music] all right guys so now we're going to do is add our mix to the mold all right guys so once you finish filling your modes put your bows in the freezer for a few hours [Music] all right guys so been about four hours so now we're going to remove the gummy bears from the mood so now what i'm trying to do is just remove some of the extra gummies from the gummy bears if that make any sense so so this right here i'm going to strip that from the gummy bears just to make it look a little bit better [Music] there we go [Music] all right guys my cannabis gummy bears is now done to my left is the medium-sized gummy bears and to my right is the small size gummy bears i personally like the medium size better but what i'm going to do is leave the link for both sides in the description below but um thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace [Music] you", "JUCaBvF0_YM": ".

racer and the agent orange that are in the auto pots okay guys so first off what we're gonna do is we're going to harvest these skittles um hang that up we're just gonna hang it up behind me here uh till the end of the video and then i'll move it into a dark place to dry all right let's take a look at her okay so there she is she is ready to come down uh she's either eight or nine weeks into flower and uh yeah she's ready she's definitely ready now she's got a good amount of frost there and uh she smells really good very sweet so she's got some fairly nice thick colas on there um not not as dense as i would like but uh you can't win them all and uh yeah this definitely reminds me of of an early miss that i grew a few years back that had lots of butt on it it gave me a pound of dry weed but uh it was just really loose it still smoked well um so i'm not too worried about it as this is just for myself anyway so uh yeah so let's uh get out the loppers there and we will take her down okay so we're going to take her all down in one piece um as the winter months come in here it's getting a little bit dry i'm only at about 45 percent humidity in here and i'll have to add some humidity to my closet to dry down to slow down the drying process but another way we can slow down the drying process a little bit is to cut it all in one and it it tends to hold on to the moisture a little bit better from what's inside the plant and gives you a little bit of a slower dry so that's what we'll do we'll just oh i know i'm gonna hear about that anyway okay so there we have it there's your bouquet shot and uh yeah so we got some we got some decent colas going on here now we have a lot underneath here where i didn't take off a lot underneath of this one so we have a lot of larp here a lot of low buds and uh so yeah they'll be used for processing but the top buds they'll be good for smoke so that's all right so we're gonna hang it right up over here okay so there she is so i'm satisfied with that i would have liked them to be a little denser but that's all right um so i'm either gonna hang this in my closet after this video or i might perhaps cut off these top buds that i'm going to be using for smoke and i might throw it in the bowl trimmer and just give it a quick trim that way so i'll decide that after the video i guess all right guys so let's get at these uh these plants here in the auto pots so they're not on the system yet uh i got everything hooked up ready to go she's all hooked into the reservoir but the reservoir is empty here and uh i will be filling that up this week and starting them on that uh they're owning kryptonite organic soil uh which has everything that you need to grow your cannabis plant so just like it says on the bottom just add water that's what i've been feeding just uh i'm on my own well so i am feeding them just well water it comes out with the ph at around seven so i just been straight i just been giving them straight water uh so this week i will be filling up the res with that water and uh we'll be running it through the actual system so last week what we did was we went around and took off some of the big leaves and uh defoliated some now we still got some big leaves growing out didn't slow them down a bit uh the one in the back i kind of messed up and i actually took off the bottom branch in the back because i was trying to take off the leaf and i i ended up grabbing the branch and pulling that off but uh she still seems fine um she'll grow we won't even miss that one branch so so what i want to do today is i want to top these guys we have the three cafe racers in the back uh that i got from rocket seats uh they're taking off really well and then we have the two agent orange here in the front from sunwest genetics uh they're also doing very well so uh another thing i want to do today is this is the tomato slice that i put in the ground and these are all new tomato plants growing up so what i'm going to do today too is i'm gonna pick out one of these and uh maybe even two and pull the rest out and let those two go and see which one does the best and then pull that one out down the road and so eventually we're gonna have one tomato plant growing up in here too so all right so what i'll do is i'm gonna put you on the tripod and i'm gonna bring these up one at a time because i'm gonna top them at the top and this time i'm also going to top the side branches also so i just figured it'd be easier than trying to get squeeze my fat ass down in there and end up chopping off something i'm not supposed to like i did last week on that one back there okay so this is the first one uh i'm gonna get right in here now first off i'll top the the main top so i'm gonna take it down a node and uh just to even the canopy out i'm gonna take it right here so i'm gonna take it right in here so we'll just come in here with our clips now we're gonna leave a little space between the the crook of the node there and come up a little bit and just just snip it off just like that now by leaving that little nub right in there that will help prevent it in the future from uh from splitting if you cut it all the way down and then you get two growths coming out like this and they get heavy it's much apt to split if you cut it right down to the node but if you leave a little piece that will dry up and harden up on there and that will help prevent it from doing that okay so uh i'm also gonna take off there's a couple of these big leaves here i take that one off and i'm gonna take that one off just to open it up a little bit and i'm also going to top just the four main outside branches so i'm going to come in here this one i'm going to cut right at the top so we're going to cut that one off and cut that one off that one and that one okay so we've we've topped the outside four and we've also topped the very top here so i'm also going to take off this leaf and this one also just because they're kind of blocking that hole inside and i'll take this one off and the the ones facing the inside on these outside branches these are the ones that cover most of the most of the lower bud sites in there so i'm going to take that one off too there the rest look all right so that's it we've topped that one we can see right here where we've topped it right in there we've also topped the four main outside ones and took off the big leaves in the middle that were covering all the uh all the inside stuff in here so so that's it for this one that one and it also really evened out the canopy quite a bit so next i think what i'll do is i'll just grab that tomato thin that out and then after that we'll just do the rest of these and i'll put some music to the uh video and uh yeah we'll just get it done okay so uh grab the got some tweezers here so yeah we have a lot of plants here so i'm going to pick out the the ones in the best shape now this one here looks pretty good here so i'm liking the looks of that one and maybe also one up this side here and then we'll pull everything else out so now what we don't want to do is the seeds were pretty close together in that slice of tomato so the roots could be tangled up down there and we don't want to pull out one of the ones that we want to discard and then pull out the one we want to keep to so i'm just going to take my fingers kind of hold down on the one i want to keep use the tweezers and i'm going to pull outwards now this one's snapped off that's fine and then we're going to do the same thing with these ones just pull them off to the side here some of these got roots on them if you wanted to you could replant most of these and then yeah and have a bunch of tomatoes i only want one in here so that's what i'm gonna keep okay now i see this one here i don't know if you can see that or not but that's a that's a pretty nice one it is kind of lean in a bit though there's one here that's pretty nice too maybe i'll keep that [Music] okay so we have two here now now i see another one they're trying to grow pull that out i'm just going to give this a little push down here [Music] and i'm just going to throw away there there's probably 10 or 12 good tomato plants there so in the spring if you want to plant a bunch of tomatoes outside you could even start them like this and then just use use your tweezers pull them out and plant them in another little container and have as many as you need so so that's all i'm going to do with this i'm going to take it and put it back put it back in its tray and we'll let these grow up for another week or so we'll see which one's the strongest i'm assuming it's this one it has more leaves on it it just looks healthier but uh well i'm just gonna leave them both grow for a minute and uh and then we'll decide which one's the best we'll pull the other one out and that'll be our tomato plant [Music] okay so i took i took a couple of these the inside ones were a little bit higher than the back ones actually so i did top those ones as well you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Applause] okay guys so we got her done uh we have the cafe racers all topped up i did top some some a little more than others some of the ones had this branch uh that was coming out more than the outside branch so i top those also so it's basically whatever ones you want to top top and whichever ones you don't don't so it's it's that simple so so now that should let them uh all grow out at a lot more of an even canopy instead of the christmas tree style growth the main tops they put out this hormone that that inhibits the uh the growth of the ones right below it which is what gives you the christmas tree uh type of look and uh by topping that you're stopping the production of that pheromone or hormone or whatever it is and it kind of distributes everything a little more evenly so they should grow up uh more of the way we wanted to instead of how they would in nature where in nature they're fighting for the light because they might be growing up in a forest with ferns and and all kinds of other plants that they have to fight to be at the very top in order to get any of the sunlight which is why they tend to grow the way they do but here they've got lots of light here and uh i want to take advantage of that they're not gonna have to fight for the light so we're gonna we're gonna make them grow out the way we want them to to produce the most that we can get so uh yeah so and uh yeah i have this i have these under the fc-4800 mars hydro um great light i i this is my favorite light in the whole house and uh yeah it's it's just very good it's it's an even light it's not uh like super bright in the middle and then drops off this is this covers this four by four area easily and i would think you could probably even go close to a five by five with this and still have lots of power to flower your girls so anyway super happy with that you can check them out on mars hydro if you like and now i will decide what i'm going to do with the skittles autoflower um now this came from i love growing marijuana.com and you can check them out i have link in the description they have sales going on the 12 days of christmas and so you buy 10 get 10 free and i'm pretty sure the skittles is on that list

another video guys let's dive into one of the most highly requested asx stock sectors and look at the cannabis sector we know over the last few weeks there have been some announcements that have come out that have pushed the prices of these stocks and i believe that's why a lot of you have been requesting them in previous videos so like with all videos on the channel we're going to go and dive into the technical analysis so if you're new to the channel this is one of the first videos you're seeing you don't know what technical analysis is stick around subscribe to the channel hit the bell notification icon as well so you know when they come out basically we're going to figure out whether these are stocks at a good position to be buying or selling of course none of this is financial advice get that out of your head we're just looking at the charts to figure out whether these are at a good position or not the rest is up to you you need to do your own research to figure out whether it's a company that you like the look of so let's take a look at about 10 or 12 of these that i have on the watch list and determine what position they are in in their current cycle lastly if you find any value for them hit that like button down below because it goes a long way to helping out the channel get noticed and push through that damn youtube algorithm all right let's go and check out these stocks so you can see here is the list on the side what i'm using here is tradingview.com if you don't already have a an account for yourself i have a link in the description for trading view you get 30 bucks for free when you sign up otherwise you can use the free version just know that you'll get a lot of pop-up ads if you want to get rid of them just pay the damn 12 or 15 bucks a month it's really worth the investment if you're looking to trade or to invest long term very very helpful all right first stock i've got is a c 8 now most of these have been requested and i threw in another few which i found on stock head so you've got a few of them here these are pretty great articles if you just want to have a look at some ticker symbols to get started on i'm not going to go and dive into all these all it does is just tell you the sector and how much of the business is made up of cannabis all right so back to the chart ac8 i'm sure if you're a regular viewer of the channel you guys would know this pattern by now it's essentially a pump and dump all right so it's pretty much news announcements if you're new to this and these are the first times you've seen it and you're interested in cannabis stocks probably because you've heard of it you probably heard of it a week or two ago right around these peaks pretty much when that comes out it's usually the worst time to buy you have to make your own decision if you want to just buy it at the top here and just write it all the way down that's up to you but overall this is just crap i'm sorry to say if there's a lot of people who are wanting to get into this there will come a time there will come a time where these things are good but right now this is just bordering on the line of degeneracy it's absolute garbage now look i'm being a bit harsh because it is that stuff that's what we trade in crypto it's what we trade in these penny stocks there it's just a degeneracy we're just trying to make it a quick buck we're trying to make a flip and see this thing run up 5x or 10x or something like that and then hopefully get out at the top generally we're hearing about it when we're at these tops and we write it all the way down so don't be a degenerate do your research stick around with this sector if you are absolutely interested in it and you want to read about it on a daily basis to know what's going on or on a weekly basis gather all that news together and just form a picture of where the market's at and then learn technical analysis to understand accumulation and distribution if that sounds like too much work then definitely don't worry about these stocks i'm going to run through the others a little bit quicker i just thought i would bring that up at the beginning and not go through it on every single one i probably will bring up degeneracy a few more times with this video so ac8 it's on the way down in my opinion you guys have a look as well aeb was another now i can't say if this is the exact chart because sometimes the asx uses an old ticker symbol and this might be a different company back in 2011. but from what i can see here this is a clear clear downtrend just all the way down there's nothing holding it up at the moment there's no sign of a reversal pattern it's just down so aeb i'm not interested at the moment let's move on agh i know that's a pretty popular one because i've had it on the channel before that's why i've got some ta on here already looks like this the trades already been and gone and this is just topping out at a pretty much double top so that pattern is bearish and we can see it happening already volume is increasing i'm just going to get rid of this trade that we used last time there we go and fibonacci we've used that thing is said and done it's broken through its support level volume increased as it broke through so we're at the end of day close now at monday the 21st of december so markets are closed a gh another one down next level to hopefully hold up would be that 31 cents otherwise it's in trouble heading all the way back down so keep keep an eye on that bot botanics pharmaceuticals another one not in the worst position but again i don't like the look of this look of it especially as it tries to bridge this gap through here if this is the same stock like i talked about the ticker symbols then i think it's probably got a hard challenge a hard mountain to climb up through here so it's not one that i'm interested in i went through and looked at all of these stocks using tradingview.com just to figure out the market caps so this is another one coming up they're all basically 150 mil or under some of them even much lower like this at 40 mil keep that in mind so that is sometimes why people want to get them look at that from march to the top here 6x not bad but it's a huge gamble at that point in time to go from 2 cents to 12 cents maybe you got out at 14 but that's very rare anyone's actually going to to get that right from the bottom to the top so keep an eye on these things if it's something that you want to look at later on just don't leave them now and then pick them up again later when they come back into the news because no doubt when they come into the news it's going to be on one of these peaks can that one always comes up can group limited it's just on the way down every time i look at this it's it's down down down so it had a basically accumulation after the breakout and then shot up again to make what are we at 40 percent 45 at the absolute top if you're lucky probably got 36 35 30 percent very high risk for not much return in this one so can if you want to know about it that's the chart that's my answer to can and then just bring this up again unless we break out of any of these areas this high all these lows which if it breaks out of the low then forget about it but unless it goes above these highs then i think it's just it's in no man's land so refer back to this video cph same deal dumping dumping dumping maybe it'll hold up maybe you'll get a bounce from here to here high risk for an 80 up to you guys maybe it'll go to here 50 but that's the low remember so you're coming in this high it's just not worth the risk in my opinion you could see this thing just turn around gap down you're off 50 pretty easily because there's no other support here until we get back down to around that level of 5 cents so this is a solid 70 50 to 70 down it's just not worth the risk this is degeneracy at its finest unless you got in much earlier on back back through here so october-ish area and then you're held on but why would you even know about this stock back here that's just it's a hard one you don't don't be hard on yourself like to get in through through here who knows you had to have been following cannabis stocks from the beginning cresso farmer cph all right that's degenerate looking to me on the way down g sorry j h l there is just no data here it's just so sketchy so don't even look at this one in my opinion not financial advice do your own research here if you feel like it's an accumulation zone by all means that's that's up to you guys but if you really needed some sort of tea on here look at these peaks you need to get above these peaks and hold above them you need to get above this seven cents need to get above this 11 cents but do it on a gradual basis not on a spike needs to slowly climb and grind and grind its way up and get above these levels and then comfortably start to move up so that's looking a little better than shooting off to the moon and then back again see it comes all the way back in at two cents if you don't get out at 10 you're all the way back at two what's the point so keep an eye on that jhl it looks way too sketchy moving on little green farmer there's another one that was requested this just got dumped today 11 down i think it's just going to keep going look at that volume increase that was barely holding on to its high levels look at that volume just drop off no more interest in it dumps past the 61. it's definitely coming to the 50. let's see if it gets to the 38 and if it comes all the way back probably a nice 23 area here so essentially that's a 76 retracement from the top which is known to happen on penny stocks very easily it comes back into this zone and starts to accumulate again so keep an eye on that could be wrong this could be another setup it could start to form a base up here so that would be the reason why it would be a useful stock to look at again if it started to accumulate again in sort of this area here because it's sitting above these old highs that would discount this move all the way back into this area to re-accumulate so that would be a stronger fall and set up and hold at that position to re-accumulate than if it fell through here all the way back to this area and no doubt there will be chances to pick up this stock in that area there so lgp off the cards until i see some sort of support come through hopefully around that 40 cents zld zld zelera again looks like it's on its way down look at that huge spike high volume sellers just like buyers coming in then sellers just absolutely crapping all over them and like we know that close was lower there's the close right there there's the open the open is controlled by the amateurs the professionals control the clothes so they just crapped all over these buyers early on so these buyers came in crapped on them sold everything and now we're just down down down down down every day there's just down you had an inside a tiny up and then it just shot down so i can see this coming back again to that seven ish sense i don't think much is going to happen here i think that's i think that's going to get crushed yep all right that's at zld let's pick it up again if it happens to find support around this area here alright so that's where we can be wrong like that's where we want it to hold support in order for it to be a stock to consider as a re-accumulation zone before it moves up again all right so i'm always looking at both sides i hope you guys are doing that too you want to have a look at it because we're only playing on probabilities here mxc again you can see that these patterns it's all the same up and down i'm never going to say any more with this right now there's no sign of this stock starting to find a base so mxc we'll come back to it at some other point if anyone requests it otherwise it's going to sit there and no man's lane rno i know i've seen that come up a few times this one that's just it's just weird shut up nothing's happening i think it's going to bounce around very eliquid stock so keep that in mind and overall just a mega mega downtrend if this is still the same stock in the same symbol rno it's just mega down from 2014 and for it to have any sort of hope i think it needs to break above this long term downtrend needs to spike above and then hold above it even if it starts to drift it needs to hold above that line and form a base head up again all right we're coming to the end thc i couldn't leave cannabis dogs without doing a stock called thc all right so this one again long term downtrend you can see that it's almost identical to the last one except bigger spikes it's starting to slow down on the drops and you can see these lows now are getting a bit higher so i'm just going to use the top here if i can grip it there you go that's a pretty good downtrend through there which is starting to slow the lows are forming higher which is a good sign so what i would expect from here is maybe something that bases out hopefully breaks above and doesn't break the lows remember that and then starts to do its thing all right so that could be years from now we've already seen this go on a massive downtrend for a couple of years few years now so as long as we don't break that low there so we'll throw in a horizontal then it has a hope but i would not be trying to buy and hold this thing on the hope that it's going to bounce up anytime soon maybe it does all right so that's your call not me your call i just don't like the look of it because it's such a small market in such a small market overall in the aussie market compared to if you're going to buy in the us or uk or any other markets which are a hell of a lot bigger and it's just it's too risky in my opinion of course so yeah i don't see any base forming here just yet like something solid so thc i'm going to forget about that that's my wrap up of stocks on the cannabis sector 1 2 3 four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 12 cannabis stocks i'm obviously not that entertained by any of these you may be but looking at the charts they're all in this massive downtrend i think they're all going to move together they'll have pumps up on news and if you're not in early with them personally forget about them they're just pump and dumps for now because there's nothing concrete about them do your fundamental research on the individual companies if you really want to get into the space otherwise i'm staying clear of it and if anyone asks for cannabis stocks again i'm going to refer them back to this video until the overall patterns of all of these markets change you can see they're all very very similar so you don't want to be buying up 10 of them because that's bad money management they're all going to move the same you're better off just having one or two or three not even that i'm staying away from it i'm going to leave it there

"XvwASmdTEOI": "the science of cannabis has really evolved over the last 40 years and we understand a lot about the biology cannabidiol is the non psychoactive ingredient in marijuana and since it is non psychoactive one feels the potential harm is going to be much less and since some of these children had truly devastating epilepsies in which the seizures and the high doses of many drugs that doctors like myself were prescribing because really tremendous problems for these children [Music] the first thing I tell people is you are a unique individual your chemistry is in there is unique to you you could have the same exact diagnosis of the last guy that walked in here but you may respond differently to a different strain of cannabis a different dose of cannabis a different method of using it I don't know the answer and I don't think anybody else knows the answers there's this this crazy dissociation between what's happening at a federal level of incredible restriction on safe things and a state level where it's a little bit of the Wild West and states are allowing parents to play doctor and play chemist when they really don't have that experience every two and a half hours okay there is no one that will tell me that a parent this there's as much time with our child if we do did not know what's best for them Mellie was born March 6 2012 week later we started noticing some spasms about four months old we realized that something was wrong to the hospital indeterminate they were seizures she was having roughly I don't know somewhere probably in the vicinity of 700 today they diagnosed her with infantile spasms with hips arrhythmia I'm almost immediately and put her on three different medications as well as started the ketogenic diet she did not progress at all she was not growing she was not gaining weight the doctors had given us a point one percent chance that she would really do anything they kind of feel like that would they had done everything they could do there wasn't a diagnosis therefore there was no prognosis we just felt like our hands what kind of time you don't want to believe what they're telling you and so you try and find alternative solutions and thankfully we found one we ended up you know leaving you know a quarter of our possessions behind selling our business and we made the journey to Colorado our neurologist told us that she can't prescribe it she knows nothing about it it hasn't been studied but that she recommend we do what we need to in order to help Billy you don't that stuff cleaned out yeah we started Charlotte's Web right around her birthday and within the first 15 minutes of her first dose she was wide awake and looking around and I mean I was just crying I couldn't believe it yeah probably within the first 90 days we noticed about a 75 to 90% reduction in seizures I mean we've had extended periods of time that we've had no seizure activity and when I say extended periods of time nine days 14 days we've had times where we backed off and not give her doses of CBD for upwards of a week maybe a little more and then we have times where we will have to increase their CBD it's not as complicated now that once was when I first got here was a little scary it was a little difficult trying to figure it all out it really has been a lot of trial and error it was all parental experience asking other parents you know hey when you see this seizure what do you do it gets frustrating and then you find the sweet spot and you think yes we did it anything really consider off and sort of make it throw off the whole balance it's kind of a two step forward one step back we have some seizure activity that are a bit more violent that are more painful I think the most difficult part is there's nothing you can do about it and basically just have to wait it out there are days that I don't know that I feel like it's hard for me you know and then there are days that I feel very elated and very joyful that we have her we've gone from a place where we didn't think we would have our daughter with us very long and trying to make every minute count so now we feel like we have prolonged her life that there is an opportunity for her to grow and maybe Walt Falk do some of these things that you never thought were imaginable you know I don't know what the future holds for us you know it is a very real possibility that mili could have a seizure and never come out of it for Millie's future I see a lot of beating the odds I see a lot of improvement I think that she's I think she's really gonna make the history books Colorado has given us an opportunity to be parents make decisions that we feel are best for our children I don't know exactly why people are so afraid of this but I think it is Tom now that we need to put that behind us and move on [Music] you", "OT9rsf0GDDU": "In your opinion as a doctor, who works in this field. What is the best method of delivery for the majority of your patients? So just like with regular medications, we have different forms and modalities of administration. So we have Albuterol, which is an inhaler, which is quick-acting. We have steroids which are pills, which are long-acting. We also have steroid inhalers, which are short acting. So it's the same idea with cannabis. So in terms of inhaled, if you're gonna use a flower to inhale and preferably vape the flower. Which is non oil-based, that's for a quick method of delivery. So if you have acute pain, for cancer and chemo patients, you wanna address nausea and vomiting quickly. And that will address quickly. In terms of oils and sublingual tinctures, that takes about 45 minutes to an hour, to start being effective and lasts about four hours. In edibles, it can take up to two hours to take effect. So oftentimes people feel like it didn't work and so they take more and that's where we get into accidental overdoses that are non-lethal. People took a bite of a brownie or bite of chocolate. \"Didn't work so I'm gonna take more.\" That's the most common issue that we see. And that lasts anywhere from six hours to up to 48 hours, depending on how big a dose you took. So it's really what do you wanna get across? Or what do you wanna treat? I think that's really important information because when you do walk into a legal dispensary. As of now even in the legal states, I believe the bud tenders, in those dispensaries, aren't required to have a medical background or any sort of pharmaceutical background. So it's really kind of roulette in that respect to, as to what kind of advice you're going to get. That's absolutely right. So we need to start pushing both California and every state as they legalize, we need to start encouraging and demanding, that they require bud tender required education. Because those are our current interface right now with patients and consumers. And they are not required to have a high school education, they're not required to have a college education, they're not required to have any education right now. So, yes, I would encourage every single person here, to write to their Bureau of Cannabis Control, and tell them that, you know, \"We do need these types of bud tender level education.\" \"We do need this education in pharmacy schools.\" \"We do need this education in medical schools.\" And to close this out because we are out of time. I think there's a tendency in the country, the minute we legalize something, we assume that all methods of delivery are safe. Look, alcohol is legal in this country, but alcohol could be incredibly unsafe. Cannabis, we now know has so many potential benefits when used in the right population as a medicine. But it also can be either abused or as we've seen with this THC vaping crisis. It can, if taken inappropriately from the wrong source, it can kill you. And I think these are all topics to consider. I really appreciate the work that all three of you are doing to educate. Because it's all about education. So if you're gonna use, know why you're using it, know the best method of delivery and ask questions to the right people. And if you're not certain, this is where I actually applaud you Doctor Yafai, There are doctors out there now, who specialize in how to use cannabis appropriately and safely. Inquire, go talk to someone like a Doctor Yafai, who can give you unbiased advice so that you can do it safely and appropriately for your condition.", "_KP0fQubElk": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome back to rose of green and i'm just going to give you a little uh rundown of what we'll be doing today so today we will be uh training these some more uh these are our main line plants and uh we will be doing uh the third topping on these girls and that will be the final topping it will give us eight tops uh and then i'm gonna show you guys the growing for yield tent uh the sand light tent how that's doing and then uh at the end of the video i'll show you guys uh the hash that i'm drawing right now and uh so on but uh first off i just wanted to touch on uh the weights of my outdoor uh it wasn't quite as much as i thought it was going to be guys but uh it was still an all right turnout so uh i ended up with 5.1 pounds of dry bud um with that said one plant didn't finish so i made that all the hash and that was 6.1 pounds it was wet though so after it's dried you usually subtract about 60 70 percent so that would be a ballpark around 1.8 pounds uh so it could be more than that or it could have been less than that guys but like a total total net dry weight would have been 6.93 pounds but that one plant didn't finish so it all went to hash i guess we averaged about 1.73 pounds per plant of course there were more on a couple of them and uh that one that didn't finish uh that was probably our smallest yielder and really brought us down but anyway i'm making some excellent hash that that said uh let's get on with this this here is uh remember i needed to put a band-aid on her i snapped it well we'll take that band-aid off now and we'll see what it looks like it should be all healed up now and there it is a nice knuckle that was snapped right in half and let's see if i can get in there and show you guys you can see she healed up well and now it's just a knuckle and now we can get on with uh the rest of this so what we're gonna do is uh we'll grab this lady here and we'll start mainlining her and then we'll get on with it and uh just to let you guys know too if you're following this mainline series uh this isn't an all-in-one video where i where i go step by step and just capture it by the weeks and put it all in one video it's a series so you need to follow this series guys uh if you want to go back i will have them named mainline series so you can go back to videos when we started this and just continue on from there so uh just so you guys know it's an actual series and not all done in one video so anyway you go check out those other two videos but uh let's get started here okay so here we are so here we are with our plant uh i should have been training these a lot earlier i allowed them to get a little big so now i'm gonna have to pinch them and soften them up in order to get them to bend down without breaking them because i already broke one but those knuckles will break very easily guys so you've got to be careful but since this side here is growing more quickly than this side i'm gonna remove the leaves on this one and then i'm gonna leave them on here so these ones could catch up so uh trick to that is so i'll just want to remove all these bottom ones and these ones here i'm gonna leave for now but uh we're gonna leave these ones alone and then we're just going to train these out maybe we'll start with this side actually you know what we'll uh yeah we'll start with this side so a good trick here is you use pliers like this put black tape on them and then you can soften it up real easily just by pinching it instead of using your fingers and it won't destroy it or anything it's just a good way of doing it then you get a feel for it with your fingers so there we go when you bend these out you kind of want them to go out like sideways not straight ahead because our next topping is we're gonna put our arm here and an arm there so now that we got that there i'm actually going to remove everything below this so i'm going to remove these nodes here and the leaves just like i did in the previous videos you go watch them now this one probably could have trained it a little better but it is what it is so this one here i'm gonna tie down that we'll tie her up with a twist tie so now she's stuck like that and now i'm going to remove these ones here everything below and i've noticed uh people don't like me doing this they think i'm mutilating the crap out of my plants but if you want to wait you'll see the yield if you want to look back on some of my other videos you'll see uh how good they yield i noticed i was getting some thumbs down people sure don't like the thumbs down see i could have uh trained this a lot i should have trained this a lot earlier when they first started coming out anyway that will thicken up and it will be fine so now i'll tie it down and remember you want to like pull it off to the sides there you go these will thicken up and fix themselves uh really they should have went straight out i waited too long to train these girls but it is what it is so what i will do here though is i will remove these bottom ones but i'm going to leave the rest of them so they get better growth and you really got to be careful those knuckles already busted or knuckle so you just want to pinch it twist in your fingers a bit until it wants to fold over almost like a super crop but you don't want to super crop it you want to catch it before it before it gets too firm how it is now so now we got that side bent just trying to manipulate this side without breaking it okay so we will remove these shoots but we're gonna leave the leaves now these leaves they'll help beef up these stems like the other ones so they're a little more thick so now what we will do is we will tie them and again you want it out facing out like off to the side we shouldn't do this with these scissors if i had to there we go there's one side done and uh for those who think i'm mutilating my plants uh these things they really bounce back guys uh the veg really isn't too much longer i'm still gonna send these at six weeks i think we're at four weeks now so there you go there we go so these are all going to grow out then we're going to get two more tops and we're going to top those and we'll probably string one up the middle and then the others out the side and uh we'll be good to go so i'll do it the rest of them and then i'll show you okay so here you can see they're all done now they're all looking okay uh this one's a little wonky looking but uh we'll get her uh this one's all right and this one is uh my favorite one i really should have did the training a little bit sooner instead of waiting a full week and then just recorded it then when i did it but i want to show you guys i broke one off see that i don't know why it's not zooming in but anyway i broke one off so uh what we're going to do here is uh i'm going to show you guys what you do if the break went off so we still got our two on this side and we only got the one on this side so what i did is i just topped it i topped the other side so now we have two shoots and now we'll work with that uh we'll see if we'll uh top it again later uh so we still end up with the eight shoots but uh we might just uh use this one with uh the two and then do something else with this side uh but it all depends but uh yeah that's what happens when you kind of rush uh my hand hit it i busted it off and uh yeah so anyway to save it all you got to do is top the one other side and then you'll be good but anyway i'll probably get some thumbs down for that break not too worried about it i just wanted to say thank you to everybody i really appreciate all of the support all the new subscribers the old subscribers and everybody but uh anyway let's move on now and i will show you guys uh the sand light tent and how we are doing in there actually before we finish before any crazy uh before i get onto the other one there uh when you do any crazy training you might want to use some peppermint oil i just put a couple drops on a q-tip and then i rub it around the edges of the pot and uh that helps cover up the smell of the chlorophyll and uh it keeps the bugs away it's just uh it's just to prevent the bugs from wanting to enter and come in because after doing cutting and training like that it's a really really crazy smell in here a strong smell that bugs go after and i also forgot to mention that these are in-house genetics and they're black cherry punch and we're underneath uh the mars hydro sp 3000's daisy chained together so they're both dimmed and it's at about uh 450 ppfd so now we'll head on over to the other tent and i'll show you what's going on in there okay so here we are in the sand light tent as you can see everything's starting to turn colors real nice everything is looking beautiful uh you can see all those strings i have those are all plant yoyos i have them hooked up there and they're just to hold up uh some of these snugs from falling over some of them are real nice and frosty down you get a good shot of everything underneath see some of the lights getting through we like to keep her nice and clean in here and this is all organically grown under super soil here let me just fix my phone and i'll zoom in okay so see if i can get in and around some of these strings show you guys some of the frost we've got going on here really nice and frosty even coming out on the fan leaves there and this is mvp most valuable perp by dungeon vault genetics and uh it's really nice strain uh this is turning purple on its own with the fade i haven't even cooled it off yet in here and these ones are fading off as well we'll see if we can get you guys some other closer frost picks see how frosty some of those girls are now this is a more frosty strain than a big yielding strain but you can just see how much frost is there all these lowers will make awesome hash some of them frostier than others but yeah they're all nice uh gulf sized gulf sized nuts we're gonna get a good yield out of this but what do you guys think i should grow next i have uh more in-house genetics i have uh twisted i have uh twisted helix or i have garlic storm but i was really thinking on doing relentless genetics and uh growing that one i can't think of the name right now but it's uh oh yeah rozzy rotten rosie by uh by uh relentless i'm thinking of crossing rotten rossi with purple punch and having my own strain so let me know in the comments what you think i should go next in-house genetics or if i should go with uh with the relentless genetics i also have california dream by i love growing marijuana but anyway tomorrow will be week seven for these girls so we still have two weeks to go uh someone was mentioning that they thought they seen nanners there's no nanners on any of these i went over them i went over them real good because uh if i thought you seen them in a video it kind of scared me but i replied to you no there are no nanners so i'm happy about that i just look at some of this frost on the lowers even like unbelievable unbelievable frost look at that okay guys so anyways this is most valuable perps let me know what you guys think i should do next uh we're in here underneath the sand lights and the satellite tent i'm only running two of them for this grow and they're only on the second setting for those who ask uh they're not even maxed out i'll probably max them out tomorrow for the last two weeks but uh let me know guys what i should grow next i'm interested to know please like this to help me with the algorithm so youtube knows that my uh videos are good to go and share it wherever you want and we'll see you guys in the next one remember to subscribe peace out", "cSy13C4kgZo": "hello and welcome to the northern lights automatic goia grill to germinate the seeds i let them soak in regular tap water for 18 hours i germinated three seeds total i kept one of them to let it grow out at my window and the other two are going outdoors before i bring them to the outdoor spot i let them grow on my windowsill for a few weeks when the temperatures are still a bit too cold outside so first i planted them in small pots that fit good to my window size and filled them with some soil i had left on the balcony i planted them directly inside of the pots after they were soaked with water this was a mistake from my side as i wasn't able to keep the soil humid enough for the seeds to pop out the root so after some days i took the seeds out of the pot and placed them into some wet paper towels to really germinate and this worked in the end and now for everyone wondering if you watch the gorilla growing series you already know this grill but this video is more intended for new viewers that most likely look upgrowing videos about specific strains they want to grow and if you liked this video you could consider watching the series because i showed there every little detail on my whole growth and spot maintaining and similar stuff and i think it is also very funny alright i was not planning to keep the plants on the windowsill for this long time but mother nature basically left me no other choice i think it's the better option to keep them longer in smaller pots with less root space instead of a whole week of rain and cold temperatures this is the final picture before moving them outdoors and as you can see for a pre-grow they are already quite big my spot basically looks like it is in the forest but it's just a small area that got conquered back by nature in the past decades so the soil there is just up to one centimeter thick and under this little layer there are only stones and sand so i have to carry my own soil to the spot and use pots for growing i would rather plant my plants into the ground but the option here is sadly not given otherwise the spot is just perfect so i gotta deal with it and the soil i brought there is a mix of planting soil from a garden store some little claystone bricks that absorb water and make the soil fluffy and under them some i guess low quality soil from the bushes somewhere else so definitely no premium stuff right there one week after i transplanted them into the pots it looked like this i moved all the pods to the side with most sunlight because they are not big enough to take light from each other the white plastic things are called slug collars and prevent slugs from crawling to the plants they don't work to 100 percent but i think they really help nothing too much more to tell about the little plants right there as they are just little plants in the next week it rained for the whole week no harsh stuff but just a whole week of this the plant growth was of course kinda small in this time i feel kinda lucky that both of them weren't hijacked by slugs there is not too much to tell about them right now but they look kinda nice in close-ups to have a little comparison the northern lights are these both now they grew much taller for watering and feeding i took a canister of water with some fluid nutrients with me and gave every plant 0.7 to 0.8 liters of the water per week throughout the whole grow some 100 percent biological hippie stuff i don't really know what's inside but should be fine during this grow i wasn't really caring about nutrients that much also good to mention every time there is a black fading effect between the clips of the plants a week has passed this week you can see really good how the side branches are starting to develop and on top of this plant is a ladybug larvae they are always welcome because they eat aphids which are not welcome the second plant has now its first pre-flowers that's also good to see [Music] now they finally make some bigger jumps on plant growth not really any flowers on the first run but the right one already has some nice looking white strings coming out of the tops [Music] [Music] now the left one has also a smooth looking flower top i say this in like all grow videos but they look really smooth and on the right one you can see the flower development really good [Music] on this close-up you can see the early trichomes also really good i like this type of picture very much and on these two pictures you can compare the phenotypes kinda good the left one has a really round appearance and is a bit brighter while the white plant has a shape of an axe and is a bit more dark interesting interesting next week i think the plants reached their final size now they will only pack up flower mass and another great view is the purple on the leaves well for now only on the little branches from the leaves but hey purple is purple the other plant has now some really white flowers with many trichomes that looks really cool and another difference between the two plants is that the left one's leaves are more hanging and chilling in the wind while the wands from the right are growing spiky towards the air and now the plants were a bit thirsty not too thirsty but a bit but besides of that of course really good you know but just nothing special to say right [Music] there [Music] here are now the two tops compared to each other here is the one from the left side sadly the zoom is not good enough to really check the trichome stair but the shots still look a bit satisfying and you can see they're really good that the leaf tips are turning slightly purple as well the white one is more interesting first it grew really normal but then on the main color it started to grow three different fox tales weird [ __ ] a week later not that big of a change but something bad on the right northern lights [Music] after checking it a bit more detailed i found some buds affected by butt rod not too dramatic for now but i of course removed it and i am now a bit more aware and will always check the plan more precise but time for some flower shots so one more week later it got quite serious with the butt rod it was on many spots on the plant and i wanted to harvest the first plants with the most malt at this day and the white northern lights is of course one of them the left purple one had some bad spots as well but i really wanted to wait some more time to see if the purple could reach the flowers in time so i am removing the mold i can see but let it stay so it's time to say goodbye to the first plant [Music] [Music] and welcome home i won't include drawing and storing stuff in this video because they were handled at different times but summarized i am drawing them up to the point where the smaller branches make a snapping sound without breaking clean off and i am doing dry trimming but now let's follow the other one up to harvest first beginning with some pictures from the top the purple looks really good sadly it's the opposite from the regular purple cannabis instead of purple flowers and greenish leaves this one has purple leaves and green flowers yay some of the flower shots are kinda spicy as well and you can see the trichomes really good especially on this picture at the one single flower in the sunlight looking really great but of course the mold won't get less over time i really found it on many many spots but besides of that i think it is looking quite good for a little outer flower plant [Music] and this is basically the last real footage of the plant the next week was again seven days of rain and not that beneficial to fight against mold but first check it out [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and now as you can see the whole plant is flooded not looking that good so it's also for this one time to come home this is the amount of usable stuff sitting on a chair to have a overview the stuff from this plant is hanging on the back line and the final yield of the plants is around 20 grams from the first one harvested and also around 20 grams from the second one harvested i think this vessel is very fine compared to the other plants and now you can have a final close-up view on the dried and cured buds while you hear a dude smelling on cannabis enjoy alright time to smell on some stuff first the first one harvested i already picked some buds out of there because i have often my green and this works really fine for this you know medicine oh this one smells really strong it's a hard version of the classical really spicy cannibal smell let's crumble a bit around after crumbling there comes a citrus note as well but still the harsh stuff now i will take a little bud out of there and crush it to get the wheel smell out of it and now i can really remember why i choose this one for some real medicine it smells just really really nice when you break it a search was not a regular cannabis note and i really love the regular kind of smell it smells really nice i just i love the smell i think this is the best smell from all of the plants maybe it is not the strongest smell according to a specific note you know like heavy citrus heavy fruit in this heavy pineyness whatever but just the best overall the best i would really stick to that and when i say stick there are still kind of sticky in there that's good all right cool really nice so let's get to the second one but first let me drink something alright now the second one oh [ __ ] the first smell is like absolutely the same now i will crumble it around and then i guess it will be something different it's also a bit like citrus but it's way more harsh you know the classical cannibal smell is way more harsh in this case alright now crush one let's pick an ugly one of course you [Music] okay it smells absolutely different after breaking that's sometimes really fascinating you break it once and boom the wheel smell comes out of there first it's it's really sticky holy [ __ ] about the smell oh man i don't know how to describe it you know i will i will break another one if they are in the glass i can just roll them up anyways oh man i cannot describe this this is so weird it's not like i don't find the words i really cannot describe the smell i would say it's also a bit a bit citrus but the other smell is not like well there is some of the regular smell but it smells absolutely different this is kind of hard to tell i you know i a bit citrus and a bit mystery i literally cannot describe it never mind that's what i smelled and i cannot tell anything else than that alright i really hope you enjoyed the stuff if yeah you know how you can help any dude doing youtube videos you know yeah so i hope you have a nice day have a nice weekend have a nice oh have a nice christmas maybe maybe santa brings some wheat who knows anyways cheers", "hwyhxIThFmg": "hey guys Nick with precision here and today we're gonna be talking about terpenes so we want to understand these compounds what they are how they occur in nature how we're extracting and isolating them so the first thing that I'd like to bring up is terpenes are actually a variety of organic compounds and these organic compounds are naturally occurring in all sorts of areas of nature the main things that you will find terpenes are in is cannabis conifer plants like pine trees spruce things like that are one of the most abundant sources as well as a variety of insects and even some mammals now it's it's interesting these compounds because they serve a variety of different purposes so in plants they're mainly signaling it's signaling for a predator to stay away or for a sweet you know delicious smell to be eaten by a certain mammal and there's kind of this underlying communication standard with these terpenes amongst everything in nature and in the universe and if you start looking at these compounds and where they're placed and what they do it's it's quite amazing the the matrix of what's there with that all being said you have other terpenes that are produced by insects that are produced by by mammals and these are actually produced in some cases biosynthetic aliso in many cases humans produce terpenes biosynthetic Lee meaning within our own body they come endogenously produced and our signaling receptors not only are they signaling mechanisms but they're also biosynthetic building blocks so a good example of this would be squalene and the steroids that are derived from that and things like that you can look into that but it's very very interesting so understanding these molecules and what they do is very very important to understanding why they're valuable to an extraction process and why they're valuable to the cannabis plant and with understanding all of this it's really important to know that they are anti microbials they're anti virals to help keep your body into a homeostasis into that balanced state that we've spoken about before so in many many cases there actually have a lot of similar properties that they exhibit on humans the same way cannabinoids do and the key to all this is that you get this entourage type effect and it's almost like nature's produced and packaged to this perfect little plant and this perfect little combination of terpenes and cannabinoids in order to aid a variety of medical conditions and bring your body back into balance now what we do at precision is we're highly focused around the extraction and isolation of these terpenes the extraction of isolation of these terpenes is a very special process because the molecules in and of themselves whether they're monoterpenes or sesqui terpenes or triterpene there's a bunch of different types of these terpenes but in general they're all very delicate when I say they're very delicate they're very prone to degradation they're very prone to really being diminished or their molecular structure being changed with any sort of heat any sort of excessive stress will say to that molecule without getting into overly technical terms so what we're trying to do from an extraction process is extract these very very gently extract them in a very low temperature and and do that in a manner that is going to actually render that molecule unadulterated in that extract well we commonly end up with as a process for extracting cannabis and extracting these terpenes that uses a very light hydrocarbon mainly butane or propane but most cases moving more towards a propane dominant blend not only we do do we do do that but we also actually take the plant and harvest the plant when it has peak terpene content and the peak terpene content ultimately is extracted with these very light hydrocarbons and we get this soupy sort of saucy type mixture and the key to this is being able to remove that solvent because that solvent is a very light hydrocarbon for example propane can boil off at negative 41 degrees and what we'll actually do is we'll just apply a very light heat so it'll be enough heat to remove the solvent but not enough heat to disturb or degrade any of those terpenes ultimately we can centrifuge those terpenes and separate them from the cannabinoids because the the two layers obviously separate able by the centrifugal force and we have a purified terpene compound and there can obviously be further from chromatography purification steps and things like that but isolating and extracting these cannabis-based terpenes are a key value stream and it's interesting to know that you can isolate these terpenes from many different types of plants now one of the things I said when we when we started out was conifer trees were one of the most abundant sources of terpenoids or terpenes in the in the world right now that that we know of and basically you get very high levels of Alpha and Beta Pi Neen that's why a pine tree alpha and beta piney and you can obviously put that one together but they also have things in there like limonene and lena law and these other different terpenes that kind of make this perfect package and turpentine ironically is mainly alpha and beta pining and it's used as an in cleaning a cleaning agent antiviral antibacterial and insecticide and for a variety of other uses works really well as a solvent in addition so the question is why can't we just isolate these terpenes from these high concentrated areas like say conifer trees and combine them back into cannabis well the answer is is that many state laws actually restrict the use of outside terpenes or non cannabis derived terpenes to be entered back into a cannabis based product so for example in states where we have like a metric system that has a traceability throughout the entire we'll call it seed to sale of the of the cannabis value stream they want those terpenes to be extracted isolated from the original cannabis crop and them to be re-used and re-entered into ultimately that suite of products that's going to be sold so understanding terpenes what they are what they do this level of science how to extract them isolate them refine them very very important to an extraction business it's very very relevant particularly in the cannabis space because most states don't allow for the use of outside terpenes to be reconstituted into a cannabis based product for traceability purposes so with that all being said I really hope you enjoyed our short talk today on terpenes hope you have a better understanding of what they are how they're relevant how they can aid in human health and conditions and how they are specifically relevant to the cannabis industry and how we use them within canvas thanks so much for watching we'll see you on the next video", "0JjHvCxQCQ4": "what's going on everybody endo grows here help everybody's having a wonderful wonderful day today's video was submitted a video idea for reviewer like you so thank you so much to everybody and thank you you know who you are so it's gonna be all some tips and tricks on how to grow like a pro some things I do and some things I use if you're new to the channel this is what we do we grow we do rosin press reviews we do rather than squishing you can see all this on my page go check it out I have all these grows everything you see here go check it out give me a subscribe you know hit the little subscription button down below thank you so much if you want to support the channel watch the video all the way through give me a like and thumbs up I can't fit all the tips and tricks in the one video so that's how I'm gonna engage on whether or not I want to keep doing this one or not so if you really want to see some more of this give me some likes give me some comments down below thank you I'll get right into we're gonna go start out in veg and work our way through flour so a first tip I'm going to use is get some make host microbes definitely check them out I have a few videos highlighting them really really beneficial stuff for your root system and bigger roots bigger fruits right that's what I always like to say a lot of people you know so definitely do that badge and flour super crazy important have really good airflow and I mean just in general about temps you want to mimic outside like their plants that came from outside so mimic outside you want to have my go-to temps for my veg tank it is like 70 to 85 degrees 70 is my low 85 is my high you don't have to worry about it as much and badge because they like to be warm don't overwater how I gauge how I need the water is I'll pretty much like put my plants my soil water and I'll let him dry out to the point that they start to droop and that's when I start to get my idea of how light my buckets are and I hold my buckets up and if I remember that day you know and like oh my [ __ ] it's pretty light like that day then that's when I water so that's how I decide on how I'm gonna water training there's all sorts of different ways to do it low stress trainings my go-to method but you can do a bunch of different ways by five by five as you can see I don't need to know trellis Nets I still have a great canopy everything's pretty even everything's only been talked to one time and they're so uh just do training and I train my plants in a funny way I like had him every single day I go in there and I just pet him trying to be rough with them been immune to the ways that I want them direction I want them to start growing and it's really beneficial for a lot of reasons you can get more tops that way as you can see I have crazy tops all over my tent but I've only topped those plants one time and it's just because of training you can also decide how a higher canopy is with that and the reason I don't really use nets and stuff because I can get really nice canopy without it and I can still move my fence around when I go to defoliate and everything I don't have that big a problem so you know definitely important to train the plants the way you want them it helps you also see things that might be going on I started really small plant pots and I worked my way up and every time I change my pots like when I go to transplant I give a good flush every single time get all that old nutrients out start with a nice new base I run sixty forty sixty percent Coco forty percent like Fox Farm soil and that's just for you know my personal preference and then so every time you also transplant throw something that make us him they're super good stuff can't stress it enough do your research on it I keep my lights in bed anywhere between 12 and 14 inches away side run cobs and LEDs so if you're running HPS you know you want to be definitely a lot further away so that's my go-to for my light setup you want to see like what stuff I have in my real room go check out my channel and I highlight everything I'm running in my 5 by 5 on one of those videos so we'll go into flour times now super-important again good airflow definitely you need good airflow I can't stress it enough through your whole canopy top and bottom and then I also start dropping my temps back when I'm in flower I like to drop them back you know just like outside so like just not quite as cool as outside but I usually like to go back my preferred range is 65 to 75 that's another huge thing is a tip make sure that try as closer you as hard as you can to keep your temperature within 10 degrees like so you don't want your temperature to much more than 10 degrees off from your high and your low so I usually like to do 65 to 75 ID foliate week 1 week 3 so right when I throw them in there I'll give them week D fully at once and that's just take all your big families and all that stuff off it's good for different like reasons like light penetration and get more light down to those smaller bud sides it also helps with the air flow back again so I'll do that week 1 week 3 there pretty much most strains are done stretching by that time almost done stretching by the time so I'll go through and the more you do fully there's a big reason why you do it it's innocent instead of the plant using all the energy for that to keep those leaves alive and keep growing new leaves those ones it takes all that energy that you take all those leaves off and it just puts all of the butts all that extra energy that would have been used to grow those leaves is now all gonna go to blood production which is what we're all looking for anyways right so that's my tips on that I didn't defoliate this time as good as I really wanted to as you can see but it's still getting the job done my lights in this setup I like to you run 14 to 16 inches away from the top of my canopy in those terms nutrients you don't want to over water your or over water or over feed the plants either because if you're starting to get like you know follow your feed schedule if you want to know what I use go ahead and reach out let me know I will tell you everybody runs different stuff so so follow your feed schedule but if you're noticing when you burn tips and stuff late kind of take it back and not flush your plants like so that's a good tip there and you don't know everything is different so do that flush your plants lay back on your nutrients a little bit if you're noticing burn tips and stuff because you don't want to get it build up in there and stop production pretty much no go I don't like my relative humidity going and you we're past 55 when I'm in flower just you start buying more risks of bud rot and all that stuff so really nice another important thing is that is your air flow I run my fan at nighttime to a little heater and humidifier in my room so do that and then flushing super important at the end especially if you're in soil and another tip about like in terms of like seeing burn tips and stuff like that is when you're in the soil and stuff like that here's a really good pro tip that a lot of people don't know starting out is when you're in soil like what you're noticing now happened days ago like a week ago it's not like hydro where it's like super noticeable right away and you can fix it right away so it's also gonna take that week to fix it and see corrections so don't go crazy and cause another problem trying to fix one problem but that's a good tip there flushing I usually start like three weeks before I know I'm gonna take them down I'm checking my trichomes and it's gonna help you through flavors and everything like that and your spoke quality I wanted to get my video done to show my cure tips and stuff but that'll come next weekend so if you're looking for that that's when that's going to be coming out I had to do this whole video on my phone because my Wi-Fi is out at home right now so I can't upload that video so that's why I'm doing this one today instead but yeah I hope this really helps somebody and when I'm flushing you know I'm starting three weeks before I'm flushing down to like 200 ppm is 100 ppm is because also if you ever test or notice like after you flush you'll be getting that reading but if you wait a couple days and try test your run off again you'll notice that your ppm rose again because your soils coming coming back to life so I like take a real low three weeks before 100 ppm is as close as I possibly can to my tap water and then I just give nothing but water after that Mike and I went doing that flush I use pH water after that I don't use anything so I hope that really really helps everybody have a wonderful wonderful day any more questions you know go ahead and reach out to me if you knew please subscribe I hope you enjoyed the video go check out my page I have all sorts of things you can find me on Instagram as well I'm pretty active there so I hope you all have a wonderful day I

video to make it so before I also get started guys I want to say this already I am NOT a chef I am NOT a perfect cook I'm just a mom like I said you can always do whatever you want there's no judgement but I'm gonna use a simple recipe because I'm a mom that's always on a go so I just want something quick and easy right now I'm on the west coast so it's gonna be Memorial weekend in a couple days so I just wanted something like I can chill out pop in my mouth gummi bears are always appropriate I have my regular jello you can use any flavor you want this one guys happen to be a six ounce we only gonna use 3 ounces I only had a thick box so normally when you buy this jello get the three ounces until you figure out how many companies you want to make we're also gonna be using a gelatin this is a 1 ounce box it comes in four packets we're gonna be using all of those four packets if you are vegan you cannot use this gelatin there is another substitute for individuals who are vegan so please don't use this if you're vegan shout out to all my vegan Watchers also we're gonna be using that cannabis infused coconut oil that we made in the last video this is a 4 ounce on jar by fall they make all of those mason jars and as you can see I left it out just so it can be liquefied because we're gonna mix that with our water look at that gold green that's nothing but gold green honey anyway so this is a 4 ounce star I have a bunch of them they were referred generated all that did was just took it out a couple hours before this video and let it come to room temperature and as a just sidebar I have some citric acid I'm gonna try to play with this after we make the gummies because I know you can make like your gummy sour so we could probably turn it up a notch if you want to there we go we got that citric acid so and I have a little measuring this is like a little measuring cup where it comes like 2 ounces 4 tablespoons I find it easier when I'm trying to measure out liquid cannabis so and we have a spatula and whisk is going to be important and these are just two measuring one is a half cup one is a four for my cannabis in my water measurement so you can use any shapes of cups long as you have a 1/2 cup a 1/4 cup and a whisk and a spatula that's all you need so let's get started guys so I'm gonna start out with my 1/2 cup and I'm gonna just fill it up with some water and that's what's gonna go into the pipe I dropped a little bit so I'll just add a little bit y'all don't tell nobody alright and what we're gonna do is put this puppy on and I'm gonna put it at like a low medium I find that you don't want it to cook too fast okay guys now that we got the 1/2 cup of water in I'm taking off my mason jar and as you can see my butters been out it's melted but it's starting to come back together so I need 1/4 of this so I have a 1/4 cup you might can't see that but that is and it just makes it easier to scoop sometimes you find it to get messy so I'm just gonna use this too together with that water and ain't gonna hurt nobody to add a little bit more cuz I know y'all like to turn it up up and you can also less let's get these gummies poppin yo we gonna make sure they live that's the young folks eh okay so mater we have I 1 4 plus that I added of the cannabis infused coconut oil we're just gonna let the let it heat up and infuse a little bit together then once we do that and we see it kind of coming together we're going to add those four packs of um gelatin so I kind of like wanting to do its own thing because it should have all been liquefied already but it all started coming back together so i'ma just let it spread out a little bit and now that those two are coming together I'm now gonna add those four packs of gelatin and what I like to do is just open them up two at a time make sure all the good stuff is at the bottom of the envelope and then that way I can pour it in and whisk it so you're not like pouring them individually and then they start clumping up on you I hate that so let's put all of them in there try not to drop the packets pop mine so the whole idea mmm excuse me voice just went out it's to whisk so it dissolves so we want all of that together all of it does just start to come together because you can see if you know yo is not all the way liquefied its clump up with the gelatin packet so I just find it easier when you just start getting three ounces I just happen to have a six ounce box I think I picked it up by accident and you can use any flavor I know some people use kool-aid I've seen videos with kool-aid which is pretty creative I've seen videos with food coloring which is also creative so you can get like so creative with this stuff guys don't take it like so serious that oil coconut oil is so good I'm so in love with it okay guys so like I said I have a six ounce box and uh I don't want to use the whole six ounce because if I did use the whole six ounce I would just have to double all of my measurements so if I had a half cup of what I would have to go to a cup of water so I could have used it but I didn't want to make a zillion coming so I'm gonna measure out three ounces my little cup here is two ounces so I know I just have to add one more element after this wash and I'm gonna add it and whisk it at the same time because I don't want it to start to clump up on me one more ounce in there and guys if you feel like it's like I don't know how to explain it maybe like a little too thick I have seen videos other videos where you add a little bit of water to it and I'm not saying like you know it ain't supposed to be super liquidy of course because it's gelatin I mean you know it's the gummies so it's supposed to have a little thickness to it but sometimes you find it just a little it's not coming together around just don't be afraid to just add a little so I'm putting in this last so that was a total of three ounce of that lime jell-o and as you can see it's turning green and you need to whisk even aside so make sure you get the sides of the pot and you want to whisk until all of that jello is totally dissolved and once it's all dissolved I'm gonna turn my heat up so it can come to a boil which I'm gonna start kind of now turn this up and I'm gonna I'm just turning it up maybe to a medium fire so I can start boiling and then once it starts boiling guys what I want to do is let this simmer for five to eight minutes now it's gonna be your choosing all the time the reason I said five to eight minutes because you want to try to keep some consistency the more you make this stuff I realized as far as cooking and enough use meant and the longer you cook things the THC potent it's burning off so I'm gonna be be cautious of my timer and if you could see on minds and say 11:50 to five minutes from now we'll be 57 so at 57 is gonna be my time to take this off and start to get it into those moles maybe cuz you don't want it to get cold so and I'm gonna for five to seven minutes and also be stirring whisking I'm sorry that's the better word whiskey hey guys as you can see it's boiling up it's getting all good and make sure in between your five to eight minutes that you're whisking and then you stop so what you want to do is just whisk in between let it boil up whisk again we'll be back in a few minutes guys it's gonna be ready all right guys our clock is at fifty seven let's go and turn that off see how nice and bubbly it is the green done came through in the jello I can clearly tell from my whisking that you know it's it's solidified together so it's ready to do what it does when it goes into molds and make jello now guys like I said I got these molds from probably Michaels and I made it with me from the East Coast so you can go anywhere I've seen YouTube videos where people literally put them in ice cube trays and I ain't mad at you if you can find some dollar ice cube trays and put these in do it stop saying like so serious and have a little bit of fun so spatulas always won't come in handy guys cuz you can do this with I just want to make sure that my camera guy sees that that's spatula cuz you're gonna leave some stuff on the side so okay this is the difficult part is pouring it in I don't have no trick if you know a way to get this in I tried syringes it takes too long this stuff moves quick so I'm just gonna use my half cup of my measuring cup thing I had and hope that this works so at least with this I can scoop the handle important just like that you're gonna get stuff on the edges don't worry about that you can always shave this stuff off I'm using this heart mold I probably won't even have to use these other moles because I only did the three ounces if I probably would've did more I would have been able to fill probably all of them up so we wanna that's why you want to make sure you get this in here pretty quick cuz it will solidify when you really quick so what I want to do is just take this and honestly y'all I think I'm gonna just eat this so I'm probably just gonna get my high on now because if I can't eat it yoshua can I think I'm just addicted to the cannabis oil cuz it just tastes so good for real so I'm gonna put these in a freezer you can put them in a refrigerator I just find it if you put them in a freezer it kind of makes it come together a little bit better I'm gonna leave it on this parchment paper that way if anything drip off it can stick right to this and see the good thing about the parchment paper guys look you got some little extra gummies coming on the side look at that look at that look at that look at that look at that look at that look at that that's what I'm talking about I think I might be high already but it's okay I'm at home this we're gonna put in the freezer for about 30 45 minutes we'll come back with the video and check on them and then I think I'm trying to turn up a notch just a little bit to make them like sour why not we'll be doing be right back alright guys so we're back we've given the gummies 30 minutes and let's get ready to take them out I tend not to leave mines in there that's a whole 45 minutes just because I don't want my gummies frozen so guys I got the parchment paper I'm just gonna use that paper and what you're gonna do is just kind of flip them over and you should be able to pop these puppies out let's pray they come out for me come on baby and remember we said we will have the access of stuff around it and again I told you what I was gonna do with that oh I don't really care about the perfect dummy because I'm not perfect so I don't care and I'd say are so good you can do any flavor remember and I love that they all just coming out which is always a great sign that there I was getting ready say cooked but there hold it correctly not cooking so guys and pop these puppies out and then what we gonna do real quick just turn them up a little bit and put them with I'll make them sour so as you can see guys here's on those Tommy's there's me eating them all right I got Lobo I got my measuring cup this is a half cup I'm gonna scoop out sugar yes people do some sugar in a ziploc bag so I'll put 1/2 cup of regular white granulated sugar and then I'm gonna just do like a tablespoon of citric acid no I lied I'm gonna do a tablespoon and a half I want to and that's the citric acid you can get it from right where the kool-aid is in Walmart and then you want to just start it up together like that now of course you guys are a lot smarter than I am I'm sure if you know something else that you can put in this to make them sour share it with me so what I'm gonna do take that out the way and then I'm gonna just pop these in and make somebody sour because I can that's what we want to do and then guys what I would do is put these back in a refrigerator they're kind of like let on kind of coke this is it this was mine do it yourself make gummies out of jello and not knowing what you're doing and I can still be to work in and out work and I got some dummies no don't take your gummies the work can get fired you see you guys the devil's nicest up was not wet number one notice I'm sorry whoa now I do think that lump with the citric acid does make it ten times our but the amusement tastes good then consistency in a dummy like some time you get gummy snake falling they all wet this is not so I did a good job on this I think I'm right now alright guys so that's it so until the next time I see you guys thank you so much again for watching remember if you haven't

the two-year-old Delilah didn't wake up to that bag of candy because she's at UMC that's where we spoke to her older sister Chantel Chantel herself is still in her Halloween makeup Pattillo heard her at least open her eyes Chantel took her younger sister trick-or-treating in North Las Vegas near Lake Mead and Sandy they walked a lot so when Delilah said she was tired Chantel didn't think anything of it so I picked her up and I like hold her for a while we kept going back to houses I noticed she started getting sleepy I was like okay maybe it's time to call it a night after trick-or-treating shantel went to give Delilah a bath Delilah was limp and not responsive I started freaking out and everyone was telling me she's just really tired she's okay like she's not okay this is not her this this can't be her and then I've told them I need to go to the hospital there's something's wrong with her Chantal took Delilah to UMC and doctors ran a bunch of tests tests came back they're like there's THC in her system and I was like I was just I couldn't speak I just kept on crying I just I don't know how it got there I don't know what happened in between time Delilah slept through the night and woke up today and now her family is speaking out because they don't want this to happen to anybody else they're asking all parents to check every single piece of candy their children brought home it's like you're here you know so I feel a lot better the fact that she's been here because if I just let her believe what everyone was saying you let her sleep who knows but what happened police came to the hospital and took a report the family hopes Delilah will be released tonight", "K1VtZ1vqo8s": "Crete [Music] hey guys what's up welcome back I'm glad you're all here today if you happen to hear some birds chirping around the background perfect because it is springtime here in the northern hemisphere which means it's a perfect time to start to germinate seeds whether you're going to be going outdoors for the 2019 outdoor season or you're staying indoors and want new genetics or just new seedling plants for your indoor crop today I'm going to be showing you the few little things that I use and how I germinate seeds just like everything I do it's a very simple method it's something I've been doing for a really long time I think you know I think I'm on like 14 years now I'm sure there's plenty of other ways to do this and possibly better and you know just slightly easier ways to do this but this is how I do this like I said it's been successful for a long time now so today we're gonna be showing you how I germinate seeds so stay tuned alright so let's show you the little bit of equipment that we're gonna need to get these seeds up and going so obviously first things first we're gonna need some seeds so whatever a variety company strain even species you may be going with get those ready now what we're gonna be using here is banana split from the homie loci grow he started his own little breeding company here a breeding genetic company under grow genetics and they're just getting up and going he's got about six or seven crosses that are in testing right now and I was lucky enough to grab them so I could take some dope pictures and also get them kind of up and going and do some testing anyway we have the banana split which is banana punch by symbiotic genetics super hot they're crossed with ice cream man was his mail from compound genetics another super hot breeder out there so should be some serious fire in there and if you guys have been following me on instagram at green jeans garden you have seen the fire pictures before these things have even germinated as well as some other strains that got some dope pictures up so follow me at green jeans garden anyway so we have our seeds next we're gonna need a shot glass or anything really that holds some water because the first step is soaking the seeds and to go along with that we're gonna need some water simply now this is where everyone's gonna ask so what kind of water tap are oh this or that doesn't matter guys use tap use are out use what you got but whatever you use use the best you got if have RO water use it if you have clean spring water use it the idea is that it's clean water and it's neutral water and what I mean by neutral is it's somewhere in the range of upper fives at the lowest pH to around seven at the highest pH so just say Gerry generally neutral pH and you should be good to go and then once we soak the seeds we're kind of moving in the second process and that's going to be germinating them in the basic paper towel method that everyone knows and loves so that's going to consist of a paper towel and a ziplock baggie now the Ziploc baggie could also be a clone dome it could be anything that's just going to keep the paper towel from drying out too fast could even be two bowls but we'll get into that once we get going I picked pick eight of the beans that I want to germinate here save a few just in case for a rainy day you never know it so it's just kind of a we save one or two anyway got them as well as the two twin beans that I have in there photo goes up now so all we're gonna do here is we are going to put a little bit of water in there and we are going to simply drop these seeds into the water now you'll notice most of the seeds will float any that sink immediately are usually duds but they could be okay anyway just give a little little swirl and we are going to let the seeds soak for 12 hours okay so we've dropped our seeds in water we're going to let them soak for 12 hours and we let them soak for 12 hours in darkness now by dropping them in water and having generally good temperatures those are the two criteria to start the germination process light can be harmful essentially it's just really not necessary some species and strains and things do need light but overall 95% of seeds germinate the best and most successfully in darkness so as long as you have good moderate temperatures over 65 degrees under you know 80 80 82 and some moisture for the seeds to start their process they're going to germinate so what we're gonna do is we're actually just going to put these in one of these cabinets I have behind me here and come back in 12 hours [Music] ok so it's been about 16 hours now and the timeframe anywhere from you know 6 hours to 24 hours is plenty of time to get these seeds soaking and as you can see here these seeds have already sprouted tails in the shot glass now these things these are new fresh seeds very vigorous ready to go if you have some older seeds they might they probably won't sprout tails a lot of times my older seeds won't sprout tails in here which is why we actually go to this the second step of the method here the paper towel method some people will just germinate in the shot glass and honestly these seeds right here these could go straight from here to whatever your final or starter media is and probably be fine they're vigorous and ready to go but for the sake of how I always do seeds we're going to continue to take these from the sprouted tails in the shot glass here and get them into a paper towel so let's do that now okay so let's get these seeds transferred into the paper towel and it is just as easy as it may seem we are just literally just going to pour them in try not to spill them everywhere and keep them in our palm and we got one being left in there we'll just wash it on out use gravity and water and bam just don't tell my wife I'm doing it here on the counter all right once we have the seeds on the damp or moist paper towel we're just gonna fold it up maybe two three folds tops you don't need much as you can see here you can see the seeds through it we don't want it to be completely thick that we can't see through it but we want to be covered enough that it acts like you know some form of medium or soil all right so we have our seeds damp paper towel just let it drip dry give it a little ring on the edges we just want it we want it moist damp not dripping wet but obviously need some moisture for seeds act like you know pretend it's some moist cocoa or some moist soil once we have that we're gonna open up our ziploc bag or simply just gonna put it inside now this thing is like I said just acting as if it's a clone a cloned oh this is just they've always done it in ziplock baggies cuz you know they're more accessible and pretty much everyone has a sandwich bag I'm using a gallon ziplock here because to me the bigger the Ziploc the better which is why I think I cloned a clone dome works great for this situation the small Ziploc sometimes if your seeds take a while to germinate maybe they take 3 4 days to get going and they can get kind of just a funky little smell going you might want to change paper towel something like that and I've noticed a bigger a bigger Ziploc or cloned um or something like that that kind of mitigates that just a just a touch but these things are so vigorous they're only going to be in here another 12 hours or so maybe 20 for tops you'll see them and they're gonna be frickin explosive so all we're going to do is put it in here and kind of give it a little little puff give it a little air poof in there so it's got you know so the bags not laying right on on the seeds and we're going to put it right back into that dark space where we had success getting these tails out of the four so wherever that was for you go ahead and put it right back there [Music] okay so let's look at these guys all of them have have sprouted and one of the twins has sprouted one of them has not guys are looking at just some singles here look at that beautiful beautiful growth here we go and this one see that's a twin that only one has sprouted this twin both of them have sprouted guys this is a little weird [ __ ] Wiggins I'm so stoked but all the seeds looking good look at that tail fantastic so whoo okay alright guys so 24 hours after we put them into the paper towel we've now taken them out roughly 24 hours might be like 18 you know but give or take these seeds are extremely vigorous so don't expect results exactly like this I just want to clarify that right now tails popping out after 12 hours beautiful busted tails out this is just a very you know these are fresh seeds it's a vigorous strain obviously all good signs but if yours take a few days to get to get some tails sprouted this or that don't worry that's that's totally normal but once they do once you've opened them up we can transfer them from the paper towel to whatever starter medium you have so if you're gonna try to drop them into a rock wool cube that's your thing if you're putting them in soil that's your thing Pro mix whatever it may be that that's your choice at this point but we're using coco here but the you know the technique here is the same we're gonna lightly we've already buried our unburied them holes give them some nice nice spots to sprout and we're just going to lightly place each seedling in there I have eight little four-inch pots here and we have eight seedlings we're actually not going to do all of them because that twin sprouted so I got to actually go take some some great photographs and that should pop up right here and if not give me a few days and get all these potted up and nicely watered in I have one little watering technique that I'll show you once we get these in here but that's that so we are actually we're two days past once we first transplant these seedlings into their Coco medium and you can see there up there sprouted all of them even the twins that are in this bag you're going I just want to get that shell off there so I can get each one of these twins into their own own media but but yeah they're ready to go now I told you there was one little trick I have two watering and guys its watering so it's nothing revolutionary it's crazy the point of it is just when you first transplant your seeds you want to get them watered you want to get that basically that bond from the seed to that medium it kind of wants their wet it just creates that bond and to do that we want to do it gently we don't want to just flood the top here with water and let it do its thing most likely the plants to be fine honestly but you know most people are paying pretty good dollars for seeds these days ten plus dollars a seed so you want to take care of it let's just be gentle so simply what I was gonna show you is just be gentle with the water bottle that you were watering with nothing crazy um we don't want to flood or this is the kicker everyone forgets most of you guys have a pump sprayer whether it be a little hand like hairspray or thing or you actually have like a pump sprayer and this guys is the most gentle way to water in the top of your seedlings because it's a very light mist you can be very direct with it right where it needs to go and the perfect amount where it's not too not too agitating or not too too harmful for these seedlings now my only tip is that if you use your sprayer for your IPM be kind of you know pesticide or preventative anything it could be gnarly on a baby seedling just make sure you clean out your sprayer or have a dedicated clean sprayer something like that I know it might be an extra step but that is my suggestion other than that you guys should be off to the races that at this point and should be able to start feeding these plants now that they're to this point they're just starting to get their first true set of leaves you have those they're called cotyledons the leaves that don't really look like real leaves once they get past that they need some nutrients so at this point we need to give them light and we need to give them nutrients and we need to start treating them just like real plants which at this point they are if they're above the ground so whatever you're gonna do with your seedlings this year whether again if you're going outdoors for 2019 or you're staying indoors with new genetics that's how I pop and germinate I've always had fairly good success rate overall obviously these seeds are extremely vigorous new so they're kind of you know stars of the show here so don't expect identical results of the EC's work again vigorous freakin nature's but yeah you guys should be often going have some beautiful seedlings up and started and some great new genetics in your rooms or in your gardens so guys I appreciate it like this video if you liked it go ahead and just like it if you don't is what it is subscribe if you're not and I will see you guys next time whether it's a back to the basics little tutorial here or we're back in the garden guys so I appreciate it I'll see you next time for chief [Music]", "CqFiucWKo-8": "[Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah that's a blend these are the last this one is mallanna Valley [Music] [Music] it doesn't drop from your finger so sticky this it's it's incredible and so intense dorama you can smell in it that the mountains you can smell a little bit of resin from pine trees a little bit it's so complex is incredible the place in India where we are going in the mountains it's famous for its charas how is it made this is one of the reasons that we have gone to this place is this this is one of the few places in the world where they make the hash from live plants this is the best cream produced in the Malaya's and we're gonna make sure that when we come back we will bring back with us the knowledge the precious knowledge and frankerz alone and that many other people have about that area about this kind of quality this is this is cannabis cup winner quality stuff for me is very interesting and very nice but to go back in India and to work to make something for this plant because I told you for me here's my life [Music] [Music] the Indian expedition started with a really cool trip from Amsterdam after a great dinner and a good night's sleep we went to the airport board the KLM flight and in eight hours we were in India fortunately our great friend Simon was waiting for us in Chokey came all the way from Africa and it's always a surprise to people arrived on time or not we travel long distances to meet each other and communication is quite difficult sometimes it was really a cool experience and a cool thing to find him there waiting for us [Music] [Music] at the temple there was a ceremony going on so in in our honor and in honor of the shiva god of charas we witnessed this ceremony [Music] also very important these traditional cultures here in India was a suggestion from our shared by her Chapel we also decided to offer a goat to the gods for our well-being into the mountains and it was pretty amazing three unique quite intense experience you could really feel the vibration of something special in the air is church' see that this is church Wow the first ones in India because of the resin a man among these are these are the original colour scenes man look look at this green one this one yellow this one here lemon haze what do you think about all the females there's only female sir yes larkey this male are not good 100% Greeners feminized quality no doubt in the Himalayas this is gonna be a nice smoke in the Himalayas as well as in Africa this one performs well everywhere this plane it's full seizure [Applause] [Applause] [Music] we arrived in the morning in the pool and the first thing we did of course is smell and taste some culture of the area so we decided to have a little walk on the market a very colorful market little beautiful clothes and people and kind of circus young children doing things that you can question if it's good or not but this is India if you compare to Europe it's incredible so the prices and the labor and the people are working there you see the ice cream vendors with there is no patents little cars [Music] [Music] the service festival is a festival they make to remember the victory of the god Rama against the devil was living in Sri Lanka and who raped his wife Sita hundreds of thousands of people they will come because he are in any village there is a different God so in this particular day all the God will go in Kulu we got on the main square and all these gods these personifications of gods came running through the streets parading through the streets and the army was there an incredible amount of soldiers thousands of gods come together also our god shiva the ganja god the festival was really colorful was something that for me it was unique to see also because you can feel the culture how it pregnant the life of the people here it was a big riot in yet but it was beautiful to be a part of this festival [Music] my Indra in India is like a classical if you drive around you see thousands of these old minder Jeeps and for us it was really nice to be able to drive and get the feeling of the real India on the road compared to other countries where we are able to get a bit more modern and a bit more efficient for by force actually it was a little bit of a step back but we adapt and we move on and we drive on after a few hours in the car we reached the bottom of Milano Valley and that's where the walk begins and the walk is pretty steep immediately it starts with a good session all the way up to 2700 meters and that's where the the incredible character galilean our lives ha ha we walked up to Gagne know an Italian man who was living for 24 years on that mountain is one of this crazy hippie character who lives in his own world but he creates something very special and very magical around him and he knows a lot about hand rubbing and making cherish he grows on vegetables he lives in his own monoculture nearly there he's got all different kinds of things and he made also very nice woolen sweater for me for in the cold yeah perfect fit Kiki he decided to come here and to forget this [ __ ] new one Jelena was pure poetry unbelievable to find him living the inspirational at his age in so strong and healthy smile and a sucker all that counts for him is writing poetry smoking good chairs in the Chilam and having positive vibes and positive energy with the people and the animals and the plants around you [Music] [Applause] Ultra can totally change to create a glioma team so meeting with a salesman at the poco team is no patent alpha means that there are in the morning time now this is the swinging of the bed night but is not only this because I had forgotten smoking five six joint at least Audrina [Music] [Applause] [Music] we decided to camp on 2700 very close to where Franco have lived for a very long time in HK but I think I could have shot each other he told me about the cave many times but when you see it in person and it's really incredible you see this place the view alone is out of this planet and you think so peaceful so magical with plants around fields around a small community of mountain people with which are very welcoming and very friendly the locals they told me there was a house they are broken they told me you take stones and wood and you'll fit it and they a they fit it when did you came here 96 96 how many years did you live good ten years first time I was in this area it was in 91 then I was amazed from desimilus really then in 94 I had the trouble in Italy so he had my strains I decided to give them a chance in the spring of 96 I was here asking to the locals it was possible to give them some chance they told me yes you can do it then I started on living here but it I realized was not only for this all these kind of life is so interesting like see the original hand way of making cherish Rabbinate rubbing it the big difference with Morocco is where the dry the plants but here you have to do all alive we decide to build the base camp there because after that we could walk for another few hours up to 3,000 2,200 so very special fields and these fields are amazing the genetics they are actually a very very special because you can see many phenotypes of the same kind of bland rice that generates this incredible charros and incredible cream and in the same field you can see purple plants you can see sweet flower plants you can see real sativas with a minty piney woody smell and a very very nice variation so very interesting from a plant point of view also thank you a whole day to make one Tola it will be very difficult now to make one Tony on one day maybe half dollar no maybe six seven grams maximum seven grams the taller and India's 10 grams so now they make six seven grams in the afternoon one food at work imagine [Music] camping is a strain hunter is also a little bit different experience than than people imagine because of course the kind of time and time frame you have is always very short you have to set up tent at the end of the day and leave your camp very early in the morning so you don't have much time to prepare much to ether you just have time to make a nice big fire that we always take care of doing because it's safe and gets you warm it's very important [Music] traveling from Malaya to India is obviously quite a shock and massive differences obviously in terms of altitude and terrain and also in terms of half people plant in Malawi you'd find this tiny little field hidden miles and miles away really like a needle in the haystack whereas in India you really just hit that Ganges everywhere [Music] after the gay we get moving get moving until we finally reach the top fields Franco showed us how the original cream is made now and this is something the foreigners brought in like 15 years ago because it used to be on insurance and now they also make curry misses a high quality with less particulars of the planting like nowhere has and no calyxes and wood and for us it was also very big learning experience to see from which area the best cream of West Charles come what we really saw is that the higher you get the higher the quality of the cream gets and also the more indica the plant gets this is the field how many plants are here so the plants we have to shoot to choose they should be a ripened but not fully ripened they should have not one dry point of the little leaves also in crema we all sat in a circle and franca started teaching us how to make the perfect hand of Charles and the perfect and looks cream and it was just incredible we just sat there in the Sun it was such a beautiful day with this crispy mountain air and we started rubbing rubbing rubbing so the hands are totally clean nothing on the hands no cream not nothing the hands must be in his son would Franco explain to us the better the face went from the Sun cause it's a long hot day then slowly rugged plants in the manicure first one by one some people they were cleaned all before altogether but they will start to let some juice if you play not before it's better for better quality is better to clean one by one wrapping in the Himalayas King this is pretty cool the stem you should take away then bud we put in the ends and you start we start to a caress it very gently very slowly and without pressure we just must to feel it to rub in your hand in your palms with a very fingers without breaking anything look already you see they're stitching this big yes we take these two big yes is better to make two little together when you strip it you don't make like this because this now this will take away the tears from your eyes we try to take to let it the big piece on your finger so don't know bigger it is like this piece you will lose it okay you take it or leave a finger you have to you have to press you have to have bigger it is looking more text okay yes and more it takes away [Music] [Music] [Applause] so after walking down rushing down the mountain we reached the village of mallanna there is now a road going down there but before you had to walk like 2020 for cash together like two days now because of all the dams that are building in this area it's easy to access but still it's a very pretty steep climb up to the village and once you are in the village you are in a totally different world [Music] hey guys [Music] these guys are probably the direct descendants of Alexander the Great's troops lefting is in this area during the conquering of Asia you cannot touch the people you cannot touch the houses we're not allowed to eat with them this place was very hidden in the mountain and divorce is related everything they they need they get from the mountain okay so they the way they build their houses without nails the wood even the stones for the roof and vodka castle only tells us that in all the times there are only two things that people needed was salt and oil Franco can you ask the guy for bottle of water here we cannot to go inside the shop because there's an eatable of items so they will come unpure they was letting a few SEC's of wool they were going away and the locals from down looking how many and changing with salt and rice and going away and the mulana people they was going and taking wood no even look in the other in the last hundred years or in the last 150 years Cera's has replaced wool as a form of barter so these mountain people live this life totally self-sufficient and they use Cera's to buy the few things that they can't obtain from the mountain to see mulana people there was really another confirmation of the fact that cannabis is integrating part of the most special cultures on this planet Cera's is people's freedom in these areas ok tomorrow after meeting you in may after your all your problems we had decided to give you a beautiful house in your village of Milano and we're starting now and we hope it's going to be ready before the winter a very nice plaque for you because this is a holy village we cannot touch it sure we can also not touch the house so we're going to put it down here and we hope it will bring you a lot of prosperity and a lot of good luck for the rest of your life and here are the plates your house we donated this house tomorrow we lost both his parents he's an orphan when he was four and seven years old first his father and then his mother now it's 18 it has nothing description is shed it only has a few sheep one pot filled so we decided to give him a nice house to give you a little bit more luck than had in the past we did a lot of work for the green house foundation in the past most of the work is helping people with good seats and in other ways we have never give any attention to the public about our foundation because it is questionable for some people but now when the situation is changing in the world with the cannabis cannabis is getting more accepted cannabis is getting more legal around in the world people are realizing that cannabis is not that bad at all in the end and also us becoming more and more popular YouTube with like 120 million hits we decided that if we go open with the green house foundation maybe we can get more funds and do more things in the future after a good night of rest in the guest house in Milano we started a really long walk really steep walk and we reached one of the most secluded valleys in the area the locals call it Rolly touch it's the valley of the Devils we were a little bit shaky on that walk because we heard rumors the night before that over 200 police officers were on the way to our area to cut down cannabis plants and to perform their circle duties this is a whole game between the politicians the farmers and the police it's a very sad situation the war on drugs takes on and very interesting dimensions when you come to India you've got hundreds of policemen that are paid to to climb up the mountain and try and just cut and the time it takes them to cut one plant is the time it takes someone to rob a plant so this is futile expenditure of energy and it just must be really demoralizing for them it's also quite fantastic for me that in the mountains protect the people the way they do the mountains yeah just make it impossible [Music] Wow look at branch here Ohio wreath we are 3028 meters so what I'm six 700 meters up today yeah 600 meters up we started yeah this is a very touchy the value of the Devils well now today we have to see what we do in the end of the day because there's 200 police down there yeah so if we come back all luggage safe if we have to do an emergency evacuation we go down right to the pass because they're gonna search up to the glacier maybe we don't know yes we will just ask the moon amazing value yeah well basically what we what we figured out up to now is that this side is the warmest ideas and so it matures a little bit keep a lot of Sun and the advantage here much more production much more they can work twelve hours in the other side where we we made the hand we it was only seven hours in here's 12 12 hours son you're really freedom fighters yeah yeah the police comes cut the filth they go more far away have the police ever cut on this side huh have yes they cows on this idea because they know a European community is giving them ten million euros to cut down the plants so what they did basically they're separating the money behaving a little bit here a little bit there and the farmers use went up a little higher and put more fields yeah and also the funny part is that the cops they send up here to cut the plants they themselves smoke charas they rob it's in their culture their families do it in the more in the day time they come they cut the plants in the evening time they as to the local some showers to smoke yeah they know this butcher for them and then they get drunk you know and then she also here the alcohol and more they premised it to the locals to grow chick beans to have a good price instead of growing charles how much do they offer them they offer them eighty rupees per kilo in 1888 zero and emotion and how much do they get and they get six you see six also the government promised so you change it now they are coming to cut the plants more and for these people nothing what they will eat in this winter beautiful answer Franco yes very nice fall over rising you ever here to have the sunlight nearly the whole day yes and now they have an idea rising it's hot the Sun yeah one of the best best creams of the area comes yeah man it's really jungly start the channel miss master they arrived they wrap the seeds fall down with the seeds fall down with ground yeah you see the different phenotypes you don't know that's why you never never get the same cream or charge in this whole area in India in the whole nation and you can see also on the plants that they are really resistant because I mean for the kind of roughness they go through climate wise and altitude wise a pretty healthy and pretty cleaner but you see now it's now's the perfect time to for the harvester we see the plants of turning yellow and of the season of autumn the crystals are SS decisis the other side of the mountains yeah much more a little bit different again and in Malawi style the African style where to put the whole pile there Peter throw the hand you see they see them lying everywhere and an Africa to put little piles everywhere because the birds eat them what smells you get you get sweet you get the sweet you get the minty you get menu I got too many I can make a bowl now on the finish [Music] so here's the end result a very nice piece of of Johnny cream look at this [Music] Branko you as a boom on you should light it up normally Renault mom very nice they're in a very sweet man with a label so this is Rolly touch Shira really touched can he can can a friend explain a little bit the story about this level's valley this place here here was the place of devil his name was Bradley then touch means field yeah and it was eating a man taking his clothes and going in the house of this man where his brother was living with the same face of the man heated but here the Devils they can have the face the same face of the man but they have a heel heel here in the bottom of the feet okay so here versa brother will recognize it he is a devil then when he recognized this he gave to the devil a lot of food so that they will was sleeping in the nighttime he was putting this scissor they used to cut wool to the ships they are big huh in the fire there was a very hot then in the night and well the devil was sleeping he put in the eyes of the devil and the devil died so since the time here people can stay and this is the place maintains the name the name of [Music] I've been before in this area and I know there's very very nice field but we have to pass them and a lot of security things but luckily one of our guides had some connections to a high-ranking police officer there's a very big project going on building dams and the aspects of the environment are totally thrown off work even though they're doing something good to the eyes of the world because they are creating so-called green energy the way they are doing it is just nasty they are they're overruling any logic any environmental rule they are putting lives of people at risk and the condition of living of the workers there are inhuman in saying that not even animals live like that [Music] [Music] when you look at these projects you can see there are economic [Music] [Music] [Music] and that I should get money this company like my friend was peeking we are owners of our life and when they're odd and then we'll come we were left to work and to live for somebody other and that's true it's nice to meet you what's your name what I've heard and this is the good thing in the end is that European community is putting 10 million euros one way in the other by supporting the narcotic police here in India to cut down all those plants and basically what I think is happening now is that this money is divided between politicians police and farmers because what you see happening now is the farmers are pulling a little bit away from the road so it's not in your face totally anymore but they're putting it up more in the mountains and appointing three times more up until a few years ago there were actually shops where you can where you could buy this stuff legal all around India so you know it's it's very difficult to change the attitude of someone when for thousands of years has been part of your culture many plants they just put their foolish come to cut down to plants many ways if you and the funny part is when you talk to a police officer about this you also can say in Europe they will say yeah I know we know that cannabis plants are good but we are just doing our job we have to cut them down and we know that alcohol is much worse well here we have a situation where you interrogate a police officer the highest-ranking police officer of the area and he just basically says Blaine in your face no no alcohol is much better for you and we should not smoke the sheriff so that we tell our children drinking they are smoking better that's also some alcohol many people die just just ready ready said that you have everyone jumping on the alcohol thing and yet Charis is a much more gentler culture you know it makes people shanties makes people think in thousands of years in billions of markers nobody never one died and now they are going to not only the police in the books [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] wow man look at this look at the stocks here incredible Wow amazing this man really incredible Smith who are you pleased to meet you I'm Franco oops sorry Franco come here I'm coming Wow look at this a mind-blowing place look at here everywhere really beautiful stocks are impressive you have all males here full of Mauser I think they leave the male's in some area so that they can make enough seeds for the next year but for sure here they pull them because you can find them on the ground already a lot got enough yeah that's the one water lady Wow look at this a what a lady amazing I'm gonna strange really amazing hardly any strategy but yeah but it has a fruitiness that the others don't have though the others were really mint in US and this one as a fruitiness and it's beautiful you see that the better in the way don't know it already from stock instead of a single pretty flower she's shooting bad stock machines we have we have some seeds we have 15 to take this plane with us across the river with [Music] [Music] the next day we were planning to reach dodge so we got on our bikes where every person that travels through India should do or did its travel around on the big royal enfield the bullet the first time I was in India was 89 I bought the secondhand model in Bombay then I traveled with that 12,000 kilometers all around Libya the Royal Enfield is just an absolute classic and as recurrences we got to Indian we saw how many they were our tongues are just hanging out so we made a plan and arranged - Hassan and your beautiful beautiful experience [Applause] it's actually a nice morning but pretty soon we see thick nasty clouds approaching the sky and in a matter of few hours it starts raining the one where you are unfortunately or not fortunately we walked in the mountains for five six hours in very bad conditions a lot of heavy rain and we find this field Jesus Christ look here guys it's traction incredible the police leader very sheer what happens with European community money but they leave a whole whole part area yeah because you think I would deal with the farmers or something maybe what's coming too late because you see it's usually maybe start raining and they run all the way around away the surprise was not a good one because as we get there we realize that most of the field we were supposed to visit was already being chopped down by the cops and the funny thing again is here that there's so many police officers but the field was so big the only could call half of it but at least you see the destroying of the plant happening right in front of you we just arrived in that field and all the plants were cut down and so much left and then the same time you realized that this is the food for the farmer for a whole year and now he's gonna suffer I'm scared to walk on all this but somehow porter of the field was still standing and what was still standing was pretty damn amazing this pineapple mango this is the pineapple mango story food just a little bit more and we are into the snow mountains we're lucky the rain stops a little bit a little bit but the plants are so wet they cannot make it no we can't we can't drop any charge today because of the rain look at this I will cut it then bring down Wow what's that looks like maybe that is that you're paralyzed man I'm a it looks like every time yeah hi sir don't like just by its female yeah we had to make a small fire in the way on the way down to try to dry our clothes and dry ourselves and fit and that's something that that that just happens you know and when you are strain hunting you have to keep flexible no problem it's part of the game it's actually a lot of fun if you feel the right spirit for it [Music] everybody thinks only in Holland we have coffee shops but I just came back from California there are 4,000 coffee shops there are coffee shops in Spain or coffee shops all over the world but they don't have a license where they are there and the police tolerate these coffee shops and also here in in India I think there's a few hundred coffee shops Tosh is a very colorful little village all the way up into Parvati Valley and we had a contact there in a really nice guest house three male adult guest stars and the atmosphere is really like a coffee shop you sit down and they bring you a nice hot cup of tea and you can sample different varieties of Charles of cream they have children's everything is arranged you can buy your your your hash there and you can you can smoke and people from all over India come there and the police the local police come there to smoke with us so yeah I think it's pretty relaxed after all the stories that we heard so in winter city we had the chance to sample the local cuisine it was a quite hectic quite chaotic experience but the food was really tasty we had a really nice lunch in a traditional Indian restaurant with the Tondo there and some dal and some chapatis it was nice nice to see how the locals enjoyed the food [Music] [Music] after that we had a quite a long trip in car all the way climbing is nasty mountain road with a few problems two or three times with the car with to watch out because the conditions of our of our tires were pretty scary but we got to the top of this beautiful mountain where we can't again it was a very nice night we had a beautiful moonlight we made a big fire and it was really a very special experience was from juvie tillich others have over 50 55 years he he robbing and he went for his father in his best days how many grams a day could he robbed four five gram and forth a from one day what time of the year is it good to make the cherish cut him that to cut me it's like in between end of September to middle of end of September to middle of November until the first no come till the first no covering some can you show the hinge look how black incredible well can you can he explain a little bit more about the medicinal aspects of the ganja great and creepy you think it's most of using for stomach pain for stomach pain okay for sleeping so for sleeping and for stomach pain they used it here very long time it has pill to return the didn't bloated and they're using mostly that seeds for that's what he sings it's for oil yeah for oil what is what do they do with the oil or it for cooking for cooking yes huh very good it's very healthy and what is the good way to make to finish the product like this okay so he turns his finger and it must be in the south or in the shadow that guide to Dubai last equal of you guys did you take like a period find it starting from a son you have some time too much Sun here too much hot and it's more melting so yeah but now it's morning it's okay yes no okay [Music] after four or five hours of walk with the wrath of this amazingly big field with our guides and rush it was like young kids in the candy candy shop [Music] in this area actually the cultivation is a little bit more spread out and you can see that the phenotypes are adapted a bit more to the to being lower in altitude so the sativa character manifests itself a little bit more so for me as a sativa concern it was nice to see the sativas growing a little bit lower than the indica plants growing higher the plants have not this really broad leaf like like it comes out at 3,000 meters here we talk about something that stays a little bit more in the original sativa leaf shape and the smells are bit more mint a bit more fresh a bit more pining so this is the tea plant in the big field that we're gonna pick out for the sheets look at the structure and the mango flavor yeah looks a little bit like it alternates to another mango one yeah mmm Wow there were a incredible beautiful fielder how many Hector's is this how many plants you see they put a lot of mail set is his first field way into my high up in the mines where you see the pool lot of mills yeah they definitely got rid of the mess a while ago there already rotting away look at this it attracts associative RC between us yeah even though I have to say there is less difference overall compared to the thousand meters in the yeah really like candy garden this one whoa this is the real sativa rational this Oh bitterish like very green most like the crystals here completely on the leaf [ __ ] like what we do indoor quite open I see from this side on the Sun it's one big shiny thing and even the leaves you know the little bird leaves they're like totally poor covered [Applause] [Music] the idea came up three years ago in our office to do something new we were very big under pressure in Holland of the right extremist Christian parties and we decided on the office we should create more awareness and show more what's what is cannabis about what's the background of cannabis and which cottages you'd use where you come from one little journey has become a multitude of journeys where we following a pond and we're going to regions which are very very remote that have had very very few outsiders and but also the kind of approach which makes it quite different is that we're not coming here to buy anything or to buy Charis or to buy you know which is was what people ordinarily expect often when Outsiders come here and we're coming to these places to learn that's what's behind strain hunter and the green house foundation it's the feeling of of hunting for something unique and bringing it back and preserving it but also the feeling of leaving something good to the people and the cultures and the environments that that donate this beautiful plant to us and I think at one point I hope we will be a part of the legalization process that people can show this movement to other people who are against condition and give them more awareness about the plant and see how important and how valuable this plant could be to society it's just the continuing project is just an ongoing mission strain hunters are people who can't sit quiet for too long you know we get bored easily so we gotta keep moving [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music] you you", "QkFQ6kvray0": "regular exercise a healthy diet maintaining healthy blood pressure

even 12 hours okay so those are the psychoactive effects what about the effects on our biology if it's going through a completely different part of our body in a completely different way what are the health effects of that so we know that for smoking for example there's the inhaled carcinogens the irritants and the carbon monoxide that can enter our lungs and lead to serious respiratory health effects or vaporize cannabis we know that there may be a less from less harmful alternative however we don't still understand its full health effects with edibles there's no carcinogenic effect so many consumers may prefer this method of ingesting it however the risk is more related to the overdosing of cannabis so that was one thing that I read a lot about in the Colorado experiment which was everything was seem to be humming along very very well and yet people didn't know how to how to dose themselves properly with the edibles at all so a lot of children were getting into it that's a separate conversation yes and that takes us back to the way it is metabolized which for people who might be first-time you in those couple first hours where they're not having any in effects they may be tempted to ingest more and then that leads to the more serious adverse effects like paranoia hallucinations psychosis that can last for prolonged periods of time lastly what do we need to know what else do we need to know about this new frontier in legal cannabis so one thing is like you said the public health concern that there is with accidental ingestion by children or even by our pets that you know poses a huge health risk to the population but also the fact that we shouldn't be consuming it with alcohol and that we if we have any other health issues that we shouldn't really be consuming cannabis all right well if you don't know now you know dr. Campos thank you so much for being here thank you thanks for watching if you liked this be sure to subscribe here and you can check out more your morning videos right here", "rMMHqxyvVAU": "so what's up everybody welcome back to chef Judy's TV on today's episode of in the kitchen we're gonna be cooking cannabis infused cooking oil so what I have right here I have about 34 grams of shake I have about two cups of cooking oil and have about two cups of butter this video is sponsored this video sponsored by blessings on blessings dispensary in LA there are just 2157 west century Boulevard on the corner of Van Essen century so if you guys are ever in LA go ahead and check them out I'll leave all their informations in the description box down below but yeah they actually provided me with the shake for you guys that don't know what shake is shake is basically the leaves that fall out put a flower and settle at the bottom of the container this is some really high-grade shake it came from a high-grade plant if you guys get if you guys that's not as very much like you're just filling up my whole house my neighbors won't be big on big beech over here some but yeah so blessing a blessing dispensary supplied me with the shake shout out to my homie swag City over there he didn't want to subscribe me with the shake thank you guys for sponsoring this video but without further ado we gonna jump into it alright so the first thing we want to do is we want to decarboxylate the weeds basically we want to activate that Tec so the way we do that is we throw it in the oven a 250 degree oven for about 25 minutes and it activates that THC that way we can put it into oil and do a further second step to activate the marijuana into the oil so I'm gonna go ahead and throw this in the oven and I'll see you on about 25 minutes alright peace so it's been about 25 minutes we just got the weed out of the oven as you can see I got separated to two piles 17 grams each like I said if you guys can see that color it got a little bit darker so now all that has to do is add the week to the jars and put the jars in a double boiler not really a double boiler I'm gonna do is put the jar and in a pot in the water that's slightly boiling like a like a mouth simmer you want the water to be about maybe 200 degrees and you want to put that in the water for about an hour and a half - two hours all right so now we're just going to transfer the weed to the jar I like to use the napkins cause as you can see it transfers very easy yeah I can see downtown let's begin for a same thing with your butter sack just to the butter so once again that's 17 grams of shake and about 2 cups of oil 2 cups of fat if you want to use the flour you can use a flower but cut that use about maybe a 8 3.5 grams of flour because the flour has more THC to the shanks so we're gonna have to go ahead and throw this into our boiler that got fitted over here slightly balding and we're gonna leave that in

I want to see you oh like Huayra [ __ ] right I want to have I want to see you be able to go and I got no wonder this place is on his knees thank you", "tz6QveHJ4y4": "to smoke or to vape that is the question at least according to the state of New York hey guys Tara here for dnews and we've reached a turning point in our country where marijuana use is starting to become the norm whether it's medicinal or recreational andrew Cuomo the governor of New York State is expected to sign a bill soon that will legalize the drug but there are rumors that only certain methods of intake will be legalized specifically anything that does not involve the actual flower so edibles THC pills and vaporizing would all be okay now we've been hearing a lot of news lately about e-cigarettes and how those are supposedly better for your health than smoking actual cigarettes but how do we there stack up and are they better or worse for you than smoking say a joint let's go back to basics for a second now a raw cannabis plant contains over a hundred different cannabinoids which are chemical compounds that bind it to the cannabinoid receptors in your brain cells one of those cannabinoids is THC which is what's responsible for the psychotropic effects of smoking weight then there are others like CBD which gives you a body high but without all the mental fogginess now depending on where it's grown a cannabis plant will naturally contain anywhere from four to 65% THC and products with a high THC content like hash don't actually need heat in order to be activated you could still experience their effects just by ingesting them it's just that heating makes them even more potent now when you smoke a joint you're using an open flame which is very high heat and that combustion process activates the THC so when you inhale it the alveoli lining your lungs will deliver it straight into your bloodstream that's why you feel the effects of marijuana almost immediately after smoking vaporizers on the other hand use a process called conduction heating where either the raw plant or an extract of the plant has direct contact with a heat source but without an open flame so it uses a lower temperature and it heats it up just enough to be able to vaporize the THC that way you still feel the effects of it but without all the health problems that come along with smoking now much like a cigarette paper rising marijuana is still a relatively new thing so it's hard to say exactly what the long term effect but unlike ecigs you really don't have any outside chemicals to contend with so it's still widely agreed to be better for you than smoking burning marijuana produces carcinogens it can cause you to inhale soot and it can exacerbate problems like asthma shortness of breath and coughing basically it irritates the hell out of your lungs and there have been many studies showing that switching to cannabis vaporizers from smoking is effective for relieving those symptoms a 2007 study found that marijuana users inhaled fewer toxic compounds and less carbon monoxide when vaping compared with smoking it also tastes and smells better and from a medical standpoint it just kind of makes sense there's no medicine out there that you have to smoke in order to use so if the option to vaporize cannabis exists why wouldn't we use it well like anything there are a few caches for one paper izing can be way more potent than smoking and it's harder to actually determine how much THC you're getting many people say the effects of vaporizing lasts longer but also produce a more even high it also depends on your specific method if you're using dabs which are a super concentrated form of hash oil it can be really easy to overindulge dab users have also been shown to develop more tolerance to marijuana and have a greater risk of withdrawal which can lead to things like irritability and sleep problems even so it's hard to deny the relative benefits of vaping over smoking as long as people are responsible about how much they're dosing then this law may very well set a precedent for future marijuana laws what do you guys think would you support legalization even if it bans smoking outright or is this a step in the wrong direction let us know in the comments below as always thank you guys for watching", "pAOZ1Z_KFrw": "so we have a regime in Canada where there's actually laws that allow for recreational use as well as for medicinal use and the medicinal side patients have to register and the cannabis use has to be authorized by a physician rise on the recreational side basically anybody can go and buy cannabis at an approved licensed location so you have two regimes which I believe creates some issues when it comes to use on the medical for medical purposes because patients basically have open access to cannabis what we're seeing is that there's this expectation and the patient side that cannabis is going to be this wonderful treatment for their pain and on the science side there isn't the evidence to truly support that and so I feel very strongly that there's a there's a need for well conducted trials to truly evaluate the benefit of cannabis in this setting but it's almost like the horses are out of the barn patients want it and we have to find ways to better educate patients engage them as well as do the research to actually show whether it's going to be helpful or not as health care professionals we are because the scientific evidence isn't there there isn't the knowledge to use cannabis for medical purposes pain management for example in this setting and so we have a large information gap from the perspective of cannabis and its use in the setting which product to use how much THC how much CBD the dose which way and it should be administered so there's a lot of questions that as healthcare professionals we have and yet again I go back to my comment earlier that patients still want to use it so we have to find a way to embedder engage patients so the consultation service at our Center was really the result of clinicians telling us they were having patients ask them about the use of cannabis for medical purposes in the oncology setting and not knowing what to tell them we had developed some expertise within the pharmacy department I basically went to them and said we can do this we refer patients to us we screen patients we try to better understand what the patient expectations are in terms of the use of medical cannabis or cannabis for medical purposes we assess them in terms of their symptoms and then we feel if there's a need for cannabis or that cannabis may be an option once traditional ways of managing that say pain have been exhausted then we lead the patient and the clinician through the process of registering with with the government approved grower choosing the products and then dosing the product helping the patient go through the dosing of the medication to see if it's going to benefit them we also follow the patient to assess whether it's working or whether it's having any side effects so in a nutshell that's the program we're trying to ensure the safe use of cannabis for medical purposes in our patients can stay with the medical the cannabis side I think there are I actually believe there is a role for cannabis in the management about adverse effects of chemotherapy and/or the symptoms that cancer can cause itself there's a tremendous amount of research that needs to be done and that's the exciting part in terms of understanding the underlying mechanisms in terms of side effects and how cannabis can be used to address or to target these underlying mechanisms so we have a research program that we have started looking at very specific adverse effects of chemotherapy that may be immune related and how cannabis can actually modulate the immune system to reduce the side effects for example taxane acute pain syndrome is a is an area that we're very interested in we think that potentially fatigue could be managed by cannabis certainly anxiety seems to be a really important issue with with our patients and we've had some success in managing anxiety with with cannabis in that setting through our consultation service sleep disorders also seem to be at least from our experience and the consultation service seem to be amenable to the use of cannabis as well so I think there's a potential for a broad range of uses once we have the research to prove it", "A8UIcTdlYbk": "weed that looks like this and smells like this makes me really rediscover my love for weed every time i get it got a bowl of this dosie dough packed up ready to go gonna be smoking out of my brand new triple tree perk this function is [ __ ] epic oh yeah oh that's smooth today i'm smoking on this dosy dough from rhythm they're the same brand that grew the gelato that i reviewed but this dosey dough really is another great strain by them i am very satisfied with it it smells so good as soon as you open the jar bro i just want to like stuff my entire face in it like oh my god and i love the effects i get from this one it's a very stereotypical indica high definitely really helps with my anxiety and helps me fall asleep at night some pretty heavy effects but it doesn't hit you super hard at first but once that high creeps up on you you're like oh yeah this is an indica it's a super calming strain i feel like i move a little bit slower after i smoke this one if you know what i'm saying oh i just want to kill that bull by the way this water pipe as well as over 100 others are available on my website if you haven't heard by now my website is officially live it's pponlineshop.com that is my online head shop you can go there for all of your glass and headshot needs i got glass grinders papers beer bongs you name it i got it and again the website name is pponlineshop.com and if that's too much for you you can just type in popcorn.com and that'll get you there as well but this strain is a cross between girl scout cookies and face off og and if you've been following me for a while you know i'm a big fan of girl scout cookies so any girl scout cookies cross i'm typically a fan of but i am not being biased here you guys these are some super high quality buds the weed is like 50 50 green and purple but mostly purple especially towards the bottom of the buds there's also a couple red hairs but not too many but trichomes cover these nugs honestly white is one of the colors to describe this but i really love the structure of these buds they're nice tight and compact and they're very nicely trimmed and it's super sticky when you break it up very resinous and it's not overly dry like a lot of pennsylvania companies let's just crack this nug on camera real quick look inside there oh my god i am not kidding that isn't beautiful [ __ ] but just look how sticky this is and it's one nug again but i think my favorite part about this weed is the colors it honestly looks like you ran barney through a meat processor like this is just some crazy purple green and red i don't think barney had red hairs but besides that it just looks straight up like barney got ran through a meat processor the outside of the weed is mostly a dark purple but as you break into it you just find all these different colors it's a lime green it's like different hues of purple to like a dark purple to a violet to a light purple like very aesthetically pleasing weed this is that designer weed and it looks so good when you pack it up in a bowl it doesn't even look real i love the little hints of purple in there it has a crazy odor it's like you had a bowl of fruity pebbles and instead of using milk you used gasoline when i was at the dispensary i was talking to the bud tender for a little bit and my weed was in the bag and he opened the bag to put the receipt in there and the smell of the weed literally just like flooded the entire dispensary and him and i just like stopped their conversation looked at each other and were like damn and he was like you go home and enjoy this [ __ ] bro this is insane grinding up a little bit more of this all right got a fresh bowl packed up i'm gonna milk this one up god damn i love the function of this piece it's kind of small so i'm paranoid that i'm gonna like cough my ass off on it cause i just got it but honestly i can rip it it's pretty smooth but this weed has a great taste at first it's super funky and pungent it kind of reminds me of like a gingerbread cookie but the aftertaste they don't love as much i feel like it kind of lingers for a little too long which always makes you just want to take another hit [Music] god damn here's the stats for anyone that's interested it's about 21 total thc point one eight percent cbg the terpene analysis isn't too crazy but the weed speaks for itself it was most certainly grown and cured very properly and it's very potent it's great for a smoker like me i'm pretty high just off those couple bowls i can still function though i just feel like i'm moving on dial up speeds not fiber optic it's definitely one of the best strains i've had in a while and i feel like i've been smoking pretty good recently so it takes a lot to impress me weed that looks like this and smells like this makes me really rediscover my love for weed every time i get it time to smoke another bowl [Music] that's fire such a crazy flavor you guys i really [ __ ] with this straight i've been smoking this a lot since i got it but i've been smoking it every night before bed i swear smoking a fat bowl like this is just like taking a giant chubby nyquil i'd rather strain a 9.5 out of 10. it's probably one of the best strains i've had all year dosi domo certainly has the popcorn stamp of approval one more little close up holy [ __ ] god damn that smooth well that's the video you guys thank you so much for watching i appreciate

sponsor cana track [Music] the next cup we have for my leisure seeking friends at home is once again another laid-back experience so without further ado let's get into who won i think probably one of america's most commonly used cannabis products right now right like vape pens have come from it's been what 10 years and they went from nothing to everyone's not smoking joints anymore they're smoking vape pens couple bumps in the road here and there but yeah they prevailed that was all big tobacco don't worry about it i'm not a doctor um all right in third place we have cresco with the liquid live resin jet fuel gelato in second place we have pharmacan with the origins razzmatazz vape in first place we have once again revolutioncraft cannabis with terp tank florida orange vapor yeah now oh boy these guys don't just make great edibles and great pre-rolls they've got the fire oil too so i is there anything that these guys don't make because i gotta be honest they're they seem fully i think they're fully vertical i haven't seen tinctures yet they haven't seen tinctures yet we'll have covering a large span of categories for sure we'll have to let them know but everything that we've seen from this brand has been nothing but top i mean this is their actually it's their third trophies already this this event yeah like absolutely killing it so here are some comments from our judges brad says winner winner chicken dinner the orange flavor bursts through this cart and filled with potent clear concentrate from the first puff the relaxation just flows through your body leaving you feeling like a freshly squeezed orange i what does a freshly squeezed orange feel like it must be tasty i like honestly that that's a good that's a good way to sell your product i want to feel like that i'm in jeremy says the florida orange may be my new favorite strain it tastes just like a fruit smoothie and gives you those summer vibes i like to smoke this indica strain with a glass of oj in the morning before work that is a bold move but thank you jeremy and thank you brad for the excellent judge's comments and once again if you're looking for these guys you can find them at revolutionenterprises.org or on social at revolution canada now we're going to move on to concentrates one of your most liked categories you like them all but you really like these kinds of treats i'm going to be honest and like you know i'm a guy who loves convenience but as much as i love flour who doesn't love getting all of that packed into one little tiny head like i mean i cough way worse than i do when i smoke a joint for sure but like it's always worth it i love how much flavor you can get out of them i don't dab that often maybe in the comfort of my own home and close friends um but this is a really great category we had a lot of great entrance into this so i'm excited to see who the winners are it's good that we made this opportunity for everyone to dab at their own home exactly exactly all right so the scores are in and in third place for concentrates goes to grassroots cannabis blueberry headband live sugar second place goes to arise with our jenny kush live resin butter and last but definitely not least oh man first place again with revolution with their gorilla blue number four butter wow this is now the fourth award third first place trophy for this competition this is just a testament to revolution and their amazing team and amazing products really bringing the fire to this competition i i don't even know what to say this is uh this is pretty awesome so big congrats to everybody there again at revolution if you haven't at this point in the broadcast started following them at revolution canada yet it's probably a good idea do it do it now do it um we have some comments from the judges joshua says as soon as you open the container you can't help but smell the classic gorilla glue smell very loud gassy and diesel the texture was great to work with it burned very nicely and the taste was wonderfully strong but not overpowering effects were immediate came on strong and potent and brian says this is one of the best strains i've ever had looks taste scent all incredible especially with this half gram would love to see this specific straining consistency more in illinois stores would travel to any dispensary in the state as long as i can get this product so brian you know what's good make sure you're checking out those stores and everybody's good cosign yeah that is a really great coaster i'll drive anywhere in my state to get your product yeah um so big congrats to revolution you guys are crushing it very very exciting and now a word from our sponsor cresco labs all right y'all we're getting in to the heavy hitters the next and final three categories are the flower categories it's where the cup came from it's what the cup is about the competition was started to be a battle of the buds so that we can see no matter what the what fancy marketing and cool bells and whistles the plant had we were gonna pick which one was the apps provided the best experience so that all of our other homies knew which weed to buy so i think we should get right down to it because i don't know if i can handle this anticipation let's get it okay can we get a drum roll please can we do a little what do we got alrighty in third place at the people's choice illinois cannabis cup we have cresco with the red wine [Applause] let's go in second place we have rhythm with their sour diesel nice always a popular and in first place once again we have revolution craft cannabis with their turbo lemon cake flour what is going on all right well it seems like these guys are running away with the whole kitchen sink because uh wow this is what this is their fourth trophy fifth award and this yeah this is nuts and this is and this these guys these this is their first competition these guys came out this is the you guys know this because you're in the state but this is the first time we were able to do this the first time cannabis has been legal in illinois and these guys have just put their mark all over the landscape i mean literally from

vibes every generation of pages", "vUh5NWjjdDI": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel so I wanted to make a quick video or until for making edibles so let's get into it so the first tip would be to purchase a skill so the reason why you want a skill is to be able to accurately measure your kena business tip number two would be choosing the correct type of cannabis so provided gainers I would recommend using cannabis shape or trim the reason why I recommend this one is they feel it's gonna be way more affordable then use a flower or any type of concentrate so start with shape shrimp but let's get into the nest - alright guys so the next tip would be choosing the correct type of fact to buy it with your chemist so remember cannabis is that soluble so in order to confuse your candidates you need to use some type of back so the most proper fat would be your butter if you just have to use butter make sure it's clarified butter and I will try to get the butter with the highest fat content the more fat but what I have the better so just keep that in mind the second most popular type of fat to use to make edibles would be coconut oil now there's two type of coconut oil that most people use most people will use regular coconut oil or MCT coconut wall so depending on what you are making that's gonna have an impact or what type of coconut oil that you want to use if I'm making my cookies cake brownies I'm gonna be using regular coconut water not if I'm making like cannabis pills cannabis syrup honey then I'm gonna use MCT oil but besides coconut wall you can also use olive pool but let's get it to the next tilt the next tip would be using less I think to make sure your edibles now let them come into the sample form it's gonna come in powder and it's gonna come in liquid now there's different type of listening to you have your sunflower and you also have your soy I recommend using sunflower or diesel research but let's go to the next to the next tip would be to purchase cheesecloth or some type of string is for the purpose of the cheesecloth is to filter Isaac enemies [Music] so let's get to the next two so the next tip would be to label your products [Music] so every time I make a nut butter or a kennel or not always label my product and the reason why you want to do that is it's gonna make it easier to distinguish what is what so right here this is Keith choking the wall and this right here your CDV OpenNet wall so by labeling your products is gonna be easier for you to know what it's like so when it's time for me to make my edible I won't have any issues with figuring out what is what so just keep that I'm on guys but thank you for watching this video don't forget to Like share and subscribe [Music]", "4XPHy0DrODQ": "is it actually a different strain type or is it just a different phenotype that looked way better and they were like let's call this one the exotic gelato man [Music] all right i'm about to pack up a bowl of this exotic gelato mint gonna be smoking out of my straight tube tree perk today pretty much all of my bongs are beakers so i was like you know what today i'm gonna mix it up grab the straight tube time to get high [Music] that [ __ ] is so smooth so the strain i'm smoking on today is called exotic gelato mint not to be confused with real gelato mint totally different strain i went to the dispensary and they literally had two different strains from the same grower exotic gelato mint and gelato mint and obviously i got custard and went with the exotic version this brand is called g-leaf i really don't know what to expect when i get them they're really hit or miss sometimes i'm super disappointed by their flower and sometimes it really blows me away this strain right here is prettier than most of the strains they put out in my opinion it's super colorful got a mix between purple and green bud some of the purple even has like a bluish hue to it so it's really got like a crazy color combination there's a few red hairs in there as well let's not forget those looking at these nugs broken up kind of just look like somebody threw up some skittles trichomes cover this bud from head to toe inside and out it is really keeped up not gonna lie i really like the smell of this weed too it's super lemony it honestly smells like you're like squeezing a lemon as you break up the buds and it's a super strong odor i am not kidding i didn't even have to open the jar and i could smell it it just has this insane lemon scent to it it honestly feels like you're just eating a lemon head it's so [ __ ] sweet if you like really sweet and fruity strains you'd probably [ __ ] with this [Music] one [Applause] oh god i'm really glad i picked up this strain i'm typically a big fan of any gelato strain there's a lot of words in cannabis that really just like grab me by the strain name sometimes i like haven't even looked at it before and i'm like oh i want that one for me it's like purple gelato anything with the word lemon in it any cookies cross i'll [ __ ] with and in this case the exotic really caught me let me know in the comments down below if there's any words like that that just gets you with the weed name and these nugs are super [ __ ] dense they're honestly that's something i prefer these are honestly like little rocks it's definitely super hard to break up with your hands this way and you definitely want to get a grinder for it by the way shadeless plug my website is about to be live next week and it's going to have grinders glass pieces anything you need for a

and if you're watching this months or weeks in the future you can still join my newsletter to get exclusive discounts and stuff but back to the weed these are some truly vibrant colorful buds but as i broke it open the trichomes were a little bit more on the ambery side supposedly this happens when the trichomes fully mature and then start to ripen and supposedly that amber color is actually thc converting into cbn which isn't actually as psychoactive as thc so it kind of degrades the potency of the weed it's not like your weed is bad now but supposedly cvn does have its own benefits that thc does not offer like anti-inflammatory and it's also a good sleep aid got another bowl packed up ready to go oh that's fine has a really good minty taste to it almost reminds me of like a girl scout cookies how it smokes but it's still a very unique taste it's definitely a nice high it's not super overwhelming it's nice and chill but the weed is super [ __ ] sticky it is covered in trichomes definitely gives you those stereotypical indica effects without too much of a couch locked feeling the stats on it are pretty impressive too it's about 29 thca a little over one percent thc and has a decent terpene profile but i'm curious why they called it exotic gelato mint versus the other gelato mint like is it actually a different strain type or is it just a different phenotype that looked way better and they were like let's call this one the exotic gelato man it might be a totally different genetic than gelato mint but i'm assuming it's just a different phenotype and they wanted to put a cooler name on it that would almost got me who that was nice though hydrate before you died but congratulations to all the states that legalized weed last week probably gonna have to make it trip over to jersey once you guys get that [ __ ] all set up i've personally heard a lot of complaints from new jersey patients though so i'm curious how the actual wreck market's gonna be they tell me that there's a lack of dispensaries lack of options in those dispensaries and a lack of inventory in those dispensaries so that just sounds like a [ __ ] show pennsylvania slacks on inventory sometimes but we're getting there we're getting better if you're from arizona new jersey or any of the new legal states i'd love to hear your perspective of what's going on over there though overall i consider this exotic job i'm in a pretty good strain i'm glad i picked it up i'll definitely be picking it up again in the future not the best rain in the world the hunt definitely continues but i definitely [ __ ] with this one but that's the video you guys thank you so much for watching if you need more popcorn in your life make sure you check out all my other social media there's gonna be a

get deeper into the coronavirus pandemic some oklahomans are turning to medical marijuana to ease their anxiety two works fused christie maria visits with a dispensary owner seeing an increase in customers unlike anything he's seen before the last two weeks has been pretty crazy as more people decide to stay home brad pissodo says main street in collinsville is beginning to feel like a ghost town but his dispensary is quite the opposite we've got about a um 30 increase in our traffic lately um and everybody's got questions questions from returning customers asking whether dispensaries would stay open tuesday they got the answer yes but pesota says the majority of curious customers coming through his door are newcomers i've had more questions lately about what's good for anxiety than i ever have before he says customers are nervous about their health jobs and families people are just scared and they're scared of the unknown and a lot of those people are coming into the dispensaries and they're picking up their essential items doctors say the answer to the what should i take question is it depends there are several ways to ingest medical marijuana and each affects people differently the common rule start with small doses and wait until you feel the effects for those feeling more anxious that does not mean you should up your dosage pesota says he doesn't expect questions like these to stop especially with many businesses closing their doors i think this is going to have a very long lasting impact in our community to adjust to the increased demand and fight the spread of disease the collegeville dispensary is only allowing six customers inside at a time desoto says the store will remain open and staffed as long as they're allowed chris di maria two works for you", "YDVZV7NDI2I": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to be making cannabis kool-aid so let's get into it [Music] the ingredients to make your cannabis kool-aid would be two to three packs of kool-aid next you're gonna need your sugar we're gonna be using two cups total i'm gonna be using one and a half cup of white sugar and a half a cup of brown sugar i'm gonna be using a one gallon pitcher to make my kool-aid and the last ingredients to make our cannabis kool-aid would be your cannabis simple syrup if you don't know how to make the cannabis simple syrup no

this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace", "l7dP70VFo90": "site is going I can't even read my Twitter feed I [ __ ] these people I don't live if I don't put my glasses I don't know what the [ __ ] they're saying oh my people don't get depressing it actually I'm saying psychosis is a different thing okay okay I think we are discussing overall mental health yes I mean look I'm saying this because I really think that this is something that I've made a big turn over the last few years with myself that I don't quit bathroom break yes please go I don't think marijuana is as safe as I used to think it is I used to think it was benign I really used to think there was no big deal but I have a friend that I discussed the other day who was a really confident [ __ ] muscular a handsome man that never did anything and he took a marijuana edible to go to sleep and for two weeks this guy was like this is a different guy not that I was taught it's not Rafi no a different guy he took it and he experienced suicidal thoughts and and all these he had like severe consequences I think that the human beings we vary so much biologically that to just make this overall blanket statement of what's good for you is good for me is irresponsible and I've been irresponsible as saying that well one reason it's interesting what out reason I think that alcohol is so widely accepted despite all the problems it causes and again alcohol can certainly cause problems yeah is that alcohol affects most people pretty much the same way you know if and you sort of know if what somebody looks like when they have one drink when they have five drinks got some dress I've got some friends that get those gerbil eyes you ever see when they start talking crazy but you sort of know that and you sort of know how long it's gonna take to clear your body and you yes cannabis is so different it's a really complicated drug and it does affect different people in different yes and also the tolerance has changed yes so you know people say well two and a half milligrams of THC you vape it that's like one drink for somebody who you know who doesn't use but then if you if you're a tolerant user you can use 200 milligrams in a day that's 80 drinks it's a weird drug and then there's the issue of eating it yes when you eat it your body produces something called eleven hydrogen's on a tab alight it's a far more psycho action you were all along for the ride when that happens yes you are yes and it can take days for it to get out of your system I know many people have eaten marijuana edibles and then they call me up the next day like dude I'm still hot yeah yeah so so so I think I think the legalization community has sort of said for years like oh there's basically no downsides to this there's only upsides the cops will bus smokers they'll be tax revenue all these people have a way to get high that's clearly safer than alcohol and unfortunately that's just not true I think you're right and I think the the issue that people from what I've read are having with your book or people that are marijuana advocates that think that your position is unbalanced and that you've ignored the positive aspects of THC in terms of like what he was talking about cognitive benefits for people with psychotic episodes and that you were only focusing on the negative plead guilty today yeah because I think that for 20 years people have only heard the positive right eye I think that's I think that's also I'll plead guilty that myself because I think that I've only been discussing the positives and one of the things that I've tried very hard to do and one of the things I've learned how to do from doing this podcast and experiencing criticism and communicating with a bunch of different people with a lot of different viewpoints is examine my own positions and try to figure out am i coming at this from a truly balanced position or am i trying to support a conclusion that I started out with and I'm trying to you know somehow or another back up my own work or back up my own just my own statements and and and sort of prop them up instead of being really honest and objective right it's very difficult to do listen I wrote a book called tell your children that yeah about marijuana mental illness and violence you're I don't think you can you can think that that book is gonna be a compendium of the pros and cons above if you want to tell your children the truth though you really do want to tell them the pros and cons right and you did indicate Alex you said you know we should tell people the truth yeah in the book right so you know I think that when you're telling and you're saying that that you're telling the truth and Alex I'm agreeing with you that you're telling part of the truth right but part of the truth is you know a little bit deceiving and deceptive it in some ways right you want to tell the whole truth when you tell the whole truth then you give the whole story and then people can actually make you know a good informed decision based upon that like if people are going to just read one part of the story then of course they're going to make a decision just based upon that one part they're not going to make you know an informed decision based upon all of the price and because of that people are going to make you know some very poor choices I completely agree with that but to me the last 20 years have been an exercise in the other side in the legalization side doing a very very good job talking up its arguments and essentially there's there's almost nobody on the other side there's this one I bet what's got Jeff Sessions you had the [ __ ] goddamn attorney general that's telling people that good people don't smoke marijuana that's literally a quote yeah God that little morons not an office anymore but that's that's a terrible thing to say people don't smoke marijuana there's a lot of wonderful people who smoke - is not true and and and by the way I think this is a personal choice okay especially for adults yeah okay and and you can make bad personal choices you go look I play cards I'd love to play poker I'm said that on this trip to LA I didn't get to go to a poker room but you can go a new casino and you can see people of Los Angeles but you can go to a casino and see people who've lost their houses it doesn't mean that gambling should be illegal it also means that there's less and more dangerous forms that device in your hand where you can bet on what the next pitch is gonna be gonna be a ball or a strike yeah that's more dangerous than my having to drive to the commerce and play there and one hundred percent or 98 percent THC that an 18 year old vapes is a lot more dangerous than a 5 percent you know CBD 15 percent THC product the doctor heart might suggest his patient uses once a night to go to sleep but that that's the message that you know we should be putting out there right we shouldn't just be you know focusing on one side of the story like that part you know should also be you know and in the book and like you know your book you know in some ways has made me rethink the way that I write you know because my first book was co-authored with Jeremy cost and called friendly fire you know my second book that I'm writing now is called cannabis for PT G so it's how to transform post-traumatic stress into post-traumatic growth right because I feel that and you know we all know examples of people that have you encountered really difficult obstacles in their life and some people have you know succumb to that stress and they've gone down you know the wrong path kind of thing and then other people have used that stress to their advantage and they've actually become you know better because of it and you know CBD and THC can both help facilitate that process you know when you're looking at someone like like a veteran for example you know the hallmark of someone with PTSD is someone who doesn't leave their home and they can't sleep at night so like when I see a debt in my office a lot of the times they'll be leaving their home like five to ten days a month right so when you give them CBD and this is really important for people understand CBD has been shown to decrease learned fear that's incredible right so if you can get people outside of their home because I'm not talking about again you know someone who's you know too nervous to like go to a you know at the bar with like the friends or some like that I'm talking to people who like you know it's difficult for them to go to the grocery store just like pick up a few things so you know those are the type of people that I see in my practice with CBD is really excellent for that then when you look at you know the the nighttime component you know THC again is excellent for reducing nightmares that's been shown in studies and it was even shown with one pharmaceutical drug now blown again I don't really use now blown very much because it's only one cannabinoid and I do believe in the entourage effect and using all of the cannabinoids so I don't use that that much but that shows that she she can reduce nightmares and you know if you have you have you have PTSD I mean if you talk to someone who has PTSD and again this is this comes from a clinician support of you they will tell you I will try anything and that's the same way when you get with like you know the parents of kids who have see shoes all day nobody wants to see that yeah and like Alex you know if your kids you know ever started getting getting seizures which you know I hope I hope they don't because it's it's terrible you know what it can do to people but your when if that ever happened you know I would hope that you would consider you know CBD as a potential treatment I think she's not against that I think we have to be really clear as tension like CBD you know again CBD at all I don't know I don't think anybody is I think no one really is arguing except maybe the federal government in certain levels is arguing against CBD that's probably some pushback from the pharmaceutical industry the reality is CBD has proven to be at least as far as I've read very safe and very effective for a bunch of different disorders especially those that are about reducing and have it something do with inflammation or seizures yeah one of my good friends his son has developed seizures and CBD knocked it out just killed it this is very recently you know you're somebody who's you know who's a cannabis user you obviously know a lot of users why do you think it is that people you know in legal states where they can really express a preference they can go into a dispensary know exactly what they're buying why is it that they want such high potency THC product because they get used to it your tolerance develops it builds up you know every year we do this thing called sober October well we don't do any no drinking no no pot and then we do some sort of crazy challenge me and three of my buddies and when we do it what it's it's very interesting how your tolerance is radically reduced like I'll smoke pot at the end of that month and I'm like holy [ __ ] like I don't even know what I'm talking about in the mid-sentence and I'm just bullets creaked whereas you know now like I smoked a little weed last night did some stand-up had a great old time there's no issues with it at all but I'm used to it and if the weed that I smoked last I assume you don't smoke right I do not okay if you and me were together last night and I gave you a hit of my joint you'd be still there in the corner in the fetal position gone what and the [ __ ] is going on because the marijuana is ridiculously powerful but once you're accustomed to it once your body acclimates it's really not that big of a deal the problem is you you're dealing with a lot of habitual daily users and for those people like my friend Joey Diaz there's a video of him giving this other comedian how many milligrams of those stars of death Oh Tilly like when we give Owen what did he give oh I think just one he ruined his life and about 200 to 250 oh I made a video but the day changed Owens life like literally [ __ ] the guy's head up like he went outside he vanished he's gone yeah well I think I think there's a real argument to be made it's particularly with him well I was gonna make two points on that so you definitely can develop a tolerance yeah and I tell people all the time trying to take at least one three-week break but the evidence does show that if you stop for four weeks generally all your receptors return and it'll be like you've never used cannabis before yeah and that's even with people who are really really heavy users I can go back and get the study but I mean these people are you using I'm pretty sure it was like close like seven joints a day well really heavy users and noop dogs a good example of that you know my friend Tony Hinchcliffe his good buddies with Snoop Dogg and he said Snoop Dogg just smokes all day and he just like is always high and you know you're like well what do you do when you're not high he's like what I'm never not high so everything he does he is high as [ __ ] everything he does look for that guy it's not that big of a deal and for the way he lives his life like he's just a relaxed easygoing guy it's no problem you could be high all day and live his life and he's obviously wildly successful with this strategy yeah loudly second point I was gonna I was gonna make on that too though was there does not appear to be any tolerance at the cb2 receptor so she she attaches to the cb1 receptor and that's and that's where we know we can get tolerance you know some people you know they they have some pain they use some THC and sometimes they need a little bit more same sometimes asleep you know they use THC it'll work and then we'll stop working with CBD - we haven't seen that meaning like the people who you know get get seizure control generally they don't need to increase of dose like the girl I was talking about earlier you know I first subscriber I think when she was 20 and she was by him 20 she's 25 now she's never increased her dose and she's just used the same amount to CBD for the last think we should really stop talking about CBD I just wanted to make a note on the on the Italian someone I just want to make a note that CB to the doesn't appear to be tolerance it's all yeah it's just there's just such a significant impact when when it comes to especially edible THC it's a there's a significant impact on people's state of mind and it's not always good no that's just a fact we", "BzmZ_sb5dZk": "Cannabidiol -- also known as CBD -- is so\nhot right now. It\u2019s sold in pills, as an oil, in gummies,\nas a cream, a vape liquid, and even in bath bombs. CBD is one member of a group over 100 chemicals\ncalled cannabinoids that are produced by the marijuana plant. Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is another,\nmuch more famous one. It\u2019s the reason weed gets people high. So THC and CBD are produced by the same plant\nand their structures look really similar. Which raises the question: could you fail\na drug test by using CBD? Even though the structures of THC and CBD\nlook very similar, they act quite differently in your body. So far, the evidence suggests that CBD does\nnot get you high, nor does it produce any of the other classic THC symptoms: hunger,\ndizziness, hunger, difficulty concentrating, hunger, nausea, hunger, elevated heart rate,\nhunger, dry mouth, hunger, hunger, and the munchies. And what about drug tests? Urine marijuana drug screens test for one\nspecific metabolite of THC. They don\u2019t test for CBD. But there\u2019s two pieces of maybe bad news. First, because the structure of CBD and THC\nare so similar, some scientists were concerned that CBD might be converted to THC by your\nstomach acid. It\u2019s not too crazy of a hypothesis. Acids catalyze ring closures every day of\nthe week. And a few years ago, some researchers did\nin fact use a delicious sounding mixture called \u201csimulated gastric fluid,\u201d which is basically\nacid, table salt, and a few other things, to convert CBD to THC. But they did this reaction in a test tube. Or a beaker. Or maybe an Erlenmeyer flask. The point is, it wasn\u2019t in a person. A few studies since then have fed people pretty\nhigh doses of CBD and tested for THC in their blood and stomach contents, finding none. But CBD isn\u2019t out of the woods yet. The bigger problem is that, because over-the-counter\nCBD products are not regulated by the FDA, there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019re getting\nwhat the label says you\u2019re getting. Back in 2017, doctors at UPenn analyzed the\nCBD and THC concentrations of 84 CBD oils, tinctures, and vape liquids, and found measurable\nlevels of THC in 18 of the samples -- that\u2019s more than 1 in 5. The levels were generally low -- but possibly\nhigh enough to set off a drug test. By the way, in that same study, only 26 of\nthe samples had CBD levels within 90-110% of what was on the label. If you\u2019re in the market for CBD, make sure\nyou look at that specific product\u2019s certificate of analysis first -- this a test performed\nby an independent lab to make sure the label is accurate. Make sure that the lab checked for THC, too\n-- sometimes you\u2019ll see relatively high levels of THC, right there in the fine print. You should also know that CBD has not been\nFDA approved for concentration, anxiety, stress, depression, pain, or almost any of the other\nthings it\u2019s being advertised for. As of right now, there\u2019s only one FDA-approved\ndrug containing CBD, for hard to treat seizures. So, could you fail a drug test by taking CBD? We gotta remind you that we\u2019re a YouTube\nchannel, and not a doctor, but our conclusion is: if you\u2019re 100% sure that your product\ncontains CBD and nothing else, you\u2019re extremely unlikely to fail a drug test for marijuana. But, given how often CBD products are not\naccurately labeled and how often THC was detected in them, it actually seems plausible that\nyou might fail a drug test because of a mislabeled or poorly analyzed CBD product. So in the end, your mom is probably right. Better safe than sorry. Have you ever had any unexpected CBD experiences? Let us know in the comments, and we\u2019ll see\nyou next week.", "Wm7NGuSZnGI": "but what what dr. heart is talking about is in the first chapter of the book which I guess you haven't read and I really should have a copy for you it's stupid of me I got a copy of my bag but so this is fascinating to me the the British you know they colonized India and they set up what they called lunatic asylum was really psychiatric hospital sort of very primitive psychiatric hospitals and they were really initially for soldiers in the Indian Army and they were run by British doctors and what these doctors really as early as like the late 1850s 1860s noticed was that a lot of the people who showed up in these hospitals were showing up with canopy what they called ganja actually in Indians called ganja or bong which is a very weak preparation of basically or Indian hemp just sort of low-grade cannabis and so and so they started counting and they rose the twenty to thirty percent of the people who were coming to asylums or heavy cannabis users and that was way more than alcohol is more than opium and this really fascinating doctor named George Francis William EWTN's wrote a book in 1908 and he looked at the evidence and and it is amazing to hear how he describes schizophrenia how he describes cannabis how he describes the cases of violence around cannabis it's like it's like any psychiatrist today certainly any forensic psychiatrist like my wife would would like everything in the book would ring completely true and it was so fascinating to me to stumble on this and realize this is something people were talking about for more than a hundred years mmm so could we agree that there are some people where cannabis is not a good idea absolutely right we could agree that that's a all right would think we all great we're also agree that some people can't eat peanuts absolutely yeah yeah right yeah you know why peanuts kill you that's yeah it's more dangerous Oh so these second six hundred a year yeah people die from peanuts so yeah I think more people die from canvas as a result of homicide in the zoo okay well there's no correlation there's no study but I know somebody's got to do the work but why you saying that then because I've looked at enough data to tell me you think marijuana is causing homicides oh yeah this is what the book is about but anyhow so what does it causes paranoia and psychosis in people and paranoid psychosis are huge risk for homicide and schizophrenia studies that refute that it was notable there are no studies that refute that paranoid psychosis are huge risk for homicide schizophrenia is a 20x20 Times Joe well Jamie I sent you a document yesterday I mean there's there's multiple studies that they show that you know marijuana laws are not associated with a new drug yeah so the use of the drug which could possibly trigger psychosis psychosis and schizophrenia which are correlated with murders are we're not correlated they're triggers that's a grab salute fact yeah triggers because of the paranoia and delusions and you think that someone's out to get you and they're not absolutely I mean the the out of the numbers okay so the numbers are if you're if you have a diagnosis of schizophrenia you are 20 times as likely to commit homicide as somebody who's healthy now it's actually worse than that for cannabis okay and here's why what so the National Alliance for mental illness and the mental illness advocate advocacy groups hate talking about this why they hate talking about it obviously because it stigmatizes people with mental illness so what they say and this is true is if you have a diagnosis but you're taking your antipsychotics even though the side effects might be unpleasant you're in treatment you're you're you're not using recreational drugs your risk for violence isn't that high it's not that much higher than a healthy person okay and you know fortunately healthy people don't commit murder that often the problem is if you if you think about the math for half a second if there's this one group of people who don't have a very high risk for murder or serious violence who because they're not using because they're on antipsychotics it means that the excess risk in the people who are using and who's untrue whose psychosis is untreated it must be spectacularly high and the numbers bear that out so so there's a really good study from last year 2018 a small group of patients in in Switzerland Isis what's wrong Linda's a safe country is a low base crime rate but 50% of the people who are using cannabis and had psychosis over a three-year period committed violence in that group of people that's mostly 20-something man well you know there's a study here and I just sent it to you Jamie and it's it's titled risk factors for violence and psychosis a systemic review and meta-analysis of 110 studies so you know that's it's quite a few studies okay so you know let me just just read part of it out to you so violence was strongly associate with the history of polysubstance abuse strong associate with diagnostic oriented substance use disorder and recent substance misuse and moderately associate with a history of alcohol misuse a history of substance misuse recent alcohol misuse recent drug misuse and a history of drug misuse it was unclear if there was an association between violence and history of cannabis masseuse so again this is a hundred and ten studies they very carefully looked at all of the different risk factors as to what could trigger violence just let me finish Alex and what they said again it was unclear if there was an association between violence and a history of cannabis misuse alright so that's a hundred and ten studies so cannabis use in there is gonna get locked in with poly substance use like because a lot of people who use are gonna be using other drugs Holle substance means multiple sub zactly so odd everything else was found to have significantly sophistical announced and I have not not just mine a study that doctor heard a song that I'd like to look at it without looking at it I can't push back as hard as I would like what I can tell you is that I have many studies in the book that show that cannabis use is associated with violence in people with psychosis okay and more broadly it's associated with violence in the general population in large studies in studies of high-school students and bullying in studies of people who were vacationing in Ibiza in in in studies of young men in China and the UK there are big studies out there that show cannabis use is associated with violence Ibiza grilled over there for that they get manager just said it yes some dignitary or royal person how Lisp right isn't that how it all starts right yeah yeah I believe so noted yeah the way the people in Spain prints words was directly affected by this one person apparently but um so this these this correlation between people that have schizophrenia and using cannabis how do you is schizophrenia a diagnosis it's purely based on behavior basically yes yeah it's a clinic there's no blood tests do a brain scan it's basically how you behave and and what you tell the doctor about how you rise rise or it's very subjective because you're you're asking someone basically a series of questions I mean it's no different than you know depression really I mean you just just asking someone a series of questions and then you know based upon that which is very subjective then you're gonna make you know a clinical decision whereas when it's like a blood test like if someone you know passes a you know a certain amount of hemoglobin a1c and depending on which chart you're looking at then you're going to call that person pre-diabetic or diabetic but you know our fortune we just don't have those objective measurements and again that's why you know Alex was saying earlier that that you know the they couldn't really figure out you know how many people in the United States had had schizophrenia and I understand that but at the same time too I mean it's okay to to adjust you know the way that you diagnose someone over the course of the years and you learn things because you know you could easily say that almost everyone has some type of mental illness and I mean people should understand that you know there's seven different basic human emotions you know I've talked to sports there's the anger is contempt there's disgust there's fear sadness surprise and happiness that's seven so you know depending on which way surprise goes I mean six out of those seven are negative right because we're wired to basically detect threats so you know we're making you know the all these diagnosis I think we have to be careful because you know some people are calling themselves depressed and some people call themselves anxious when really you know they're just not dealing with basic human emotions that they need to understand and need to deal with like people are getting angry about being angry or like depressed about being depressed like if you feel one of these emotions just kind of sit with it and just kind of reflect on it and I think you know that's a much much better way to kind of kind of T to T's things out but you want to come back to to my original point I think that you know more people are understanding that you know we don't just need to give out a pill for everything and that you know everyone shouldn't just be labeled as having a mental health diagnosis because if things just keep you know going the way they are you know what it's by 2040 it's gonna be like 50% of people are gonna have like a mental health disorder so I people just need to understand that life is hard you got to deal with these emotions sometimes it's not that big of a deal and that's why and that's awesome for some folks and that's why I'm such a big fan of Jordan Peterson because you know he's he's kind of tough on people and he said but let me stop there because Jordan Peterson was on SSRIs for years yeah yeah for a long long time I mean it like for a long long time as was his family and that's what's crazy about him is what got him off as a carnivore diet is an elimination diet where he only eats meat with salt and drinks water and the healthier that he's ever been in his life and that is a another massively controversial subject yes let me push back a little bit because I think people you know as controversial as the book has been about about cannabis and psychosis this violence issue is even more controversial and obviously for a fair number of people it doesn't really doesn't sync with the stereotype doesn't say it doesn't say with how they've experienced cannabis use right so I think I think alcohols are really interesting [Music] comparison um I'm a Canadian from Newfoundland oh I'm sorry youthful age understand marijuana loose and land decisis a Newfoundland trade myself to say that way your tongue I'm wrong lane look what you just pulled up marijuana use increases violent behavior 50-year study finds casual link between cannabis and subsequent violent behavior new research published online in advance of print of the journals like psychological medicine concludes that continued use of cannabis causes violent behavior as a direct result of changes in brain function that are caused by smoking weed over many years researchers have long debated a possible link between the use of marijuana and violent crime in contrast to alcohol meth and many other illegal drugs the metal bang effects of cannabis seemed unsuited to promoting violent behavior however ample ample previous research has linked marijuana used to increased violent behavior the sticky problem in such studies are that many confounding factors co-founding factors involved in interpreting this correlation so okay it is very difficult to determine whether or not any statistical correlation between marijuana use and violent behavior are causally linked or instead the two associated or instead the two are associated through some other factors such as socioeconomic status personality traits or many other variables that are related to the propensity to use marijuana so I think that's a fairly good summary as well of the issues to add the study came from 411 boys who were born in 1953 in London 97% of which were Caucasian and all of them are raised in two-parent households so so you know so those people are relatively stable if they're to family to parents to have parents be tissue that's also know it's possible but so so so I think the alcohol comparison is again a good one because anybody who's ever been in a at 9:00 p.m. and gone back at 2:00 a.m. knows that alcohol dis inhibits people right it causes fights right it it makes people loud it makes a lot of [ __ ] it does alcohol and sex you're a terrible idea right it certainly causes some sexual violence okay but at the same time everybody knows that you can have a drink you know you can have a beer at that backyard barbecue you can classify that's right it doesn't mean that you're gonna get in a fight and it actually might enhance your conversation social lubricant all that good stuff all that good stuff and you might even know people I mean I do know people who I would say have a problem with drinking okay but it's mostly they're sitting at home drinking scotch watching baseball until they fall asleep that night now that's obviously not a healthy way to use alcohol but it doesn't make them violent but we know on a population basis that alcohol causes violence it causes drunk driving it causes problems and it's said that in the study that that I quoted earlier but it's it's said that alcohol again they they didn't or sorry cannabis they weren't sure right so okay so this is again I would like to read the paper that you're quoting from because I have so much other research but here's here's what I'm saying about cannabis okay cannabis for a lot of people yeah they can just smoke it and as people you know many people have tweeted at me the only thing I attacked was a bowl of nachos hmm like and so and so that's true for some people but that could be eaten with the alcohol as well that's exactly logical variable and there's so many studies that say that that the cannabis laws have actually decreased crime so so even though for many people cannabis isn't gonna cause violence that doesn't mean it can't cause violence in some people especially or at least could be affair or at least could be a factor especially with the kind of violence that I am talking about and then I write about in the book which is again so alcohol it maybe makes a argument into a brawl it makes a brawl into something where somebody picks up a stick it makes that into something where somebody pulls out a knife it escalates right cannabis is different cannabis causes paranoia and psychosis and it certainly causes those things temporarily even if it doesn't cause them permanently so a distortion in reality that could lead to you doing some things terrible and it's usually to somebody you're not actually fighting with it's a family member that the worst cases that I've and I've really seen a lot of these cases are basically innocent family members who are just in the way when somebody loses touch with a reality and literally thinks like this my 85 year old grandmother is going to kill me so I better stab her to death first that happens it happens a lot and if you look at the amount of violence that people with psychosis commit on a population level basis it looks like people with schizophrenia commit about six to ten percent of all the murders in this country and it looks like people is sort of broader to more broadly defined psychosis again bipolar with psychosis other psychotic conditions temporary psychosis they might be responsible for as much as twenty percent of the violent crime in the United States that's a lot of violent crime and what I'm saying is that it is quite clear that drug use mediates that violent crime in other words if you're not using you can keep your impulses in check but when you do use you become dangerous so when we're talking about biological variability if we factor in schizophrenia you know essentially what you're saying is that there are people that have schizophrenia that don't commit violence but that they're much more likely to commit violence if you add some sort of psych medication whether it's marijuana whether it's something else that perturbs reality for them and particularly psychotics bring down these yes so recreational drugs the worst the worst cases of all are cannabis and a stimulant because to these they both like cocaine or meth exactly yeah so when you get that you get paranoia from two sources mm-hmm and you get the only good thing about cannabis from this point of view is that kind of knocks people down a little bit but meth brings them right back so is it fair to say that what we don't know is that we don't know whether or not these people like this young man with this terrible story from Connecticut yes we don't know whether or not he would have become a schizophrenic and and exhibited those symptoms without the marijuana we really don't know we do know he did with it that's that's correct and and what I would also say is that for somebody like that and this is quite clear on a population level basis with people with schizophrenia is you've got to discourage them from using we really have to be described because it brings out the worst Brian and and you know somebody said this a friend of mine of old friend mine from the New York Times said so every time there's a hurricane people some people on the right say well you can't prove that global warming caused that one hurricane that would have happened anyway and he and they're right you can't prove it and you can't prove that any one case of psychosis was caused by marijuana but when you look at the big studies at the population level data the association is really clear and everything points the same way and the synthetic cannabinoids k2 and spice those can clearly produce psychosis in people and people with psychosis tend to slip back into it if they use at some point you got to start to say to yourself why does everything go the same way yeah I also have a personal friend and I'd really didn't think about this guy but there's another personal friend that I know that is a martial arts instructor that had a psychotic break he became schizophrenic and he's a regular marijuana user and the people around him associated that with that and in fact people that are regular cannabis users were trying to get him to stop using marijuana if you're close to being on the edge and you use a little bit of cannabis for sure let me tell you something this guy was not on the edge when I knew him yeah when I knew him he was very rational very rational but something happened somewhere along the line was he would did he become a pretty heavy smoker over time I do not know because we don't live in the same area anymore but he got really heavily really heavily medicated and did some really crazy [ __ ] and wanted being hospitalized and this was not the case before I mean whatever it was that triggered him I mean it when I was around him when he was younger I would have said he's a total normal guy and I would have never saw that coming he was a heavy marijuana user heavy heavy but I don't know how he's doing now I hope he's okay but we're you know we have mutual friends yeah and he became a schizophrenic and and you know you will see you know cases like that but you know when you do a lot of the larger data on cannabis and violence I mean it's just it's just not there like there's lots of data that suggests that you know medical marijuana laws for example can actually have a decrease in overall they could I mean I think that's a study that says there's no comfort to the people who lose their children because of these psychotic breaks that's right and those studies are really bad so the place that you can criticize is bad though because they're because state-level data is not great the place the book has been criticized or andr there was a rand review though in 2013 and I mean that that's again that stays by statement that marijuana use does not induce violent crime and the links between marijuana use and property crime are Thayne right there I think we all agree that marijuana use by itself with people that aren't schizophrenic probably doesn't induce violent crime but with people that are schizophrenic or people where it triggers schizophrenia it could potentially induce violent crime my friend did not get violent although he did do a violent thing it wasn't to a person yeah I think I think we have to be really careful because there's no just like with diet just like with the food and you know like allergies all these different variabilities when it comes to human beings I think we have to be really really careful about lumping all people together when it comes to how they get affected by various compounds yeah so so the state levels thing if you want help so the place the book has been criticized in my mind sort of the most fairly is it points out that in the four states that legalized first which is Alaska Washington Oregon Colorado if you look at 2013 and then you compare that to 2017 mmm-hmm murders and AGG assaults violent crime are up substantially in those states and substantially more than in the u.s. can I stop you there but is there a possibility there's a correlation between organized crime because one of the things about selling marijuana is the people that have always been selling marijuana have been criminals when you make things legal in a state the people that were selling an illegal flock to that state and that's true so that there's there's a direct correlation between people being robbed that there was also a significant problem with credit cards and banks where everyone was having to do all the transactions with cash there was a lot of violence as was associated with marijuana in regards to that and also massive increase in population so so and that's the reason why Trump is actually not really against cannabis in some ways is because he feels that if we have medical marijuana laws that especially the states that are that the better border states that the crimes going to drop drops a lot tremendously and it has dropped they they did a study last year and it dropped over successes all around drop seven percent in Arizona and then again you know Benjamin Hansen who's who's in the wrong data silver so he said that the murder rate did not demonstrate that marijuana legalization increases fonts and then it may have actually demonstrated that legalization slightly decrease fonts and he thinks that the reason that there was an increase in the murder rate particularly in Washington is because there was a large income gap they say that Washington has the tenth largest income gap in the United States but that's how did that change the ex-cons to the murderer good question Durham I'm so I haven't you know I didn't get to speak with Benjamin about this it sounds like confirmation box well he I mean if that that is one thing that has been shown to you know increase mental illness like we talked about and can definitely increase violence is when you have an income gap right that happens but how's the income gap shifted that directly correlates to the legalization of marijuana because during the scene because during the same period the income gap particularly in Washington and increased okay so he feels that you know the corresponding number right so he feels that that it's it's likely more to that and I mean he'd I mean I understand but I mean you have to respect this guy I mean I don't I respect them because I know what he did with this data and and so Joe this this is maddening to me okay okay okay violent crime in those four states increased more rapidly than in the u.s. period between 2013 and 2017 Jamie just conjecture Assad no credible data exists it supports a significant association between the increased violent crime and legalization furthermore studies suggest that so far violent crime decreases in states with legalized medical marijuana until new research credibly suggests otherwise the claim that a demonstratable link between the two exists will remain classified as false okay so that's just not true okay I know it's knope's okay and I know we trust Snopes how do we trust them that okay I was gonna say that too but they're they give all of their their source okay so again these do you are you on of those where are these sources and what's wrong with it here let me just go back to okay what I'm saying yeah please do 2013 Oregon Washington Colorado Alaska mm-hmm there are 450 murders in those four states there are 30,000 AGG assaults period okay 2017 Oregon Washington Colorado Alaska there are 620 murders in those four states that's an almost 40% increase there are 38,000 AGG assaults that's a 25% increase if you adjust for population you still get big increases in Denver 2018 almost 70 murders there were about 35 in 2013 Seattle 27 2018 there were 34 35 murders there were I think 19 in 2013 these increases are real okay they now know now okay can we say that marijuana legalization caused those increases we cannot yet there are other possibilities and your what are those well one positive all population did increase it's also possible that these states quote-unquote imported violent crime in other words that you've got a population of transients coming in in part because marijuana was legal and those people are likely to commit violent crime and on top of that organized crime people that are selling absolutely there may have been some people who are exporting to Nebraska to Minnesota to other states there's crime associated with that but what I am saying is that unequivocally unequivocally the people who said legalization is going to decrease violent crime and people did say that and Cory Booker in 2017 said it he said that it actually had decreased violent crime in states that legalized and he didn't say it randomly he said it when he was injured using legislation to legalize marijuana on the federal level those people are wrong and they need to stop saying it I know and by the way that Oregon economist used he used the wrong data set for his charts okay he used I used the real numbers okay the FBI homicide numbers he used numbers that include justifiable homicide no police that's not right because the FBI reported that the murder rate went up 1% from 2015 to 2016 as compared the nationwide which went up 7.9% and then it dropped by 11.6 percent between 2016 and 22nd do not know what you're talking about okay those are FBI numbers I'm reading not know what you're talking about the numbers are clear okay I use I'm reading them right now 2016 release of FBI uniform crime reports from Oregon okay yes Oregon you're not reading the reports from the United States you're picking one state for Jamie sure the entire country from that time period too so yes I picked those four states where marijuana was legalized as a sort of cherry-picking you know it's not it's picking every state where they're illegal country arrays no that's what I'm trying to show yes something wrong we'll pull back so we can see the holster so first of all that's a that's violent crime for murders and a crime great be in there Oh violent crime and that assaults aren't they no so so the four categories of violent crime are murder AGG assault robbery and rape rape is sort of gone sideways the last few years robberies actually have gone down it's murders and AGG assaults that our interpersonal violent crime okay just to go back to this Oregon economist because this Madden's me he used a dataset that is not the standard data set to report murder what is the difference he used the data set that includes justifiable homicides meaning I'm in my house you come in I shoot you and kill you the police don't charge me with anything right and police homicide because let's not let an interrupt let me finish the those two categories of crime are not likely to be impacted by cannabis use cops aren't smoking when they're on Patrol is hope and if you are using you're very unlikely to have your murder viewed as justifiable homicide the fair comparison is the base murder rate in the US and that's the number that I used and I am Telling You I mean I know these numbers I sleep you know I wake up with these numbers cannabis the for cannabis legal states on a per capita basis crime murders rose 31 percent on a per capita basis in those four states over the 2013 2017 period maybe I'm sorry I said 31 maybe it's 29% so maybe I say I woke up with anyway the for the u.s. its 18% 29% versus 18% that's the gap and I am NOT saying that I know that cannabis legalization caused that gap what I am saying is people need to stop claiming that cannabis legalization reduces violent crime it in it has increased in those two I asked you in those states was it Universal the increase was it almost identical yes Alaska was the most then I think merged why not more in Colerain Washington and and what's also interesting Joe if you're if you really want to go into the numbers is the gap actually widened year by year so that's sort of what you would expect if this is the result of a psychomimetic effect in other words a psychosis causing effect because cannabis doesn't cause psychosis right away people break down but if it's causing heavy use and some of those people are sliding into you know paranoia and psychosis you'd sort of expect the gap to increase over time and that's what's happened okay so you know I'm gonna go back again to the Netherlands okay because they've had you know cannabis legalized forever and they have one fifth of the homicide rate that the United States does right but they also have a lower cannabis use that's true but still you know one one line cake box result one one fifth I mean it's still it's pretty drastic overall and and again you know Alex you know you know I appreciate some we're talking about the correlation between cannabis use one of the things that we have to accept in America is when you're in a place like the Netherlands it has a long and accepted history of use people are accustomed to it so I think things kind of even out I think one of the things that we're dealing with with the United States is people that have just they don't they don't have a long history of experience and it becomes legal and then they use it and maybe some of them like we're talking about don't have a tolerance for it have too much and like I was talking about with my friend who's like this really continent the the one who had an edible and became suicidal and this [ __ ] up for weeks that is very confident very articulate very intelligent he's not a not a weirdo not a not transient extremely extremely successful you know I think there are there are variables that we need to take into consideration there's certain human beings that exhibit a pattern of behavior that's directly correlated to cannabis use that I don't experience so if I could say from my own personal biases that that's [ __ ] that's nothing it doesn't do anything I've been smoking for years doesn't do [ __ ] well you probably don't have one of those three genes that we were talking about and you probably also too you know don't overuse or you have some type of you know legitimacy as to why you are you are using it and you know one III want to keep going with this but you know at the end of the show I think that we should make some type of like recommendations for people just because I hate when you know you have this big you know three-hour podcast and then at the end of it it's just like hey guys just be safe you know some type of like recommendations like I love the podcast with with with with crecer and Joel Wright but at the at the end of it was just sort of like hey guys the American diet I think most people realize that one person was going on data and the other person was you know yeah yeah I mean I'm sure I find it so fascinating that now when you think back through your you know through your life you've thought of somebody who was affected that I have several people I'll bet Oh if you think about it you'll think of more people maybe but those are the big ones and like I said my friend who is a martial arts instructor it was a pretty significant issue with a lot of our friends we were trying to figure out what was wrong with him beforehand he was sending me these videos that didn't make any sense and I was like what in the [ __ ] is this like I'll explain to you more off air because so I don't have to out this guy but a lot of people that were close to him were really seriously concerned now it is it something that would have happened anyway I don't know how is he since 20s late 20s 20 you know that's right around the age a little a little bit late ish like because like I said a lot of the studies even when you look at the ones on adolescents like for sure it's it's below like they have done studies like below 18 is worse yes and say below 25 below 15 is worse than 18 like the younger you go the worse and he seems to be fine now that's good that's good it's using that I don't know after I know and it's you know I'm not an expert on this subject but it's because of this of something called pruning that we go through so everyone goes through this and basically if your adolescence you're gonna drop off some some weak neural connections to kind of pick up some stronger ones you know it's the best way to kind of explain it I'm gonna use cannabis you can potentially accelerate that process and then because you accelerate that process you don't get those good neural connections and then you know people unfortunately you know develop things like like psychosis and and schizophrenia so you know that's kind of where they were the issue lies so you know one thing that I am you know very happy that we're talking about and I know Alex will be too is that you know we want to discuss the benefits in this podcast make sure that people understand that you know I believe that marijuana is medicine it's an excellent medicine but the other thing though too is we do want to mitigate the risks because there are real risks out there so you know I do appreciate you know us talking about adolescents and making sure that they do stay away from cannabis yeah and I mean especially that's like I've read these you know these cases files sometimes you know the kids started using when he was 11 and you know it's like that kid never had a chance right and obviously oftentimes these are kids coming from disadvantaged backgrounds anyway but you know they were using by 11 and it's 16 they put a you know put a gun to somebody's head and pull the trigger I mean the pre-adolescent and early teen use we got to do everything we can to stop the problem is yeah like if you if you smoke pot in junior high like say 7 8 9 like you're probably gonna smoke pot and highs yeah like that's the I mean that's what I saw we went out when I was growing up and you know even when I was home for Christmas for a few days like yeah a couple of my friends even talked about you know some people that we knew you know smoked ton of pot in high school and like now like they're they're they're crazier they're not really doing too too much you know so but there's you do have to be careful with that I think we've learned a lot of ignorance we're dealing with a lot of ignorance in a current when it comes to biological variability right we we don't really understand how a lot of these different things affect people including like just diet and what what what causes depression like how much how much of what we constitute or what we just decide is depression is inflammation poor gut health there's a lot of variables a lot of them marijuana is absolutely one of those variables and again I don't have an issue with it I liked it I loved the stuff but it does it doesn't [ __ ] with me right but I'm also honest and so I see these people were it's pretty obvious to me that something's going on and that marijuana is not a good idea for them and I just think you know like I said in the past I might put myself have been guilty of using this this sort of blanket description of it as being a positive influence and then it's a good thing for people I don't think it's a good thing for everybody no it's definitely not a good thing for everybody and it's definitely not a good thing for the people who have that those genetics that I discussed earlier and you know also to like you know if you you need to have some type of like self awareness like the people who you know don't do well with cannabis you know you you shouldn't have to you to have your friends tell you that you came in like you're not going to work you shoulda got yourself like but that's hard for people yeah it's one of the most difficult things for people to do is itself of self-assess yeah you know to be objective you know and and it's a I've obviously I've heard from a lot of people who used heavily and seen other people who've used heavily in last month and I think it's very interesting why people continue to use when they're getting paranoid and and you know the the most cogent argument and again I'm I'm not it you know you've smoked a handful of times in college and Afrikaans I usually don't think I'd be comfortable using high THC cannabis now knowing what I know but anyway so the people the most got some right I'm gonna get hot-boxed I'll give you the shitty law on the ban the most cogent argument I thought was so interesting this guy's well you know my friends I talk to them they say I'm I'm paranoid now but I'm gonna smoke through it I'm gonna smoke so much that I'm almost comfortable being paranoid and I think that's a dangerous thing to do to your mind because you're you're sort of counting on being able to step back from that and stop using yeah that's a that's a silly way of looking at", "R6qDLu01RnU": "the state of Arizona is allowing medical marijuana dispensaries to remain open during the Cova 19 pandemic we are legally required to so it is a rule by the Department of Health Services that any licensed dispensary in Arizona has to be in operation

moved to online orders or pre-orders so that they can more quickly serve patients and with constant and consistent communication via emails and texts according to the Arizona Department of Health Services there are approximately a quarter million patients across the state with underlying conditions many of those conditions are the ones that that the CDC and the World Health Organization give special consideration to to be extremely careful for during this time most dispensaries have social distancing lines outside and are only allowing two or three patients inside the store at a time

mr. Nelson something new stuff that had to do with with legalization marijuana in Kentucky we were just talking yeah yeah it's just it's just pretty crazy that you'd have a hemp museum and have it be illegal for so long with no argument there's like there's no science it doesn't pollute anything it doesn't do anything the environment the nation makes amazingly built on it yeah everything was made out of that [ __ ] do you ever see the first Henry Ford Model T where he made the fenders out of hemp and he's hitting it with a hammer not know though dude you had to watch this we'll play this for you it's the craziest [ __ ] ever Henry Ford's very first car that he made he made the fenders out of hemp and you're watching him hit this [ __ ] fender with a hammer and a hammer is just bouncing off the fender check this out and this is crazy I mean I don't know when was this what did it say Jamie was the time it said their 1941 1941 so in 1941 before it was illegal so it was made and it was made illegal right around the time where alcohol prohibition had ended and they needed something to go after so then they started using the same guys to go after weed and this was pre that look at this he's hitting this [ __ ] thing with a the back of an axe it's just bouncing off it was also a great way to discriminate against Mexican immigrants it was and black people to the whole name marijuana came from a Mexican slang for a wild tobacco didn't have anything to do with marijuana they just created this thing like when they made it illegal the the people that were they didn't even understand they're making hemp illegal they had all that explain it to everybody then they were they had like tax stamps that you had to but about DuPont understood that all the Institute's to the [ __ ] out of it so did William Randolph Hearst that guy was the craziest the guy whose Citizen Kane was based on rules that guy was the craziest so here is this guy's hitting this hemp fender with a [ __ ] hammer Henry Rollins testing it Henry Rollins goddamn it look you barely smudged the thing I mean they're so superior to metal and it's easy it's a renewable resource like we're we've [ __ ] this up so bad it's so obvious it's one of the biggest example said why are you drone on about pot all the time it's because these things like that are one of the biggest examples of just how egregious making it illegal is it is a it's one of the most amazing plants we've ever discovered you can make your house out of it you can [ __ ] eat at you can get high with it you can make your clothes with it it has all the amino acids you could use for heating oil you could what to treat cancer patients treat cancer patients with this here first I mean somebody put it here come on come on come on right it helps reduce tumor size it's crazy helps a host of different diseases I know a lot of people that have like serious inflammation problems they smoke some weed and they're alright just lightens everything up and it's illegal and you can grow it you grow your own you can grow a [ __ ] ton of it in your backyard anybody could do you have a sprinkler okay you got some good dirt alright you got some weed that weeds just good to go that's a [ __ ] hardy ass plant yeah my grandmother she just had some some health stuff and it's like you know how do I you know she's pretty old-school like well knowing there's this thing out there that that isn't anything that these doctors are gonna offer it's just gonna make her feel awful yeah and and you know ever have to go through all of that somebody just give you comfort and it ease nausea or make you want to eat food or those kind of things like why wouldn't you want someone you love and care about to have that but then at the same time you know you want to be the person trying to feed pot to your grandmother yeah it's a hard sell it's a hard sell yeah it's just stunning how well propaganda from 1933 carried all the way the [ __ ] to 2018 it's stunning is it I mean but it's almost a hundred years yeah with what we like the amount of information that you can get on a subject now like say if you're the bet the medical benefits of cannabis just google that and you'll just start reading all the [ __ ] like if it seems to me that enough people would go wait what are we doing like why is it illegal nobody's died from it like no one more people die of aspirin every year because zero die from pot so it's really the number zero it doesn't mean that people are going to get high and walking at traffic some some are gonna but I think part of that is because we're not too teaching people how to get high properly someone gets high for them but it's time you let a poner how many of those people that are getting hit by cars are actually looking at their phones it could be a lot they were high and looking at the phones you don't see that here like you're doing in Nashville I drove around and that's like if I can't hate that and you look every time was driving on a town everybody's texting everybody's looking down you can always spot on the interstate yeah we've been home but you don't see that in California guys you guys have like really heavy loss saw today yeah so today some lady had drifted completely in my lane and I looked over at her and I saw the back of her head like I was I was on the driver side I was on that side looking over at her and all I saw was the back of it she literally wasn't looking at my car and she was just looking her phone and working her thumb and occasionally like looking up at the screen or looking up at the wind chills like whoa you crazy lady you think just cuz you're going 40 miles an hour that's okay cuz you're on a side street like you're not even looking where you're going you driving a car what if you hit a kid Jesus Christ [ __ ] what if you slam into some old lady you know what if you rear-end a bike you're not even looking you didn't notice the bike was there

Nashville is ever like super I don't know bro I don't leave the house I really don't have any idea I just I think that's a good move yeah you know I like my kids I mean I'm somewhat aware of

mothers are always stigmatized mothers who their formula instead of breastfeeding stigmatize mothers who choose to send their kid back to daycare at six months and go back to work are stigmatized moms will always be harshly judged more harshly judged than anybody else but as soon as I became a mom I hit it it was a secret even though I have a prescription and I use it for medicinal purposes Vickey below lows is a month the growing number of women who use marijuana while breastfeeding and while pregnant even as medical experts warn against doing just that in fact a recent national survey Fallot there's been a two-fold increase in women using cannabis during pregnancy many of them do so to find relief from things like morning sickness chronic pain and depression among other ailments [Music] Vicki had suffered from debilitating migraines foreigners at age 18 she found what she says was the best remedy in the form of a joint the first thing everybody told me as soon as I got pregnant is you're gonna stop consuming cannabis right you're not gonna use kind of this while pregnant right and she did it during her first trimester she also stopped taking migraine pills it's been three days I'm in bed with a migraine I can't go to work I'm throwing up I can't eat like my body's in a state of distress like that can't be good for my pregnancy that can't be good for the baby that can't be good for me Vicky's doctor prescribed a morphine drip to ease the migraines but for her that didn't seem like the best option I decided to consume cannabis and within 30 minutes I did feel better and I did have relief why did you feel more comfortable using marijuana instead of using the morphine your doctor prescribed because it's an opioid and it's a proven addictive substance but if I continuously took and put it into my body not only would I be addicted but my baby would be addicted by drinking my breast fill I'm back I knew in my heart of hearts that there was other women and mothers out there like me that we're using cannabis for medicinal purposes instead of pharmaceuticals because they didn't want to use pharmaceuticals and I knew they existed I just never knew how to find them recreational cannabis has been legal in Canada since October 2018 and it's been possible to get a prescription for medical cannabis for almost ten years but a shift in the law doesn't always mean a shift in attitude in Quebec doctors are reluctant to prescribe I think there's a lot of a lot of fear a lot of worry when it comes to kids anything involving kids in cannabis and whether it's pregnant women with a fetus hysteria around that cannabis use is still stigmatized Jordana's of its key looks marijuana every single day before she was a mom she used cannabis to get a handle on her anxiety and depression and when she found out she was expecting so pregnancy for me was a nightmare I jumped to being pregnant my entire adult life and when it finally happened I was bedridden with symphysis pubis dysfunction and that's all so it's when you were and your pelvis basically separates from a hormone called relaxin in your body and it happened too early on at 18 weeks I was throwing up until I was 22 weeks pregnant it's up to three times a day if I hadn't used cannabis I'm a prenatal depression and anxiety was so severe that I was not able to get off my couch even in the severe pain that I was dealing with physically it was really bad for me mentally and cannabis was the only release that I got from pain and from the anxiety that Jordanna was reluctant to use cannabis at first but changed her mind after coming across studies conducted in Jamaica back in the 90s that research found that babies born to mothers who consumed marijuana heavily during pregnancy didn't suffer any psychological or neurological setbacks after birth that was enough for Jordanna to take the plunge well I knew that it was working for me and I continued to advocate for myself with my doctors Jordanna was desperate for support and someone to talk to about her marijuana use that need led her to start a cyber support group for other moms in a similar situation that's how she met Annie clawed Bertrand another young mom who turned to cannabis during a difficult pregnancy the two teamed up to create Mother's marry mother's Mary is a not-for-profit organization that empowers and supports moms to live their most authentic lives using cannabis consciously through introspection and attempt right now we are an online peer support group and essentially everyone can utilize the group every day and you know be supported and empowered in that in that space they come to us with questions we accordi three new members today I feel like our Facebook group is growing at a rapid pace today with the exposure in our local community it's proving that like there's you think there's a stigma that comes with being a mom there's a ginormous stigma that's why we're moving our movement for us it's really important to not say terms like stoned or high now or baked like that's not that's not where what's going qualify though I'm Olivier listed faded and yes medicated you guys have a whole slew of synonyms yeah for marijuana and for the feeling of vampire on it yeah [Music] [Music] Annie has two kids and didn't touch marijuana during her first pregnancy but her symptoms both physical and emotional became unbearable with baby number two I vomit up to three or four times a day like being in meetings that were having fun run out and just being like I cannot wait to go home and just have it blend a little puffs like have dinner and try to keep it down you know it's really people I think people underestimate morning sickness like it's really debilitating postpartum depression just took me to the very deepest darkest depths of my life and I didn't know how I was gonna come out felt very suicidal and if it wasn't for cannabis thing I would be I would be divorced or I wouldn't be here we want to give women the pros and the cons and then you make your own decision based on what's right for you what's best for you like your own risk benefit ratio and analysis you know as well yes you advocate for themselves to go to their doctors and other doctors their family members their spouses whoever and are you showing the research article oh yeah oh yeah what do you say to the medical evidence that suggests we're not entirely sure if or how harmful this could be to kids mm-hmm I think that what we have to remember is that no mother is taking this lightly it's definitely not moms who don't need medication who are doing this recreationally that's not what we're talking about but what exactly does the medical evidence suggest we know that marijuana exposure during pregnancy affects the brain of the developing baby dr. katrina mark is an ob/gyn who has closely studied marijuana use during pregnancy the effects of marijuana on the developing fetus are much more long-term than immediate and so you may not be able to see them directly after birth but long-term the effects could range from no discernible difference to difficulties with learning learning disabilities attention disorders and even mental health disorders the response when I tell people that it can be harmful is often but it's not really proven right which I disagree with it is proven that it crosses the placenta and it has effects on the baby's brain and so although I can't show you a picture of exactly what your baby's going to look what like the way I can with something like fetal alcohol syndrome the changes with marijuana exposure are much more nuanced they're not seen five minutes or five days or even five months after birth typically they're not seen for five ten fifteen years and so they're much harder to study and much harder to characterize although pregnant women may experience relief from morning sickness after smoking a joint dr. mark doesn't want women to turn to marijuana as a first resort marijuana use during pregnancy has risks to both mom and baby and I would encourage any women who is using they're considering using it to talk to her doctor about the risks of use and about the potential safer alternatives in the same breath I think that we all need to distinct Nancy and outside of pregnancy because the stigma that surrounds marijuana use some pregnancy makes women feel uncomfortable disclosing their use and if they don't disclose their use to their doctors they can't make an informed decision because they're not receiving the information about the risks Viki never told her doctor that she smoked marijuana while pregnant as with any medication just like morphine or anything else they ask you if the risks outweigh the benefits and for me they did I don't think I would have made it through my pregnancy I don't think I would have been okay to make it through if I wasn't able to medicate when my migraines were that bad I would have ended up in the hospital and I would have ended up on a morphine drip and those have known and proven side effects they're known and proven but th is unknown and unproven that you were using marijuana while you were pregnant my parents my sisters my husband would we eat after Bach you need a diaper were you ever worried about people knowing only in the sense that the fear that maybe they would call child services on me that my child would get taken away from me was that a real concern were you afraid yeah it wasn't actually very afraid I was actually very afraid that I would have been seeing like a drug addict when I clearly wasn't how did you get over that fear I guess I didn't I really I guess I didn't I live without fear my whole pregnancy Oh mommy's here you're so sneaky Spears and sense of isolation went away when she discovered mothers marry online after her son was already born hey Vicki we're so excited today to officially be offering you at your role and we also are gifting you of course you're very excited she even ended up joining the team I put myself out there and um I feel like just so blessed that I was so well received and everybody was so kind to me and so supportive of me and I instantly found the community that you know I loved and here was a bunch of women that I never met I didn't know them personally but I loved them and that when they would write something in the group or comment something I worried about them and I cared about them and that was something I had never found before and as a mom for me it was just life-changing I don't know how else to describe it here we so emotional I know [Music] is it worth the risk um yeah it is worth the risk I know that it made me better I've seen my children from having them in my bellies to the age that they are now and they've hit every milestone they're developing beautiful ease [Music] I don't think cannabis is for everybody especially if you don't suffer from anxiety mental health or fibromyalgia or epilepsy or multiple sclerosis there's a bunch of the elements that cannabis does has been proven to help with so if you don't suffer from one of those things and I don't think you know you really need to consider it but I definitely think you need to consider it if you aren't being prescribed morphine or effects or or serafall and you're pregnant I think that it's a much better medical benefit for yourself and for your child I do stand by that and as opposed to poo as opposed to pills as opposed to pharmaceuticals with with proven by effects with proven site like birth defects in children kind of a saved my life so I don't think I would be here without it being a mom and suffering from severe postpartum depression the cannabis is really the only thing that kept me feeling like I had hope and if I haven't gotten my medical cannabis good morning I'm a new member from Quebec I felt very alone in my universe of a mother smoker they also feel better when he smoked when I'm under the effect of marijuana you reassure me thank you [Music] hi NBC News fans thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down

North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the

Thursday", "pMMfp7lEyB0": "CBD is taking over the wellness industry the Center for medicinal cannabis says the UK is home to six million CBD users who take it in supplements cosmetics and vape liquids and with some of the best known pharmacies and health shops stocking up UK sales alone are expected to exceed 1 billion a year by 2025 advocates claim CBD can help with a seemingly endless list of conditions from anxiety to acne but what exactly is CBD does it make you high and most importantly to the bold claims behind these wellness products actually stand up to science CBD more formally known as cannabidiol is the cannabis extract but no that doesn't mean it can get you high so that's THC THC is the primary psychoactive component in in cannabis THC and CBD are both cannabinoids in the cannabis plant they differ because THC is intoxicating and CBD isn't and it has produces very little side effects to better understand health claims it's useful to split CBD into two categories wellness CBD and medical CBD wellness CBD products are available off the shelf in health shops and pharmacies CBD oil is one of the more popular ones but it's also made its way into shower gels bottled water gummies and even tampons people claim that the wellness DVD helps with general aches and pains anxiety daily stresses and sleep but there's little evidence to say that it actually does help with this and now the NSA is cracking down on the sale of wellness CBD products under a law they're classified as normal foods this means the claims that they make and how safe they are need to stand up to testing before they can be authorized for sale there have been a few studies now where they've taken bottles of CBD from health food shops and looked at what's inside them and sometimes they found that there's actually teach seeing them little or no CV some of them have alcohol in them to the level which they could be considered sort of an alcoholic beverage if companies don't adhere to these regulations by March 2021 then their products could be taken off the market the second type of CBD available is medical CBD there are a small number of approved medicines currently available on the NHS that contain much higher doses of CBD and there is some evidence to show that they may be effective at treating certain conditions that's epidural X which is approved for two very rare childhood epilepsies and then there Sativex which is licensed for like pain and spasticity in multiple sclerosis only doctors on the specialist registrar can prescribe these on a named patient basis with very little scientific evidence about the effects of wellness CBD and what the shorts or long-term risks are the Food Standards Agency says healthy adults should think carefully before using it and if you're pregnant breastfeeding or taking medication you shouldn't take it at all I also think that when it comes to CBD there's probably a really big placebo effect out there sort of global placebo effect because people are looking for something in their life that can really help them and they're not getting that from their general medications so then they're turning to sort of herbal medications and those having medications should be a quality standard that we all agree upon [Music]", "hQ-2ooQuUkU": "[Music] hi and welcome to canada basics today we're going to learn how to make bubble hash [Music] bubble hash is one of the oldest and purest methods of making concentrated cannabis and uses only ice and water as a solvent it's easy to do but requires time patience and some elbow grease so let's get started here's what you need to make bubble hash when it comes to making bubble hash you are going to need some bubble bags and these are usually vinyl bags that are designed to fit inside of one gallon or five gallon buckets and they have a silk or micron screen bottoms and those that vary in different sizes 25 to 220 microns and you're going to need three to five different sizes of those you can find links to those kinds of bags on amazon in the description you're also going to need a wooden dowel to agitate the cannabis you're going to need some ice about 10 15 pounds of ice you're also going to need some cannabis you can use any grain of cannabis that you want for here we're going to use about three or four ounces of outdoor grown cannabis if you're using outdoor grown cannabis or any kind of cannabis you're going to go ahead and manicure it down to its buds so go ahead and pull off the major portion of the leaves until you get down to the pods unless you're actually using shake and trim which you can also make bubble hash out of shake and trim but we're using the buds and we're going to go ahead and manicure that down the next thing you're going to do is to layer your bags inside of the bucket we're using a five gallon bucket you may use a one gallon bucket also depending on the bags that you have but the thing that you want to do is you want to layer your screens inside of the bucket starting with the smaller screen first so in this case we've put our 25 micron screen in then we put our 73 micron screen in now we're putting our 160 micron screen in and then lastly we'll be putting our 220 micron screen back in and micron screens and that a micron is the measurement of microns with 220 microns means that 220 microns will fit through each hole in that screen and then so the smaller the number the smaller the size of the holes so and now that we've added our screens and layered them up and now we've added our cannabis into our 220 micron screen we've added about three or four ounces of cannabis and then now we're adding in ice now the ice is being used in this case to lower the temperature so that it freezes the trichomes and so that the stems of the trichomes are brittle and the trichome heads break off into the water so you want to use as much ice as possible so we're putting as much ice in we're covering up our cannabis and we're coming about six inches from the bottom of our pocket and now we're also going to add water and you want to add water so that it covers up into barely covers the cannabis which is in the the bottom of our top bag so you can tilt the screens or tilt the bucket to find out if see if you estimate if you have enough cannabis enough water to cover your cannabis but that's the idea is that you want to have enough water to cover your cannabis as well as up into the eyes and what we're doing is we're freezing the the trichomes so that the stems become brittle and the trichomes heads fall off and the idea is that to break and agitate the cannabis so now we're agitating turning and using our wooden dowels to actually literally just agitate and mix the cannabis being sure not to poke holes into our micron screens we're going to keep agitating as much as possible you can do this for several minutes 15-20 minutes or so and then after you do that you're going to let it settle and we've uh what we've done is we've broken frozen those trichrome heads and we've letting them uh fall into the water and then they've fallen through those micron screens and this larger micron screen we're now taking that out it's been several minutes after it's been agitated and it's been sitting for about 45 minutes and now we're taking out the the top screen the 220 micron and setting it aside and now we're going to pull up our first green which will have trapped some of the uh larger pieces of cannabis and our thc and trichomes and also some plant material so this first layer of screens that we're pulling out is going to be our least pure it's going to have our most plant material it's our biggest micron screen and most of the thc has actually fallen through this screen so but you can see there we've pulled out a little bit of bubble hash there and it's a darker color hash and then now we're pulling out our second screen and in order to uh save the cannabis that was left on the screen that we didn't wash off we're inverting it carefully and then dipping it back into the next green down into the water that's in that screen and that is to wash the trichomes off into that next screen so now we're removing the second screen out i believe this would be our uh 73 micron screen and we're we're letting the water fall out of that we're not going to squeeze it we're gonna let it fall out and then you can see now that the trichomes that are left there a little lighter color than the first set and there's also more of them and there's a lot less plant material here as you can see compared to the previous hash that came out it's a lot lighter color but again we're rinsing the remaining hashtag we didn't scrape off into the next batch or into the last screen so we make sure our screen is nice and clean and then we've come to our last screen and this is our 25 micron screen and we'll see this is the finest screen and this is going to make sure that pretty much anything left on here that's any thc is going to get trapped in this screen here and as we scrape that up you can see it's pretty easy to collect the cannabis or the thc that's collected there or the hash and it's a nice uh lighter a little more blonde color than the previous two a little bit more pure and you can see that's why those screens are used so that you can get different grades of hash and the next step now a lot of people would use a micro on screen here we didn't have a micron screen we're just using some cheese cloth or a muslin cotton muslin bag here and we're squeezing out the water it's just being pressed out gently with some palm pressure there to press out the water and what's going to be remaining is bubble hash and what we've got here is three different grades of bubble hash depending on the three different screens that we used and and in the end we're actually going to combine all of our hash altogether so i'm just showing you the different screens there for demonstration purposes but if you're only going to use one grade of hash in the end uh there's really no need to have multiple screens you might just use one or two screens in that case but for demonstration purposes we're using multiple screens to show how you'd get different grades of hash and now that we've uh we've gone one run of our canvas you can do this two or three different times or even up to five or more times with each batch of cannabis so this is the second run with the same batch of cannabis just with another run of the water and ice this one actually sat overnight this second run we got a pretty good yield off of it even better than the first and then we even decided to go ahead and run a third run off of the same batch of cannabis and so even after collecting two pretty good batches of bubble hash with it we went ahead and decided to go the third one and even after the third running we're still getting some more hash out of it you can see after the third time the cannabis is getting it looks like a lot like seaweed it's very foamy it get agitates a lot easier and it also gets foams up a lot easier as the last two or three batches were gone but once they pressed out the the phone goes away and you can see that there are three different batches of bubble hash there at different stages of drying out and you can see that the uh the newer batch is much muddier looking uh the batch in the center there is the first batch we did is dried out from overnight this episode of cannabis is brought to you by the roughhouse studios smoke shop selling raw rolling papers accessories vaporizers much more a great process save 10 off everything with the code kind of basic i do hope you enjoyed this episode of canada basics on how to

It's exploded in popularity with claims of treating everything\nfrom insomnia to diabetes. - That's the only thing that would help me with my migraine headaches. - [Narrator] It can be consumed as an oil, applied to skin, or inhaled it as a vapor. We know CBD is a component of marijuana, but it's derived from hemp,\nusually does not contain THC, and won't get you high. The game changer for the\nCBD industry came when President Trump signed a farm bill legalizing hemp cultivation. One prescription drug\ncontaining CBD has been approved for treating two rare forms\nof childhood epilepsy, but the vast majority of\nwhat we know about CBD has been limited to personal experiences and unproven animal studies. - More often than not, things\nthat look good in animals, when you go into humans,\nthose effects aren't there. - [Narrator] According to a\n2018 Harvard Health Blog post, scientists say they still don't know much about how CBD affects the brain or which doses and\ndelivery methods work best. For example, if you put a few drops of CBD under your tongue, you\nmight consume 10 milligrams. But some researchers say you\nwould need 30 times that amount to reach a threshold\nthat can relieve stress. And since CBD products\nare primarily marketed and sold as supplements, the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration doesn't evaluate whether these products\nare safe or effective. That means if you buy a CBD\nproduct, you don't really know how much CBD is actually in the container. There's no denying the\nCBD revolution is upon us and the marketplace is buying in. However, there's still\na lot of TBD about CBD.", "mcDxSon5gCY": "[Music] weed and the controversy is there any permissible use of weed the answer is there is an extract of weed that happens to be non-intoxicating it's a clear liquid known as cbd sometimes it is added into various multivitamins or supplements and sometimes foodstuffs that is permissible because it is not intoxicating at all so that's the cbd in fact it has a lot of health benefits it actually boosts your immune system and can fight certain diseases perhaps the homeopaths might tell you more about it the experts of it if you read up about the benefits of cbd oil and cbd extract of marijuana or weed in arabic known as or in some of the african languages known as subhanallah so there is an extract you can get from it that is non-intoxicating and extremely beneficial that's the cbd but what about the thc well the thc is also an extract of the weed but it happens to be slightly intoxicating sometimes a little bit more does it have any benefits any medicinal benefits my brothers and sisters the medicinal benefits of thc are known you can read up on them you will actually be surprised people have been cured from cancer a lot of people have had their tumors eradicated many people have been cured of epileptic fits that have been happening to them for years on end and that is by the correct use of the thc in extremely small doses together with a disciplined diet but you need to learn about it there is medicinal benefit in the extracts of weed and like i said the cbd no question about it the thc only when absolutely necessary for some of the diseases and you would need to contact a homeopathic doctor or perhaps an expert in weed subhanallah some of the doctors the normal medicinal doctors may not even approve of it they might not even know about it some of them would acknowledge yeah you know it does have some benefit i know of people who have been cured like i said but let me make it clear my brothers and sisters the social smoking of weed is not allowed it's not allowed my brothers and sisters i you know what it does have an element of intoxication and if it's done for social purposes it is totally prohibited the hadith the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam clearly says that which intoxicates you in large quantities even a small quantity of it is prohibited so the social use of it is not allowed medicinal use of it if it is really needed and it has been prescribed by someone who's an expert then yes it may be used so remember this my brothers and sisters i hope i've clarified it spoken about three things the cbd being okay because it's non-intoxicating very beneficial extremely good for your health immune booster but when it comes to the thc you remember it's only administered to those who need it as a medication for some serious sickness or illness or disease cancer some tumors etc it does help to be honest with you it has had that effect on so many people alhamdulillah but once again the social use no not allowed so let's not think oh wow weed is legalized just like cigarettes are legalized alcohol is legalized that is a secular legalization or the legalization in your country that doesn't run by the the rules and regulations of allah so even if it may be legal in your country doesn't mean that from an islamic perspective it is allowed or legal may allah wa ta'ala grant us goodness and understanding and may allah help us all those of you who might be hooked on to it it is still considered a drug islam and get off it inshallah we not not just wean yourself off it but just get off it really to be honest you must try your best to move out of these bad habits because ultimately they would harm you uh i want to say once again that for medicinal purposes it is it does have a scope of permissibility protect us to [Music] you", "wA5wg8JqoDw": "[Music] welcome back to torpy eyes in today's video i'm going to show you how i make skin cream that has thc and cbd in it this cream is amazing for sore muscles dry skin sunburns and any other type of skin irritation that you might have [Music] this mixture of products is pretty simple but does amazing job for the body all these items can be found at a store nearby you're going to need coconut oil aloe vera gel and skin cream i have a lot of muscle pain and dry skin so this mix of products is fast acting and doesn't leave my skin greasy the first step in this process is to infuse your coconut oil with the thc and cbd this can be done in a few different ways i found it to be easiest using a slow cooker you can do it on your stove top using a double boiler if you don't have access to a slow cooker i picked up this slow cooker at walmart for about 15 coconut oil is a great product to use because it's all natural and has little to no order it's one of the best binding agents for cannabis both cannabis and coconut oil are really good for treating inflammation to infuse the coconut oil with thc and cbd you measure out the amount of oil you want to make then measure out how strong you want your final product to be for my mix i want about a half milligram per one milliliter of final product i'll leave my mix amount in the description below simply put the coconut oil into the slow cooker then add one cup of water the water is added to create a volume for the slow cooker so you don't burn the product then add your thc or cbd you can use just thc or just cb or combine them both just like me it's all personal preference i grew the harley quinn vx4 strain a little while back it's a one-to-one ratio strain which gave me both thc and cbd [Music] i leave the coconut oil in the slow cooker on low for three to four hours then it's time to separate the oil from the canops and water i use multiple layers of chew cloth and a fine metal strainer be sure to use a heat resistant container because the oil is pretty hot i always go with a collab [Music] me once you have the oil in the glass bowl i put it into the fridge overnight this not only lets the coconut oil to get hard but it also separates the oil and water you can remove the hard coconut oil out of the bowl and then drain the water out since i use ice water hash instead of cannabis flour you see my coconut oil didn't get much color to it usually when you use bud you'll get a very green end result now that we have our coconut oil infused with the thc and cbd we can go ahead and mix everything else together for the cream i use a cream that i prefer any cream will do though this one also has vitamin e in it and doesn't leave my skin greasy so that's why i chose it [Music] as for the aloe vera gel this is great for reducing pain and soreness reducing the healing time of burns and it also contains vitamin a and c [Music] since our coconut oil is hard we're gonna have to warm it up a bit so it's easier to measure out i just put it into the microwave for a few seconds once i've measured it out to the proper amount i put it into the blender's container and place it back into the fridge for 15 minutes this is to thicken it up since our other two ingredients are a bit thicker than the oil for this mix i used 200 milliliters of the coconut oil and 300 milliliters of the aloe vera gel you can use all-natural rear from a plant but it may not last as long i've never used the plant form so i'm not 100 sure [Music] time to add the lotion this container of lotion is 220 milliliters so i use the entire thing [Music] i'm using a ninja blender i set it on low and let it mix for one minute i take it out of the blender shake it around by hand then put it on low again for another minute if you want you can add essential oils to the mix but i like mine as odorless as possible i like to reuse the lotion container that it came in and also any editor i put into a tupperware [Music] container [Music] if you enjoyed this video or found it at all helpful be sure to hit that like

intelligence experts have been unable to make many definitive statements health authorities can only really say marijuana might do harmful things to the brain but that more research is needed ma vu I Americans according to a recent poll ranked sugar as more harmful than marijuana are they wrong maybe so a new report titled long-term effects of marijuana use on the brain is offering fresh evidence that a chronic users brain undergoes significant structural changes for those who've used marijuana regularly over six to eight years what kinds of changes using MRI scans researchers compared the brains of 48 3-point marijuana users who took the drug on average 11 times per week to those of 62 non users the yellow area on this MRI scan shows the average amount that the grey matter density was diminished in the bilateral orbital frontal cortex of the marijuana users this is the part of the brain that's involved in decision making at the same time the MRI shows the marijuana users have greater activity than the control group in another section of the plane called the forceps miner this is the white matter that connects the brains frontal lobes that means according to researchers the pot smokers have more connections to facilitate communication between these lobes and the more efficient communication makes it more responsive to the environment why would marijuana users have higher connectivity and isn't that a good thing not necessarily the report suggests this part of the brain may be compensating for gray matter losses however the study finds that over years of regular use those increased connections wither away meaning the brain may be losing its ability to compensate for lost gray matter then what happens eluding marijuana scientists not involved in this particular study says these longtime users could be at increased risk to be driven by immediate rewards and not looking for more long-term gratification and may be more vulnerable to mood and anxiety problems the authors of the study admit they found no correlation between an individual's IQ and reduced gray matter in the orbital frontal cortex they don't know whether heavy pot users had less grey matter to begin with making them more prone to using the drug and if so whether marijuana made those structural deficiencies worse yet again the public is told more studies are needed so at this point setting aside the emerging consensus among researchers that pot is harmful to the developing brains of adolescents in places where it's legal do leading scientists think there should be a warning label on marijuana some do here's what crystal is Dahl of the University of wisconsin-milwaukee would have it say high THC marijuana can cause subtle cognitive deficits brain structure abnormalities mood and sleep problems daily use is not recommended not recommended at least until the science becomes more conclusive that's the short answer", "WMNFyC15q-Q": "hey y'all it's Cody from sleep populace and in this video I'm going to introduce you to my favorite CBD products for sleep now a lot of CBD goodies in the market promise to help folks slumber but in my opinion these four are the absolute best now what are they well you'll just have to keep on watching to find out all right first things first let's chat a little bit about what CBD is now if you haven't checked it out yet I highly recommend that you take a peek am i what is CBD video which I'm gonna put right there I think yeah and it goes over what CVD is how it feels the research that's been done into its side effects dosage all things like that basically like it's a full rundown of CBD as a compound but in case you don't have time right now or simply don't want to watch it I will give you a little bit of a breakdown right now but what CBD is so CBD or cannabidiol is a compound found on the flower of the cannabis plant it's one of more than a hundred different compounds or phyto cannabinoids contained on the flower and they range and feel and type but the two most popular ones are probably CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol or THC however unlike THC CBD is not psychoactive and it doesn't trigger hallucinations or intoxication it's usually used in oils creams and pills to treat things like joint pain anxiety poor appetite and even poor sleep I should also mention that it's totally legal to buy and consume hemp derived CBD in all 50 states as long as the product doesn't contain more than 0.3 percent of THC alright now that we've gone over a little bit about what CBD is let's get into my picks for the best CBD products we're falling asleep and I want to start with my absolute favorite CBD product for spalling asleep fast which is the CBD PM tincture from CBD MD now this little baby contains both CBD and melatonin so it is literally designed to send you off to snooze town in a flash and when I tried it myself I found that it pretty much did that within five to ten minutes of taking it I felt totally relaxed and like I was drifting off to Dreamland with ease another thing I liked about this tincture was that I didn't really experience any next state grogginess which is pretty unusual for a melatonin based product so if you're looking to fall asleep super fast and need to get up and go the next day I think this could be a great product for you another good thing about it is that a 500 milligram bottle of the tincture only costs $45 which is pretty affordable when you compare it to other see many products on the market next up is what I find to be the most relaxing CBD oil and that's the American hemp oil from American hemp and I say most relaxing because I found that this oil had a really nice sort of like calming effect all across the body within 15 minutes of taking it I felt like tension in my shoulders was being alleviated my mind was quieted and so it helped me to fall asleep at night for sure but I also found that it was really just nice for lounging around the house reading a book watching TV and when compared to other products that I've tested I found that the effects lasted for a longer time around an hour and an hour and a half so if you're looking for a subtle CBD oil that'll sort of carry you through an afternoon or maybe carry you through your bedroom time routine I would highly recommend this one as I found to be very relaxing however it's like caveat is that a 2,500 milligram bottle of American hemp oil retails for $140 which makes it one of the more expensive ones I've tested next I want to share my favorite CBD oil for general use and that's the CBD premium oil from CBD MD now you'll recognize the brand from the first one I shared with you all for falling asleep fast but this one is different in that there is no melatonin here it is all CBD oil and I like it for general use because it helps me fall asleep at night but I also found that it had a really nice subtle relaxing effect during the day you know if it was like a weekend day and I was just hanging out I could take it go see friends go to the gym you know do errands and I found that it was just a really nice Zen tone I was highly recommended for general use and something else I really like about this oil is that you can choose your flavor so you go on the website and they have like four or five different options so you can choose the flavor that's best for you and something else I like about it is that a seven hundred milligram bottle of the CBD premium oil from CBD MD regionals for seventy dollars which puts it in a nice mid range between the least expensive ones the most expensive ones and finally my absolute favorite value buy has got to be the CBD oil from some soil now here as 600 milligram bottle retails for $30 and a 1200 milligram one retails for $60 so it's definitely more in a budget friendly zone for those of you who want to try CBD but maybe we don't want to fork over more than $100 to try it and even though it's less expensive than some of the option other options on this list I'd say that it's just as good it helps me to fall asleep fast and it made me feel really relaxed during the day so I think it's a great option the only thing I really don't like about the CBD oil from Sun soil are the flavor options and either comes in chocolate mint or cinnamon and personally those just aren't tastes that I like well folks that does it for my guide the best CBD products for sleep for more sleep related content and resources make sure to go to sleep obelisk calm and is subscribe to our YouTube channel until next time happy dreaming", "qsK0IojtJ0k": "I'm gonna need some wine to go with the main that Marcel is preparing but I don't want just any ordinary wine so I'm up here in Northern California to meet up with pack smelly who's gonna show me how to make a cannabis infused wine that I'm gonna bring the dinner so you're actually infusing the wine by putting cannabis flour directly into it yeah the cannabis flour is added at three stages the first stage is fresh flour added to fresh juice pre fermentation and they soak together then we had about two pounds of crushed up flour this year the Blue Dream oh wow so the wine starts fermenting naturally with the cannabis flour for two three weeks and that extracts all of those terpenes and all of the flavor and all of the aroma that you get in the wine fantastic yeah I mean it already smells amazing so this wine is done fermenting and this flour is spent and so the flour pretty much floats to the top we're gonna squeeze out the flour that's been kind of steeping in here like tea and then we'll hop down here we'll open the bottom valve and we'll just drain it right out how exactly does the THC get in there the alcohol in the wine is what is extracting this THC I've heard of wine being infused with cannabis where they put in some kind of cannabis concentrate or something into it but this is clearly different than that it's like the flowers are fermenting with the wine for sure the terpenes and the flavor are all being extracted from the fermentation for me as a purist there's just something that seems very right about having the flower actually fermenting in the wine it just seems that you're really getting all of those terpenes that you don't get from just adding the tincture now that this has been drained off of the spent flower that it's been fermenting on for the last couple of weeks we're gonna take the same cured cannabis flower and add some of this to the clean wine just to add more flavor and more THC go ahead and like grind it up between your hands and so this aging process in the kegs takes about 4 to 5 months for everything to settle out of the wine we then rack that clean and then we stick it into a bottle and we got we wine then we got we learned right away you smell that fresh cannabis flower fermented with the wine [Music] Oh", "XHcIX8pKj8w": "[Music] i have to come on here and say this again because it's a couple days later but these are so good i had no idea how much i was gonna like them i'm usually not a huge chocolate strawberry person but with the cookies on them oh my god you guys they're amazing what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you guys how to make chocolate covered strawberry milks they look like nugs but they aren't nuts it's true um so yeah these don't include any um weed but i am using coconut oil on them so if you want to swap the coconut oil for something else i mean to each their own you can do whatever you like but yeah these are really easy to make i think you guys are going to like them let's get to the recipes so here's my strawberries they're not the best strawberries i've ever seen um for a couple reasons one i can't find strawberries for some reason i finally found some and as soon as i saw them i went to the store my eyes were like zoomed like right into them i like booked it it was the last little container of them yeah they're not that good but and then they've been sitting in my fridge for like three or four days i'm needing to film this video but if you watch my last video where i was like crying and stuff i just i wasn't feeling the best this weekend and i wasn't really in a place to be filming a video i don't really like filming videos unless i'm like feeling good um but yeah i'm feeling good now so um let's make these chocolate covered strawberries so the first thing you need to do is wash and dry your strawberries i did this yesterday well because i hadn't intentions to make this video yesterday but you want to watch enjoy them because if they have moisture on them they're not going to last very well so this is like very very crucial because no matter how good you do all the other steps because moisture on your strawberries they won't turn out well so you need to make sure they're nice nicely dried to make these all you're going to need is some golden oreos or cookies that look like this some strawberries chocolate i'm using chocolate chips but you could use nitro chocolate and some green food coloring and maybe some coconut oil if you want we're going to crush our oreos to make the outside coating for the strawberries um you don't have to use uh oreos you could use any sort of cookie that has this type of color so there's lots of cookies like that and you can do this we're gonna crush them and you could do it in a bag you could do it in a blender i have a food processor so i'm gonna use that but um like i said you could use many different things to crush them and pour that in there okay now we're going to color them and i have a few different food colorings i have like different shades of green um and i have some yellow if i want to like kind of play around with it but i feel like you can just whatever you want right i think i'm gonna do this moss green that looks like it'll be good so i'm gonna color most of this green and then i'm gonna color a little bit of purple to get that um accurate nut looking if you don't have purple or you don't have what is it that makes purple blue and red makes purple i think i'm not sure you can look up if you don't have things to make purple you could also use regular oreos like the blackish brown oreos to kind of get that contrast of color or you could just do green and just do different shades of it you don't need much of the purple so i'm just gonna set aside a little bit of um some of these to color people and then these ones we're going to color different colors of green or different shades of green okay i'm thinking this gel food coloring is going to be too difficult to use that's going to be a hassle to color that all so let's use the liquid thank god i have that on hand and i could have done this in the um food press processor or blend or whatever but food coloring oh my goodness i don't want to get food coloring everything because i make a mess with food coloring but you could do it in there i feel like this purple is not going to be fun to get to mix i feel like i might have to microwave this one so that um the gel food coloring can be a little tricky to get to mix just what i keep at home so i mean i would recommend not using gel for coloring and just use regular food coloring okay i'm just gonna put those in the microwave quickly because it's just not mixing now we can get to the actual strawberries so like i said i'm eating chocolate chips you could use a nicer chocolate but this is just what i chose so you can do this over a double boiler i'm going to use a microwave i know you guys love when i use the microwave just kidding if you're new everybody here they hate when i use my kids like why did you use microwave i just i like the microwave okay i'm gonna need more chocolate than that so this is we're gonna add the coconut oil now you can use whatever coconut oil you like if you know what i mean but um i'm just using this one and this is to make it easier to dip so it doesn't like um be so like thick and also keeps it since we're microwaving it it's going to keep it liquidier so that i don't have to constantly re-melt it whereas like if you're keeping the chocolate over a double boiler you aren't really going to need to have to worry about it needing to remelt but i always add a little bit of oil to my chocolate when i'm dipping it in anything and the amount is not super important this is like it's like a little bit less than a tablespoon and i have a cup of chocolate chips here but i don't follow a certain ratio it's just that's just what i'm using here so i'm gonna go microwave that and i'll be right back okay so i melted the chocolate in the microwave and it's important when you melt chocolate in the microwave but you do it in increments of like 10 15 20 seconds you just don't want to put it in there for like a whole minute and then take it out because it'll burn into this wall so just do it for a little bit of time stir it a little by time stir it and you can use white chocolate candy melts whatever it doesn't matter when you're dipping them you can use a toothpick you can use your fingers i'm going to be using my fingers to just me eating them um or i'll try both we'll see what works better and i just have some parchment paper here that i'm gonna line them on and i'm using roomish coldish temperature um strawberries again don't judge my not so good looking strawberries they've been sitting around for a while okay so you'll dip it in chocolate and then you can either wait for the excess to drip off or you can just like scrape it off considering we're covering it in this it doesn't really matter if it looks perfect but i don't like too much chocolate on it because then it's just like too much chocolate not enough strawberry but don't get me wrong like a lot of chocolate but trust me you're going to be eating a lot of chocolate when you're eating these so i like to get as much as i can off and then we're just going to i feel like this toothpick is going to fall off okay so there's the first one yeah that toothpick is not so secure i'm just gonna set it on my tray there i feel like the toothpicks are kind of pointless i'm gonna try without get a bit of a better grip here just had the camera over here turned off i thought it was wrong but i mean i'm sure you guys can kind of see what i'm doing but let's just now i have it back on here and that's kind of how they look let me show you guys close up although i'll show you guys again after and i kind of like when they look a little bit messy because it makes them look a little bit more i don't know real instead of like a perfect strawberry like having those little like bumps on them and it looks kind of nice and i'm sure you guys have noticed the little hearts in the background that's because i thought this would be a super cute um idea for valentine's day and i tried so hard to try and find a heart-shaped box because i thought these would be so cute um if you put them in like these and then put them into a heart-shaped box just like chocolate but i could not find a heart-shaped box i did not look that hard i also didn't want to like just buy a heart-shaped box like just for the video to like not use because i'm not giving these to anyone they are for me my sister will probably eat them together i think this one's going to look nice it's a nice little shape you know we might not actually need more chocolate i thought we were going to but it looks like this should be enough these stems are a little rough looking since i've like took so long to get to this video but it kind of kind of goes with the the look maybe i don't know [Music] yeah see i kind of have a blob of chocolate on this one so that's just me being lazy don't get lazy but with these ones you can kind of like fix them by just adding more of this cookie on it and because like i said they don't have to look perfect and almost not looking perfect kind of like makes them look more real that's okay [Music] so yeah they are pretty much done this is all you have to do and then you um if you want to eat them right away you can put them in the fridge for about 10 minutes let them set um but otherwise they're actually best uh best served or best stored room temperature so you can leave them in at like a coolish room temperature um and yeah you can put them in the fridge if you like but they will sweat in the fridge they have to be careful with that i think i'm gonna put mine in these little liners and that's it guys they're done they're so easy to make they turned out so cute i think they're adorable well mine still need to cool so they're not um like hardened yet but yes i think they look beautiful and very happy with them they're so cute i'm gonna try eating one now and see how it tastes i just have to take my invisalign out first i don't actually know if i'm gonna like them because honestly i don't know if i like the idea of cookies on the outside of strawberries like i like cookies but i don't know if i like it together so let's find out we'll see i like cookies on strawberries they're actually really really good i think you're gonna be a little bit better in the fridge i think i put a little bit too much coconut oil in the chocolate because i can kind of taste the coconut oil maybe use a little bit less it's really just for smoothing out the chocolate but yeah they're delicious thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thank you guys so much for watching i hope you all have a wonderful day and valentine's day if you're watching this around that time thank you guys bye [Music] you", "sOPTCsoAPXw": "what's up everybody today we're going to be making cannabis hard candy using canned butter and kennel oil so let's get into it all right guys so before we get into the video i just wanted to give you guys some information so so in this video i'm going to make a large batch of heart candy but what i'm going to do is divide the ingredients into two different pots however since i'm not actually accurately measuring the ingredient one pot is going to have more than the other one so it's not going to be equally divided so when i add my jello at first it didn't turn out right but overall it did so just for my beginners use this recipe for only one type of method don't do it the way i did it so i just wanted to let you guys know that but let's get into the video so the ingredients to make my cannabis hard candy would be lecithin so we will need the lecithin to help bind all the ingredients together so i'm using one teaspoon per recipe next we're gonna be using two third cups of light corn syrup two cups of sugar i'm gonna be using one pack of jello i'm gonna be using blueberry jello and raspberry jello next we will need our water we're going to be using one cup of water also you will need a candy thermometer so we're going to be using a quarter cup of peanut butter for one batch of our hard candy and i'm going to be using a quarter cup of can oil for the second batch of hard candy make sure your candle butter is at room temperature before making your hurricane but let's get into it all right guys so now what we're going to do is measure out our can of butter [Music] now i'm just going to add this to my container so now i'm going to measure out our kennel oil [Music] so this can of oil was made with 14 grams of blue drink all right guys so once you have all of your ingredients the next step would be to turn your stove on now the temperature that i'm going to be using is like medium heat i'm not going to turn it on high so i have two parts on my stove and that's on purpose so i'm going to be using one pot to make the hard candy but once i finish making a hard candy i'm going to add some of that mix into this pot here so i can add my kennel oil so you don't have to add your peanut butter or your kindle oil mix it after your ingredients reach the 300 mark so just keep that in mind let's get into it all right guys turn your stove on medium so that's high right there i'm not going to do that i'm going to do like right here so like medium to high heat so add your sugar then the water [Music] and then your syrup while you're mixing your ingredients just look on the side sometimes there's going to be sugar crystals that's going to form on the side of your pan just remember to brush the sugar crystal that may form on the side of your pot now it's boiling so i'm not going to miss it anymore now i'm going to add my thermometer all right guys so my temperature is getting closer to 260 degrees which is perfect so at any point now it's going to shoot up to 300 degrees hopefully i can get this on camera but we'll see all right guys so we're getting close to it so this way was perfect so this time didn't shoot up like it would usually do i guess because of the temperature that i got it on once it gets to about like three or five i'm gonna turn off the stove and add a portion of my mix to the other pot it's over 300 degrees so now i'm going to turn off my stove and add a portion of the ingredients to the other pot let's go ahead and turn off our stove [Music] now we add our jello to the mix [Music] now i'm going to add our kennel oil [Music] and our peanut butter [Music] now i'm going to add lecithin [Music] so [Music] all right guys so i had to put this back on the stove to mail the ingredients so what happened is when i split the ingredients from one pot to the other obviously i didn't split it equally so this one here had way more jello didn't have the ingredients so it was really really dry so i put this back on the stove just to give it more of a liquid base so now what we're going to do is now we're going to add this to the mode so let's get into it so now i'm going to add my mix to this mold right here [Music] now i'm just going to pour the rash onto this mat right here [Music] do i'm gonna put this in the fridge for about three hours and yeah i know right now it don't look that good but don't worry it's gonna come out fine all right guys so we've been about three hours so now my hard candy is now hard so now what i'm going to do is break the hard candy into small pieces and remove the other hard candy from the candy mold so let's get into it [Music] [Music] i'm just going to use a knife to break my card candy [Music] so [Music] [Music] all right guys my cannabis heart candy is now done thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace [Music] you", "uz4hfUiGDY8": "[Music] hey it's mad at roughout studios now welcome to cannabase ecstatic oak shatter tabs and wax today we're going to look at several ways to smoke shatter wax and rosin along with the pros and cons of dab rigs and nails dab pins vaporizers emails and nectar collectors you can find all these products and more at the wizard puff com online head shop and you can save money with the code roughhouse I'd like to thank wizard puffs for sponsoring this video perhaps the og of ways to do dabs is the trusty dab or oil rig fitted with the titanium nail or quartz banger and is truly one of the most effective ways to do a dab you'll get a huge hit instantly and usually get the most out of your wax - as it's fully vaporized in seconds dab rigs might be one of the most effective ways of doing dabs but there are drawbacks such as needing a torch and gas to heat the nails and also a recovery time to reheat it now for the next tab also when you introduce open flame and exposed high heat into the process you also sacrifice safety to some degree dad pens on the other hand are probably one of the safest ways to do dabs these types of pens usually use quartz ceramic or metal coils to heat the wax enclosed inside of a sealed glass or metal cap these types of pens can be effective and give big hits but usually will take several puffs to smoke the same amount of wax as doing a single dab off of a nail another common drawbacks to wax pans is that the unvailed wax builds up and they require constant cleaning to keep functioning properly some vaporizers that are made for dry herb can also be used to vaporize wax to these devices usually provide a cup or pod that inserts into the dry herb heating chamber to vaporize the wax these types of devices can be very convenient but the cons are that they often do a mediocre job of vaporizing wax as they lack the heat that's required and the small pods can be cumbersome and leaky so it can be hard to keep the heating chamber clean for dry herb nectar collectors or vacuum systems could be considered the Dark Horse of DAB methods these types of devices use a heated tip on the end of a handheld device that you dip directly into the wax there are both electric collectors as well as those requiring external heat sources such as a torch one big advantage of the collector type rig is that you can get huge hits when you're dipping the tip directly into the wax but they can have a bit of a learning curve and a little bit awkward to use perhaps the biggest favourite among divers is the email emails are very similar to the standard titanium nail on an oil rig with one key difference the emails have an electronic control center to set a precise temperature and a heating element that will keep the nail continuously heated and ready for a dab the pros of emails are that it's ready for a DAB any time that it's on and you can set to precise temperatures and you also you can do back-to-back dabs without having to reheat the nail they may also arguably be safer than using open flames and are clearly more convenient than needing a secondary heating torch cons are that they usually require a power source to operate so it may not be as portable as the other methods and it's also very convenient to use so you might find yourself smoking through your wax very quickly and passing out on the couch very early whichever method you choose dabbing wax or rosin so long as it's free of impurities is actually healthier than smoking cannabis flowers by not smoking or vaporizing the plant materials you are clearly putting less unnecessary chemicals into your body and by taking concentrated doses you're required to smoke less frequently not to mention that the time it takes to do it to have is far quicker than the time it takes to smoke a joint bulb or especially a blunt but if you're an everyday diver like myself a nice email setup likely be the way to go but if you only occasionally dabber prefer to vaporize then a three-in-one vape pen that does wax too might be satisfactory or any or an inexpensive wax pen might be even better or perfect for the beginner just looking to dabble in wax shatters and rosin concentrates again I'd like to thank the guys at wizard puff for sponsoring this video you can save money on a lots of the products that you saw in this video with a code roughhouse and wizard puff comm I hope you enjoyed this video on how to smoke shatter tabs and wax if you did please visit Rafal

in London, and I'm about to meet\na guy named Hidrow. He's an underground\nweed-concentrates maker who treated his own cancer\nwith medical marijuana, and now supplies\nJohn's neediest clients with serious,\nhigh-potency cannabis oil. \u266a\u266a Always have one of these. Andavolu: Okay, good.\n[ Chuckles ] So, Hidrow,\ncan you take me through the cannabis medicines\nthat you make, and, like,\nhow you make them? Yeah, I'll give you\na first run out, and this is trim and leaf and a little bit\nof bud and stuff. Where do you get this trim from?\nWho gives it to you? Everybody's got a friend\nwho grows a little something, and, you know,\nthey throw it away, so I say \"Bring it to me. That, what you're throwing away,\nto me, is a lifesaver, and to other people can be\na lifesaver, you know?\" And when you say \"they,\"\nyou mean, like, people who are basically\nselling weed illegally. Yeah. Some of them are\nreally nice people. Some of them are\nvery horrible people. Some of them are --\nI would like to see them out of the business\ncompletely, because -- What do you mean,\nthey're \"horrible people\"? Well, they're not nice. They're criminals.\n[ Laughs ] You know,\nthey actually are criminals. [ Twisting cap ] After this,\nwe would take this and we literally have the most\ndangerous part of the process, which is where we have\nto actually decarboxinate it. You're putting a flammable\nsubstance next to heat source. Yeah -- never smart. You know, I --\nI mean, like, honestly -- Like, I'm pretty nervous\ndoing this inside. Um, stick your mask on,\nplease. -Because...\n-Um... What -- What can go wrong\nif this goes -- Um, you could burn down\na whole building. You could kill yourself.\nIt's extremely dangerous. All right, I'm actually\nvery nervous about this. [ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a I'll just take off my mask. Yeah, that's done.\nThat's just, uh, oil. Ooh, you can really\nsmell it, though. We don't charge. It's not about charging,\nyou know? How much\ndo you give away? Every week, about 20,000. 20,000 pounds? -Yeah.\n-Wow. But for someone, that could be, like,\n5 to 10 days of relief. And this is why we're -- we're\nactually fighting our government for the right\nfor medical access, because it shouldn't be\npeople like me, sitting in a dank,\nlittle house, risking my life\nand my -- my freedom. to produce\nhigh-potency cannabis oil, I wanted to know who was using\nthis back-alley medicine. So I'm joining John\nas he consults with a new patient,\nPaul Webster Hughes -- a single father of two\nand stroke survivor. Hello.\nGood evening, John. I'm Paul.\nIt's a pleasure to meet you. Hello, Paul.\nVery nice to meet you. Can you step aboard?\nI'm -- I'm good. Thank you. \u266a\u266a I've just given cannabis\nin the privacy of my own home. Thank you very much. And, uh,\nthat's a 1:1 strain, which is 15% CBD\nand 15% THC. There's no\nrecommended dosage, because there isn't\nany medical data on how we're to do this.\nOkay. But, really,\nwhat I'd say of anyone is try a very, very, very\nsmall amount. Just take -- even just, like,\na pinhead to start with until you just\nget used to it. No need to worry about money,\n'cause that's what we do. We give out\nfree cannabis oil.\nWell, thank you very much. Because Paul lacks\nregular, safe access to medical marijuana, he uses a combination of medical oil and street weed to treat the symptoms\nof his stroke at his home in North Yorkshire. [ Birds chirping ] Andavolu: So, Paul, if you could\nsort of take me through -- What happened to you? 2005 --\nI'm living in Thailand, and I went out\nto my wife's village. Went swimming\nin the morning, and later that morning,\nI just fell, and I've got videos --\nbizarre, coincidental. Paul: Now, while you're\nplaying around on there... [ Woman gasps ] -It's okay.\n-There's no blood. [ Child crying ]\nOkay... And I was paralyzed\non the left side of my body. [ Slurring ]\nDo you need any... [ Woman speaking indistinctly,\nchild crying ] Woman: Hey. [ Crying continues ] Paul:\nAnd for the next six months,\nI was carried to the toilet. I had about 10% of my left body,\nat that point. I've had a headache\nfor 11 years.\nWow. Can you imagine having\na headache for 4,100 days? -Straight?\n-Straight -- absolutely. I never get a break. Imagine big, rolling\nboulders or marbles crashing\noff each other. It's like a tightening\nof a skull cap on my head. Did doctors sort of\nprescribe you anything to sort of help?\nOh, sure. Yeah, I-I've been on\npretty much all the medications that they're allowed\nto give me. I was on 14 pills a day\nat one point. So, on these pills, physically,\nit closed me down, and a couple of them depress you\nenough to kill you. This last Christmas,\nI decided no -- no more. And, uh, that's when\nI started, uh, smoking, because it dulled\nthe pain. \u266a\u266a It allows me to do the things\nthat I must do. It gives me potential. The pain's still there,\nbut it's in a bubble. But it's like\nthere's an extra layer between me and my pain. My kids\ndon't see me smoke. I only smoke\nin my room. I don't smoke anywhere else\nin the house. I'm a single dad.\nMy kids come first. Hello, you. -What'd you doin'?\n-Hi. There's word\nfor your brother you'll learn\nwhen you're older -- seven girlfriends,\nI mean... He's a player! Okay, that's one way\nof putting it. Yeah, sure. All right,\nhere's the view -- pizza. Can you bang it on?\nYou can do that, can't you, huh?\nMm-hmm. All right, homework --\nWhat about French?\nI got my history. What was your history like? 64%. 64%. -Yeah.\n-Well done, you. -Pizza's ready!\n-Okay. Thank you, sir. Please.\nYou're very welcome. Oh, thank you very much. Meat Feast or pepperoni? I think it's Meat Feast,\none of your favorites. -Meat Feast.\n-Looks like it's Meat Feast. Do you guys sort of,\nlike, realize that, like, the marijuana\nthat your dad's smoking is still, like,\ntechnically illegal? Yeah, we do. How does that make you feel?\nLike, what... Uh... Kind of scared that\nhe's gonna get caught. Paul: If I thought there\nwould be a situation where our life\nwould be threatened, I wouldn't smoke.\nMm-hmm. That's just\nblack and white. They're more important to me\nthan, uh -- than anything. [ Speaks indistinctly ] Ooh.\nHey, you okay? Yes, yes. Is it sort of scary\nto think that he has to do something that's illegal to,\nlike, feel better? If it's helping him,\nI allow it. But if he's doing it\nfor no reason, really, I would feel\nkind of upset. Right. But it doesn't seem like\nhe's doing it for no reason. It seems like\nit helps him a lot, right?\nMm-hmm. Well, she hates smoking --\nI think that's the main thing. And she's got a pretty good\nsense of values. And to her, whatever\nshe sees in the world, says pot's bad. And she thinks\nin black and white. And now we give her\nthis conundrum that daddy needs it. It kind of throws a bit\nof a wobbly at her, you know? Mm-hmm. So she's trying very hard\nto reconcile that. We had a bit of a cry together\nand a cuddle upstairs, and, uh, she'll be okay. I mean, it's hard, right?\nAnd it's -- It's lousy. I have to live a lie,\nand no parent, especially when you've got\nabsolute love for your kids, wants to do that. \u266a\u266a I've come\nto Limehouse Marina in London to see John on the final leg\nof his journey. Today he's gonna take\nhis tiny, little canal boat into the mighty River Thames\nto let his cannabis banner fly and to drum up support\nfor marijuana reform right in front of Parliament. What we've got here are\nsome CBD-rich cannabis seeds. They're very low in THCs. I'm gonna pop them\nin the balloon. Okay. [ Helium hissing ] We are gonna tie some notes\nto them from patients -- medicinal-cannabis patients\nacross the UK, and we're gonna send those\nup into the sky and hope they reach\ncommunities across Albion. Amazing. [ Hissing continues ] So, what do you reckon the day's\ngonna be like for you? Uh, I am...\nI mean,\nyou're taking a small boat into big old body of water. It's gonna be a big old\nbody of water out there, be nice and choppy. How is it different from the small canals\nthat you go in? Uh, it's tidal,\nso it's pretty dangerous. Do you think the boat's\ngonna handle it? The boat is gonna handle it,\nmy friend. We do not like pessimism...\nOkay. Right on. ...anywhere near my boat.\n[ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a [ Boat motor humming ] All right, John!\nSee you, man! Goodbye, Krishna.\nGood luck. Namaste. Whoo-whoo!\nWhoo-whoo! [ Laughs ] That's the little barge\nthat could. \u266a\u266a [ Crowd cheering ] It's to legalize\ncannabis in London. [ Cheering continues ] -Hey, how's it going?\n-Nice to meet you, man. Good to meet you.\nHey, man. I'm Krishna. You guys excited? \u266a\u266a [ Siren wailing ] Hey, Paul. -Krishna, how are you?\n-How's it going, man? Aw, it's good to see you. -What a great event.\n-I know. How are you feeling --\nYou excited? I'm very enthused\nand excited about it. It's not just talk. These are real people\ncoming out and demonstrating\nthe reality they believe in. And that's got to make a\ndifference, Krishna, in the end. And what's it like being sort of\nbeing amongst this group of, like,\nother like-minded people? -Brothers. Family.\n-You think so? -Yeah.\n-Amazing. They're just be so open\nand honest about it. I asked them, did they feel\nat all self-conscious? Hell no.\n[ Laughs ] You know, this is what\nthey believe and what they do. Yeah, people are just, like,\nsmoking weed next to the Thames, next to Parliament. The English are\nvery law-abiding. But I think now that we're starting to see\na movement that's gonna\ngive us a change. And this is the mother\nof Parliaments. If it can't start here... -This is where it starts.\n-This is where it starts. \u266a\u266a Andavolu:\nAll right, it looks like he's just about to go\nunder Westminster Bridge, and he's just gonna pop out right in front of the Houses\nof Parliament and Big Ben. I saw him for just this little\nbit right on the other side, and he looked really tiny. Like, the boat was small. And -- Oh, look! You can\njust see him right there. He's coming in. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] He's releasing the balloons. [ Laughs ] Amazing. Man: Go on, John!\nKeep going! Get those seeds!\nYou tell Cameron! [ Cheering continues ] Hey, John!\nHey, John! He gave the wave!\n[ Laughs ] He waved at us. And he looks so small\ncompared to that building. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] \u266a\u266a As an American,\ncoming to the UK and seeing how medical-marijuana\npatients are faring -- In one way, it's a little\ndispiriting to see that they have to improvise and sort of do\nthis underground stuff to get what they think is\nmedicine that's gonna help them. But another way -- I'm seeing\nsomething sort of special. The people I met here\nare kind of filling in the gaps. Guys like John,\nlike Paul, like Hidrow, who are making real sacrifices\nin order to help people -- Robin Hoods of sorts -- they're forming these kind of\nad hoc underground communities, taking weed\nfrom the black market, making it into oil\nand medicine, and then giving it\nto the needy. That's kind of\na beautiful thing. That sort of, like,\nmodel of compassion is something I think\nthat the world can learn from. What I've seen in the U.S. is that legal weed\ncan equal money. But here in the UK, it seems like illegal weed\nequals compassion. And what's cool\nis that compassion is free. \u266a\u266a", "fYMCA_Tg_vk": "Welcome to Endoca's beautiful organic\ncannabis fields. Come I'll show you Well, in order to make a good cannabis extract\nyou need good starting plant material. In my hand I have a cannabis plant it\nsmells fantastic. In order to make a nice extract you need to obviously dry the\nplant material first. Come let's go to the lab I'll show you how to make an\nextract. Welcome to Endoca. My name is Henry Vincente and today I will show you\nhow to cannabis extraction using ethanol We will use cannabis material which is\nthe leaves and the flowers all in one Very important to use organic so that you\nknow there is nothing inside that can harm you. There are over 4,000 different\nvarieties of cannabis now the one I chose has a lot of CBD inside. You could\napply the same method or what kind of cannabinoid eschews so called ethanol\ntake a ball put the plant material inside so the process has to be very\nfast. You don't want the ethanol to touch the plant material to a long time. If it\ndoes you get a lot of other stuff inside which you don't want. You just use enough\nethanol to cover so that we can separate the plant material from the cannabinoids. You need to be fast in this process because we can only stir for three\nminutes so I use a plastic spoon. You don't use mechanical devices because you\ndon't want to create a spark. If I create a spark now everything will burn. You mix\nwell then we have to separate the ethanol from the plant material. I do\nsimply by taking a sieve and put it in another Bowl. It can drip a little bit\nyou know there's still some alcohol left This was the first filtration now we're\ngoing to do the second filtration in order to remove the plant material you\nhave left, and we do that by using a simple coffee machine\nIt can heat your material and it can filtrate and we start with the\nfiltration part coffee filter, take your spoon you take now the material on the liquid\nand you pour it into the filter paper and you see the process starts. In order\nto accelerate the process we change the paper, every time a single filtration has\noccurred if you have more material you just continue until you don't have any\nmore, and like this and it's dripping beautifully. Now it's time to cook so\nwhen you cook at home you can use many different things I have here an example\nof a rice cooker which works fine a pot and a heating device works also fine and\na water distiller. Now my favorite is the water distiller because if you cook with\nany of these methods we need a cleanroom box like this for those of you who\ndoesn't have a box like this you can cook outside but to make it all easier\nlet's use the water distiller. Now this is the process where we separate the\nethanol from the cannabinoids. The time it will take for the full separation\ndepends of course of how much material you put inside I use a bowl to collect\nthe pure ethanol that's going to come out here because you can you reuse it\nagain and again we give it some juice and we wait so now the question is when\nto stop I can see I have 80% of my original ethanol volume so that's\nindication that it's time to see what's going on inside you open the lid slowly\nand look inside and you can see that is very little material in my case this is\nthe time to stop just to be sure not to breathe it here we go and be careful\nwhen you pour because there's very little material you don't want to lose\nit and now I'm going to show you the final step using the coffee machine what\nwe have to do is remove the remaining ethanol from our extract put it on the\nheating device turn it on and we wait best is to wait for 24 hours so that\nyou're sure that no ethanol is left I already did this and as you can see from\nall the work with it we have very little material the final test is a quality\ntest we do it by using a paperclip dipping it into the material and you use\na lighter you light it fast and see what happens if there is a spark you know there is \nstill ethanol left so you can see comparison see it's burning then you\nneed to put it back on the heater but in our case it was well done. To make a\ncannabis extract at home you need a lighter\nfilter coffee machine some small bowls, two bowls\nsieve plastic spoon coffee filters alcohol cannabis. Put the cannabis into\nthe bowl cover with cold alcohol steer three minutes with plastic spoon filter\nthe alcohol through the sieve filter again through the coffee filter it still\nuntil 80 percent of the initial alcohol volume is gone pour into a small ball\nhit the small ball with the coffee machine for 24 hours to remove the\nremaining alcohol. To check if there is any remaining alcohol use a small spoon\nand the lighter if there is any remaining alcohol the product will\nproduce sparks when burning with a lighter keep heating until you don't get\nany sparks anymore Enjoy your cannabis extract Stay tuned\nnext time I'm going to show you how to purify the extract and turn it into pure\ncannabinoids in my hand is 99% CBD beautiful

together some uh information here from youtube for the people who have joined the drawing get this over here on youtube and find my community page here so i can find out who all is interested a little delay there while i get this thing rocking here trying to figure out what the hell is going on let's see hand roller veterans here we go looks like we got a few people who are interested so let's see we got a few folks let me just grab them off the page here looks like there's only like six people one of them is getting one automatically because he is a stock exchange member let's go over here to the notepad and do a new notepad and paste this [ __ ] in and then collect these up growth to blow is one of them the curiosity palette says that he's wanting to try it james randall asked a question but didn't indicate that he wanted to get some so now i don't know if james wants to be part of it or not we'll leave him in there if he wins it and he doesn't want it we'll go ahead and give it to somebody else chris garcia says he's ready to try some mark mitchell and jade growers g is getting one automatically because he is a no guaranteed stock exchange member a major participant he has sent me a bunch of different seeds as a matter of fact i'm hoping that i have taken care of you already jd yes so give a shout if i haven't let me know we will definitely take care of business no [ __ ] around so let's see without further ado we got these five names i'm gonna pop over to the new greed seeds website here and pull up the spinner wants to restart firefox no thank you not right now let's pull up this wheel spinner should already be configured for me no it's not but it doesn't really matter we're just going to spin a couple of names here and i'm going to select a couple of names let's see first things first i close out these ads i wish you guys could see this but i know you can't why is that tagging every goddamn thing what is going on oh wants me to click okay on this [ __ ] cookies thing i think that all right so we just got five people we got grow to blow the curiosity palette james randall chris garcia and mark mitchell i'm gonna give away two bottles this is for testing purposes so i'm really expecting some feedback from you guys again this is a new batch of colloidal silver that i've made it is not as brown as it usually is and it's actually a little more cloudy so i'm curious about what that's all about i'm using distilled water i'm not sure normally i use a little bit of salt i've used some mineralized salts this time so it may that may be what the uh the deal is uh so anyway let's go ahead and shuffle it a couple of times and i'm going to spin it and the first winner is the guy wasn't sure who wanted some james randall okay so we'll pull him off there now we got four people to choose from and i'm gonna kick this around one more time and it looks like grow to blow has won the second bottle so grow to blow and uh the other one let's see who was that again where's my note there it is so james randall and grow to blow are the two winners uh gentlemen send me your contact information i'm going to need that as soon as possible i'll see who's still live streaming you got a few people oh my gosh you got a bunch of people in here james scanlon made his own all right well done and the minerals in the salt is basically it's a it's a grow solution that i use uh for flowering so merry christmas everyone it has been a good day i actually had to work today working from home uh and so i was chilling all afternoon so uh hope everyone had a wonderful safe and happy holiday season our holiday today and uh we're gonna be looking forward to that drawing on new year's day and sorry if you guys missed out on the giveaway for the for the bottle like i said i wanted to put this in somebody's hands right away there will be some bottles available on uh no great seed site right now uh i think it's still out there but i actually don't have any bottles available like say i'm waiting for some feedback on the testing of this knit last solution because it didn't come out the same as it normally does so what do you do oh no don i hope your heat comes back on sometime soon brother and the solution color like i say is cloudy and parts per mineral parts per million rather really you guys can't uh easily determine parts per million in a colloidal silver solution because the electrical nature of the solution ppm meter that i would normally use for like hydroponic solutions just straight up does not work does not tell me uh all i can tell you is it's a bunch um when i run uh 19 volts at three amps through these two silver bars in my distilled solution for about four hours normally the water turns uh a medium brown i wouldn't say like beer but it's more like uh i don't know i don't know how to describe it rather than describe it i'll get it out hold on so this is my last batch that i made it almost looks as dark as uh some of the solutions that i make with the uh when i recently reduced the um hash oil that i was making when i distilled up the alcohol from it so that's how dark that is this is this is last year's batch and i'm almost out of this and i don't know how viable this has been exposed to a lot of light usually in a cabinet and the batch that i just made did not come out quite as dark brown and like i say it looks a little cloudier this had an eighth of a teaspoon of mineral salts added to it uh again fertilizer solution something you would normally spray on your plant anyhow but it didn't come out as dark as i'd normally expect i may run it for a little while longer it may be because of the salts that i use normally i just use regular sodium so any other questions guys laser test huh you know if i had that kind of equipment three nine volt batteries hooked together pure silver clips silver jewelry wire time soaking distilled water shining a laser through nano nano silver versus distilled water i'd have to look into that to see uh what that would what what all that would entail and what it would mean what the results would mean what it would look like i have to do a little more research on that like i say i'm looking for just raw results at this point i'm going to send out some bottles see guys test it please post your results back either here or on your own channel and just let me know so that i can you know let everybody know excellent well that's good feedback james that's that's really good stuff guys i appreciate you i'm gonna be back to i'm gonna go over here and do some dabs and um peace out we'll see you guys soon nine to ten nine of 10 10 germinated yeah my seed the seed vault is uh doing pretty well and i really haven't had any complaints from uh from anybody who's managed to get them to germinate have had some people with germination problems hell i've had germination problems lately uh i think it's because it's cold though so and four of nine were female don

much about thce liquids and hey drew can you make a video about thc e-liquids hey man do you know there's like loads of sketchy thc e-liquid going about so today i thought i'd make a video about why you should sort of stay clear of thc e-liquid now quickly before we get into this video quick message from our sponsor of the day the goods yo the goods have been such an amazing sponsor of the channel so it's always good to have them back on here and yo they have some of the most amazing cbd vapes that you could ever imagine and they've got a bunch of new flavors recently i'm super super hyped to try this draw on honor because everyone's been telling me that's dank and i haven't tried it yet i'm waiting for it to arrive so hopefully in the next video it should have arrived so i can give you guys my thoughts on it but for the time being if you want to check out the goods the link for them will be in the pinned comment down below so i get messages all the time saying something along the lines of hey drew do you know about these fake thc carts going about hey drew do you know about these thc carts with spice in them so i thought i'd make a whole video just going through my thoughts on sort of these comments and explain to you guys what i think and how you can avoid stuff and just stuff to keep in mind in the future really so if you don't know about this this has been a thing for a very long time all the way back since like 2014. these vapes started popping up which were basically like spice vapes they'd be sold online on the internet as something called sea liquid and basically it's just like synthetics in a vape and then basically selling it as a legal high it's basically legal high but as a vape so these have been around for a long time and they're really not something that you ever want to come in contact with because if you do end up coming into contact with it you do end up smoking some of it it will not be a nice experience these chemicals that they put inside those vapes are insanely strong and they're not safe and like some of them aren't even like cannabinoids a lot of people like to think oh you know synthetics are just like cannabinoids so it should be fine no no no we've gone way past the cannabinoid point of synthetics like a lot of these vapes will not even have like synthetic cannabinoids in them they'll just be synthetic drugs in general that you are vaping so that's been a thing for a long time but in the last two years it's kind of propped up that a lot of new users a lot of people who don't really know anything about vapes or you know people just trying to prey on new people in the cannabis scene we'll try and sell them this spice liquid and say that it's thc now i get messaged a lot about this and to be honest most of the time when i get messaged about this unfortunately it's usually really young people like people who don't really know much better people who aren't in like the actual cannabis scene and people who just think like hey i want to get a thc e-liquid you know it seems like a reasonable thought but to the untrained person who doesn't know about all this stuff you could be sold one of these things and then it could end up [ __ ] your life up but the thing is as well i kind of hate when people call these fake thc carts because they're not it'd be like the same thing as if somebody has some ketamine at a party and then they come up to you and they say hey man you want to do this line of coke and then you do it you've not done fake coke you've done ketamine right like somebody has been an [ __ ] and has spiked you essentially and i guess i'd probably think differently if people were like making a brand and like you know there was like this brand of thc e-liquid which was actually spice you know but i'm pretty sure that's not a thing i'm pretty sure most of the time it's just people buy this spice liquid branded as spiced liquid then they're trying to sell that to people and trying to lie to them and say that it's thc which i wouldn't quite see that as saying oh it's fake thc liquid as much as i would say it's someone just trying to drug you but okay listen to me here that is not the only reason why you shouldn't buy thce liquids so even before the whole spice thing came about i've been trying to tell people that thce liquids just aren't worth it like they're really not so when you think about it in this way it might make you change your perspective on it but think about it for a second right if you have a thc e-liquid it has to be mixed with something it has to be mixed with like pg or vg essentially when you're mixing it stuff you're making it weaker and i'm not gonna lie like every real thc e-liquid that i've ever tried has been insanely weak but you kind of have to hit it the same amount of times as you'd hit a joint to be able to get the same feeling from it and when you're doing that with a vape it's not the most comfortable thing in the world especially when most people who are vaping are trying to like you know just have one or two hits while they're outside or walking around like it just doesn't feel quite right to like sit there with a thc e-liquid and chong it just as much as you do on a joint it just really doesn't feel right and then you've got to keep in mind that shout out carts are a thing right and to be honest shack hops can be just as like iffy to buy especially if you're buying like a branded one i guess that's kind of the difference with the thc e-liquids in the carts because the thc eliquids are pretty much always going to be unbranded but the carts are always going to be branded now obviously carts are dangerous for a different reason like obviously there was the whole vitamin e acetate stuff that happened with you know a bunch of carts having that in it and it you know messing people's lungs up so that's a whole nother story so i mean personally i try and stay away from branded shatter cartridges and also you know the e-liquids in general but if consuming in that way is exactly what you're looking for and you're from the uk honestly the safest way to do it is to buy an empty cartridge that allows you to just put straight up shatter in it so you can get these types of cartridges from loads of places i've even made a video called making my own wax cart so you should definitely check that out if you're interested but essentially you can buy your wax from a certified saucer you know the wax is on point good because honestly it's an extremely rare thing to have like contaminated waxes it's more of like a i guess you could have the issue of having like bad wax with butane in it still but if you're buying rosin it's relatively the safest way you could ever do stuff so imagine you've got yourself your rosin you've got yourself a cartridge all you've got to do is heat up your rosin to the point where it goes a bit liquidy pour that into the cart put the lid on it and away you go you've got a safe cartridge that you know is 100 real and you know it's going to get you stoned as well because one hit on it is going to make you feel like you've just done a dab so for those reasons that's what i would say to stay away from thc e-liquid especially in the uk especially right now i definitely definitely wouldn't be going near it and that's not even just on the safety standpoint it's also just on the standpoint of you know if you're a smoker and you have a high tolerance thce liquids ain't going to do [ __ ] for you oh and yeah there's a reason why cbd e-liquids work so well in comparison to like a thc e-liquid when you normally intake cbd you use a tiny amount of it so the ratios of when you've mixed the cbd with the pg and the vg it comes out to still being really strong in comparison but if you had thc at that same level of the cbd it ain't doing anything i mean i mean it will do stuff but it's just not going to be what you're expecting it to be so people just before i go i want to know what your thoughts are on thc eliquids in the comments down below have you ever had any issues with like the spice liquids or anyone trying to sell you something dodgy or just in general you haven't really liked them or maybe you like them maybe you really love thc liquids i would love to know in the comments down below so save one for that people i'll see you guys very soon i'll be live streaming later on tonight at 9 00 pm so like you're always on the phone i sell a toxic what you do the most when you really want to stop this got the trap spot jumping jumping like a [

From caffeine, cigarettes and alcohol, \nto more extreme drugs. But as the most commonly used illicit drug in North America, where does marijana fit in? And how exactly does it\neffect your brain? First, we need to understand how the brain functions. Your neurons are the cells that process information in the brain. By releasing chemicals called \"neuro-transmitters\"\nfrom the axon of one neuron to the dendrite of another. They change the electrical charge of the receiving neuron, \nconsequently exciting or inhibiting it. If excited, the signal is passed on. Though it sounds simple, these signals work together and the effect is\nquickly compounded into complex configurations within milliseconds, flushing over the entire brain. This is what happens every single time you think, breath,\nor move. So what is going on in your brain when you \nare smoking marijuana? Well, unlike alcohol which contains molecules nothing like those in our body.\nCannibis contains molecules that resemble those produced in our very own brains. Cannabinoids, though naturally these cannabinoids circulate in much lower quantities\ncompared to the large influx imposed by smoking. Specifically the chemical Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, resembles a\nnatural transmitter called Anandamide. These cannabinoids are specialized neurotransmitters\nreleased by neurons having just fired. Neurons temporarily becomes unresponsive after firing, to prevent them\nfrom overreacting or being to dominant. This allows your brain to function in a calm and controlled manner. But cannabinoids interrupt this approach\nin some parts of the brain. Instead, they remove the refractory period of neurons,\nthat are already active and cause your thoughts, imagination and perception to \nutterly magnify itself. This means once you begin your train of thought,\nit becomes the most significant and profound thing ever. You can't see the big picture or even recall your last epiphany,\nbecause you are caught up in the momentum of a particular idea, and your neurons keep firing. Until a new idea takes hold, and you go off on a new tangent. These cannabinoids also effect the levels of dopamine \nand norephinephrine in your brain. Often leading to a sense of euophoria, relaxation,\npain modulation and general enhancement of an experience, \nthough sometimes causing anxiety. Furthermore, there are cannabinoid receptors in areas controlling short term memory, learning, coordination,\nmovement control and higher cognitive functions.

investing in a business that's dealing solely in cash difficult get that comfortable [Music] in a city with dispensaries as common as coffee shops Denver is undoubtedly the epicenter of America's legal marijuana movement and if you're in the business of Bud it's a good place to be Colorado accounted for a third of the country's 2.7 billion dollar marijuana market last year but with being America's fastest growing industry comes growing pains marijuana is still illegal on the federal level which has led to conflicting state laws restrictive regulations and endless problems for cash-only marijuana business owners and operators however market projections of over 11 billion in the next five years still have everyone coming to town for the Green Rush we're outside the cannabis cup in Denver it's 4/20 today it's basically like Christmas for anyone who spends marijuana the cannabis cup looks like a giant pop party but with legalization this bleary-eyed consumer base represents a huge financial opportunity unlike any before high times the sponsors of the cup and loud advocates for a legal market have seen this coming for a long time just think there's no other holiday like it it's not a religious holiday it's not a historical date like d-day or December 7th it is a holiday at the stoner community made an international holiday I can't think of another holiday like that there everybody says this day this is the day we celebrate cannabis after 40 years of cannabis commentary High Times has stepped off the sidelines with a multi-million dollar growth fund to invest directly in marijuana related businesses these are the guys from Elemental seeds Tony and Jason I discovered these guys danced I did alright in Montana there a couple farmers wheat and alfalfa farmers in Montana these guys are master growers would you want to go back to farming alfalfa are you you said with marijuana like that cannabis I think cannabis is you know I mean there's no medicinal benefits in but even the most eager marijuana fans are aware of the difficult market conditions the Colorado industry I say has been incredibly patient with this bureaucracy they have new rules thrown at them monthly and it drives them crazy and yet they continue to keep at it and continue to flourish so it's dealing with lawmakers dealing with policy trying to make this a level playing field for this industry that's what the hurdle is with so much money to be made four-twenty isn't just for stoners anymore meeting the political and legal challenges of this emerging market is a new kind of marijuana enthusiasts who's getting into the game for a different kind of green we just checked into the marijuana investor summit which has a completely different field of the cannabis cup and we're just gonna see the big players that are investing in this market today the summit joins the growing list of conferences around the country dedicated to networking and investing in cannabis but most importantly entrepreneurs are here to learn how to become successful from the few who got here first [Applause] [Music] [Music] and to compete immediately you don't have the slow growth opportunity that we have here so well organized funding that have a great team of professionals a clear example of the shifting attitudes towards legal marijuana can be seen in the demand for industry experts to navigate new money to success aside from the marijuana plant itself consulting was one of the most profitable sectors of the industry last year Trant Willa Beck is the CEO o for American cannabis company a consulting team that gives advice to businesses in the legal space and helps connect them with investors yeah it's cool to see the the natural evolution of kind of what's been progressing over the last you know 6 8 12 18 months of the space and it kind of all culminates here at this event for sure one of Trance most successful clients andy williams of medicine man so we went to their largest operation where he both grows and sells marijuana so this is the Green Mile Gary green it's very green so these are some of our mother plants this is what we use to create new plants and so when we look for genetics we look for good big and fast those three things and when we find it we grow a big plant and then we clone it and we'll plant it and it will be an exact genetic duplicate of this plant let's go stand let me make a little more room go back in there a little bit to be a marijuana that's right now you all this green is reflecting from even with an improved state licensed large-scale marijuana producers are under the microscope for every aspect of their operations meant to weed out any semblance of the black market but constantly changing regulations have put many companies out of business this is a RFID tag or radio frequency identification tag actually gets attached to the plant so you can track it from when you sell it to where it came from that's right it's totally traceable the state knows exactly how many plants we have in our system they know when they're harvested how much was harvested they know everything about it it's a manufacturing facility we manufacture marijuana the success of medicine man is due in large part to its family-run business model we put a business plan together and we went to my mom and somehow sold her on the idea sheet even though my brother was growing his house didn't even smoke and but somehow she believed in us and gave us her seed money and you know we've done pretty well but for most businesses access to capital is still severely restricted by state policies as well as by the stigma surrounding the marijuana industry Colorado has approved a credit union for marijuana businesses but the future bank of Bud will not be able to take deposits or make loans without federal approval fighting to change both market policies and impressions is Taylor West there is no industry without the advocacy that creates it but when you're talking about one that is currently federally illegal it is that much more important that you have people advocating for the industry's position with lawmakers on a daily basis Taylor west of the National cannabis Industry Association is an advocate for common-sense reform to the current marijuana laws at the federal level what is the biggest issue when it comes to banking and cannabis businesses so because financial institutions are regulated at the federal level and marijuana at the federal level is still considered an illegal product a lot of financial institutions most of them are extremely hesitant to work with any business that is at all related to the cannabis industry we are in an economy that assumes that as a business if you have a legitimate and thriving business you'll be able to get some kind of capital from small business loan from a bank and that isn't the case in this industry what that has meant in the past is typically that you are raising money from friends and family can you talk to me a little bit through experiences that you've had with banking and formal banking services we have had on and off again relationship with banks and that you know in this industry banks liked us as customers especially early on but they didn't want to know it was a don't-ask-don't-tell relationship and if they dug deeper then we wouldn't get an account and we'd try another Bank so typically we tried to have two banks one we're with and one we're going to when they shut us down and April 14th we had you know half a million dollars in checks written out to the federal government for our taxes and whatnot and the bank called something said oh we're shutting your count down effective you know pretty much immediately and so we we had these hot checks heading towards the federal government and so we had to stop the stop payment on the checks and we really had to scramble to get our taxes into the government that year you know it's just that another fire drill that you'd kind of learn to go through in this industry regularly and we're fortunate enough right now to have a bank and and we'll be happy and be content until we lose this one and then we'll go from there again but for investors who are turned off by these risks in the u.s. an increasingly stable market has emerged to our north Canada what is the biggest difference between companies in Canada and in the u.s. I think first and foremost with banking if being federally legal up there they do have access to your traditional banking is the u.s. missing out in any sort of way compared to the Canadian cannabis market you know here in the United States you can't even cross state lines or state borders with product and so you know that really kind of puts each separate market and its own little niche and so that's really kind of why the Canadian market is advancing a little bit quicker as far as scalability goes since 2001 medical marijuana has been legal in Canada but two years ago the system shifted away from small local home growers to a federally regulated system with just 25 licensed large-scale marijuana producers in the country we went to the east coast of Canada to check out one of these commercial operations ahead of torrent anagram in Moncton New Brunswick it's the only licensed medicinal marijuana grow east of Ottawa we're gonna go meet with the president and CEO and go on an investor tour of the facility marijuana is a recreational drug and it's been for a lot of years and it was legal up until the 1920s and it's a medicine now behind me there's an investor so we're going on we have people from the big banks of Canada and other analysts they're basically looking at what our diagram is doing and see if they want to put their money in it there are many people currently that have the prescription is still difficult to find a doctor yes still have a way to us [Music] we talk about when we look at her society in North America there was prohibition we understand what happened when prohibition ended in the opportunities that were presented in the liquor industry so I see the industry is being similar I'm not proposing that alcohol is a good thing for society and they're not proposing that marijuana is a good thing for society but the reality is you can't stop them obviously governments are looking at this and saying well if we can regulate it control the usage for our monitors and the almighty dollar in terms of Taxation that you know it's going to go there Cheryl listen we have we have probably a little over one-third at our us-based investors you know you US market is very fragmented with the fact that it's illegal at a federal level a lot of the US investors are seeing what's happening in Canada it's more of a friendly framework for regulation and in Canada we're able to create very large companies so as a u.s. investor they're seeing that opportunity of size and there are those tremendous interests as from the US investors and what is your relationship with the banking systems in Canada started quite rocky we have five large banks in Canada but we can't borrow money from banks currently our bank account was closed about a month after I got here we received a notice saying that you know within 30 days we appreciate your business but please take it elsewhere do they tell you why they closed your bank account at first no not nothing divulged at all whatsoever quite shocking considering that we are a legal business selling a legal product in Canada so even though banks for example the big banks in Canada still don't give you loans you do have accounts and do have credit cards with them absolutely does that make you attractive to foreign investors that kind of stability yes because what it does is it takes it out of the cash industry so if you're an investor you want to make sure every daughter finds its way into the bank account and back to its shareholders so you know if you're investing in a business that's dealing solely in cash as an investor difficult to get that comfort level while these companies in Canada are able to have bank accounts and credit cards most legal marijuana businesses in the US are still cash only a serious obstacle for the growth of the domestic marijuana market what this means is that most businesses in the industry are operating without a bank account without a checking account when that happens you are forced to carry out all of your transactions in cash you're also dealing entirely in cash on the back end of your business paying your employees in cash paying your utility bills which can run in the tens of thousands of dollars a month if you're a cultivator your taxes you have to pay in cash all of this creates a lot of problems the most prominent one is safety if you are a business that is operating entirely in cash paying your employees in cash and it's publicly known that you're forced to operate in cash you're sitting duck for violent-crime without regulations that make it possible for marijuana companies to have banks security has become a booming sector of this industry having lots of cash on hand and a product that's not covered by insurance makes dispensaries and grow operations easy targets for break-ins this amateur breakin of a local dispensary occurred during our week in Colorado adding the most complicated layer to legal marijuana's financial problems is a little-known section in federal tax code what is 280e and why is it such a big deal for the industry section 280a of the Internal Revenue Code is a section that was put in in the early 80s after a convicted cocaine dealer wrote off supplies that he used in his cocaine trafficking business on his federal taxes and the IRS tried to challenge it it went to court and the court essentially said as the tax code currently stands this is legitimate the business isn't but the write-off is so then this provision was added to the tax code that says if you are in there where it's trafficking in a controlled substance that is either schedule 1 or schedule 2 then you cannot take the normal business expense deductions that any other business is able to take and because marijuana is still a schedule 1 controlled substance in federal law it is affected by this provision the way this ends up playing out is that many of these businesses pay anywhere from sixty to eighty five percent of their profit in taxes and that's just crippling for any business but especially businesses in what is essentially a startup environment and that's all money that would get pumped into the local economy but can't because it's being sucked away to the federal government recently there's only been one significant attempt for marijuana reform at the federal level the cares Act can make it easier for legal marijuana businesses to access banks but this bill likely won't even make it on the floor meaning states are still operating in a fractured way when it comes to marijuana laws if change for the marijuana industry is dependent on Congress to take action the next generation of pot barons and cannabis products may very well read made in Canada you [Music]", "29hyb2rrrgo": "and Marley how do you like your treats did you have any like reservations about giving them CBD at first I was desperate to keep him so I was willing to try anything [Music] hey we're at ro Nels house and Rennell has a dog named Marley and Marley has a couple conditions I get treated with CBD oil which is something a lot of people didn't know you could do with dogs so how did you come to get Marley somebody was had him up for adoption and they said that they had little kids and they couldn't handle him which I thought was crazy until I got him home and I found out why cuz he just wanted to be held and he's under your feet he couldn't be by himself I was like having a baby so it was like it was terrible if he got really upset he would he'd go to the bathroom in the house and it got to the point where was like you can't have that so yeah we were gonna have to find him another home we take him to a groomer and I just happened to ask one of the ladies that takes care of him there if he behaves as badly there as he does at home and she said that we should consider using the cannabis treats because it would help with his anxiety and that the Prozac probably was not helping any longer because he'd been taking it so long oh so he was on frozen crows I Fedora hmm they do what was the difference between the Prozac behavior in the CBD with the Prozac he was calmer but he still was a little more anxious with having people come and go in here so often he had to calm down because he was just barking like crazy and just going on and on so now he just sits and hangs out with everybody but like I said didn't change his personality at all which was nice because I was afraid it was gonna make him just you know with our Jick and lay around and do nothing so he still runs around with the kids and plays with them and does all that so changes to mean and oh yeah exactly that's exactly right CBD saved the day they did I did well I'd heard about studies on the effects of CBD in dogs this is my first time seeing it in practice so we're outside of it Lydon right now it's one of our nails favorite places to come get everything Marley needs so we're gonna go inside learn a little bit more about CBD and pets and see what kind of goods they have to offer hi Trey hi I'm Leah nice all right so you guys have quite a number of products which ones are for dogs all right so we do have a product that is CBD base or hemp based and it is a pet CBD whole plant tincture CBD is known to be non psychoactive or what we say is non euphoric so you're not gonna get that high it can help with ailments such as stress anxiety pets dogs namely also have what's known as an endocannabinoid system humans and pets have this so CBD can help pets as well for my dog I use it once a day in the evening to kind of chill him out not that it takes away his personality or anything it just is a nice he's not so anxious it's really great and your dog likes it oh yeah absolutely while both THC and CBD compounds are found in cannabis plants they behave very differently CBD doesn't have psychoactive properties so it won't make you feel high it's important to remember that CBD products for dogs aren't regulated so you should try to talk to a vet about what brands and quantity to try for your pet CBD also hasn't been thoroughly tested in humans or animals but some early studies have shown that CBD has a lot of potential medical benefits including a calming effect which is a natural alternative to prozac that can help marleah so let's see a shape before using take four drops per 10 pound animal wait twice daily how big is my early about 8 pounds about 8 pounds yeah that's about like three four jobs all right let's see what you think about this mm-hmm what do you think not sure if I you somewhere you eat so I find I'll eat it [Music] but if I put it on something you'll take it with me think let's try it there we go so today we learned about CBD and dogs CBD might be a good alternative for your dog or your cat or other pets as opposed to going through pharmaceuticals so yeah maybe your dog or your cat will like weed as much as you do [Music] you", "unvgJDMZ7kU": "dookey I couldn't be more excited man so we're gonna do some dry rub or toss like a dry seasoning or the chicken wings when it comes out we're gonna add some what are gonna happen to it oh I really like all this keep to that pineapple one of the best hands down okay so we have the black peppercorns that we just kind of ground-up mortar and pestle shrimp powder so this is for like umami that Korean add chili pepper powders for the little bit of spice right how much keep do you think we're doing you I think it's gonna be activated really that much I would just do you know like a good pinch like you would a normal spices all right we're gonna add a little bit of this pineapple Keith Keith has an interesting history right it's one of the oldest extraction methods just agitation and screens people recently have really been kind of elevating it to a new level before it used to have a lot of plant matter and it was kind of a less clean product but now people are getting it to the point where it's like 99% of just the gland heads which is like what you want in a concentrate this is the coconut sugar with the THC and I think we should toss the chicken in that to just be fun so you get this nice like almost our Encana hue from here we put equal parts salt the wings right when it comes out of the oil instead of hitting with just regular salt we're gonna hit it with this thanks the first time they've ever been fried chicken wings tossed and Keith is it good we could have more of that beef flavor how do we impart more that we could just like grate it in let's do it let's try the og I think it's good to put some California in there Alex beautiful yeah who's the guy this is your weapon and what is gonna be breaded in there this is gonna be for the fried chicken little baking powder cornstarch and some flour I have some cold water to it it should feel like watered-down Elmer's glue that is soju Rebecca some sort of alcohol where's my shot it's just a light light coating okay Mustard's so you see a little bit of that thank you yeah you can fry late for it it's me when do you want me to pull down it's not take like eight ten minutes hit me hit me now well we're not working sink [Music] and really smell that week I chicken and stuff oh my god awesome nailed it these are the fresh cannabis leaves rush these Oh so I figured we'd fry them yeah well do the same preparation as the chicken little bit of cornstarch a little bit about I think oh wow that looks fun deep-fried pot leaves that's a crazy thing let's do it little tester okay I'll come in on the deck just smells so good it's like pretty like solid oh yeah we gotta get you stoned Dookie then you'll finally see all these like new dimension firing thing in front of us you get the most inspiration when you're stoned apparently yeah [Music]", "RYL3jhLafE8": "marijuana prohibition has been an abject failure smoking marijuana is illegal in texas but could that change nine new bills were introduced monday ahead of january's legislative session heather fazio is the director at texans for responsible marijuana policy this may be the first time that in the texas senate a bill has been introduced to repeal prohibition entirely if smoking marijuana is illegal in texas then how can this billboard exist downtown off of i-35 it was paid for by morris dendon with compassionate cultivation a legal marijuana facility here in austin i still think there's a lot of people that don't even know that this program exists in the state of texas the compassionate use program denton sells legal non-smokeable thc to patients with extreme medical conditions like alzheimer's and cancer but current laws limit his customers and his business practices because this is a schedule one substance we can't use any form of transportation services to deliver our medicine to our patients fox 7 austin spoke with the democratic state senator jose menendez who is proposing a bill that could allow more texans to get a medical cannabis prescription is this the one medical therapy that legislators feel that they should be telling doctors how to practice medicine if his bill passes patients with any condition their doctor deems necessary could get a prescription do you think that governor abbott is going to sign any of these no i hope so but why now pew research center released a new study monday indicating 68 percent of americans are ready to legalize marijuana many states already there but for menendez this is personal his wife had two back surgeries she's had fentanyl patches she's been on the horrible narcotics and and narcotics can kill people and they stop your system and cannabis is helpful and so it's helped her texas could also see an economic boom since legal marijuana would be taxable another new

stop by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much i really truly appreciate all your awesome comments and your wonderful love and support i do apologize i've been a little absent for the last couple of months i've been really pretty sick for a while there um today's about the first day that i felt good so yeah i came to make you guys a video so if you want more details i put up a video under the community area there but i'm not going to bore you with the nitty gritty details here so let's jump into what i've got for you today and what i've got for you today are hot chocolate balms so what these are if you haven't seen these yet are really cool so these chocolate balls they're the hard chocolate balls and they're filled with hot chocolate or cocoa whichever you prefer and you put them into your mug add your hot milk and they turn into hot chocolate of course canna um but uh these are just wonderful and they make awesome um gift ideas for the holiday time which is just coming up right around the corner i know i'm sorry i'm sorry um but as i said they do make great gift ideas so without any further babbling on here let's jump into those ingredients the equipment that we're going to need to get these made and let me show you how to make these oh one thing i did tell you because this recipe today i mainly just show you how to make the chocolate balms if you want to see further details on how to infuse coco cocoa butter um check out my video on canna real milk chocolate and there i show you exactly the details on how to infuse cocoa butter and yes you can only use cocoa butter with real chocolate you cannot use coconut oil or anything else so please don't ask me that question only cocoa butter so i said if you need any further details on that as well as tempering details all right so what we're going to need for our can of hot chocolate balms is two cups of real chocolate and um you want to make it a dark chocolate it's going to give you a richer flavor so about 2 cups or 16 ounces if you've got black chocolate or shaved chocolate that's what you want to go with 16 ounces or two cups about one and a half to two cups of hot chocolate powder and this will be the pre-made hot chocolate powder it's already done with sugar if sugar is an issue for you then you can definitely use just straight coco you don't have to use the pre-made hot chocolate as i said i just do it because it's already got the sugar mixed in and it just simplicity's sake we if you want to add marshmallows what i did because these little dehydrated marshmallows are difficult to find is i just bought a really inexpensive hot chocolate mix sifted out the hot chocolate and kept marshmallows hey me um i think they if they're available on amazon if they are i'll throw a link down for you and then for i'm going to decorate mine with some salted caramel um for the decoration and give my hot chocolate a little hint of salted caramel but you don't have to do that if you just want to decorate them with a milk chocolate later to have that contrast giddy up i have not just leave them plain and then we're going to use um so this can be an and or an ore i'm going to add infused cocoa butter to my chocolate and i'm going to add about two tablespoons the other thing i'm going to do this is the end or i'm going to infuse my hot chocolate with tincture so as i said if you've got both you can do it if you just got one or the other there there you go you just add the cocoa butter to your chocolate or tincture to your hot chocolate all right so that's it for the all right so the equipment that we're going to need is you're going to want a double boiler for melting your chocolate so glass bowl in a pot or if you've got a proper double boiler you can use that of course most people don't so a bowl that fits snugly so um you don't have steam and stuff coming out the sides the other is you just want to add enough water you um towards the bottom you don't want any water touching the bottom of your bowl because it will get too hot and it will burn your chocolate also make sure if it starts boiling a little bit that it's not going to be touching the bottom of the bowl so you can always melt your chocolate in the microwave or what i picked myself up is one of these chocolate melting pots these things are really really nice so if you do do a lot of chocolate you may want to take a look at investing in one of these and what's great about it is because you have total temperature control although it's in celsius so you're in fahrenheit you just need to get some conversions but um easy to do anyhow as i said you can go 30 is about 86 degrees fahrenheit i believe which is your lowest temper for milk chocolate and for um for milk chocolate and white chocolate and then it goes up to 80 which for the most part you would never go that high because that's like 165 so and the reason that these are super nice is you can put your chocolate on and just walk away and leave it for a while you don't have to stay over the pot and continually stir it it's kind of nice basically i say it's just idiot proof for melting i've burnt chocolate before on the double boiler i step away for a moment this i can just drop the heat down step away go do what i want come back and just adjust my temperature and carry on my merry way so besides a way to melt your chocolate you're going to want a candy thermometer or a chocolate thermometer measuring spoon measuring cup about a quarter cup measuring cup or depending on how much tincture you're going to use a couple of spatulas straight edge a straight edge cutter offset spatula and a straight edge spatula if you've got those and a whisk you can use a metal whisk or a silicone whisk for chocolate either is okay [Music] you're also going to want a pair of gloves either silicone or latex or whatever really professional chocolatiers use cotton gloves but we'll just go with these this will help prevent you getting fingerprints on your product as you're as you're playing around with it if you're going to do some decorating you want a piping bag and then our mold for our little chocolate balms so this is i believe about a one and a half inch mold i will put up the link for it to um for you to see exactly which one it is and we're going to want parchment paper and the last thing that the method that i'm going to use to temper my chocolate is tabling if you are going to do tabling you need a marble slab or another natural stone slab things are falling uh is a natural slab as i said or marble and i actually got this from a table so all right let me get that out of the way and we're going to need a bowl we're doing our hot chocolate little tincture a baking dish with parchment paper and you're going to want a fine mesh strainer and a bowl i think that's about it of course you know i always forget something along the way but if i do i'll let you know all right so let's jump right in and let's get our hot chocolate infused with our tincture all right so to infuse our cocoa or our hot chocolate whichever you're using um get your uh get your powder get your strainer and we're just going to sift this through just to take out any lumps so you don't want all those lumps and stuff in your in your mix now i'm going to use about a quarter cup for 2 cups of for a hot chocolate mix oh another thing with regards to your hot chocolate mix i forgot to tell you read the directions on how much you need so there are some usually the less expensive ones will be like four heaping tablespoons or four heaping teaspoons you want to make sure uh you don't really have any more than two tablespoons um less is better it's hard to get it in those bowls balls and get them together so you want to make sure that your hot chocolate instructions are for at least two tablespoons or under just a helpful tip for you there this is my green dragon tank shaw and i'm just going to put a little bit on it first use my whisk whisk her in and you want to add in a little bit at a time because if you for one if you use an alcohol that is not a 94 or 96 you're going to have a lot more water you want to be careful of that because you're going to end up making it pasty so just add it a little bit at a time if you notice it getting clumpier pasty stop if you're using the 94 96 you can get away with a lot more but as i said just do it a bit at a time if you notice it getting pasty it all stopped you can always add more later so you can uh evaporate the batch and you can always add on as a secondary level if you want to make it really really strong i however don't really like to render people unconscious but hey whatever float your boat and then i take my strainer again and sorry you want to preheat your oven to 175 degrees if you're doing this in a an electric oven you i do not recommend doing this in a gas oven some people have done it successfully others have not always err on the side of caution and flame and alcohol don't mix and you can also use a dehydrator or you can always leave it out overnight if you have to do the table dry method just leaving it out overnight you're going to want to sift it a few times through throughout the night throughout the day and there we go so i'm going to pop this into the oven at 175 on the middle rack i'm gonna leave the oven door slightly ajar i have a ceiling fan going always make sure that you have some type of ventilation going don't ever take it for granted you can do this a hundred times with no problems and then one time you do it without ventilation and there can be a problem so very very skinny so what i usually do is i spread it out on the wrap trying onto the tray nice and evenly and then i just put little dash marks in it here just just so we can heat up through and i said pop that in the oven keep the door slightly ajar and it'll probably take about 10-20 minutes for that to evaporate so what i'll do is every couple of minutes i'll go with um one of my spatulas and just move the um hot chocolate powder around and then re-flatten it out so this way it brings the heated from the bottom to the top and it helps to evaporate it quicker and if there's any large lumps you want to uh just mush them out all right so we'll be back when that's done alright so my hot chocolate is done as take it from the oven now a tr uh test that you can do to see if it's done to make sure it's done is it's only at 175 degrees not that hot if you have really sensitive skin don't do this but if you've got tougher hands just run it over your hands and let it go and then if you feel any coolness on your hands from the air that means you still have some alcohol left so throw it in a little bit longer if it's totally dry you're good to go so we're just going to set that off to the side till the end time when we're going to need that next on to our chocolate all right so for our chocolate if you are using a double boiler you want to put it on medium low as i said you don't want it to get too hot chocolate melts at a very very low temperature so i'm using my pot i'm going to add in my chocolate and i'm going to add in two tablespoons of melted infused cocoa butter if you want to learn more about how to infuse cocoa butter and tempering chocolate check out my video canada real milk chocolate and i go over all those steps and details for you so i like to melt my cocoa butter first and add it onto my chocolate and then mix it over all of my chocolate i just found that it just blends a lot better this way when i do it the other way where i use cold cocoa butter i found a few more times than not i ended up with streaking and this method i don't just a little tip i'm giving you oops that pots are wasted small so i'm just going to continue to stir that until she all melts down nicely and as i said because i'm using this melting pot i can go toddle away for a couple of minutes i would just drop my temperature down right now i'm doing this for melting the chocolate i am doing it between 50 and 55 celsius and over in this pot over here i'm just melting my salted caramel yeah the salted caramel chips you can get them uh i found them in most grocery stores a bulk barn they're really easy to come by now if anyone's going to ask me can you do this with butter or anything else coconut oil no you cannot the only thing that you can add to real chocolate is cocoa butter and the reason for that is um the temperature at which uh but the cocoa butter melts butter and coconut oil melt at a very low temperature at like 79 80 degrees it'll start to melt so if you use those your chocolate will never ever stay set at room temperature that is the reason so if you see any recipes that are using butter in that don't bother trying it don't waste your time unless you plan on keeping them in the fridge and then using them right out of the fridge then you're fine but if you want them to stay set no will not work so just a little tip for your chocolate if you're using a block chocolate you want to make sure that you cut it up really really really fine using a serrated edge knife works really well for that same thing if you're using larger chunks you want to chop them down to smaller size it helps them develop quicker and if you're using a double boiler and that you um you don't have to worry so much about um with it burning if you have really large chunks in really small chunks it takes a lot longer for those big ones to melt and you can burn your chocolate that's why i just said i found these melting pots just so nice just temperature control like i said it's just a nice toy it's definitely it's not a necessity for making chocolate it's just it's a nice to have what would be super nice to have is a tempering machine chocolate tempering machine those things are expensive especially the good ones so i'm just continuing to melt my chocolate down here and once it's all melted we're going to get it to temperature of 113 degrees fahrenheit that's for dark chocolate if you're doing milk chocolate or white chocolate it'll be about 108 109 now if you're microwaving your chocolate um with about two cups or 16 ounces you're going to start with two 30 second intervals and then drop down to 25 sorry then drop down to 20 15 10 and then continue at 10 second intervals until you reach the temperature that you need so as i said for dark chocolate 113 fahrenheit for milk or white chocolate uh 10109 so our chocolate is almost all melted so i'm just going to check the temperature right now to see where we're at i'm going to guess about a hundred 99 i was close so with your chocolate with your thermometer if you're using one of these tight always clean off the end so that you get a correct read because the chocolate will harden up on the end of your thermometer and it can cause it cause a misread so i'm just going to continue to stir this until we get to our temperature so i'm just going to check it every couple of minutes another thing to remember um is that water is chocolate's mortal enemy if you get even a drop of water in your chocolate it can seize if that does happen don't panic get your sunflower or soy lecifit and put in just a drop or two that can help uh save it it can help loosen it up so where in most cases we use those as an emulsifier in chocolate it works for its viscosity so it'll help thin out chocolate so that so always make sure that your equipment whatever you're going to use is thoroughly clean and dried um i i just i generally do not use um wooden handle uh spatulas or anything because wood can retain moisture so i've done that before where i was doing chocolate and stirring away and it seized on me because the handle was damp so yay so i tend to try to like to stick to the solid silicone uh type spoons are but i find i find work best all right so we're at 113 for the dark chocolate you want to turn your heat off take it off your heat and you want to make sure your marble um your marble stone area work area is completely clean and again 100 dry so in the previous video i showed you tabling um this is a slightly different method in the one in the other video i still used temperature to get us to that point this does not so what you do is you take half of your chocolate if i engage what half is you set your regular you set your melted chocolate off to the side and you get your straight edge uh straight edge and your offset spatula and you're going to work the two use the two the agitation is what is going to create our beta crystals that we need and this what we're going to do is we're going to work the chocolate until it gets till it thickens up so this can oops you don't do that try and stay on the table but make sure to get all the chocolate from the side get that scooted in holder the cold from the side is what helps to start thicken up your chocolate i have found this has become my favorite way for tempering might take a couple of times for you to try it but as i said if you don't temper the first time you just re-melt it do it again continue to clean off the blades my coordination is not so good our chocolate's beginning to thicken up here a little bit almost getting to where we want it to be yeah professional chocolatiers are way neater at this so you can see the chocolate starting to thicken up now it's not flooding out as quickly i'm just going to go a little bit further almost done i found this way this method far quicker and more efficient i hate the other ways i have very few times do i ever get it right so you can see our chocolate's thickened up here it's not as fluid and it's starting to harden as it goes out to the sides so this looks about where we want it to be scoop up your chocolate not those other peas get the little pieces melted there [Music] now we're going to take our the half chocolate that we have and we're going to add in our thickened chocolate again chocolatiers make this look far more impressive eyes look like what the hell am i doing but trust me it works then get your whisk put my whiskey and you're going to mix it together until it becomes one texture the same texture it all gets mixed together and melts those two different textures together and becomes one nice smooth and silky and the color's all the same that looks pretty good now we're going to get our mold and you're going to fill that up fill them up to their tops you don't have to worry about being too neat you want to be pretty quick mix get that moved around and then you can try and dump it into your pot or you just pour it onto the parchment paper and scoot it off or pour it onto the board and scoot it off so you want to drain out the excess get your straight edge spatula and you want to scoop off scrape off all this excess off you want to try and make sure your molds are nice and clean at the tops and again you can move the chocolate around and we're going to dump out the excess and again we're going to clean the excess off the top here give her a little smack down get getting any air bubbles make sure that also make sure this is even now what i like to do is to place them upside down on a parchment lined board and pop them into the fridge to set this way um you don't get this big hunk of chocolate set at the bottom of your get that mold of the way you can just take it through any excess this will save you having a big lip what we want to try and create is a nice little edge and scrape off that top then i'm going to flip this upside down on my board here i'm going to pop this in the fridge for about then with your leftover chocolate here grab your pot and we're just going to scoop it back in the pot and re-temper it again for the second round so i think you can do this with candy melts um the only problem if you don't want to do chocolate tempering in that the only problem is i don't know how well or how easily they melt with um in the hot milk or hot milk and or cream but what you could always do to find out ahead of time makes it what you can always do is just do a quick test melt you don't have to infuse anything just melt some candy melts up um into the ball shape and see how they melt in more milk they melt up nicely then absolutely you can just use candy melts and you don't have to go through all this tempering chocolate all right so while my first layer there are cooling in the refrigerator i'm just going to re-melt my chocolate back up to the 113 fahrenheit and then just re-temper it again like i said it takes you may take you a couple of times to get this but if you can get down this method honestly it's so much easier and it makes you feel more professional so see our bowls now see how nice they are nice and even so again i'm going to fill them up i don't know where i'm going get that out of the way for a minute so we want to get that mixed around get that coated and again we'll just dump out the excess on our parchment paper and then we're going to scrape off this excess again you want to try and get the um the tops here as clean as you can getting your chocolate out of your mold a lot easier i just want to kind of smack out air bubbles here a little bit and then again we're going to dump out the excess so the reason that you want to make sure to be getting out all the excess chocolate is just have a really nice um even mold of your chocolate you won't end up with a big lump of chocolate in the base of them again clean off the excess and then one more time and then we're gonna do one final scrape here and i'm going to flip her upside down onto my parchment board here and pop it in the fridge here for about 15-20 minutes and then your leftover chocolate you can just um keep in a plastic container and just save it for next time there we go you can recoup most of your chocolate especially when it's expensive you do not want to be wasting too much and the other thing you can do is just take your parchment paper if you want to make sure to get all your chocolate pretty much put that in the refrigerator once it cools up all of that will just crumble right off i however i'm not gonna bother all right so we'll let those cool up then next we'll decorate them fill them and put them together all right so on to decorating if you're going to decorate go to this step if not you can skip on to the to the filling part so we've got our molds and they're all nicely set so you want to very gently take them out this is what you want to put your gloves on because you do not want to get fingerprints all over your pretty little balls and now you'll know your chocolate chocolate is tempered by when you touch it if it instantly melts and then it is not tempered but if it stays then it's good and it's not instantly melting on your fingers then you're good if it is not tempered it's not going to be if they're not going to be as pretty and shiny they'll be a little bit dull or streaky and as well as they said as soon as you touch them they will like instantly melt on your fingers so i've just put my salted caramel into a disposable piping bag and i'm just going to cut a little hole here and then probably should do this on a wire rack duh i knew i needed one so place the model place the wire rack down and then put some parchment paper underneath that and i'm gonna pop these in the fridge let that set up for just a couple of minutes while that's setting up well let's get our hot chocolate ready so again get your strainer and um and i've got a bowl here [Music] pay attention so i'm going to dump our hot chocolate into our strainer and we'll just strain it through take out all the lumps all right so on to our final step here everything's set here so we're going to fill them up and seal them up but what i've been here is i've got some tempered chocolate that i put into a piping bag and i put a really really tiny hole at the inlet tip so you're going to flip your little guys over if you if they're a little stuck to your rack here just get a little spatula and gently scoop those off and my um hot chocolate it its um recipe is two tablespoons so i'm gonna do one into each side so these get a little tricky to to stick together and then i take some marshmallows throw those in i'm just gonna make a little pipe that around the edge here carefully come together like so and stick them together then you can just gently with your finger just scoot off the excess off the edges here and then what i'll use is where'd they go is the medium size or these are the medium size or small sorry small um muffin cups to hold them in see pretty again we want to get that nice get a little edge on it take your two make sure your designs are going the same way let's scoot them together gently not the prettiest one but oh well can't be perfect we'll use that for the tester and there you have it hot chocolate bombs so what i'm going to do right now is i'm going to heat up some milk and we're going to give her a shot give her a try see how they turn out all right so i've got some boiled milk here let's check out how our balm does i'll use the ugly one so we just plop her into our cup here and i like to use a whisk we pour our hot milk i like to do a mixture of cream and milk that is my milk i don't really like it and look at her start to melt so what i like to do is to put just about a quarter in and get her mixed up use her whisk get her all nicely mixed up let's fill her up and there we have it [Applause] yummy yummy hot chocolate bombs that was good that was a perfect amount yum yum well before i can't finish up this video because if i keep going on this hot chocolate i'm going to bid you a fair a jew so i hope you enjoyed that video thank you guys so much for joining and thank everybody for i would like to thank everybody for your love and support you guys are truly truly awesome so thanks again for joining me", "SpUypFOXg9A": "[Music] what's up everybody cupid's here and today we're going to talk about the three most common types of cod concentrate shatter crumble and butter or wax as it's sometimes called now the names of concentrates usually refer to either the extraction method or the consistency some people refer to all concentrates as wax but we'll try to get into the details because it can be confusing and there's no dictionary definition on some of these yet so you will hear people using one term for multiple things for multiple terms for one thing so when i first started buying legal concentrates in colorado in like 2014 like 95 of the concentrate options were shatter crumble and butter or wax as it's sometimes called and a lot of times all three of these would be called wax or having a sale on wax it would refer to any cured resin that they had so most of what i would get was bho but all this is ethanol extraction and they're still using these terms because we can still come out with these consistencies and it's interesting because this crumble in my opinion is uh more waxy or buttery than the wax and the wax looks a little more crumbly than the crumble it just goes to show you that the terms aren't exact not all crumble is a hundred percent the exact same consistency not all waxes it's just general terms to try to keep them categorized like shatter for example shatter usually refers to as the lighter clear stuff that you can feed through you can't really see through any of the other ones in this one i go to break off a piece it should snap off but there's different types of shatter i mean i've had glass like shatter where it doesn't bend at all it's not malleable in any way it snaps when you try to fold it there's shatter that's called pull and snap where it's a little bit stretchier you can kind of stretch pieces off and they snap off eventually it's still shattered but it's a little bit more malleable and then i've also seen really sappy shatters where it looks like this but just a slightly melted or a slightly warm version shatter is probably the most popular out of the three of these and most people would think that this is the best it can have higher thc percentages but sometimes that means lower terpene percentages now these these two the crumble and the wax are very similar consistency a lot of the crumble that i've been getting in florida is really really dry sometimes crumble ends up looking like that where it's just really dry kind of powdery this video is brought to you by boom head shop the loudest online head shop they carry all kinds of bongs dab rigs vaporizers accessories cleaning products and more check them out and you can save up to 20 off with the cupid's code that's boomheadshop.com when you're making shatter you usually spend a little more time purging out all the fats and lipids when you're making that butter consistency sometimes you'll whip it up while you're purging it so as far as differences goes they're all very similar they'll have similar tastes they'll vaporize basically about the same it's just how they're handled now i don't really like crumble and shatter that much they're my least favorite they're the hardest to handle concentrates in my opinion if you get a really hard shatter it'll break off when you try to go get a piece or crumble sometimes it's really hard to handle really hard to scoop it's super dry sometimes it just smears all over the container and you're trying to get it off and there's just a thin film of it on the inside so i'm hoping this video gives you a little insight on the consistencies the terms aren't too literal they can mean a variety of things there's a bunch of different things you could call shatter a wax or crumble that would fit the criteria or fill that category when i first got into dabbing shatter was my favorite i thought because it had the highest thc percentage that it was going to be the best one oh man biggest numbers in this one but then i learned after several incidents of handling it losing some it was my least favorite to deal with it's usually the least flavorful out of the three there so out of the three i would say butter is my absolute favorite crumble and shadow are [ __ ] i hate those consistencies they're the worst anyway if you like this video don't forget to subscribe to the channel for

them side by side you'd honestly say that they're kind of different looking concentrates [Music] today i'm dabbing on one of my personal favorite consistencies this is called sugar starting to sesh off with this live sugar from grassroots oh god that looks beautiful that sugar is such a pretty bright yellow color all right i'm just gonna dunk it right in there oh ah delicious man holy crap [ __ ] yeah that treyo g is a really dank earthy flavor that's [ __ ] fire got a little bit of sweetness on the back end too it's pretty nice there's a lot of different words that people use to describe cannabis concentrates some of the most popular are ones like shatter sugar butter wax sauce diamonds the list goes on and on these names are used to describe the consistency and the malleability of a concentrate not the actual quality so one isn't necessarily better than the other just based off of its consistency but today we're going to take a deeper look into sugar wax it's a pretty popular form of concentrate if you've been to a dispensary before you've probably seen it on the shelf at least it's created through a solvent extraction process just like shatter or wax but it's not necessarily better or worse than any other consistency it's just different everyone has their preference but personally i think this is one of the better consistencies all around i just think it usually has a nice terpene profile and it's easy to work on a dabber but i don't want to put too much emphasis on the importance of a consistency honestly i've had consistencies change on me before i finish smoking the concentrate honestly if you leave shatter sitting out in the open on a warm day it's not too rare to see it sugar up there's actually a lot of science that's involved when it comes to making concentrates it's a little overwhelming when you just look at it but sugar is really just a term used to describe any sort of cannabis consistency that kind of resembles like a wet sugar there's not just one way to get to the finish line here but no matter how you make it sugar typically has great effects a great smell and a great flavor but it's very sticky and crumbly i don't recommend using your hands on this concentrate i recommend getting a dab tool and scooping it up the stickiness really helps to stick to the tool usually let's just get a nice little chunk on here and get a little bit more than that oh yeah now we're talking i really like this little scooper dabbers i feel like you can get a decent amount of concentrate on them when i'm dabbing on a cloud banger with a turf pearl in it i usually wait about 90 95 seconds before i take my dab we're at 90 seconds right now so let's go for it oh yeah it's gonna be a good tent oh yeah it's perfect god damn i just love weed man it's the best i'm assuming that's something we can all agree on here dude just smoking and dabbing it's just incredible but anyway sugar wax is often found as either a cured or a live resin and the only real difference between live resin and cured resin sugar is that live resin sugar was made with fresh frozen material while cured sugar was made with fully cured cannabis but the main difference between the two is typically with live resin you're going to have a more noticeable terpene profile but it's usually around the same thc sugars usually tend to be around 70 to 90 percent thc sometimes with live resin sugars companies will just get little thc diamonds and sprinkle live resin terpenes on top of that until it's like a little sugary consistency and then they call that sugar there will be a saucy coating over the diamonds it'll look just like sauce just a little more dry it's called sugar as well but it's really not the same thing as sugar wax but sometimes these concentrate consistency names just cover up a couple different consistencies under one name i actually have two perfect examples here as you can see both of these are called live sugar you can see live sugar right there and live sugar right there however this is what was inside of each container as you can see this one on the left is what i was talking about where there's little thc diamonds just coated in a live resin sauce where this one over here is actually more of a waxy consistency but it still is a sugar when you look at them independently you'd say that they were both sugar but when you look at them side by side you'd honestly say that they're kind of different looking concentrates they're not even the same color the saucy consistency is much more of an amber color while this sugar is much more of a yellow color some might even consider this more of a sauce consistency but to me that's sugar you can leave it on one side for a little bit without any of the stuff pouring out of there and live resin sugar and live resin sauce often look very similar to each other the main difference between the two is the thc percentage and the terpene percentage sauce typically has a lower thc percentage and a higher terpene percentage than sugar while sugar typically has the higher thc percentage and the lower terpene percentage but still has a great flavor so that's why i typically like to go with sugar so i feel like you get that nice thc punch while still getting a nice flavor and like a delicious overall experience when it comes to the smell and the flavor but i'm about to take a dab of this saucy sugar now and see which one i like more this drain portlandia is absolutely fire it was actually recommended to me by one of you guys it has a super high mercy level this one it's actually only testing at 2.8 which is still pretty high but i've seen it testing it upwards of seven here's the stats for the portlandia sauce for anyone that wants to see it pretty high amount thc and thca while still having a great terpene profile and i'm actually impressed that the sugar wax had good flavor now that i'm looking at the stats it's over 90 thca but it's still a great terpene profile let me know in the comments whether you guys prefer when it's more of a sugar wax consistency or went into the little thc diamonds with the live resin sauce on top i don't really mind either way i like it both ways again it's hard for me to pick a consistency because really i don't look at the consistency i'm looking at the strain and the thc and the terpene percentages when i'm buying weed and the consistency of sugar is just not uniform in nature it even ranges from like a light yellow to a ambery color like this let's scoop out our dab i think it's almost time to dab too god [ __ ] not dabbing all that i'll drop that though all right wish me luck on this one [Music] huh oh my god [Music] oh yeah killed it oh my god that was a good hit oh my god holy [ __ ] that portlandia is [ __ ] amazing i'm not kidding i'm really glad that whoever recommended that recommended it shout out to you but honestly i just love sugar because of how easy it is to get on a dab tool and honestly i think that it has the dopest melt shots when i'm filming my snapchats however i do feel like it is much harder to do than other concentrates sometimes i think i'm just taking a normal sized dab and then once you drop it in there it just turns into this giant puddle and you're like holy [ __ ] i was not intending all this i feel like when i'm dabbing butter or shatter it's so much easier for me to have an idea for how much i'm taking but when it's those little diamonds and all of a sudden there's just a giant thca rock in there you don't really know how much that weighs and you're like all right well let's find out how high i'm gonna get but i still think that sugar has a pretty nice well-rounded high and flavor no matter what form you have it in and i love flavorful concentrates and sugar is not the terpest there is but i still think that it has a great flavor profile and i think the butter and sauce are probably the most terpy for those who are wondering and if you're new to dabbing do not get overwhelmed if you see all these different consistencies at the dispensary and don't know which one to pick honestly don't even look at the consistency if you ask me just look at the strain and like the thc and the terpenes whatever you're looking for if you're a thc shopper look for the thing that's the highest thc if you like a certain terpene look for the terpenes like when i'm looking for a concentrate i'm looking at the terpene percentages i want something that has a really nice terpene profile most of the time concentrate consistencies are all basically the same thing they're all just different concentrated forms of cannabis it's really the cannabis you want to focus on and depending on the concentrate sometimes it'll change consistencies by the time the company packages it up and it actually gets to you bho does not have the longest shelf life and especially if you're talking about something like shatter or butter they can change consistencies pretty quick so honestly i wouldn't even say that labeling at the dispensary is 100 accurate you really don't know until you see it but that's the video you guys let me know what consistency of concentrates you want me to do next i did this before on sauce and you guys seem to really like it so i'm gonna make it a series so let me know what consistency you want me to

don't think it's harmful to bodybuilding at all so that's cool yeah tons of guys do it what's up guys derek from our placements.com today we're gonna be talking about the smoking weed hurt your gains notably if you're using it to help you go to sleep this is something that uh timestamp was sent to me um from the uh podcast for ad abby ad does where he had ian vayeron and they talk about um smoking weed and if it's gonna hurt uh bodybuilding outcomes so here they talk about their stance on it and i'll kind of interject after and give my opinion let's see thoughts on bodybuilders that smoke weed have you ever had have you ever and are you against weed and what's your opinion on it i smoke weed every day do you really before bed only at night yeah i didn't know that yeah i did that for a little while just to cut like i had some back pain i didn't want to take a bunch of advil yeah i actually started eating gummy bears just to kind of kill the pain and pass out yeah no i just like i'll do like usually before my like fifth or sixth meal and have my meal and i eat it in two milliseconds and i relax on the couch for a bit and have my last nail go to bed yeah i couldn't do it could you do it regularly like just sitting around no i can't do it during the day yeah 0 if i have like i couldn't leave the house high there's no way yeah okay we're the same then that way i think it's only i know usually when melissa's already gone to bed and i'm like the only person a week and i'm just like chilling and eating my food like watching you know netflix or whatever like i'd like to be in solitude for that usually yeah and she makes fun of me when i'm high too so yes it's better yeah i can't handle that yeah um okay so we're not against weed and we don't think it's harmful to bodybuilding at all so that's cool yeah tons of guys do it so they basically talk about how ian uses it every single night and he thinks there is no um deleterious outcomes on bodybuilding results whatsoever and he knows lots of guys who do it and you know how negligible is it you know for i just kind of want to lay out the science as far as giving you a more clear idea because i think there may be a deleterious impact to your bodybuilding results and i'll explain why so typically when you use it like acutely intermittently once in a while you're going to experience benefit from a reduced sleep latency standpoint so that means you're going to fall asleep easier quicker like when you actually lie down put your head on the pillow are you going to get to sleep that's your sleep latency it has seemingly no impact positive or negative on sleep duration with intermittent use however it has a very potent negative effect on rem sleep duration which is the dream sleep stage so if you know rapid eye movement if you know anything about the sleep stages you know i guess the most common ones that are known are just non-ram just straight up nor normal sleep then you have rem and then you have deep and basically rem is a critical component of sleep that is necessary for learning memory consolidation um mood regulation very notably and not being very deprived of rem sleep can lead to a lot of irritability uh mood swings depression and if some research even implies that it may lead help encourage the development of alzheimer's disease so when it comes to bodybuilding outcomes and something i should note too is when you use chronically thc every single day what happens is your body ends up building up a tolerance to it where you're gonna eventually need to use more and more to achieve the same decreased sleep latency and if you stop using it what happens is you have a brutal rebound of insomnia like sleep deprivation where you then are forced to go back to using it just to achieve a normal level of sleep latency that you would have otherwise not had that you would have you would have otherwise had if you were just healthy and not you know using the thc every day to begin with i'm not saying you're unhealthy if you use it by the way i'm just saying that you get to a point where you depend on it so much and you may need to build up your dose too then eventually if you try and get off of it if you're using it every single day you're going to have a probably have a pretty horrific rebound where you sleep like [ __ ] and then it's going to make you have to go back to use the thc in order to achieve like a reasonable sleep latency and get a normal sleep duration again all but while still having that impaired rem sleep so it's like from all aspects unless you're using it very very intermittently here and there it's not good in my opinion for bodybuilding outcomes how how drastic of an impact is this gonna have you know when you actually dig into the literature on rem sleep and how important it is you'll see pretty quick that depriving yourself of that sleep stage is likely not going to be you know negligible in terms of health outcomes as far as how it impacts bodybuilding outcomes if you're getting a sufficient amount of sleep duration and deep sleep with a relative lack of rem sleep it's like you know it plays a lot into your mindset though if you have rem sleep deprivation you start to notice it in your mood how you react to things very blatantly it has a very notable effect on how you react to emotionally to a lot of things in your life and as well as just like basic being able to be intelligent and like retain [ __ ] information in your head there's a lot of things that come from rem sleep that can't just be glossed over it's like oh it's this negligible portion of sleep that doesn't really matter for bodybuilding i think it does matter for bodybuilding and i think that smoking weed every night is going to have a negative effect on your bodybuilding progress so if you're going to incorporate it i would do it sporadically like here and there you know as a recreational thing maybe if you just like want to or you if you think it's gonna benefit you though and you think you're getting better sleep outcomes because of it it's either that you've built up a tolerance to it and you need it or or i should say dependence on it or you're just like misconstruing the decrease in sleep latency as a benefit when in reality if you put on an aura ring it would be interesting to see what was your rem sleep prior to using it and then what's your rem sleep duration when you're smoking weed every single night that would be interesting to see if it's actually impacting you in a negative way or not and i would recommend doing that if you're somebody who plans on using every single night because that is going to be the only way you're going to determine if it's actually having a negative impact on you is if you actually check your sleep metrics yourself so um you know how accurate is an aura ring or a whoop or whatever those things are for checking your metrics i use an aura ring personally you know it's up for interpretation but i think it's at least worth checking and if you're going to be doing this on a regular basis so definitely something to keep note of and in general even if the aura doesn't indicate a significant difference like personally i would just recommend being more you know intermittent with your use rather than using it on a full-time basis every single night i think it is the data in the literature does suggest that it's going to have a negative outcome on your sleep quality in the long run so just keep that in mind thank you guys for watching please like subscribe check out my

until next time my name is Alex forty babe TV and for all you connoisseurs out there keep vaping [Music] you", "RQppj42jV7M": "what is up it's your boy chronic i don't know how much of this you guys are going to be able to see in my face i'm going to try to angle it just right um it's your boy chronic we're back with another how-to so this time we are doing dry ice hash so as you can see i have dry ice in here um i've got my trim this is just just all the excess trim that was uh from hera so this is jack herrera trim we're going to be using one of the this is the 220 micron bag i have a set of bubble bags that i use and basically what i do is i go ahead and make sure all of this is in here and it doesn't slide out i make sure that i've got it all in this container sitting on this dry ice make sure it's uh really getting cold and then from here i go ahead and i give this a nice tie and now there are easier setups this is just my setup this is what works for me um you know this is just how i do it it's easiest for me you guys will see here in a second now another important thing i'm going to bring you guys over here hopefully you guys see this is this collection tray you definitely want a collection tray of some sort that's like a stainless steel or medical grade stainless steel or something uh you can collect with and uh the last thing you'll need is hey would you be able to grab me one of my business cards can you have a second okay last thing you'll need is a card to collect with i use a business card uh they're clean it's easy so let's uh start the process so basically i'm gonna scoot over towards you guys bring you guys a little bit closer and angle this down hopefully that stays there basically you just uh flip this over as you can see i mean all of that already and you wow and you basically just shake it up you just give it some tumbles thank you sweetheart business card keep it close to the tray uh basically guys you're gonna do this dry ice hash sifting for about 30 to 45 seconds maybe a minute until the color starts to change once the color starts to change that's when you're going to go ahead and collect you know do your first collection move it off and then do your second collection um basically as uh wow there's so much here as there as a it collects and breaks down with this dry ice more plant matter is going to come out so it's going to be more uncured so i usually do about 30 seconds um to 45 seconds minute tops for my first run because this is all trim and i know a lot of this is actually pretty quality i'm gonna go ahead and just do a minute so we're going to keep shaking just for a little bit longer i'm going to do my first collection and show you guys what we got so i generally also go based on the color tone so i am not only watching uh or counting in my head just like you know how i i am at i'm watching the color of the hash that's actually coming out so we're gonna go ahead and stop so i generally set this off to the side just like that take our collection card and we start collecting and we just have mounds and mounds and bounds of hash so this is uh the way to collect dry dry ice hatch guys so you're gonna watch me a few more times basically uh do this and i'm gonna do the rest with uh the rest of hera and i'll come back after i uh you know you guys will see the time lapse and everything of that but this is basically the general concept um 30 to 45 second intervals one minute max you really want to watch your color color is everything your nice golden tones are where you want to be sitting for your first run your your mid golden tones with a little green is where you want to be sitting your second run more green towards your third and fourth runs fairly green on your fifth and sixth run uh the seventh run i usually just don't even do i put the the material uh to use by doing edibles or putting it in my magic butter machine so that's how i make use of the last little bit of material that has trichomes on it so there's that so that is what we just collected um we're going to go ahead and do a second run don't do that guys do not do that barely got any out so we're going to scoot this over generally i don't like mixing these so i do actually press these separately these are my different press runs they all taste different they all have different quality for sure i press at about 190 degrees to 200 degrees for about 100 seconds and uh right now i'm using 90 micron i usually do 35 micron for hash but i have to use what i have to use uh so yeah that's what i'm using you guys will see that in the next video this one's just going to be uh the dry ice hash extraction so we're going to go for round two and it's looking mighty golden and nice still so that's a good sign lots and lots and lots and lots of heat so guys another key thing um you want to freeze your product before you actually use it this trim has been sitting in the freezer since i actually trimmed her um it was dried and cured everything was dried in here not cured sorry everything was dry so it was all dry product proper humidity um i didn't trap any moisture any unwanted anything unwanted but i definitely uh i definitely froze on my product the next bit of run we're going to be using is actually sitting in the freezer now i always suggest freezing it um you know the colder the bud the easier the trichomes are going to fall off you don't want to make it too too cold um you know you don't want to keep in the freezer for prolonged periods of time you can damage the trichomes you know a lot of people think crypto freezing is actually like really good to store your butt there's actually studies that show it it reduces the potency over time so you know there's generally if i'm gonna process um right away you know within that first three to five days i will go ahead and put my stuff straight to the freezer from um you know trimming however if i'm not going to process i go ahead and cure my bud or cure whatever i want to cure and um once it's you know cured i'm ready the day before i'll throw it in the freezer you know that way it has 24 hours to sit so we're gonna go ahead and stop this is gonna be our second collection i'm gonna kind of scoot it away from this edge here so i can set this down man just loads and loads and loads of thc guys just insane set that down right there you know what i actually have a tool for this let me grab it i don't even know why i'm not using it alrighty so now that i got my actual scraper that uh is designated for this because i'm a dingus i forgot i had it um oh my god look how easy that is the card was i was struggling with the card all right guys so there's our second run looking nice and uh pretty still gold still fairly golden brown golden still fairly tan like a sandy color with a little bit of green that's what i want so we're gonna go for our third one here in a second and i'll show you guys what it looks like and then i'm gonna get to doing uh more more dry sift hash here's the third one we're gonna same thing 30 to 45 seconds maybe a minute max looks like at this point it actually is coming to a halt on how much is in there so yep this will be the last run that i do for the trim and i'm going to trim with the used rest all righty she's getting pretty green so it's a good sign that more material is coming out than actual trichomes so we're going to go ahead and call that the last run for the trim and i'll go get actual hair bugs next which you guys will see some time lapse footage of so what the hell little fuzzies came falling down alrighty so then from here i take this out there's going to be dry ice in here and i'm going to want to as quick as possible get this stuff out guys don't touch dry ice with your bare hands it's bad it can hurt you but uh basically i take all the dry ice out because it's not done it's definitely still good all right guys we're back all right so i got my little collections and i need a sharpie alrighty so here's what i do here's third run of anything so all my third ones are going to go into this one this is how i stay organized keep myself clean and not contaminate my product it's important guys if you're going to do your own stuff at home damn it shut some of these lids don't shut whatever that's good enough um okay we're gonna be pressing today i don't give a [ __ ] about these lids so there's three there's two [Music] uh all right then let's take our product so we take the excess stuff that we did we're going to be using for the edibles go ahead and dump it all perfect so here it was seeded out so i'm just going through here and picking out any uh last seeds i see and we'll find they're healthy because you know here s ones are always awesome alrighty let me show you the last little bit of this before i go uh ocd picking through here with seeds which i'll be doing before i uh probably sift it before i put it in the stuff that's amazing so i'll show you how to prep this if when it's not already prepped and then that'll be the video guys so uh with product you definitely want to take it all off the stem so make sure that you take all the stems out um break your product up that works as well as just like you know chunking it off it is going to get broken up but i prefer to not have stem in my uh dry sift just makes it easier that again guys over top shake shake shake and you know what's up i want to say thanks for tuning in uh be sure to like comment and subscribe uh check out my sponsor homegrown canvas code which

products hitting store shelves with an exclusive look at what we should expect this October we're joined now by B and M Bloomberg's David George cos you've got a great piece on our website with all of these details but tell us what to expect so Canadians should expect a big laundry list of new products to hit the cannabis store shelves this October when they should be formally legalized a total to be exact of 17 new products and that ranges from concentrates beverages edibles and topicals there's a very long list I'm not going to say what every one of these 17 products are although we have something that you'll see up on our screen right there but this is going to really dramatically increase the scope of the cannabis market here in Ontario and we've been talking about for the past several months on the sluggish start there's been supply shortages there's been issues in terms of retail rollout but now the the actual amount of products we can disclose is going to expand fourfold from what we currently have on the market that's going to be great for producers in terms of sales figures and and the interest generated by that but it's also going to square up the legal market with the illicit market so there's been a lot of discussion how the illicit market the black market is still flourishing but once you're gonna have the same products that the black market already has in place these will be formally regulated you know great hopefully great products that will that we'll be able to squeeze out that black market player and and really generate a lot more revenue for for these cannabis producers I have so many questions please okay the first one is I understand a producer making cannabis and then selling that cannabis but when we're talking about chocolates and candies are the cannabis companies we talk about like all these hot stocks they know how to make chocolate sinan how to make candy they're learning - okay sure and and we've got facilities and they're doing that and they are yeah that's right one example I just want to bring up is Organa Graham which is a Moncton New Brunswick based cannabis producers one of the top ten in Canada and of their their capacity they've hired a specialty kitchen and they're building a special chocolate food processing plant for this particular product to have cannabis infused chocolates hit the market this October and that's just one example can't be growth the biggest cannabis company in the world is putting the finishing touches on their bottling line in Smiths Falls Ontario \u00e1free\u00e1 down in Leamington has a very high-tech automated facility to process a lot of these concentrate materials such as rosin and wax and Shatter descriptions you can read in my story I don't think we have enough time to really describe what each one of these are but but there's going to be the second wave of Canada's products it's going to be very exciting for the industry and now we have a little bit of clarity on what exactly these products are going to be and then what about the marketing like we did all this coverage around what the products could look like when we had legalization and there are some restrictions from the government on what what things can look like they're about candy and chocolate or like we're moving into an area where it's all about the packaging and the colors and the fancy titles what's the balancing act they're like well as it stands a lot of these packaging requirements are going to be that that we see for flour products are going to be set in place for these edibles and extractables nothing's really going to change as far as the proposed draft regulations go you're still going to have a very significant warning label as well as a very you know large warning sign that this is a cannabis product which is going to be bigger than the actual brand itself there is a lot of lobbying going on right now between these producers and the industry and the government to see if there's a middle ground that they can say look we get it we don't want to make sure that these products are going to be marketed to children however you have to be a little bit flexible in terms of how it can actually market this to the Canadian consumer this is a huge thing I think about I mean as much as there's demand for it I do have this fear about you know kids somehow mistaking this stuff the other question I wanted to ask you and I'm serious about this a lot of the CEOs have said they're not cannabis users are they trying these products because if taste is important now with edibles shouldn't they be like seeing if this stuff tastes good isn't that going to be the first thing the people who haven't tried edibles before think about when they're consuming this can of yeah that's tastes good it's like when you're the king and you have like a royal tester to make sure that the soup that you have is employees in there you want to make sure that so these are good so you know it's it's that's a hard question for me to answer I just they're gonna be out there they're gonna talk about how great their product is but if they haven't tried their product so so I did a story a while back for the BNN Bloomberg website we're about two-thirds of Canadian cannabis CEOs actually do use cannabis okay so a lot of that being said every one of these companies also has a very significant Quality Assurance Department where there's someone hired and their only job is to test all the cannabis products out there the company's own as well as their competitors yeah to make sure that their quality is up to stuff and as well that they're you know they're competitors aren't doing better than they are so there are people out there and making sure that what they what they're producing is actually good product I was going to say in fairness like we're talking about Tyson Foods earlier I didn't say does the Tyson's food CEO eat chicken or meat but I'm just curious about it", "-hOCqQVPIzo": "hows your neurochemistry? Hi everyone, its me your resident molecular\nneuroscientist here for DNews These days it seems that everyone is a chemist,\nand our own brains are our experimental medium. Caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol are our favorite\nlegal reagents, and some states have added a new one: THC. Tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, is the psychoactive\ncomponent of marijuana and the chemical responsible for the \u201chigh\u201d people reportedly feel. With legalization on the minds of many, we\nthought we\u2019d take a look at new data on the lasting effects of this drug on our brains. Now, I wanna say upfront that studies that\nattempt to examine functional and structural changes in human brains and attribute them\nto chronic drug exposure are extremely challenging because, its nearly impossible to control\nall the variables inherent in our everyday human lives. While mice and other model organisms share\nthe same genetic sequence, live in the same type of cages, eat the same food, and share\nthe same sleep schedule, it is IMPOSSIBLE to replicate these conditions in human studies. The next time you\u2019re looking at a news report\non a human pyschotropic drug study ask yourself \u201chow many test subjects were these conclusions\nbased on?\u201d because small studies that contain only tens of participants, are more likely\nto contain high levels of variability that *could* influence the conclusions drawn. That said, a recent report from Northwestern\nUniversity found what they call \u201cexposure dependent morphometric abnormalities\u201d but\nthey really just mean \u201cstructural changes\u201d in young, non-addicted marijuana users compared\nto non-users. This new study went beyond the usual brain\nregion activation experiments to examine the volume, shape, and density of grey matter\n(a measure loosely associated with cell count) in a group of 40 college students in the boston\narea. As expected there was an increase in the volume\nand density of grey matter in the Nucleus Accumbens and Amygdala of marijuana users,\nbut what was really interesting was a change in *shape* of the Nucleus Accumbens in the\nmarijuana users. The Nucleus Accumbens is one of my favorite\nbrain regions because it is an important connection in the set of neural pathways we call the\n\u201creward circuit\u201d. The pleasurable feelings you get when you\nsee or experience something that makes you happy is because of activation in this important\nbrain area. That all sounds good right? well, because it\u2019s responsible for helping\nyou feel good, this nucleus is also a big factor in the development of addictions. In rodents, a portion of the nucleus accumbens\nhas been shown to increase in size as dependence on addictive substance increases, and researchers\nin this human study expressed concern that the changes in shape, volume, and density\nthey observed in the 20 marijuana users they looked at may be irreversible structural changes\nthat prime the brain for addiction. marijuana use during the years of development\n(which, for humans, doesn\u2019t stop until the mid twenties) has been shown to correlate\nto lower IQ, impaired memory, and poor decision making. So when and if you decide to experiment with\nyour brain chemistry, make sure you understand that it might not just be molecules that you\nare playing with.

empowered yes to fair access now more than ever weed map says yes and stands with the fighters for change welcome back to this uh conversation for our green enterprise information education empowerment summit presented by weed maps we have a conversation with our very first guest um john and tyler sally you guys are very near and dear to my heart because um we were very appreciative when we came up with this idea and we pitched black enterprise they were like ah it might make sense shoot a pilot interview and they were like it needs to be somebody good so we're like who can we have who's gonna make sense who the viewer is gonna know um and who are gonna be really interesting and we thought about you guys and we reached out to you guys you didn't know us from anybody from a can of paint but y'all still took the time out mid pandemic to have a conversation with me which pretty much kicked off our entire partnership with them and from there we've had everyone from chuck schumer to al harrington nfl players politicians and been able to create a real platform in the mainstream for black people to talk about cannabis business but none of that would have been possible if y'all would have ignored my dm so appreciate y'all have y'all been oh we've been great thank you for having us we really appreciate or so proud of you for your success that's right and uh we send an address you can send us out the senate oh yeah definitely definitely um i want to talk about when we first met the first conversation we had was um right when the pandemic hit everything was in lockdown nobody really knew what was going on and you know people had to figure things out and i don't think there's a person alive whose life or business didn't change so from like the outset of the pandemic when we talked in april to today kind of what have been some of the changes you guys have undergone as business partners a lot uh we focused our focus more internally and within california my dad has expanded the business into more cbd products um packaging packaging uh we realized that it's okay to start off where we are comfortable and then grow so yeah that's a good way so what what we also uh ran into a bad business deal in nevada yeah um i was just trying to keep well we ran into a bad business deal in nevada of course you know people wanted to blame things on the pandemic but as you know cannabis soared at least above 40 percent during it so we should have been out in certain places it didn't work we're still deciding on whether they're being a lawsuit or not so we have our social equity partner here um greenhaven la and we put out our first um i i guess our first order yeah uh and it was on leafly uh our name was spelled improperly but tyler's gonna get it fixed and we sold out yeah so and that's because i think of the way she curates cannabis and she picks it like a fine wine and when you got somebody that cares that much about the product that they're not even like she said if we're going to sell it i have to be able to ingest it as well um since then i became um business affairs manager of uh my company called anthos and we have a great product that will be in stores and online it's called title t-i-d-l sport uh we we went to business with uh conor mcgregor so one of the things my wonderful daughter is learning from me is if you get one check you broke so you better go a couple of places and have checks and um and that's what we're doing with this is this is really big and i was always in the hemp um cbd side anyway and she was in the cannabis side but she became a packager she figured out how not to make the banks nervous um but pretty soon the banks are going to come to their senses and we'll see which one we choose we might get in the banking i know that would be amazing because then we really could do the passive income thing like right that's kind of unpacking that what have would have been some of the benefits of because i'm pretty sure your nevada partnership was with a pretty large operator right yeah that did some small time stuff yeah right and now you're focusing on more of like a like you said a social equity company in california what are some of the benefits of being able to work with a really more smaller craft grow type company the quality um can be controlled easier um we know that our clientele we know exactly who our clientele is as opposed to a large demographic of just blanketing which would totally work because it's great but now we know specifically because it's through delivery we know exactly the parameters are um how big we can reach so i think that if anything it's better because now we get those numbers and the like we get the data to understand how people are receiving our product and i think that that's a benefit that we didn't really realize before yeah the other part is we get to watch the cannabis grow here in california uh and literally all the people uh which we used to call the hood but in south central that are working inside it just gave me more pride um as an owner or a co-owner um really just her bodyguard to see this hookup between our business partner our partner chauncey and tyler and these you know the future's female i've said it before and these two black women in this business chauncey's been in for a while very well verse and tyler knows what she likes so it's it's a great thing and i think the blessing was that we went into business with another black person that believed that you don't have to be grandfathered in we don't have to ask we uh we can literally and you know we learn yeah we learn if you want something you have to take it right and kind of moving into what you were talking about with tyler how she's gotten so much better at you know identifying a target audience figuring out that relationship with them explains how much difficult that is in cannabis because historically this is a product that you have to buy from somebody that you trust so this isn't just something that you can just slap a label on put it on a shelf how do you kind of figure out how to uh communicate that story to to the demographic in california i mean at first it's hard because most people don't want to have um any kind of personal relationship with their consumers so most people think i'm crazy and they're like well why does it even matter wheat is weed um it's not especially when you live in california so i think for us at least for me it felt like it was really difficult at first for me to decide okay what kind of price range do i want to have this in because that i think is the biggest indicator of who you're talking to and once we established that then we were able to like move yeah another thing is we didn't have to start off with a thousand pounds yeah of cannabis um you ever you know when you go to a restaurant an old restaurant in in chicago or new york city they'll tell you about this restaurant in this spot you can't really see it you go down but the food is amazing right that's exactly how she made this this and let me tell you i'm opinionated to put it lightly i literally say nothing when she makes a decision i bring her i'll go get it and say your majesty this is for your taste this is for your taste and she will literally sit there and you think you're on hell's kitchen should be like no no no no throw this away like i wouldn't give that to a dog if it was like you know what i'm saying she was like yo this weed is mediciney who gave us this like she will mark down i hear it and then i go back and go oh no it didn't work out but the black best thing about chauncey and and tyler is they had the same idea anybody can sell cannabis but not everybody sells good cannabis yeah and your smoke as she would say your smoking experience should be enjoyable agree and um just it's something specific i want to dial in on it that you said tyler when you said the price point what area did you guys settle on was it like the upper end pricing was it mid uh the the mid price point not mid wheat but like the the more consumer friendly price point kind of what did you guys settle on yeah a more mid to low price range just so that it would it had some respect but it wasn't like ex like ridiculous pricing we also really want to get into i want people to start buying bigger so i'm trying to convince the world like hey buy half ounces and make more money save money but that's not really it's not yet but that's my plan is i really want to get into bulking because i feel like that will be like the future that's how a real stoner i think smokes is bulk oh this is so funny she's like jay-z she wants to sell weight she don't want to sell you or sell jobs you want to stop 3-5 no i agree i was having this conversation with someone um my company we're actually about to make an investment in the minority on brand because uh they identified that everyone's pricing themselves out in california everybody wants the highest price point flower and there's a customer who's walking into the dispensary who wants quality but doesn't necessarily want to spend what all these higher end brands are putting on the shelf so it's like you're letting a lot of money walk back out of the doors and if you look at all of the other brands in like traditional industries like let's say toyota they have lexus which is their high-end car they have the acura and then they have the toyota they figure out how to have a relationship with whatever dollar amount each customer is comfortable with and i don't think cannabis companies have figured that out yet especially in california where it's like everybody wants to just say i have the most expensive flour but there are people who want great flower but can't necessarily afford the price one of these other brands i um this was a this is an argument an argument i i'm i'm i've been black longer than both of y'all [Laughter] put together and uh and uh so i learned this one thing about it so when we're talking consumers since we're talking black people black people will go on layaway black people will buy something that they cannot afford and not pay a necessity so for us to think that black people will not invest in the better quality is a bad thought process and a bad way to continue to think is why jay-z has aces if you cannot afford it you don't drink it that's my opinion so that's why that's why the mid price i wanted to sell 65 apes she thought i was on something and i said i buy wine i will go buy a 150 bottle of wine but i'm guaranteeing you may have another sibling at the end of that night because i'm not letting that 150 get that you know what i'm saying that mentality but but what i mean by that is you we have to stop worrying about those who can't have something you you can't live in two places you can only do one you can't drive two cars at one time you can only drive one so you should drive and set this you can always go down in discounts it's kind of hard to start off at a 35 eighth and go up to 55 they won't buy it because they don't believe that your value has risen twenty dollars but if your eighth is sixty dollars and you go up to 65 they'll do that so you have to understand the mentality of a human as well and we have to stop making black people cheat we're not the proven fact is hair clothing fake jewelry cars we can't afford everybody to because we're stunned out in public that's why we got to stop that thought process that's me being older than both of y'all i don't disagree with this this thought but what i'm saying is there are more needs than there are used and because of that so there's more toyotas than there are rolls royces but guess what one rolls royce there's a sale of 40 toyota again still why choose either oil you can get both though i think that's her thing like you could have you can get better we wouldn't be having this conversation i agree with what he's saying but i i'm just trying to i it's just hard because i'm thinking about in the sense of like i want my friends to smoke my weed i want it to be like easily accessible but i don't i don't want to devalue it so this is why i'm like yeah i get it i get what you're saying i'm so there but also it's hard so it's been a conversation for sure i saw a girl wrong answer yeah i saw a girl pay 300 for hair in a bag then had to pay 150 to get the hair put in then didn't like it do not tell me about black people and money priorities right you know i understand i think there's no wrong answer but there there's a price demographic there though not even necessarily just black people you know there there's the price conscious shopper everywhere you know so and i think in that situation to your point you can't maybe do that under one brand you can't do maybe deuces 22 have a 70 product and a 35 product maybe you put a different name on the cheaper product but i do think there's a market for it but to your point i don't think you can have both of them under the same label though we should stop making cheap wheat yeah well that's the but that's also yeah because people make really cheap really bad and then it makes up everyone else why is this one cheap well because it's trash so they can't really do but you're not you know when you just want when you're just so excited about the fact that you can go to dispensary and just get what you want you're not really thinking about oh this one is bad or whatever like i have had so many stories told to me if people go oh yeah i found 10 grams for 30 for 60 and i'm like don't even put it in but i don't think this is a good idea like i just don't think and then there are other people that see that and they're like oh yeah that's definitely bad i you never know so because i've had places where the cheap faiths are amazing and then you know you go back in eight months and that's not the case so it's not consistent so i've just decided let me have something that's consistently great all the time and you can always count on me it's i don't want to have to have any like oh well this batch was no no it's at this level high level and that's why i spent so long trying to find the perfect flower for us because i don't i don't like excuses right i agree i think there's a lack of quality control in cannabis right now to where like you to your point you don't know what you're going to get you know month to month from a given brand or company right so what was your response john when she came to that conclusion though you just uh you came around to that idea no it's tyler's company she's the boss i am giving you years and years of hustle and things i've been in and didn't go into things i know i don't know but the best thing about tyler is and this is this is i say it all the time the best one of the best things about it is she understands her experiences in this life if she does it her way and it doesn't work she'll then try something else but you don't know the pain of not doing it your way and doing it somebody else's way first so she found it in herself and in finding herself and manifesting exactly what she wanted she got exactly what she wanted and so she found a weed that is uh is it 55 or four yeah i think it's 55. 55 and 8 but somebody was like 55 made well not really because the taxes were thirteen dollars yeah because it's like a delivery and it's like yeah all this stuff but the the experience was great so when i hear her say something she goes with it i'm with her 100 um you know i'm like what are you gonna say i'm i'm the vice president i'm the vice president and i and i stay in my position you can always be happy staying in your lane no i agree um and tyler i want to ask you another question 2020 is bad and bizarre of a year as it was it was a great year for cannabis right and you know now with the with the democratic senate and the democratic white house there's a lot of interest around just how we'd could possibly expand this year like what are some of the things that you feel like deuces 22 could grow into as more opportunities you know come about do you guys want to go multi-state more markets a larger product line kind of what's in store for you guys for me i think i would want to prioritize multi-state over multi-product just based off of the fact that i will dominate but i i have i don't know i think there's different flowers in different states and there's different like i want to try it all and i want the brand to be nationally recognized internationally recognized so the more that i can grow i would like to i also just think it would be cool to have like state specific deuces and you can try all the different ones so it's different here than it is here and blah blah blah i i love that idea so that's what i've been really working on what particular states would you be excited about michigan michigan um at michigan i mean there's a i have a whole long list but i definitely want to go to michigan just one like i know it'd be extremely receptive there i know um there's great flower there i have family there um he used to be there he's not that big of a deal but he has some people that like him up here and we we have a guy my guy adam who you know had us host the hash bash literally has lined up um who we would use i i got my friend rocky there i'm getting pictures of great pieces but until tyler we don't fly where it's cold so when it's not cold we'll fly there and the taste test will happen and whichever she likes and people that we trust will do what's necessary we we get it done and we guarantee that what's inside the container let me say that we try to guarantee what's in the container is what we picked so we have to pick somebody with as much integrity as we have right i would love have you guys thought about maybe like the east coast you know that's emerging i would love to see y'all tackle the east coast marketing idea because as you all know the west coast is really like cultural lifestyle type brands and the east coast is more since they're all medical states more like health and wellness i would love to see tyler jump into that because i don't think there are any brands on the east coast doing it the right way yet yeah good then we'll beat it yeah i definitely have my eye out on a few states just based off of what i've seen on like instagram and stuff like that but yeah i totally agree i have a few friends that have started um hemp collectives in maryland and they're like hey come over like really trying to get me to come over so i've been i've been researching but i haven't really fully put in any like final anything but wait you you said something about the fact that the democrats are in power now i think cannabis was doing better under the republican rate yeah i mean so this is the just understand that i know a lot of people are democrats but democrats are more churchy what's happening is right they can legalize weed in north dakota but or south dakota but not in pennsylvania um there's an issue and that right there is why i mean i'm the kind of person that's into politics and i'm really into like senatorial races because that's where stuff will change right now uh for cannabis to even be legalized more democratic states need to legalize it and the president needs to stop um you know being anti-cannabis that needs to kind of happen first because i think it it feels like oh it's super exciting we have a democratic majority um things should be moving faster but like in reality not all democrats think alike and even on top of that there's like a lot of other stuff going on that they've decided to prioritize even though i think this would be an easy win i not not saying that it won't happen but i'm just i feel like it's that push that we've been doing for the last 10 15 years 20 years to get cannabis legalized state by state that can't just stop just because we've had a new democratic majority we really have to keep pushing that pressure because states like colorado are legalizing mushrooms now and the country we're behind like we need to like accelerate so i think that the idea that you know it's all said and done this is going to happen like within the year is a little naive because people have kind of like hung back to like oh buttons in we're done it's happening and it's not happening i'm sorry but it's not happening and they still gotta push that's that's what i've realized and learned i agree i'm in no rush for federal legalization honestly i think it gives black people more time to position ourselves the ones of us who are smart enough to try to get in a little bit early but you were talking about how um you have friends on the east coast who are trying to kind of get you to come over there and i'm sure you guys get uh pitched a lot of ideas and partnership opportunities kind of what do you guys have to see in like an opportunity or potential partner to make you guys want to do business with them well we can't tell all of our secrets but they have they have to be good people yeah and we'll leave it there yeah we'll just yeah exactly i got a vibe with you that's like the most important thing and i think that that shouldn't be overlooked like internal gut feelings are probably like the one thing that's protecting you so that's like that's the main thing you have to meet a person see their all of their everything and then decide like do i even like you before i can continue because i don't i don't recommend working with someone that you are not into or as you're creeped out by i've tried it it doesn't work no i agree cannabis is more you know is you really have to be able to discern if people are who they say they are because everybody sounds like the next great cannabis entrepreneur um but very few of us actually have the resources and and talent to pull off what we're doing so i tell people in cannabis you'll get sold during a dream faster than you will in most other industries but um moving on i know our first conversation you guys had talked about maybe like jamaica and other countries that you were looking at do you guys still feel like the international markets are still attractive yeah um they're growing um really fast so i'm i'm constantly keeping an eye on germany like right now now they're letting people grow in this country i'm looking at jamaica for sure just like that is something that is never going to go away i'm always going to strive to have a brand there um but yeah we want to expand as much as we possibly can um just mainly to provide a steady brand that everyone can go to no matter where they are no matter like i want people to be like oh i know that brand yes this one just we're safe and i got you back and that's what i want to establish all the time and so you know i'm sitting around and when we went to jamaica so you have to understand i told tyler i said yeah you know we you have weed in jamaica and she looked at me what do you mean i have read in jamaica you have weed in jamaica like i didn't i didn't know another way of saying so we did this interview with her and she's like i don't have it so we go to jamaica and she saw her happening farm she just took pics he was so happy about it um and when we learned the reason we said germany also germany walked up to where we do this thing called the icbc and in may we'll be in austin texas it's the uh international cannabis business concert um uh our boy alex puts it together and we get to be on stage and meet more people and hear more things because it's about the business icbc austin in may um so when she gets to see it one of the the best thing about what i do is um she's beyonce and i'm beyonce's team so you understand be be fabulous be sasha fierce everything else is going to be on time you're going to be understanding dances are going to be on time the outfits are not going to rip the wigs are not gonna come off the mic is not gonna go out that's what i do around title so when we got to see can we even say who grows away we're not ready for any kind of announcements we're just getting ready right right now but we went to jamaica it was so good it was so good we talked to y'all after it she couldn't bring it back and we had to sit and ingest it and she kept saying i now see why you've been coming to jamaica 22 years without me no it wasn't the case [Laughter] but it is going to be when the jamaica thing kicks off because we just read the other day that jamaica's running out of cannabis um but that's another thing understanding why i said we ran into a bad business deal in nevada fine but we learned from that we learned about scalability we learned about um uh rolling blackouts we learned about uh different stages of cannabis may be great here down here it's just like the wine business so if we can get a constant grow and some outdoor some indoor some greenhouse and it's bomb well you know we're always going to have a great product always this i wish we can you know do like tabasco and make it in one place but we can't and i know when they open up the rest of the country you're going to be able to get california weed wherever you want it um we'll cross that bridge when it comes to as well because we also understand that michigan has some really good cannabis i haven't tasted it in florida uh rhoda island rhode island vermont right yeah rhode island has good has good flour really really pretty flour like really pretty yeah so and it's smarter that we only deal in flour right now we don't have to worry about anything else i've always maintained that it's safer to save a flower because it's like no one is going to stop smoking weed that's what i think people need to realize no matter how much you tell me a vape is going to be the best thing or an edible people are always going to smoke weed always it's it's it's a cultural at this point so to not bet if you can bet on anything in cannabis the one thing i think you can bet on is that people are always going to want flour so that's what i like to focus on i agree like i think flowers gonna like other uh segments will increase like edibles topicals tinctures but flour is gonna stay the same like it's not gonna decrease because people use more um other product lines but i wanted to just clarify so are you saying jamaican wheat is better than california wheat no it's different it's entirely different it there's no comparison because it's made in jamaica it has grown jamaican soil it's jamaican we don't even need to have the conversation there's no comparison at all whatsoever the thing is people get weed in jamaica from the wrong people a lot of the time so then it's it's literally you know wrapped like it's 1970 yeah we don't need to do all that but the weed in jamaica is not even comparable to american wheat we don't need any kinds of comparison we got a great bro it is so bomb i though i will say i've had some bomb wheat in the u.s even like hawaii because it's also like an island they have some great stuff going on over there but i will say i don't know what happened but there's nothing like jamaican wheat we can just this ganja yeah right which doesn't get you hot so that's what the rosters are smoking ganga and it's constantly constantly you know it's blessing the sky a little bit of whatever but we found a weed grower that also likes ganja and we don't sell ganja we sell cannabis it has to do with the air and the soil and like and the people and disasters they were blessing us yeah wow that's amazing um i definitely appreciate following back up with you guys uh my last question would be we kind of touched on it already as far as just like federal legalization and everything like that and to your point like with states like mississippi coming on board and and south dakota right places that i never thought in my lifetime would legalize cannabis what advice do you give to entrepreneurs in those areas who may look at a john in thailand say oh i want to do this in my home state what advice do you give to like the person who may have not jumped into the space yet yeah go learn from the business side first um not everyone is a farmer not everyone can grow cannabis but there are a lot of people who can so partnerships are something that are important but learning the business side of cannabis because it's been a business for years even if when there were dealers and whatever and there still are but is a business and going into it just for the flower is naive i think learning the fact that there are more older people who smoke cannabis or use cannabis in different ways than you would even imagine learning all of that stuff from let's say business conferences or just meeting with different companies i think that's like invaluable because one you're saving your money i we met people that we would go to different conferences around the country out of the country and they hadn't even started but they were like we're interested and they're just soaking up as much information as they can because i i learned about different kinds of um thc from a conference talking to a guy in the seat next to me not from any just like random conversation he's like yeah have you heard of thc a and this and tcb and g and i was like what like no i haven't and that and like just those conversations were important but also just it helped create relationships that i don't think we would have had just going in and doing it ourselves yeah another thing and so let's just say mississippi understand this about jamaica what she realized is great for her hair because she has curly natural hair but that humidity is amazing so opening your door to your grow one time in that humidity is different than opening it if you're in a cold state if you're in a cold state trying to keep that building the right temperature for six to seven months a year is an important thing so you have to understand temperature you have to understand humidity um when things are trying to dry uh you know it was so sticky in jamaica but it was good because you know we smoke out of a bomb um that's a whole nother thing too we we we like the taste of the week um i would just say that i would say if you're going to be in mississippi as opposed to being so deep back where they made moonshine figure out where you're going to grow where you can have easy access in and out if it rains and no blowout streets people who work there can get there it's hard to rob you all those things are important electricity goes out you your thing better kick on within 10 seconds yeah they better be like the government you better kick on and stay on in 10 seconds you will lose your entire growth so you you cannot have rolling blackout so get into solar and win and and make sure that you know you got somebody who knows what they're doing and wants to help you they they have to treat it like they're growing like that like they're growing moonshine like in kentucky that mentality of jack daniels you got to have that if you don't have that mentality then you shouldn't get in this business you know it's crazy because i'm from alabama and what you're saying is reminding me of an idea i've been having i feel like there are so many opportunities as it reaches these these deep south states like mississippi alabama florida tennessee because it's so much farmland there and there's so many black people there who could figure out how to cultivate and use some of this land for like hemp and flower and stuff like that so that's i agree 100 we're actually trying to figure out how we can start to partner with like hbcus to start informing our kids about this stuff now like you know there will be opportunities in a year or two or three or however long it takes but i think black people in the south should start paying attention on how they can cultivate flower with all this land that we have yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't connect any anybody to you i wouldn't tell you to go to the uh historical black universities um my friend hughie um tried that and um and it just wasn't receptive to somebody who has been training people to be in a job what you're telling people is to be entrepreneur so if you're telling people that stay away from the college let them go spend their money in the colleges and then come to your college to be educated so you should just focus on teaching in that state do anybody want to be in this business we will help you in this business this is what it costs we will give you the forms of this the this this this so be the platform let i i realized this um i said it today and this damon wayne said it and it just went over so many people's head when he was doing a lot of stand up he said black unity is an oxymoron and only a few chuckles i laugh because i know what oxymoron is uh and and when i when when somebody said that to me i was like it they said it doesn't work it does but nowadays so we don't do it like they did it in the 60s everybody should become the strongest link they can possibly be and if we link and vibe up all good that's the way black people should be now because every time this we're in one place judas and the messiah they kill our leaders so we all need to be leaders i agree and you have been black longer than me so it makes sense and good at it you've been successful at being black never gonna let us down period hey thank you guys so much if y'all could just leave us twit where we can follow deuces22 on social media um and we look forward to seeing more from you guys thank you so much so you can follow

there's a first catch there's a secondary catch when you open it you can remove the pendant okay yeah [Music] snap secondary you know hoping around Sora when it was amazing Oakland time to get busy [Music]", "HViZBkNF-uM": "my entire house is a cloud this is the [ __ ] crazy instrument I ever rolled what's up guys my name is Jeff Austin of this popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if not make sure you subscribe I got a lot of dead last videos on the way I would have failed to meet actually making this I was really stunned the other day so I had a bunch of different nuns in a jar and I didn't really know what to do with them so I started pressing them into this mold from Purple Rose supply calm and this is a press that makes you able to make your own can of cigars now what's different from a Canada cigar from a normal joint is that like instead of grinding up the weed you get little nugs and you press them into this little container pack as much of it as you possibly can in then you can fit way more and it burns way slower because it's just these nuts that are just pressed together instead of a bunch of ground-up flour but I made one of these I didn't film myself making it and it ended up being pretty [ __ ] epic I ended up putting caviar in it in three different places because I have like two and a half grams of caviar and I didn't know if the deal with it and I was like [ __ ] it let me put it in this and by the way caveat another work for moon rocks or honeyBun whatever you want to call it now I have this six gram joint that has weed three different strains of honey but and if you can't see there's this little stick that is poking through it and since it compresses so much it needs that stick sitting in there so that when you pull it out it actually has good airflow so I figured that time like the present might as well spark this up some of the message me and said this looks like a wheat tampon it's gonna fly and disgusting that's hard to get out oh yeah now you got it goin unless not completely goddamn it's living in a sentiment finger this is legit six grams it does not look like it at all with a Panikkar like this you gotta light it with a torch [Applause] that's it burning [Applause] yeah then we hit a nice I kind of [ __ ] up though because the joint paper is burning away fast on the we [ __ ] beautiful white ash in their exciting using the moon rocks damn this is a nice hit it like burned your lips as you hit it doing this it's supposed to make the joint last like three times as long as it normally would so this is really something you're supposed to do with people but I decided to face this one holy [ __ ] this is ripping it's really close to getting through the caviar I'm really excited what's gonna happen once you get to there probably wasn't the best idea to put moon rocks in a joint but I think I'd try it should have started a timer to see how long this thing burns yeah just hit the honey bub mean tell it's crazy you get hips like that and it really doesn't even burn being only when you hit a blunt like you see a nice little cherry every [ __ ] time holy [ __ ] that caviar like just these giant a trips every time and super smooth - it's all weed all the way to the end they're coming to sent me these do two different sizes this is the smaller one but it's thicker the other one is longer but it's a little bit thinner this one's a little bit less than twice alright and it's about half the width so you want to super skinny one this is the way to go but I like these shorter fatter ones this one looks more like a cigar to me this log was shorter than a king size joint so there's excess paper so I just kind of cut the remainder off and wrapped the [ __ ] up stoned and wrap the rest of the paper around the mouthpiece and it feels really nice it feels honestly way better than a cigar a lot of people ask me why I didn't make this a cigar and honestly I feel they don't smooth back woods or lungs to off them so I wouldn't do it for this and rather do it a joint if it was possible I took the risk and it worked so I'm happy I did obviously though even if you smoke the Thai sticks the weak cigars that are a pot leaf wrapped around it it's just so harsh like this is such a smooth enjoyable feeling it's like a night and day difference versus having a pot leaf wrapped around it or a cigar wrapped around them I hit the caviar like five minutes ago and it still just stayed there it has not moved like a millimeter I can see the oil burning but it is not moving it off I'm gonna be here for a while god damn I have so high so many people that sit over where you can make them up these I think I smoke my own and show you guys where to get it this isn'ta dad I really don't know how it lasts long term something they pointed out to me when I was at Shaolin in one of my previous vlogs was that they make them out of silicone so it's easier to clean these ones are made out of plastic so I do fear that after a long period of time there might be some wear on these but I just cleaned it after I put the honey button there and it was totally fine after a wife of rubbing alcohol it looks like it's really high-quality plastic so probably fun this is a really stuff that you do all the time though like this is cool but if you like are trying to party like this is when this comes into play is it last so [ __ ] long like I've been doing this over 20 minutes maybe maybe a bit of the weight room so it's gonna be a long evening I'm not gonna lie this tastes very good it is harsh and there's a mixture of strains in there so it's starting to become a little bit more raunchy in taste but in still does have a really good flavor yeah I'm gonna be really hot yes better be smoking with me if you're watching this because like it's not fair and I'm just smoking this whole thing alone come on y'all better be sparking up there I put a link in the description to where you can buy one of these for yourself people keep asking you where they can get their own but dude this is such a cool thing to watch the caveat that I put in it is melting but you can just see how soaked the paper is around it it's just oozing out of the vents that's what she said but like so much movie was coming out of this [ __ ] walk you know I got that clean white ash this was an expensive joint probably it was always that I just had set aside I had this jar where it was just like my tip jars what I always caught it then I would take like a nut from every strain I picked up and I would set it aside and at some point I forgot I had it so I looked at it the other day and I'm like oh cool I have all this extra weed I felt boring just smoking it so I was like let me do something cool with this boundary and then I did something extra cool when I put the caviar in there so I mean this alone is very intense I am so [ __ ] stoned already I'm not even nearly done it's been exactly been a minute since I sparked this and just weren't like maybe a third of the way through [ __ ] I don't know what point we're at in the actual video but I can cut up my videos a lot to make them a little bit more entertaining a little bit more fast pace I am so high my entire house is like hotbox already I'm curious this is gonna get clogged if it's gonna make it all the way to the end so if I said it good something tells me this is gonna be burning for over an hour you know gets a high end it will get withdrawing a like why the [ __ ] you doing this to me blah silly thank you for doing this to me I haven't even hit the second chunk of caviar that's right here and then we got this part right here I'm currently high as [ __ ] I think I rolled the everlasting drink similar to the Everlasting Gobstopper bull way cooler so I I think my favorite part about this is how while I rolled them out these I don't know why but it's just so perfect it just reminds me of like an actual traditional cigar holy [ __ ] I don't know where all these endless trips are coming from because I feel like this thing is making never aggression and I'm just getting hyah hyah better crazy but it's literally on the caviar right now and it is literally impossible to smile whoo damn let's go safety my party house there we go back to Prince trunk this caveat really slowing it down like if I'm not cheating on it it'll just go out right away trying to smoke this in one sitting but I am [ __ ] you're hurting I wish I knew how to make smoke tricks that would be like a lot more entertaining I'll try to show you that how bad I am this is the smoke ring yeah pretty much strata crunch inhales about all you got he kind of did a ghost but not very well holy [ __ ] another was Girl Scout cookies in this another Cresskill cookies lime stunk Juliette Jake you know there was sunset sherbert and there was one other strain that I don't remember but there were six trains in this I'm pretty sure but there at least those five I'm just rambling I'm so high I [ __ ] regret this my entire house with hotbox this is a weed rock I've just decided can you [ __ ] flick your joints this might be the slowest burning attacks that God ever smoked now what point am i smoking too much wheat is the real bush oh I had to roll it you know popcorn paper not available to the public I can say well you successfully went through the second piece of caviar I'm tasting wheat again that's just a fad I bet it'll fit in the [ __ ] drink oh yeah that worked up so high that hurt so bad that was so rough try this one more time it's weird it's not like a thick milk eat smoke but it is so uh so intense well judges they fall down the ash is so white like whatever we died according was some fire athlete pretty much everything I've been smoking recently is in Pennsylvania weed there was a little bit of a drought right now that when the dispensaries all my favorite dispensaries have like a third of the options they normally have I've never been a kid and my dad liked smoking cigars with his friends and be like man it'd be so cool it's a smoking cigar filled with lead I was like 15 at the time but I remember being like dude that'd be like the coolest thing that was cigar for weed like I would smoke in like when I'm older I wanted to do that like I imagine me being like 40 in my backyard looking a weed cigar and that's actually possible hey I did it at 25 it's still hitting super [ __ ] clean I'm so happy I didn't get clogged and we're making our way it cooks the last record honey bud honestly it's like when you're avatar and like me if she has us I know that's like there's a peak - you're high definitely hit it definitely hit my peak I'm at the final moon rock and it was getting hard to hit man like that's me repping the [ __ ] out of it and like that's still not a huge rip that nice little burn I'm actually getting to the end have the superpower where my eyes don't get red like I never use eye drops and like this is pretty much as red as my eyes ever get I definitely get the heavy eyes but they don't get red so as long as I can pretend that I'm tired I'm always good I can't believe they're closed stays like this perfect the entire time very impressed just try it cheap do this now so I can kill it the hit is so disgusting now non-durable a dog is just straight road shit's not really one for challenges but when I made this something inside me just said you have to face this one this one's just for you I was really skeptical and I lit it but the paper was gonna burn faster than the joint holy [ __ ] you guys I don't know the cameras gonna pick it up but like my entire [ __ ] house is just like a box right now the lights pick it up best holy [ __ ] it is just a [ __ ] fog house in this [ __ ] my entire house is the cloud you know those memes were think WYD after this and it's like a picture of a giant blonde the best answer is sleeping I'm going to bed if you made it this far in the video click like and subscribe because I did this for you if you made it this far we soak this together this was a connection between the two of us I buddy just bubbled for [ __ ] 20 or 30 minutes but I lit this an hour and three minutes ago holy [ __ ] definitely lasted over now this thing one eye and it's got a little fingernail left so we're done I'm gonna try to just chief through the rest of this you guys this is not providing a good tip it is too dense it is too thick it is to rock like it's not I'm a weed hit tapping out here I can't light it it's too small I know I could probably put that in a bowl but I'm too high still counting this is the dub thank you for watching subscribe click like I'm too high so [ __ ] ghost in here not just my god but these", "Crc9OKhpuNE": "I'll be rolling rolling I'll be smoking too Oh gasps my stash like I'm rolling in a stolen truck yeah you know sure we see the great thing is the bait Bank doe - jeez well guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we're back again for another strain review today we are checking out another one from Lumpy's another one a few um peas in the past but it's been a minute since we did one I want to say the last one we did was the Cali berry right yes we did the Cali berry a few months ago something like that bring it to you Lumpy's apple fritter and when i crack the jar I see perc a little bit of perp in there for sure and what is it it smells it smells along the lines of the dogs walls but is not quite that so I would say it smells kind of pervy yeah so it's supposedly apple fritters supposedly sour apple and animal cookies okay and then I think the sour apple I know it has I think it's sour D in Sydney 99 okay so yeah that's that's a nice lineage I don't know what sour apple is but there's animal cookies there's some diesel in there I just told you what sour apple is Cindy 99 Sour Diesel I'm sorry there you go sorry I agree though all the all the parents that went into that one every all stuff I would want to smoke on its own you know so that's usually a good start exactly it's better that then has like og cross with blue dream and I'm like oh why'd you go and do that - oh gee you know dude this smell is really similar to that dogs walls from from elemental wellness back in the day which is we that I love I love this turf it's actually kind of rare I feel like you know it's almost like the herbal turf but a little different yeah you definitely for me I definitely get those like sour II kind of fuelie notes in the beginning but then it's kind of more of like a sweet creamy thing like you're talking about you know I'm almost getting like as I've just broke that up I kind of got like almost like a little cheesy funk or something you know I'm really trippin on the snow guys like I like it there's many layers to it there's layers to that's a good word to describe it there's layers to the smell I'm gonna go ahead and light this joints I forgot we had it rolled I really want to taste this stuff I love me some purp great game in this thing I wonder how far we are into this video there's always somebody that comments down below the exact time and moment that one of us takes our first rip because if we're on top of our [ __ ] it's usually a minute two men in 30 seconds most of time it's usually two minutes and a half minutes and people were like hey I thought you guys were gonna [ __ ] smoke in these videos I don't you guys did high no we just blab on we're just blab blab blab but lighten up this Jeffrey here gonna get high let's see how it tastes huh definitely a good burpy I get purp on the inhale but you do get a little bit of that like almost gas eNOS I'm guessing it's coming from the sour apple or the sour deep very smooth out of the bone I like it the first and this will hit off the joints Barry I get a perfect flavor guys almost like yeah it's sweet like a sweet candy like a like a Laffy Taffy ah that's a little extreme but if I had to tie it to some it's almost like a great walkie-talkies yeah I kind of like that dogs waltz comparison that you drew cuz one that's a strain I haven't smoked in forever and I really missed back in the days when elemental had fire in San Jose that was one of our favorite strains to get from them similar parents I guess I left the cam yeah and then a vertical rise at the Kemp sister of the herbal I don't know after days Ray's dog yeah I think it was Charles about an Urkel so you get kind of that fuelly kind of more pungent thing going on from the chem whereas in this strain you have it with the sour and then you know got the cookies bringing in some of those may be sweet perk Terps not like truth no I can pure Oracle but it's a little very very hint in there to man and wife you know coming from that like great D flavor I'm getting but I almost got like a little berry flavor and there's really good guys yeah lots of lots of depth I feel like to the smells and the flavor of this stuff yeah it's been a while I think since we it may have not I don't know but I think it's been a while since we have we had honestly the best characteristic of this weed to me is the smell so far yeah the taste is good don't get me wrong but the smell I sat there and tripped on it for a minute different smell is what I am always going for you know it's always my number one criteria this strain actually won the cannabis cup a couple of years ago I want to say 2016 pack that for hell yeah y'all this trade year there you go there you go fair's fair yeah but this one the cup a couple of years ago that one was hitting out like 25 percent THC this one right here is coming in at 21.5 1/4 cultivated on 1213 package on 114 so Wow we picked this up a couple of weeks bail it's sitting on it took forever to do these reviews but I'm surprised it still has this good Terps after being packaged about four or five months ago that's really good I mean it stays like 70 degrees in hearing some of the dispensaries I'm sure go a little hot you know one of at least like that not the nice ones but yeah but we've only had it for a week or two and you know the shop it's still really they had it for four months before that so it's not usually when we get weed that was packaged a few months ago in California it's gonna be dry it's gonna be stale that's good the nose isn't gonna be there the way it is on this so I'm definitely impressed this has kind of been I don't want to say their flagship strain but one of their biggest strains over the last I don't know year - maybe longer sure this is the one that really put Lumpy's on the map for me personally and I think there's a lot of other people know yet for sure this is only my second time having it not gonna lie but the first time I believe was like you know beginning in this year maybe even like December something like that and fire both times like he said the freighter you talk about yeah the apple fritter is that what I said yeah I just didn't know if you meant Lumpy's in jail no no no that was for yeah yeah I've had Lumpy's a few other times Cali berry few of their other ones this is my first time trying the apple fritter I saw a batch of it before like one of my buddies just had like one left over and it was like a nicer nug as I look at this stuff it's some you know some of these bugs are a little bit smaller in these this particular jar that I'm looking at not necessarily the tightest no nuts what we're dense at least these particular notes sometimes if you get some like bottom or like more side note right they might just look like that if we were to see some tops of this it might be a totally different story yeah I don't know if I had to get down on rating this one I really like it I like this strain in general I think this is super fire I'm not sure if this is I do I know this isn't the best batch they've ever grown you know if you just want to go based on test results they've definitely grown more potent looking backwards some of the photos I've seen on their Instagram and from other people online I got I got a crazy little you know it's crazy sorry I just totally cut you off yeah go ahead what are you saying go ahead uncle Gard okay oh you know you're a Buddhist daughter you know how a [ __ ] beer has this always like 3.4 whatever the push there it's crazy how we can't get weed like that and do you think we will see a day that we do being that we can be able to grow apple fritter at parking the same percentage every single time well I mean there's so many variables with growing wheat everybody tell me that things are gonna be a little bit different and I think it's way easier I think it's way easier to control like every single just about every single very when you're brewing so you're saying that we will see the day no I'm saying that I don't I think that I think you can control way more of the important variables when making beer obviously I've never [ __ ] made beer I don't know anything about it but this is just what I do right now me too there are way more variables with ie just being that every strain is different yeah each one has different optimum requirement exactly I don't I don't think we're gonna see the day either I need to be able to grow the same plant at the same THC percentage every time that's not going to happen especially when you have the genetic getting weaker and weaker as you clone down I just don't see it happening all you scientists out there please prove us wrong or otherwise or other known or whatever the [ __ ] other stupid English anyways I almost rate this stuff yeah I was gonna say the best thing about this one like you kind of alluded to earlier is the nose for sure that's the first I mean and for being packaged four or five months ago and still smelling this good yeah obviously it was dried and cured properly even perfectly I would say it's keeping alone I would have loved to smell this on the plant or smell it like right after it was like fresh isn't you know at packaging time it's just to see if it was even more crazy and I love doing I would have loved to just rub the sugar that's the best part about growing at so that's the one thing I miss the most about growing is just being able to like just smell the evolution of the Terps knowing what it smells like at early the flowers date of the fire late flower stages and then like you know the color starts to turn yeah and then like once you cut it down and like after the chop and then how it how that kind of flavor just kind of like changes to that final project you know I like being able to see that evolution and like you're talking about just walking in there and doing that form is amazing so yeah we got a 10 on the smell Wow this stuff gets me high man I'm like really high sorry for the stunt 110 on the smell what's next flavor flavors not far behind but super smooth it's very smooth it could just be like more more beautiful white ash it beautiful white ass definitely that's for sure hundred percent so flavor I'm gonna give it eight I'm just gonna grab this a V you could just be more I'm gonna go with the word more really it could be it could be just more pungent I like the flavor on this one I think it's pretty good I did like it a little bit better out of the bomb than the joy let me give it one more bigger but yeah I'm gonna stick with a eight because we're running out of time on this damn video effect effects good I'm just now assessing it like I'm pretty pretty Spacey pretty a bomb-ass song right now it's very creative very uplifting it doesn't make me want to just sit here and be lazy all day so I'm gonna give it I'm gonna give it it I'm gonna give it a 9 I actually really like the high so overall I'm gonna give it I don't know if those average out - I'm gonna give it a 9 9 9 so as far as the buzz goes I cheated a little bit on this one and I smoked some a couple of days ago we kind of split these last couple notes we had up and in between these jars so we could do this video or whatever but it definitely hits me like that at first it's kind of like uplifting euphoric very like clear motivational I guess I don't know what the right word for it is but it's very like uplifting at first but at least for me when I smoked it the other day it just completely did a 180 on me like mmm and then maybe 30 minutes 45 minutes after smoking it because I was feeling like this last time I smoked it a couple of days ago then the coffin in 30 minutes later yeah yeah I guess I'm coffee'd up right now I could have something to do that overall overall I'm gonna give this a solid nine and a half nine point five yeah I like the flavor on it the smell 10 flavor I'm giving that like a 9 buzz I'm giving you no flu Niner ten everything about this is pretty much a 9/10 so I'm gonna go nine point five it's good we apple fritter from lumpy shoutout to Lumpy's for growing some good weed yeah I look forward to trying another batch of this this is something I would definitely buy me too Lumpy's apple fritter from your sister pick this up by the way at atrium down in a Southern California we actually did a dispensary tour on them a couple of weeks ago with that so check it out right up here somewhere over there check it out he'll definitely let us know what you guys want to see us review next put that down in the comments if there's a strain that you have Jalen's for us to review now is the time to let us know he's rambling yeah I might I'm showing you how to throw the Gees up right now it's like they're grabbing some titties I'm Danny guys he's Shane for the CCC 4/20 right hi hey see ya no nice home yet if I told you would I had my bag that [ __ ] will be a palm tree I got more flavors than letters this in the Alfa [ __ ] star no mids around my circle no we ain't allowed", "VfRnQBRlw2c": "we're back and we're talking about the recent surge in moms who say using marijuana has helped them deal with anxiety pain management stress all of these things that we talk about openly now well psychologist dr. sue Varma joins us in cardiologist dr. Tiffany Sizemore both with us thanks for joining us dr. Tiffany you said that you instead of opioids you've prescribed marijuana in many cases yeah a lot of the times I refer to a Medical Marijuana clinic I mean the opioid epidemic in this country is it's a big big big problem the problem with opioids is their addictive potential and it's a very small range where someone could be on an opiate for a week and they become addicted to it and they're looking for heroin on the streets whereas marijuana has a very very very low addictive profile and we see it more in teenagers and young kids that's why we try and avoid prescribing it to teenagers and kids but for adults the addictive profiles so low and it can cure or get help with pain it can help with anxiety so many things that can really help with without having to worry about that addictive potential dr. sue you know over 40 million Americans suffer from anxiety as we now talk openly about cannabis in the use of marijuana we've gone from these stereotypes of from the Cheech and Chong to the rapper to all these memes that were never real to now women of all backgrounds being able to openly say this is what's helping me function absolutely and you know 55% of Americans are saying that they're feeling stress throughout the day anxiety disorders are the number one mental health disorders and they affect women more than they affect men and in fact people that are using cannabis are telling you between 50 and 80 percent of them admit that they're taking it for anxiety for depression for sleep problems for stress what we do know is that in short-term smaller doses marijuana can be helpful for having treatment for anxiety however we don't know about the long-term consequences specifically for depression and it can make it worse for some people but alcohol for example if you drink alcohol that's a depressant right so if you're already depressed and then you add alcohol into it you're not helping yourself no no and this is the problem is what we're talking about what you're referring to is self medication and a lot of people do it a lot of my patients use alcohol or marijuana to feel better but what we want to do is look at a wider range of coping mechanisms I don't have a problem if somebody on a one-off basis says that this is something that makes me feel better in the short term right but I'm concerned that if you don't have more flexible coping mechanisms without spending in the home are we having dialogue with our partner are we getting the resources or we gots the source of some of this pressure stress and anxiety yes and I'm not dealing with the root problem it's just gonna get worse it's a great point as I said dr. Tiffany I one of my girlfriends is a cannabis counselor before I was pregnant with Moses she was like okay here's this coffee bean and it just relaxes me and she's like I do yoga I feel so relaxed I took it and my husband came home was like who are you I was like scroll within the bed I was like what just happened to me I don't know myself I had another experience and it was very mild very chill it was in the smoke form I hope I didn't just confess to a crime but I won't tell the state I was in what that said I felt completely different but most important to me I don't want to be on anything having a five-month-old and that was what was worrying me if something happened I wouldn't be able to react to Moses fast enough so this is something to remember there's different strains this is a plant that's been around for thousands and thousands of years and so there's hybrids and they're strains so an easy way to remember it for you for instance is indica is more of the suppressant kind of puts you to sleep like it in the couch indica okay and sativa is more of the stimulant and so what does it work the same way in everyone's body not necessarily no those strains do are known to have those separate properties but there's tinctures and you can do one to one or one to two and so you can kind of I feel like breaking bad episode I'm trying to measure to the point of regulation right so if you're getting this off the street you have no idea what you're fighting if you're getting it in a dismiss rate correct if you're getting it in a dispensary then they can tell you listen this is one to one this is probably what the effect you're going to get and you can play with it a little bit and that goes back to medical marijuana to their physicians that help you through this process right well and to your point doctor homer last but not least again dealing with the root problem of whatever it is in life right has to be addressed we can't just keep putting band-aids that's how we got into this opioid addiction in the first place yes so thank you both for your insight you", "G2nhsLIqFaY": "what is up guys welcome back to marijuana essay weekly episode 83 yes we got our episode right this time and today we are talking something very very exciting and close to home we're talking about the best genetics in south africa from south africa our locals our home breeds we bringing business back to south africa and we showing all you guys in the states in europe and uk everywhere um what south africa has to offer so we're just going to do a little bit of a rundown we're going to go through some instagram pages and uh as always i'm joined tonight with our chief and expert on the genetics and growing dean how's your week been going what's been happening what's up andy yeah really looking forward to this episode things are going well um i think this is such an exciting episode because i want uh you know people to be aware that there is a big breeding scene within south africa it's quite competitive and there's lots of guys doing interesting stuff and you know i think it's uh something incredibly exciting that it's happening within south africa a lot of guys have uh obviously been breeding for many years in the illegal market and now they're obviously able to come to the surface of our new decriminalized market so yeah just really really exciting and i can't wait to have a look at some of these guys that are doing all of this interesting stuff within south africa that's one thing that i mentioned in my video on on wednesday is um because of our the the fact that smoking's recreationally legal in south africa in a certain extent um the laws around things like breeding and and you sort of even buying and selling is it's very relaxed so it is our breeders okay they haven't had enough enough time yet but i think probably last year a lot of them started their their breeds um we've seen some some different uh i think f1 f2s coming out uh from some of the breeders but they probably only really going to have stable some of them are stabilized but the newer guys that are coming on and i think there's a lot of them are going to have stabilized genetics from probably like next year as soon as that even yeah i mean i've seen some guys already doing uh motherland genetics for example has die is moving on to an f3 now which is quite exciting he has been breeding i think a little bit longer than then the the decriminalization and there's people like i'm a deadly who i think have been breeding for about 30 years within south africa so but then they are like andrew said a lot of guys who have now you know started to up their game a little bit starting to increase their scale a little bit and who are breeding and like andy said you know it's uh a lot of selection has taken place and now the stabilization can start to take place um i have seen some very interesting sort of f2s grown out um if if ones as well but personally you know if i if i was to take something to the the global market i'd want to make sure that it's stabilized before i put it into into the market so i think sort of the next five years within south africa we're going to see some really really really special seeds coming out and you know it's already happening right now certain people are putting in the effort and i think we're going to see more and more guys coming on to on to the table i really you know a lot of guys are working with international genetics and breeding them locally some guys are breeding with some local genetics as well or a mix of a mix of both so it's very exciting to to be you know in south africa where all of this is happening and i'm i'm sampling a few local genetics myself i'm busy with the knuckle genetics quarantine cush i'm busy with a strain called kosher cush crossed with uh ghost train haze number five from i'm a deadly and i'm going to use those two to make my own cross uh as soon as i've weeded out the you know the the ones of that i don't want to be working with so very exciting um and those are sort of my two favorite reading companies within within south africa but there's there's many many more so yeah some of the grams yeah let's on that let's pop over to the gram um let me share my screen while it's loading up guys just remember we we uh don't get any money from youtube so like and subscribe um really goes a long way leave comments of your favorite breeders if we left anyone out just put that below and then we also have our patreon where you can give us some dollar thanks yeah and the patreon guys we have our first piece of content on the patreon behind the scenes who is andrew forte where did marijuana say start so guys you want access to that content please support the journey yeah one patreon in particular that's really helping me stick eight in uh uk with a with some tasty treats um so patreons are legendary um but anyway cool we're here on knuckle genetics um this is a south african breeder uh they've got a long line of uh quite a quite a history breeding but but they've also there's something not like they're in the medical space if you look up their brand they've got some some some quite serious uh backers behind them yeah and i don't think they actually breed in south africa they are south african but i think their uh facility is in lesotho if i'm not mistaken but yeah they they've really bringing some some some interesting stuff lots of selection um and then they've made some very very cool cool crosses so you guys can see it's very dank they grow they have a large facility um they seem to grind a massive amount of luxe lights so they're rarely producing top shelf medical grade and then the cool part is that they while producing top shelf medical grade they're also breeding you know so they're constantly working on new genetics um i really really like their seeds at one point uh we had the quarantine kush we had the uh vegetables um the banana knuckles fudge case how many of those are still around so banana knuckles has been they do small batch seats so like they come and they go you've got to snatch them up when they're available um the banana knuckles i believe has been discontinued but the dozy kush the quarantine kush and the and the fudge cakes are all still in circulation um and available i'm not sure about stock levels if you guys want to go and check them out but uh but they they they are still available uh very cool packaging as well in the seeds a lot of attention to detail with their packaging exceptionally exceptionally impressed um no i think they they they a really good brand they're very consistent very stable um you know i've only heard good feedback on the yeah the pricey seeds for southern not so bad but no not too bad for regulars they're quite expensive it's about a third they go for about a the recommended retail price is about a thousand five hundred round it's about a what like that like a hundred dollars um internationally that's spot on uh yeah um but i mean i don't have to smuggle through the borders and [ __ ] exactly and uh and for me the uh the the nice part of them being regulars is you know you can you can take them and do some of your own magic with them so i've weeded out a beautiful beautiful mail um and i'm going to use that mail quite soon so next up we have i think it's fontaine genetics or it's maybe dhaka fontaine's seeds as this [ __ ] i think this is it uh is it maybe no it's definitely the other one cool so yeah this is also a very um a very south african brand uh it's from dhaka fontaine springs up in jerseyish side they've got only regulars dieseling they've got gardeners delight a lot more on i suppose outdoor focused plants or outdoor focused genetics i guess yeah it's uh that they their main lineage is a uh about a 30 year old malawi malawi gold the dg malawi and then they've obviously crossed across in a few classic flavors with them this malawi base so all of their seeds are based around this this malawi gold the specific malawi gold and you know it's not the highest thc content lots of sativa dominance in their strains but uh i saw some grown out last year and sort of colas as long as your arm you know huge yielder strong seeds as well and for anyone who's sort of a little bit and price wise they're very very affordable so it's you know for anyone who's who's still practicing or who's very keen on outdoor who's keen to get a high sativa with big yields then i i would always suggest the the uh dhaka fontaine i don't think i'm a deadly is on instagram you have to search bushman j old school oh there you yeah yeah no so darker fontaine i agree spot on price wise you're gonna get good value and they got their gardeners to light pack which is a nice uh nice touch uh so next we have my all-time favorite i'm a deadly these guys are operating hard they grow hard they operate hard they also do small batch seeds um and you know very very interesting stuff uh when we had the joint cannabis consultants on connor on our on our podcast uh connor was saying that uh these guys actually did a phenom hunt of like 11 000 plants a few years ago so they're really really pushing it hard everything's grown fully organic living soil they produce a lot of their own for testing of course and then on top of that the seeds are also top top top notch but like once again limited supply um so when you see them you got to buy them because you might not see them again these guys have a long history of breeding a long history of breeding very very knowledgeable people very very cool uh people as well and you know for me this is one of the these this these um jay and candy are some of the top readers in in the in the country in my opinion um i unfortunately am yet to flour out something because last season i didn't plant enough and i had a bit of bad luck with males um but this season it's gonna i'm having it yeah now these look these look really really really primo and and and i think when it comes down to finding good south african genetics these guys are gonna be at the you know not now but in 10 years time when south african genetics are everything that everyone's talking about this is where it's going to be happening 100 and then next i'd like to have a look at motherland genetics we go so these guys are operating very hard there's the man himself looking like happy probably with all the dying seeds he's growing up they do a lot of like community work up in up in casino natal um you know you you see as we scroll through the feed a lot of uh they included the banana knuckles yeah they this is a banana it's afghani cush crossed with the banana knuckles from from knuckle genetics yeah that's very cool yeah and i mean i've been following these guys for quite a while we only stock one of their seeds on our website um the durban cookies kush but i've you know i'm a big instagram stalker and i've been following them for quite a bit and they really grow a lot and they seem to do a lot of education um they have lots of community projects they're teaching guys how to grow teaching guys about quality you know so that for me is the most exciting part how much effort he's putting into or they are putting into you know building a professional community um no it does look it looks top-notch i mean i mean good lord this looks like you could have it on a on a you know this looks like a seed you know when he's buying selling when you're selling a seed on a website like this is like a demonstration area of the nugs that you and then just while we're here andy go back to that image um that on that on that same image there's another company which i actually found through following i'm a deadly and that's that arcana sea company and they're also breeding locally in south africa i haven't seen i haven't seen their beans on the market just yet they say no sales strictly r d but when i found this page like two weeks ago i couldn't believe the frost levels that this this company is pulling it's also breeding check out that like check out that stuff it looks like frosty nuts bro and look at that one they're like leaf frost here so on a level these guys are operating incredibly incredibly hard nag champa dirty big dirty ex pineapple sorbet f1 so i'd like to see these guys seeds on the market i'd like to grow some of these seeds myself um but yeah i found them through following of i'm a deadly and i also you know think i mean we can just see here in front of us it's with these dank nugs frost crystals everywhere um looking really really proper and then another seed which i've been seeing going around quite a lot recently is the garden root genetics black chronic or there's one called rose wine i think here they are and he's got some very very cool seeds as well um or they do i don't know if it's a dude or a chick let's find some of that purple weed scroll down a little bit wow so there there there africana select so that's beautiful red grape i think it is f2 grown up by kyle just seven weeks into flower beautiful beautiful bud and um my brother's girlfriend actually got gifted a whole bunch of of seeds from from him and i've been following her grow so far so yeah i'm really really keen to see how they how they come out but so far it's they're very strong looking good and she's got some of that that grape so i'm keen to see they need to get one of our one of our brand ambassadors extincting to grow one of these and just get those like dank macro shots like that yeah 100 100 very very cool so off the top of my head those are all my current favorites um and i mean the list can go on there's head honcho genetics um and there's a guy called josie sico i don't know too much about him but you know guys are are really are really they're starting to breed and it's it's exciting because i saw this meme recently and it was like people were complaining about you know the people breeding with their seeds and then all the breeders one breeder made this meme and it's like this pasta and he's standing there and he's like it was like when you release your your seeds and then it was like my these turps belong to the streets you know so basically a lot of guys and when i'm when i had that me uh that interview with mahmoud from dutch passion a lot of guy a lot of the big breeding companies say you know once the seeds are out there it's for the people you know do with it as you please uh but they really different intentions uh to patent genetics when it happens they will yeah i'm sure i'm sure like on some of the more big medical strains you know the stuff like i think heavy cbd lineages but uh i think i personally feel i personally feel that dude why would you pay like how you know to take away everything you take away all the fun like it's uh the weed industry is uh growing rapidly you know it's breeding there's uh seed sales there's um uh there's growing there's you know commercial cultivation so you want to get access to of good seeds to as many people as possible but then on top of that all you know there's also land races which need to be protected which is something we haven't really said yet but you know there's this the illegal industry has just diluted a lot of the the land races but i'm sure there are still land races out there and you know i'd like to see them protected if if fossil i know guys are putting work into it but all in all i think south africa my personal opinion i think south africa has already got a lot of quality i mean we went quickly went through a large amount of um guys there you know um but i think i think in five five years we'll be some of our breeders will be as famous as some of the american or legal market breeders yeah it's going to people are going to be looking to us for for the next the next big thing and i think the next big thing is already in south africa so yeah i'm not too worried about that and then uh so i mean you guys you can you can find more information about some of those uh genetics uh you can and we do have availability of them um we don't like to blur to too much um because of the youtube and this and that and then black friday next week just want to do a quick announcement on that we're going to be basically make sure you sign up to our newsletter through our website we're

guys", "190a3E-J9cg": "top five cannabis plants for indoor growing when it comes to finding a good strain to grow indoors it's a bit like finding the holy grail while we accept that it is illegal to grow cannabis plants in the uk there are plenty of countries where it is legal and it is from those growers experiences we have based our list well assuming bob from cambridge was cambridge massachusetts and frank from birmingham was birmingham alabama and we think betty from iceland was actually someone who was working at the local frozen food supermarket and who shouldn't have been growing anything illegal we also based our results on a number of metrics including resistance to pests and mold sensitivity yield perceived medical benefits and taste which we consider to be five of the most important characteristics so starting in fifth position we have super lemon haze which also appeared in our top five best tasting cannabis trains our reasoning is principally based on its high yield and the fact that it thrives indoors as discussed in a previous video it has a subtle taste and a pleasant potent citrus aroma in fourth place we have og kush which we had identified as the very best of the og strains so why is it on this list as well because it kills on the yield front when grown in restricted indoor spaces as not everyone has twenty thousand square foot of warehouse gelato makes it to third place on our list following on from an impressive first place in the most popular cannabis plant we like this wake and bake strain one of which is great for daytime motivation and which is also popular for attributed medical benefits high resistance to mold and pests and a relative lack of sensitivity remember all cannabis plants are inherently sensitive well the female ones are anyway moving on swiftly in second place and enjoying its first mention in any of our top five lists is mac also known as miracle alien cookies we can't help but feel that so many cannabis strains were named while people were heavily under the influence it's earned its high place on this list as it's renowned for having great taste with high notes of zesty orange delivering bags of smoothness on the basis these plants thrive outdoors bringing them indoors makes perfect sense and beyond abusing them mercilessly it's difficult to screw up the growing process and the one in first place is purple punch this is a great all-rounder and though one of the strains more prone to bugs and mold its popularity comes from a combination of the berry flavor and something we haven't mentioned with other strains it's perceived medical benefits being popular with those looking for the alleviation from the symptoms of stress nausea insomnia and appetite loss no doubt you'll have a strain or two you think should be on the list of best indoor strains so let us know in the comments section below and of course if you enjoyed this video do like and subscribe so you too can become a

kids bucket list name is ice-cream new on the menu 5 euros from pluto's coffee shop in broadband yeah I like she lies it's a very nice room veteran what should i block I'm in some weird what this is is nice", "gjcGZ0QGAJ0": "[Music] [Music] which means about those are just solid you know you can see the really dark green there are the days we need a better camera but yes we can see our eyes but how much of our camera doesn't just us well we do have an Instagram exactly what bytes comedian cannabis from use will have much better pictures yes that's right all right so let's see how she rolls alright alright India I am a little bit excited about this one because I like strong guessing because anyone who watch the shows knows yeah or if it's percent indica will be nice the SLC website they've caught up mister label it Steve I say miss label because I'm assuming Highland knows what the [ __ ] they're making they printed them on the package I meant in terms of flavor so let's say the NSL see website caught it right it's very generic weed the Lima Lima Moline stand in three or four very finely nursing from the airport so very just standard weed is but wrong with that absolutely you know twenties well almost twenty seven percent is this I would expect this to be a drifting off so the killer sloth weed if it's not we will be more confused about it and yeah yeah but I asked at the liquor store as well and apparently they're getting mixed reviews yeah so my for today is Tim Hortons has really gone downhill for customer service like the regular people who work there during the day the people who've been there for years fine but you [ __ ] Millennials who work in like evenings weekend it's just zero customer service I went up to Tim Hortons last Friday and I was waiting in the drive-through for 10 minutes my tea wasn't ready when I got there and they didn't apologize or anything I was like you know I've been waiting ten minutes in the drive-through is like yeah well we got busy he seemed high when I got there - you know giggling joking around with whoever he's [ __ ] talking to hi it's 20 rolled in Tim's not gonna be a lifer now true but you know customer service is a valuable skill and none of these people seem to have it I think there's a caring factor I just don't think if you're working in Tim's even weekend care no you know if you don't care at least about you know performing your job well then you shouldn't be in that job let's be honest how often do they [ __ ] up a coffee how do me twice this week because they gave me coffee instead of tea yeah that's going in you know hours and it's yeah not have much good to say about two morons lately coffees awesome tea yeah our macaws doesn't really know how to do tea right have you tried any other new stuff like those chicken burgers no chicken but they have like the premium chicken sandwiches our bomb like shockingly bomb really yeah interesting they do want you to make goods that are all so much better than what to warm ourselves from their pre-made stuff India that's not surprising the donuts are all right but like Boston cream donuts have you ever had Austin Turner from Saudis don't have them superstore are awesome there yeah yeah welcome exactly and you get all the ice oh man like I recommend it you gotta go for a donut anywhere go to the grocery store before vandals yes Daniels apparently is quite good but not everybody has vandals I haven't eaten there but a lot of places would have a little bakery that makes doughnuts on collagen yeah yeah so it's just on the street from you I've never gone during the week per se as a traffic but once you I couldn't under weekend go grab something for everybody cos that's right no no it's just when you say on gosh no like just in that area you mean on Cottage yeah it's actually on God okay yeah they got their own blades they're no longer in in Gus's yeah I think we better Gus's a while don't be Thomas for wonderful things I'm on their social media knows about crazy pictures and stuff deaf lose it one of our old bosses from web goes there and she loves them probably Melissa oh yeah I tried not to use last thing it's a generic I'm still rolling out these and joints of this [ __ ] thing on my finger to deal with going on Thursday so if you want me to sketch a popsicle sticks I might just cut it off if I have to leave this thing on any longer it's aggravating but you know and driving and you know taking things I curse this thing about half a dozen times a day just because when I'm driving and I'm going right I'll hit the windshield wipers I'm going left go ahead the signal light turn it off or turn it on or you know go the wrong way as expected that smells like weed like shits gonna it's not a lot yeah it's like the base weed nice smoke really smooth actually as expected here well this from the feel of it like I'd almost like to go back to whichever of the islands we didn't like initially and see if they've upped their game because that's significantly better than things were just hum I can't - yeah wow I can feel it already NAFTA thirsts it's kind of creeping up and then you did watch the EOC last night I did I did have you feel the hooker and veteran all I think Felder should have won that fight I think hooker because he got the takedown in the last round that one of the fights yeah close to going into the last one yeah no belt on the line or anything that actually goes two points it's not yes schoolyard rules who's gonna leave the man you gotta beat the man they rope in and go we're gonna fight yeah they're commentating really well actually that'd be really cool [Music] right ologies apparently I forgot to turn my phone on the dog he has a hard time getting the crew together for one because they all typically have Saturday night it was Brendan job and Bryan Callen and yeah I ever see Bravo anymore he's just training people he's one of Tony Bergson's hey he is tell me first of this jiu-jitsu coach night apparently the plan is or elbows and Darcis hit on wish it he hasn't seen before know like just stand there [ __ ] that comes up counter in the first round that under but uh yeah when is that fight isn't like sorry for this mess and everything I've been allergic for the whole weekend and then there's what's the next big fight coming off the Menace on universes Romero like next two weeks from now yes so middleweight probably interesting dance playing the chance the dance-off yeah did not see the dancer but what do you mean I don't like was it on UFC yeah press conferences on weeds yet but they were over there and have a sandy and Romero when Dana doing their thing I've said he gives a little shuffle well Romero gives a little shuffle I've assigned egos a little more now keeping my real Romero is howl at 4243 cuz he that old she's a little accuse men and wearing jeans and not stretched so they busted out a backflip dropped into the place that's impressive wearing jeans it would be impressive these father years old wearing yoga pants granted yes data's looking shot kind of saying you look like he's gonna dance a little more I prefer seeing them fight but as far as on a little moment like yeah and that dude's athletic curious if he has what it takes to beat Adesanya and I really don't think he does I don't know like he's got the power it'll be an interesting fight like nobody's ever called al Romero so it's a good reason for that yes it's called out Steve may as well come for God's sakes yeah mostly just a [ __ ] throw shade on John Jones [ __ ] you John John will move up eventually he's cleaned up the division pretty much like there's nowhere to go for the light heavyweight like iam stay there and rule for the rest of his career or that he won't get old and lose but father time is the only thing beating him in 205 I also think he has a hard time getting excited for the fights like to really get in there 5 a.m. and whatever you know like the process is like Robin Hood who are these guys I think the fights like steep it would be more fun for him oh sure yeah almost eBay walks around like 240-250 he doesn't cut to go into 32 when it's lost fight against DC which I found interesting last night Wilder weighed in at 231 boxing match boxing match phenomenal case the first fight was a 12 round draw so like for the next fight they were going out fury 1 in like the eighth by TKO by the fourth or so Wilder was hurt my thinking is here oh geez the hole was bleeding so the commentary was theater theorizing he might have a busted eardrum this is a little floppy for around this is sort of like punch it together Wow he's a buffalo and then the ref step did about what his corner was gonna throw in the towel Jesus so which one it was Tyson Fury was the the champion oh no he'd say he's a champion but he was the towel art champion which would mean he stood I'd be the guy who used to be the champion I can't beat Klitschko a jet yeah so if you go in water and felt he just was but you know louder had the belt and decided fashion by with the reading because he did one there 100 and 1 tie like time zero or zero zero one time with our happened some period I can call it done we have plus they get millions of dollars the other fight of course I'm Joshua Korea Joshua would be fun in the UK I don't know anything about boxing anymore it's not not my sport at all the heavyweight division spot real good all aside yeah but just yeah it's too saturated I don't know like you'll see the least there's just specific divisions it's not you know there aren't honoured also there that yeah I'm falling every ballot yeah you're right it's a mystery and if I don't wait to Street coach we have been sort of chatty but yeah maybe maybe they're both right the NSL see we like the NSL see sees clearly I'm having some difficulty talking yes the weed works but you know maybe it is a hybrid the is nice yeah if you have odor concerns don't get this weed yes officially we you cannot to get away with smoking this anywhere in any sort of subtle or you know yeah like smells like weed here and we've never said that before yeah it is is a weed Smyly very solar quietly insatiable conversation you know the usual my shot and was like the CBD we for sure no no no it's it's an interesting it's an interesting stream I recommended happily especially liver cure the quality and strength look at the NS I'll see see the Gaelic fire right now how much was it 46:40 nice yeah yeah I notice a lot of the braces at the inner self see you starting to come down as well so that's good good for them since they brought out the 130 dollar rounds which apparently has been in a stop for a month but and there's a couple to like I mean there's Teva and I believe I've heard as well yeah and then there's a mix of a couple screens in those bags just having one thing yeah so it's a big fan yeah 9 out of 10 10 out of 10 but it's awful nice yes is but thank you very much for watching like and subscribe and become a poof eat today", "A3BR63HH0hE": "hi everyone welcome to fact versus fiction my name is trataka and with me today I have our health reporter sha Chi so sha Chi has been tracking and debunking all the misinformation around coronavirus but what we noticed was that all these debunks that we have done all the stories and reports that we have written they the king still the claims keep coming back to us so we decided we'll do a top misinformation episode around coronavirus and yes but first let us give you an update of all the statistics so sha Chi what is the status X what are the numbers as of now how many global cases have been reported so basically if you look at it it started from Jan 23 okay or China came out with its first reports with the first cases on Jan 23 and since then there have been around more than 110,000 confirmed cases with about 327 deaths across the world in 1:08 countries all around 62,000 have also recovered coming to India we have 43 confirmed cases three of which have recovered from Kerala earlier and now we have 40 active cases mr. buted across the country we have some from Delhi we have 16 Italian nationals who have confirmed cases we have another six new ones in Kerala we have two in Ladakh we have one in Jammu and Kashmir we have one in Telangana and so it's it's it's spread its across the country it's not it's not limited to a certain region right but then three of the cases have been recovered yes that's what the so the three has recovered came down from Wuhan China the epicenter where it started right the current outbreak which is started since March 2nd is basically travel history from Iran and Italy the new epicenters which have now have around the second and third highest cases of the virus okay okay okay so let's get to the misinformation that is going wider again so the first one has to do with buoyant garlic water now the claim is that if you drink boiled garlic water on an empty stomach it will prevent coronavirus so this is the claim that you received on our helpline as well so sha Chi what has the truth behind this so basically Oh garlic water has been seen to help for as a home remedy for normal colons but not for this current strain let me put a disclaimer out there coronavirus is a family of viruses right that basically have flu-like symptoms so this is stars which came up in China in 2002 more's which came up in 2006 in in Saudi Arabia and and in the Middle East are also types so this current outbreak is one such type whose source we are still researching and so the government and the whu-oh and everybody is also come up with these notifications and you can follow a couple of things but home remedies with we are unsure of so boil garlic water eyes for a normal call sure but for go over 19 not yeah okay so the second claim is somewhat similar to our first claim and it just replaces the ingredient it just says that ginger boiled ginger water will help you prevent coronavirus so again I mean is it true again it's false we have no scientific theories and studies supporting these clear till any journal does not publish such work we have to limit it ourselves to a grandmother on home remedies and then with our own precautionary I mean logic use them around there is no confirmed theory stating sick over ninety no coronaviruses will be affected will be will be prevented by these bottles garlic and ginger no skulls right right okay so the next one is about lead and it it's so claimed that we it kills coronavirus now we receive this on our helpline number and it is sort of a graphic and it seems that our news channel put it out and it seems to be a screenshot of a news channel so sha Chi what do you have to say about this one I'd like to apologize to all the stoners who were rejoicing sadly this also is false because oh this is actually a meme generator you have all these apps coming online and website so you can make up new things use new challenge when you thank you exactly so we came across the meme generator which was created from and we want to create one of our own yeah no fake new skills coronavirus yeah that's the one man so we went ahead with that right so again that's one of our own and that was actually a meme generator nothing true I'm sorry for everybody who is rejoicing and hoping that it will be legalized in our country yeah well sadly that's not happening so this one's break your own news calm yes the meme generator website right now the next one is again around the same thing but it's it's just briefly a thing go another way weed and it says that people who are drink alcohol won't get coronavirus how I wish but again this is false so the Tsarina mouthpiece dr. cusamano came out yes this article Oh India Hindi India in the papers on February 14 now the World Health Organization is clearly stated that alcohol will kill coronavirus we're not drinking it the alcohol that you find in your sanitizers within your hand robes are about 60% to 70% of alcohol and though those products are made above sixteen seventy percent of alcohol right when you use those they could stave off the corona virus they could stop them from coming on your surface right what skin surface so it's just a preventive mechanism okay it should by the World Health Organization but drinking will nowhere help it there is no theory as such as claiming stress right right so drinking alcohol is like not going to help you cure corona virus going on to the next claim it's at all and I am very much sure that you've received this on your whatsapp and it says that that all already knew about corona virus and it's already prepared so Shachi what is this emphasized in the first disclaimer that I made could one difference between Corona why doesn't go with 19 yes that all we reached on the record banks or the manufacturers and at all they clearly put it out saying that we are sure to deal with other families and other strains of corona virus not the current one they they're not denying that won't work against it because they've not gotten this chain to work on yet right so they have claimed that if the chain is available to them they'll run a series of tests and then they'll be able to come to a conclusion meanwhile these coronavirus they are talking about our other strains which they have actively been useful against sure the current strain no right now the next one is to do with ice creams and cold drinks so can a black if you don't eat ice cream sort of you don't drink cold drinks does it help you prevent coronavirus nothing as of now either again so you don't we had this home remedy of normally avoiding cold food and when you have a cold yeah so taking all those grandmother theories in disguise everybody has just been tasting them about garlic ginger yes so similarly ice creams and Co will prevent you from a pool but then if you bins around been around a person who's unwell who probably has the virus God knows I was going to say this like stopping ice creams why why derive why you know did I keep yourself away from such a pleasure shirt rate okay so this is the last one and it is actually an advisory from the Irish ministry and this one supposedly claims to say that arsenic cim album will prevent you from coronavirus so did the Iassogna Street really come up with this advisory and yes the Ministry came up with this advice that is stating some Ayurvedic medicine some punani medicines some homeopathic medicines which will help because in India as you know we have different schools of medicine so ayurveda homeopathy neuropathy are three of the main ones and a lot of practitioners do practice o these schools of medicine now Irish ministry is gone ahead and started the distribution of these tablets as well arsenic yes absolutely Melbourne forty they say that you can zoom one of these for three days on an empty stomach and that will prevent you of sorts from the virus but if you are still showing symptoms you can repeat the doors on a doctor's recommendation right however o true and however it talks about prevention it is not supported by the World Health Organization and secondly we did like a search on the major web bottles of a major medicinal portals to see how true disclaim stands right we did a PubMed research we did oral surgical just run through how true it is and we've not found any studies suggesting that these tablets help any sort of infection for red cord 19 any sort of infection the only study that we came across was about how these were used in neonatal calves to clear diarrhea okay right which is from human so right but for human use nothing has come out okay so these are the claims that are really going viral on social media and maybe you should check before forwarding all these messages but before going off we would like to tell you what are the preventive measures then you can take to prevent coronavirus so stretchy can you just take us through all those the first one is as I mentioned yeah cleaning your hands with alcohol-based side or the hand drops now again another preventive mechanism you have to take into consideration is and alcohol could dry your hands so the regular normal soap and water is the best way to go about it and keep your hands wet keep you know keep clean them and all of that secondly when you're cuffing or when you're sneezing cover your cover your face with a tissue or with a flexed elbow and don't necessarily get into the fear of the masks because the doublet is also stated masks only for the ones who are already sick not for the ones who are healthy right thirdly or if you use a tissue and miri throat is also those that are exactly why will you save yourselves but everybody right then if you're sick if you know somebody who's traveled abroad or if somebody is showing those signs do not be in close proximity with them and just for your sake save yourself from it next don't eat undercooked or off food thoroughly cook your vegetables meat and eggs because we don't know the source of the virus yet yeah and finally avoid attending large gatherings like I wouldn't exactly own political figures are not going to be celebrating whole you tomorrow yeah most of them are not oh yes so they've they are imbibing what they're asking us to do and finally if you have symptoms please don't self-medicate daughter is the only important they have studied all that they've got that degree for this reason so guys you sanitizers and follow all

back at you with another concentrate review here in Illinois this time I have some Verano g6 live sugar this is gonna be super short and sweet but basically I just wanted to check out what Verano had to bring to the table and I have to say I was pretty disappointed this first time around right out of opening the jar I noticed that it was really messy poor presentation so I don't know if there was some sort of packaging or manufacturing issue but this stuff was like running all over the sides and really sticky and just wasn't super good presentation in terms of smell I didn't care for the smell coming off of it at all either it had a really strong musky sort of swamp like aroma very strong smell but not a pleasant smell to me and the taste was very reminiscent of like RSO or vaped flower it wasn't a super amazing super turkey experience like I would want so overall this stuff is a bit of a disappointment I don't know if I got a bad batch because the manufacturing I like I said was kind of weird it was very sloshed around and very messy but yeah that's all I have to say about this one I wouldn't personally recommend this g6 but maybe I just got a bad batch let me know if you've had a different experience thanks for checking out my video give me a follow on Instagram if you like the content and until next time stay safe and stay sane everybody", "QQWzE6LSGDQ": "[Music] [Applause]",

be dangerous sweeter of San Diego's infinite cal cannabis testing lab is opposed to using cannabis testing labs to do coronavirus testing an idea being considered now by some within the cannabis

possibilities david winter timer runs pacific STAR Labs cannabis testing facility in Los Angeles he believes that with proper accreditation and safety training on handling samples Kovach 19 testing

your own strain uh uh your own marijuana line right cannabis yes man it has a beautiful packaging it the packaging is beautiful the the high is euphoric it is a it is a hybrid l is a sativa guy i'm a heavy indica guy my mind moves so rapidly and fast that i need something to calm me and focus me in and l is um ella's he's his stimulation so here's the sativa they did on cookies and lemonade did an amazing job creating a hybrid people are loving it people are live and smoking now i just got to push our governor push the people under the gold dome here to not only allow marijuana because it's going to grow into recreational usage we've seen that in other states but there needs to be a presence of african-american ownership in georgia marijuana we have had young men served 10 20 30 40 years and then they get out and they cannot participate in the trade that they helped build that's like a moonshiner who brewed shine through prohibition not getting a chance to have a liquor license we've done that mistake before so i want to demand normal other marijuana organizations out there to get people of color on the forefront and i'm going to be frank and say black folks deserve a big state we deserve at least 25 percent of the marijuana industry because it has truly been built on our backs and we need you know we need more mad men that are owned by men that look like me so i want to demand that progressives and especially black democrats that are out there start to demand locally marijuana policy on a state level that is inclusive of the people of georgia is 35 black 35 percent of the licenses should be for black people i want to challenge joe biden to do what bernie sanders said he would have descheduled it the first day of his presidency you have the power of that pen to invoke things like gun laws you should have the power of that pen to take it off the schedule one list so that if nothing else is decriminalized to the point that kids lives aren't being ruined today i want to do a national day of protest my day is my my birthday is 4 20. let's everybody in america who smokes rain on our cities in the streets and instead of fighting and wilding out that day just light up a joint and blow some shotguns at the police that show up", "bP9emR2escY": "[Music] what's up everybody thanks for tuning in to another cannabis review show with david we're looking at some synergy it's a purple grapefruit haze oh wait it's pink grapefruit hey yeah my apologies I'm gonna take my sweater off down here I've never heard of I have an idea a dominant hybrid but you know the usual NSL seaweed texture there just crumbles up in your hands not much problem with the stems poking through when I roll joints these days which is nice well generally but I mean even even when I forget to with the NSL seaweed I find it's dry enough that it just kind of crumbles all right a little bit yeah that's our new rulers I highly recommend us removing the stems altogether of course everybody out there should already know that stems and seeds yeah exactly you want to save those seeds folks I don't think they have never stumbled across an NSL sea seed by accident and any of the containers I'm open to they sell seas I don't know actually sell seeds or not there's nothing I've looked into I know they have they have sprays now like the THC spray is like the same as the BC people yeah all right yeah so friend to who's trying that and they recommended for very very light weights let's praise for like one spray but you know people like us probably for 4 to 6 I would say yeah I think I think the spray might be a good a good shot as well like tastier now work I haven't tried those one on set but the last the last sample I got from BC was was not as bitter as the first one I tried to put some basic cedar tree no all right well it did but no as much still not selling me on it now it's fine but I mean the effects are almost instant it takes like 5 10 minutes to kick in because it's gold absorbing through your mouth exactly yeah and it guess I basically goes right into your bloodstream it's like yeah it's not it's a that's what's well I don't know what the what they're using it or what they're calling it but my friends in BC call it a nano emulsion which we've discussed briefly previously but how does an animal mostly live in a deal with these to emulsify no no she explained it to me but I am NOT a scientific person at all so the details we're sort of lost on me and that was many months ago as well and then I kind of smoked a lot of weed exactly exactly so here we go alright and then if you check out our Instagram or picture this button it's actually really nice little thing if you've got it under microscope which we have pictures of on Instagram yeah it is a very nice lights canvas reviews it's just the same as a channel so please do check us out also an Instagram as well I know a lot of people are asking for for pictures and generally with the camera quality we have we can't i mean we've tried in the past but we can't really put it up to the camera and have any kind of clarity or focus on it so you know the best place to go and check out the pictures is definitely gonna be our instagram and in terms of smell it cracked it open earlier yeah it smells nice you can definitely smell like the citrus of the grapefruit on there yeah and if it is grapefruit haze I would have to think the half of this hybrid is it the old yeah it's the the grapefruit strain and then the the super silver a super super Silver Haze for summer haze is great I love super Silver Haze everybody fruit before never had super Silver Haze but it's a it is like I saw it sativa dominant hybrid which is like that doesn't seem like a very common thing these days like I said everything we've been getting lately from from the story all seems to be Hindi coasts which was pointed out to me last night but you know not by any kind of design we're just grabbing random stuff yeah yeah I've got a soft spot for really ganking because that was purposeful on my own oh yeah that's fair well I I know design the Mayan yeah yeah and then this one was basically three strongest when they had I hadn't heard of oh interesting yeah alright then I also have a soft spot for any sort of citrus sweet so like the sour tangi but for a little super orangie I enjoy this stuff I enjoyed this got some citrus to it that's very yeah nice and up a few things I do like to let the NSL see we can go with hey I don't want a flavor profile which used to be impossible oh my god Holly and tell me what we visit oranges don't just laughing it what do you have on that oranges what are your first sort of thoughts on the first inhale it looks like it's gonna be a strong you got that little catch of the throat nice later kind of not an overpowering flavor at all or earthly that's expected yeah it smells more citrus but tastes worth it God will sweet do I find there's not bad at all no you catch you up see last night I did a watch part of it here with you yeah you know what the end of the thought like is did which yeah with Israel Ibis on yeah and was he coming gasp all right yes good fight really good a war they sure did I expect him gasolin to come out on top in the well not in the end but you know from the from the first couple rounds it looked like he was doing very well and that ended in the first I think yeah yeah first time Israel's have really been a deep-water potentially like she's no.17 and no.18 no 17 and there's this alignment first championship he's got the interim bail so whatever Whitaker comes back they'll fight for the middleweight championship so that'll be a good fight to that's coming up probably later 2019 but only six months or something yeah depending on how long it takes wicker to recover from surgery and whatnot and whatever's wrong with us and you'll be sent by ground fire oh yeah yeah he's on 90-day medical leave for sure don't even not ma'am like usually when they have a five-round fight that enough injuries at zero for six months oh yeah like it's one of the problems of the five render is it's such a grueling war is like what leaks are out for six months afterwards they're not always up for six months but you know like after a five iron warlike GSP was always fighting like six months to eight months later so you took three months to recover and then you know he never stopped dreaming but I imagine a lot of fighters are very much the same way that seems to be as you move off you want to fight class keep developing more champions always fight less it's the way it is boxing's the same way a box in a fight relation to fire no no they put together the money fights for boxing so what I always enjoyed more about UFC you know there's there's division so there's Deena Deena actually makes the fights versus like promoters for exactly you wanna you want you want your fighter to have the championship but you want them to keep it and have easy fighting so he's got the longevity but you know see it's not like they they fight every three or six months most fighters not my brothers to do I believe this Dana has to offer three flights a year yes to kill anyone yeah really yeah like the Diaz brothers for example he's offered them fights and he's never had to pay them because they just turned a fight yeah sativas always weird me out because they're so like but it's definitely like going in my head immediately oh yeah for sure so make it way more of a sunny day type we like something go to work or something whatever you want yeah I wouldn't say work for this one maybe maybe shouldn't smoke we can go to work depends we I wouldn't advocate for that you know depending what you're doing I know call so employees do so being a former cult center employee myself has I'm sure 90% of people are these days whatever you need to do get through some of those places manually feeling like the thing remind you after every shift or bath we'd like the manager to have to give you a hug as you're left because you've had a bad day Jesus oh man the other stuff doesn't have anymore it's all a mere sexual harassment now thank God for that there's manager-level more [ __ ] hurt me Oh in the headliner in last night and max all the wipers Dustin Poirier another flat round decision yeah and those two [ __ ] killed each other actually Poirier got definitely got the better of Holloway he was just seemed a sign in a little cleaner but like it's not like for you it wasn't lame it bad no it's true but you know like the third the first round like the dominant round for a for poori we're very dominant right kindness but that's I think one always sort of traits putting emotes a bigger problem yeah I'm happy with it so far we'll pause this for a few minutes me has an effect I'll let you have a feel for the score anything else you want to say there again until we come back all right welcome back and so the initial hit was pretty hard but I'm coming down a little bit a little bit still content yeah still very content but a less strong than we've expected like in terms duration yeah yeah it seems like we've done probably hour and a half yeah I'll do that great way to sort of go through life but not a go to bed weed at all if you're newer have things to do when still want to smoke I'd say this would be a good pic know for sure for sure um way more friendly than some of the pushes we've been smoking yeah yeah absolutely it's not a knock you on your ass I don't we yeah not really hit you it like smashing the place indica I've smoked it a few times already just because it was he or no well yeah exactly overall have been happy with it nice what would you say give it a score that's a seven and someone gonna have exactly yeah yeah alright good get to get to work we'd but yeah so please like subscribe join us and we will tell you what to smoke but not to smoke and haven't helped you what to avoid if they released terrible products yeah absolutely thank you thank you very much become apathy today", "8tJc4_BBDVg": "what's up guys my name is Nick and welcome to another strand of you Saturday for the CCC 420 so today we're gonna be looking at some lotto number 41 and I'm pretty excited to be bringing you guys this strain pick this stuff up from cookies SF in San Francisco burners Club pretty much oh-ho-ho-ho and it smells fantastic right off the bat I could just say this dump is so exotic smelling super loud they have a ton of gelatos their cookies SF server everything you know that the cookie family's growing right now and this gelato 41 is one of the best I gotta say so the genetics on gelato is it's a cookie fam crossbred buy the cookie fam most likely bread by [ __ ] and chevensky and it the cross is Girl Scout cookies cross to the sunset sherbert Girl Scout cookies this F Wonderman cross on Flo Rida og and sunset sherbert is another cookie fan project strangest girl scout cookies crossed with pink panties so this strain is grossed out we use cross pink panties cross back to Girl Scout cookie so a lot of cookies but a lot of exotic genetics as well but this this stuff smells calm than those crazy Yuli fruity nutty creamy it's intense [Music] let's take a rip though to get nice and baked and taste the Strand guys alright Cheers [Music] Oh it almost not finished that one guys there Oh labor Wow this strain it tastes awesome I mean crazy flavor but the looks on the string are pretty awesome guys definitely gelato is a really unique look compared to the cookie strains cookies usually has pretty large or calyxes pronounced parts there's a launch now it really has some more rounder mugs it seems like the canvases are really reduced but definitely have a lot of cookies characteristics in there this this batch of 41 is a really really purple super covered in trichome just caked up but really a darker purple color but and just rock-hard super dense nuts I gotta say out of any cultivar I've ever smoked gelato has to be the densest I mean it's not overly dense or like it's compressed or anything here quite just the amount that each nook ways and how much plant matter actually is packed in that small space this stuff is just so dense and it comes from the cookie characteristics definitely the smell guys is yeah this stuff is loud like for real some strains are just above others you know in terms of their chirping profile how much they put off and this strain is totally up there I mean it's an incredible creation by the cookie fam the pink panties is something else it really adds a craziness to the sherbert and then you cross it back to cooking the potency the smell the flavor it's all just you know multiplied it really is up that one rip I'm pretty much already in the day's stuff is really medicating really stony for sure this me definitely as an indica totally overall similar to cookies you know you get eyes really lowered let's take another rib here taste that sue this stuff tastes great there's a few different phenotypes of the gelato that are out right now there's like 25 33 41 and the 45 and there's a few really exotic cuts like guava gelato and mochi I don't even know the cross on mochi but I gotta say I've smoked pretty much all of them and the 41 seems to be my favorite this is the what sure bin ski has coined the Bakke of gelato which means hazelnut gelato and I can see why they named that guys on this smell is intense it's gelato if you smoked gelato you know it's one of the hardest smells to describe it's crazy I would have to say it's really nutty it's very nutty like a pistachio almost like you're smelling it back mustachio super nutty a little bit of mint tons of fuel but it's and there's a lot of like sweet fruitiness in here as well I think that comes from the peak panties and it's also really creamy I mean there's a reason they named it gelato and it's totally creamy very different than cookies actually a totally unique dripping profile alright guys let's pick this group here of the number 41 just locked oh here Wow huge lung expansion I mean gives you tighten lungs you can tell stuff is hi testing hi THD come but oh my god that flavor guys came it is just nutty nutty nutty creaminess to the max really close your mouth entirely I mean just straight creaminess if you smoke herb or gelato you know it has a really sort of exotic creamy ice cream flavor this the gelato definitely has that but this Pacquiao is is really heavy on that nuttiness and then locked enchiladas are the 33 out I also feels pretty nutty definitely has sort of that sherbert taste would just sort of earthy fuelie sweet and it takes the cookies flavor to another level it really changes it ooh and those two risks I'm [ __ ] baked it's really heavy in my head right now totally you know changing my perception but it starts off with more energy but totally a stone feeling but you know 30 45 minutes you get intense relaxation intense sort of more sleepy you know indica effects to finish off this ring here that expansion that's most great as well I mean this is grown by cookie fan members and I'm sure they do it well because it burns a nice white ashes burns real clean and smooth I'm not too harsh in it where the flavor is totally there so I'm I'm sure the stuff you grow well but completely medicating affects guys I am feeling it weirdly really strong I know this strain has tested pretty high before not sure the exact percentage on this one but it usually tests like around 25% or more and the effects are whole just honestly if I had to cut it bad come down to the Ice Age gelato probably is the strongest cultivar cannabis that I've ever smoked you know when the cookies is already one of the strongest ever smoked and the sherbert takes it to another level so gelato it's really just so incredibly strong but I'm glad I got to bring you guys this is gelato number 41 straight from San Francisco true cookie femme genetics if you guys liked this review please give it a thumbs up you have any questions please feel free to drop you down in the comments and I'm gonna take one more rip of this gelato number 41 baki a gelato and sign off but thanks for watching guys and stay Stoney peace [Music] [Music] [Music]", "QFilBdqV5V4": "My name is Mark Burek and I've been fighting Parkinson's disease with Albany Medical Center and the Parkinson's Research Fund. 2007, I was delivering mail and it was in the winter time and I turned around after making a delivery to this house and I saw my right foot was leaving a drag mark in the snow. About a week or two afterwards, I was eating dinner and my wife noticed how slow I was putting the food on the fork into my mouth. Well my next step was to go to my primary care doctor and I saw him and he sent me to Dr. Molho. When Dr. Molho diagnosed me with Parkinson's, I was shattered. The Good Lord has a way of getting your attention and steering you back towards your purpose and that's how I looked at my Parkinson's disease. We have what is called the Hope Soars. And what Hope Soars is is an advocacy group. We've been over to the Capitol in April. Get Parkinson's recognized through the declaration of April being Parkinson's Awareness Month. Dr. Shin and Dr. Molho have been inspirational. I never knew that in our own backyard so to speak, that we had such a dynamic thing as the Parkinson's Research Fund and the work that Dr. Shin and Dr. Molho are doing for pretty much the eradication of Parkinson's disease. The Parkinson's Disease Center was formed in the late 1980s to provide specialty care to patients with Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders. We're primarily a clinical program, but we also do research into new treatments on Parkinson's disease. We collaborate with researchers in the lab. Mark has really helped the raise the stature of our program. Right from the beginning when I met him he said to me, you know, what do you guys need? And how can I help? And so in the process of helping us he has formed relationships in the community. He has formed community programs for our patients and other people with Parkinson's in the community. And he's raised money for our research program which is incredibly valuable for us. Mark and Ann Burek and Hope Soars has been fantastic as a resource for supporting my lab research at Albany Medical College for Parkinson's disease. We currently have about six projects ongoing. And ranging from anywhere, new targets for therapeutics, such as deep brain stimulation, to understanding what's going on in pathophysiology and Parkinson's disease, such as these brain oscillations. What forms brain oscillations and Parkinson's disease? The people that work at Albany Med like Dr. Shin, Dr. Mulho and his staff and the work that they do for people with Parkinson's is amazing. I would like to thank them for helping me fulfill my purpose. Our purpose is to help people find a quality of life living with Parkinson's disease. Give them the best shot that they have to live a decent quality of life. Parkinson's disease does not have to define you. It's how you fight it that defines you.

i was trying to raise it up a little bit so i put it on my grinder and yeah so let me take this off and get comfortable since it's warm in here all right let's start that over welcome to the chat this is iced out images and uh yeah with another product review so i decided that i was going to try a different dispensary today so then i started looking around at their menus and how far away they were and what the time was so i ended up just going to the [ __ ] same one i always go to so this is from new standard um and as soon as i saw it i was like you know what [ __ ] it i'll try this one and i'm ecstatic that i did because i love the packaging like i love what i'm looking at you know just like some of the other packaging when it comes to the dge harvest house premium flour um alpha buds like their jars i really liked so i was so geeked that i didn't retain any of the information that i that i did find looking um i didn't find much so i'm gonna keep looking um so i'm just gonna make my best assessment from it right from hitting it and everything and then i will let you guys know in the description below everything i found and see if it agree uh if it coincides with my assessment so i was gonna do one of these but i'm gonna wait on these just because the packaging all right so look at this so i'm gonna get to right come on where is it lemonade family farms 826 east kalamazoo street lansing michigan 48906 area code 517-580-4568 i got this from new standard here at nine inch on r in hazel park um but as i said i dig the packaging you know it's just different with all the illuminati stuff going on so then i got a sticker up here and another sticker here so i'm pretty sure the strain's name is it's from lemonade mk ultra and then in quotations it says mandarin cookies you know so i'm going to go with it's mk ultra you know you might be able to zoom in on that and actually tell i don't know so on there it gives me my net weight which is three and a half because i bought an eighth it's got a batch number and a batch date 03 11 2021 new standard hazel park and then we look at the bottom one and it says 42 degrees pro processing mk ultra three and a half grams and i got a metric id a source tag a test tag a test facility at veritas laboratories test eight was two nine twenty twenty one harvest state was 12 25 2020 thc says 28.191 percent with 0.06 cbd activation time says immediate um reported value of thc cbd may vary up to 10 percent see that 10 [ __ ] gets me every time it's like 10 of my favorite 10 in your favor because if i'm buying it at 28 thinking i'm getting some top-notch [ __ ] and then i turn around and i find out it's only 18 well you you might be a better quality than this one but your thc levels are the same so i could save myself considerably a bit of money um going with the lesser one just stating i'm not gonna but i could so now we're gonna open up the package and see what's inside and it says in a couple different places conspire with us and then www.lemonnaughtylethnom lemonotomy.com you might be able to see it right right in that lower part right there i don't know it's probably too blurry all right so let's open this up oh it says conspire with us right there also and there and there oh there's a piece of paper in here all right let's see what that's all about before we go into the jar actually this is kind of cool nice illuminati family farms for illuminated eyes only welcome to the lemonade family we are pleased to invite you to conspire with us to begin your illumination simply unseal this jar open your mind and inhale the fruits of our labor it says mk ultra then under it it says girl scout cookies equal mandarin sunset f1 durbin equal og or it's got the equal symbol but it probably needs the x symbol to say that it's crossed between so durbin so mk ultra girl scout cookie mandarin sunset and girl scout cookie says durbin poison and og kush mandarin sunset says orange velvet and rijuana cage wanna so this is the front of it you know there's the little tree and then on the back it says fbi finds nixon aids sabotaged democrats and it's got a whole little little story [ __ ] thing on it and then at the bottom of this one it says conspire with us again so that's that now let's actually pull out the jar i like that that's nice nice little mk ultra little jar a little different than the ones that i'm used to blood looks phenomenal there's a decent stem in there but whatever it all grows on a plane sorry about the length of this video for anyone that's stuck around this far i am getting to it that is very sweet almost sweet and citrusy man that is yeah i don't know if you can really get a good view of that bud so very very crystally lots of lots of cannabinoids tetra orange hairs light dark greens decent-sized stem smells [ __ ] delicious so we're gonna take these other two smaller ones out we're gonna break those up and see if we can pack the cone with those so we're gonna start on that so as i said i got this from new standard today um shit's phenomenal well looks phenomenal that's what i should say i can't say it's phenomenal because i've never tried this brand let alone this string before now i've had durban poison i've had girl scout cookie i've had uh you know this says mandarin sunset i've had sunset sherbert i've had a couple different sunsets to be honest sunshine sun sunset sunshine number four sunset number four some [ __ ] like that still using the green monkey grinder that i got let's see can we do that and use this as my little grinding tray i left my uh uh wolverine one inside the house my tray actually all right that those little nugs broke up pretty [ __ ] fat i'm actually probably gonna get two cones out of that let's move that away from the edge just a little bit pack this up as quickly as possible [ __ ] dry toke it hit it and say the best information i can give you guys what the [ __ ] looks straight fire smells good has the looks and hopefully it's got take actually let's use the one from the hat got the new raw hat from uh the vape shop by me so it comes with one of these actually in the hat pretty cool tapered so it's kind of cool nifty little thing i don't know if i specifically want to always walk around with something that touches you know has weed paraphernalia but [ __ ] it we live in a different day and age now i don't really [ __ ] care almost done so what are you guys smoking on what what what disciples are you going to uh um what strains are you smoking on what strains do you recommend all that good [ __ ] i have a xj13 platinum vape you know as long as they save it for me like they said they're going to i should be able to pick up a uh xj13 platinum vape tomorrow i was gonna do it tonight but i wanted to get home and just do this after spending the money on it all right dry hit time i know i say the word sweet a lot that's why i'm trying to come up with other words but sweet very very sweet like oh man i can't wait to taste this i think this flavor profile is going to be right up my pro right up my alley for what i typically enjoy so here we go and not knowing whether or not it's an indica sativa or any of that because i didn't look per se when i was actually at the place i want to say it's a hybrid though man it's just got that potent [ __ ] taste to it like i mean just straight potency like how do i describe it um almost like a verbally i don't want to say piney but kind of in that family of descriptive words you know it's like it's got a nice sweet scent but then it almost has like a herbal peppery almost like a like a peppery spicy taste after that is good that is real good i like this i like this one a lot packaging the nice little piece of paper with the extra [ __ ] on it oh damn uh you know the box i'm just seeing if i could see if it said hybrid or anything on it um it says craft cannabis best kept secret best kept safe um on instagram at illuminati family farms so you can hit them up on there check out their [ __ ] as i said you can go right to [ __ ] new standard you can pick up uh you can pick up this very [ __ ] jar i've got um if they've i think they've got more and these run at 55 and 8. and that's not bad since i just paid 60 for some gary payton the other day so uh i can't say 55 is bad for this this is [ __ ] same ballpark as that for sure i actually think i like this one a little bit better just because of the flavor and oh my god [ __ ] blitzed so i'm feeling it heavy in my eyes dry mouth to high hell i can't wait to break open my mini fridge but i got this table in my way right now um gravel pop [ __ ] but holy [ __ ] it's really good i could smoke [ __ ] back to back dubies of this [ __ ] but i don't know what kind of high it's going to give me at the moment nice mellow smoke not too thick i wouldn't say it's a creeper i'm definitely gonna say that it is based on how i'm feeling at this very second i'm gonna state that maybe a 70 30 sativa dominant hybrid could be far off base based on the uh i don't remember every single strains uh [ __ ] so i don't remember girl scout cookies specifically whether or not that is an indica or sativa um but one of my friends told me that typically the ones that have all the sweet tasting stuff and 10 that tends to be the uh the indicus so um

management so I see patients pretty much all day long so what we're gonna talk about today is CBD medical cannabis and we'll just lightly put it as herb to make our lives a little bit easier right now to cover everybody in the room and their questions I I wanted to name this being blunt I was overruled and then my next option was up in smoke and that did not go over so well either so the cannabis conundrum it there you go so we're gonna go through today recognizing the difference between HAMP and marijuana looking at the differences between indica and sativa knowing the difference between CBD and THC looking at the endocannabinoid system and exactly where these things are working looking at different products dosing and especially side effects what we know and what we don't know looking at safety concerns and things that you need to look into before trying some of these medications we're gonna talk about kratom I don't know if anybody's heard of kratom but that was a hot trend last year and that's one I want to at least have the safety concerns out there discuss the legal and social concerns associated with cannabis and then talking about applying wellness and lifestyle techniques as far as looking at all conditions so scleroderma being one of them pain being another but looking at it from a lifestyle approach and not just a one drug as my answer because there is no easy button in life as much as I try to find that okay a little bit about me so I've been part of the foundation for the last 20 years through schools so on and so forth I'm a chronic pain pharmacist working with physicians and so I'd be seeing patients just like a physician does I just concentrate on the medications and the wellness approach versus Diagnostics and I've been a patient advocate for many years I my entire goal is to empower patients to become active members of their healthcare team and as you can see my daughter comes with me every year right now thank goodness paw Patrol run over so you do not hear her in the background and most importantly I am asked Larry Erma patient I've been diagnosed more than 25 years so I went through pharmacy school looking at all of this from the perspective of a patient first and what does that go in what how is that going to mean to us as patients individually so I'm in there with it y'all so when I talk about we it really is we and I'm also a chronic pain patient okay I have nothing to disclose except I cannot keep my mouth shut so I'm a little blunt I try to tell you exactly how it is I don't have any involvement in industry at this point everything I'm providing here is for educational purposes only please by no means take this as medical advice okay I always talk to your physicians and your providers your pharmacists at home and have an actual conversation about all of your medications I am available my information will be at the end to answer some basic questions and I will stay here for a little bit afterwards but I am NOT licensed to provide personal medical information or medical advice in every state I only have four States available so I apologize for that but I am available for any other basic questions the history so you know the history of cannabis has been around for a long time the first documented use was actually in 2737 BC for rheumatism being one of them on cave drawings actually I did not get a picture of the cave drawings if I do this one next year I will guaranteed get a picture of these cave drawings because I want to know what that is but even going so far as the Irish physician early in 1839 notice that were there some medical benefits associated with this in 1887 we saw some benefit with neuropathic pain and then in 1925 the United States decided to ban it for a lot of political reasons and even though I can't keep my mouth shut I am still going to try to maintain the property or the proper use here with the video um that being said I'll see what I can do so we did find the the cannabidiol cannabinol structure in 1940 we found the THC structure in 1964 and we discovered the euphoric effects in 1967 leading into the 70s and fun times right in 1978 or in 1978 we had looked at the controlled substance therapeutic research Act that allowed us to study THC and cannabis as a medicinal purpose so their concern with that is is yes we could study it but the strains that we were allowed to study Hornbeck from the 60s and so it wasn't until 2016 that researchers were allowed to use the more current strains that we have so the data that we have that says it's not efficacious it we're using strains that are the potency about 10% potency of what we use now so that's part of the problem in in this you know situation that we're in right now with the medical cannabis but in 1996 California was the first medical marijuana state and then in 2003 the World Health Organization recommended that THC be scheduled as a schedule 4 which is you know pretty low on the totem pole there oxycodone is a schedule 2 and that basically tells you how addictive it is as a property and what the concerns are for you know the society as a whole so as far as legality so federally it is still a control one meaning there is no medicinal purpose so that's right up there with cocaine and with the each state individually though they can determine what they want to do as far as making it legal and what levels of legal do they want to go so looking at we do have four state territories in thirty-four states that are legal for medical cannabis and for each state they could determine what that meant so for instance Minnesota where I'm currently residing there are two places that you can get it and they have very few products so they've regulated it to the point where you know that is that's the regulation that they wanted to have with it but there's also drawbacks such as cost and availability and then there were some states who decided to do a low THC so they wouldn't allow the the red products or the really high THC products and those are listed here so you can look for your state in the list and then the recreational marijuana states are starred so Nevada being one of those minnesota is definitely not one of those so when we look at the actual plant and getting to understand really what do all these terms mean so cannabis is is just the genus or the genus of the plant species so it's that one subset of plants so it kind of covers all of them and then when you go one step below that two specie species that's when you get into Hampton marijuana so there are over 70 species of cannabis at this point that we know of and the differences really are so the hemp products tend to have they're they were originally designed for industrial purposes so fibers clothing things like that and there is a CBD over the counter with hemp in it and we'll talk about that as well but that is generally a cannabis sativa so I will go through a little bit more of what sativa but it has to contain less than 1% THC to really be part of that category and then mayor itself again medet medical and recreational uses associated with this one it is the one that's more psychoactive and that's cannabis indica and that can have anywhere from one to thirty percent THC so a really big difference in the two products and if you look at the picture they look very very similar so when it comes to legalities and staying within the laws of your state they look awfully similar so I would know they know the concerns associated with that and that there can be confusion very easily so sativa is read on the left hand side generally tall and slimmer plants that's where you get that head high and then alertness and euphoria and then increased energy so that's usually daytime use preferably and then indica as the many of the shops I have visited in the couch is what they call that shorter plants but really it's a relaxation it's an appetite stimulant pain relief and really is it it really is that body high and and yes without the video running I can tell you no I have no experience with this stuff best for nighttime use for this one so the endocannabinoid system you know interestingly enough you know this has been around for a long time we didn't start thinking about this until the 90s which makes me a little nervous but cb1 so what we do know about the endocannabinoid system is there are a lot of functions that we just don't understand yet with a cannabinoid system there are cb1 receptors in the central nervous system the lining of blood vessels which is what we're looking at first Lera derma as one of those within the stomach and the skeletal system within the bones and the tendons and so we're looking at fibromyalgia with cb1 we're looking at multiple sclerosis and potentially bone growth so there's a lot of interest right now in whether this product would be viable for osteoporosis now I can't tell you with medical data it is or it isn't but we'll talk about the safeties and then we can weigh risks versus benefits at that point and then there's the cb2 receptors and that's really the immune system so the endocannabinoid system has a lot more to do in our body than what we even know about yet we're just at the tip of the iceberg right now and that is part of the central and peripheral nervous system we're talking about Crohn's and rheumatoid arthritis for that one and then we do talk about with CD 2 receptors the tachycardia and orthostatic hypotension that can occur so when you see in these slides cb2 activity those are the things that we're gonna watch out for is a rapid heartbeat and then you know feeling faint when you stand up so cannabinoids as a class so that's the actual molecule there's 568 unique molecules in cannabis so when we talk about we don't know a whole lot about this yet we're barely scratching the surface with how many molecules we know let alone what each one of those do so in the cannabinoids themselves there's 60 that work in the endocannabinoid system CBD being one of them so CBD has usually no euphoric effect associated with it and it's used for pain and inflammation I usually use this for patients who have more of an inflammatory response that I want to calm down that inflammation in various parts of their body and we will go into further details about the products as well and then the tetrahydrocannabinol cannabidiol is the THC and that is the most psychoactive and I will tell you for personal experience as well as a number of my patients it's best to start at the lowest possible THC product because it really is psychoactive some people tolerate a whole lot better than others but in the grand scheme of things I always want you to start slow or start low and go slow so but we do use THC for decreased nausea and to increase appetite so generally speaking the rule of thumb right now is that the CBD with the THC is actually better because it has a synergistic effect so some of those products that are in between that have a little bit activity of both tends to be more beneficial than one product or another but we'll talk about specific products so if you look at the structure of CBD versus THC here if you look on this left hand side here the only difference is that ring is broken so that's a my new difference in my world in the body it's actually a big difference and so like I talked about CBD alone reduces inflammation it has antioxidant properties it does has shown to decrease seizure activity so we'll talk about one of the medications that just came out recently antidepressant and an anti-psychotic it can decrease IBS symptoms there is some talk and some research being done right now about reducing tumor effects and 30 different med tab lights that we've found so when this when CBD breaks down it breaks down to 30 different chemicals I don't even know what those do so you know a lot of safety concerns that we'll talk about and then on the other side THC that is really more used for nerve pain so that tingling numbness especially with like diabetes or peripheral neuropathy juice for decreasing muscle spasms and relaxation used as a sleep aid and as well as glaucoma you know that I think puss-in-boots even had it in his you know it's for my glaucoma anyways but THC has cb1 and cb2 activity which will become important as they do more research on these and if I thought 30 min tablets was a problem THC is over a hundred and now the problem with that is summer actives some aren't so when you first take the medication you know you you get the first pass effect and then if there's an active metabolite you'll keep getting effects which that may be good or bad depending on if you like them okay so in Minnesota at least they are color coded and I'm hoping other states at least get into some type of consistently consistency with all of these but so black is the highest THC in Minnesota and then violet is more CBD but you know every time somebody one of my patients goes to the medical cannabis pharmacist they're given a yellow and a green and then a red so I'm not quite sure what education they're getting but we will just say I do a lot of talking about this with each individual patient because the higher THC products do tend to have more side effects and so some of my you know older patients that it is challenging and they don't like those effects so it is something we have to watch out for so some of the available products out so Marinol has been around for a very long time order Navin all sometimes your provider can get Marinol covered on your insurance for an appetite stimulant as a workaround to getting this covered on a traditional plan but it's usually for weight loss or nausea and vomiting and oftentimes it's used in HIV and other waisting type diseases it does work on cb1 and cb2 and we do know the metabolism of this one so we know what drug interactions are gonna happen a little bit more so and then sessom it I'll tell you I don't have any personal experience with that one but it is another available product but interestingly the only information I could find was metabolites are known right up there with CBD for me the newest one out is a pity ol X and that is actually a CBD product for it's a cannabidiol for to childhood seizure syndromes and that's what those are so we're getting there as far as the FDA and the approval but the problem is is they're picking more obscure conditions right now especially those that are targeting children but that one is mainly CBT cb2 associated with that one so here's some of the new promising medications that are coming out I know Corbis out there I think somebody from Corvis raise your hand right there any product questions or any other things I would go to her directly because I'm not privy to such information but they do have one out coming out I think it's phase three trials right now looking at the medicinal benefits for systemic sclerosis in particular as one of theirs so I think that that's very helpful that we do have the information out there for scleroderma and that we do have Corvis on our side on that one to be able to get the data and be able to really find and study the benefits of these and make it allow it to be more mainstream there are a bunch of other products in various stages as well my goal to show you this is just to let you know that there are options coming and as we know everything needs to go through checks and balances and really we're looking at safety and we're looking at efficacy and we want to make sure that this is the right thing for you before it goes to market okay so routes of administration important things here Aurel so there's a variety of different oral products there's oils that are actually the most potent but also the most expensive and and those are generally pure products and then you have tinctures tinctures are they usually have some type of alcohol in them and it does dilute them and oftentimes that dose is easier to give yourself and [Music] less 2-over less possibility of taking too much and we do have the edibles so I know California and Denver are great with their edibles and so that's mixing the cannabis whether it's CBD and or THC or a combination of the two into like little gummy bears or candies things like that there is oral sprays available as well as Lauzon jizz so just for instance it is very and I'll go through a little bit more of this too but it's very important in your state to know what your laws are I have a very good friend of mine his son has really bad anxiety and let's just say we are not a recreational state but his 18 year old is looking at a felony charge right now for carrying around on oil so definitely important for you to know you know what's going on and then the topicals so there's creams and suppositories so suppositories are still topical in the sense of the read the hale canal with any type of topical my biggest concern is where is the pain what is causing the pain it can this topical go deep enough these are very small molecules so the absorption I'm not worried about I know the absorption is there for most of these products the systemic side effects so what goes through your entire body is much less than any oral product which I appreciate I would rather you treat the spot more directly if that's what you're going for for pain relief or you just have one fussy joint I would rather you take care of that one joint rather than the whole body but with the creams if it's a deeper joint or a deeper pain it's going to be harder to get to that area with a topical product and that's just being real and inhaled so that's the smoking or the vape it is very very fast-acting so we're we're talking you know two to four minutes to start feeling effects and you know it really starts working well well it's five to ten minutes to start working and then two to four hours my patients tell me it's more like two hours depending on the product versus oral which is you know 60 to 180 minutes so you could wait one to three hours to start feeling the effect of the oral products so the disadvantages with the smoking as I hope we've learned here at these conferences is putting anything into your lungs that it's going to have a vehicle to get it into your lungs and it's that vehicle that I'm concerned about it's also our lungs are not that the tissue within our lungs is very very sensitive and so my concern would be what is the damage that we're doing later and what's going to happen from that as far as you just need to know the long-term effects as well as the short-term effects and then obviously the top goals depend on a variety of different things including skin thickness so it may take longer with our skin okay so dosing most importantly start low go slow and stay low better bigger is not better on this one okay I do recommend low THC products initially so the products that are more CBD dominant I prefer those a you get the anti-inflammatory properties number one but also less psychoactive effects so less side effects less fogginess less dizziness associated with it when you have the non-medicinal go to the Med the dispensaries that's what I'm talking about herbal here usually it's one to three grams per day is the usual dosing very rarely do we see more than five grams per day I don't know about somebody else but I do know there was a number of scleroderma patients in the past and that good friend of mine has was not able to be here this time I am sure he's in one of those higher groups but it's not generally recommended as far as we don't know the long-term effects with heavy use and we don't know exactly what it does but start with one inhalation every 15 to 30 minutes if you're more sensitive to medications I would wait more like 30 minutes to an hour to really see the effects so it really isn't the personal experience doing five before you get on a plane okay it was a very interesting plane ride but that was halfway through it so at least I made it to the airport CBD there are no established guidelines so we have very little information on the products that are available over-the-counter so the the farm bill passed last year that allowed CBD from hemp to be over-the-counter and so the problem with some of these over-the-counter products with CBD is we don't know the purity and we don't know the concentrations so from batch to batch is it the same product one - is it the same concentration and three what really is in that and so when I recommend products I recommend products that you they verify testing from a third party so each batch that they make has to be verified and they have it available they should have it available on their website you check the number on the bottle and that number on the bottle is what tells you your exact batch and you can look at exactly what was in there okay that's what I recommend when it comes to the CBD hemp products and I'll tell you for instance my state Minnesota does not recommend pharmacists be involved at all of course obviously I don't follow rules well so I will gladly give everybody the information but really generally speaking these are sold by people who have no medical information and if anybody's been to the medical dispensary I some of them I felt the same way and I can't say I've been to all of them but I will say that I've been to a few of them across the country and sometimes I feel like I'm on my own and I'm sure some of y'all feel that way too when it comes to the products that are out there so we'll talk about that a little bit more as well it may take months to find the right combination of product so the right amount of cvd versus the right amount of THC the right amount of dosing exactly how much do you need how often do you need it and you know what does that mean for you and then with medical cannabis the goal really is once we get a little more coordinated with our efforts is really having a pharmacist talk to you about it and having that ability to speak to a pharmacist about these medications and then also educate the medical field a little bit more about the pros and cons with these medications and really just because you know the time associated with FDA approval which we all know can be a very lengthy process you know what else is available in the meantime and what does that mean for you so education really is the key but being forceful about our recommendations to our providers can be difficult so titration here's just a few examples depending on your state this goes along that same you know start low go slow type idea really I would go with the smallest dose available that's measurable and then work your way up from there every couple of days so I would give yourself two days on each dose and then go on to another dose later down the road you know a couple of days later and then once you find the dose that works you may have to alter that depending on the situation depending on what other medications you're on if you're on an antibiotic so on and so forth so there's a lot of things to consider here and it also depends on food and bioavailability so so side effects CBD side effects as you can tell THC is a lot more side effects than the CBD CBD I you know there is there can be nausea associated with it and change in mood which I have seen actually in some of my patients and same with irritability which I find interesting especially with people over the age of 65 and then anxiety you'll see anxiety on both sides and same with nausea so although it's used to treat anxiety it can also trigger anxiety too so things to watch out for so that may not mean that you don't if your anxiety increases after you use it don't use more it can be a side effect and then THC so the big things that I'm concerned about I really have seen hyperemesis and yes it's used for vomiting but I've had some people who even with just one dose cannot stop vomiting for days and so and again I don't know exactly what product they have I don't know exactly how much THC they had all I know is they took the cannabis and they were vomiting for days so precautionary their dry mouth for those with Sjogren's dry mouth is real my friends with THC I think I will tell you that is probably the worst thing for me and that that's one of the reasons that I choose not to use the THC products personally there are a lot of conversation about confusion and decrease in IQ with the higher THC components because really the people back in the 70s who you know continued to use and that's perfectly fine a lot of times the products they're choosing are the low potency THC just because that's what they're used to and that's what they're growing but what's gonna happen when we have the higher THC products and we're using them regularly I don't I don't know the IQ effects I don't know the memory effects and I don't know if that's leaning us down a you know path of more Alzheimer's more dementia we don't know yet and so those are my concerns for for my patients my loved ones personally and then hallucinations those really are real and I have seen them I have not personally but my I have seen my patients have them euphoria is another one that actually can be a benefit depending on where you're trying to go for that moment but you know one thing that I'm really concerned about with THC is vasodilation so yes it does vasodilate your core the problem is is if it has to vasodilate your core it takes your blood from somewhere else and my friends that is your periphery those are your fingers and so we've had cases of Ray not spacious who have severe Raynaud's attack for a couple of days that didn't end because of the basal constriction associated with THC so again higher potency products avoid those until you you know know what they do for you there's a question about decreased sexual abilities and really what that's going to mean whether that's desire or actual function I have seen a decrease in both in some of my patients so it is going to be something that we need to research more and same with Acree acute pancreatitis so if that's something you're prone to you might want to stay away from THC altogether and then you know would THC in particular withdrawal symptoms are real and I don't know exactly to the extent that withdrawal symptoms can harm I know with alcohol it can kill with opioids it sucks but it's not going to kill you I don't know where THC stands so just cautionary so every state can determine what conditions that they want to approve it for this is Illinois and man they like the her medical cannabis it appears Minnesota has I think ten oftentimes physicians can find a way usually anxiety weight loss wasting any type of most of the things that we have or chronic pain oftentimes those are covered under medical cannabis so that is something to have that discussion with your your physician about so contraindicated so ones that I would not use it for pregnancy obviously I would I would hate to harm a child I know in the 70s has happened a lot but with a higher potencies I am concerned about that and same with breastfeeding we don't they are small molecules like I said so the amount of and breast milk can be pretty high if you already have schizophrenia or psychosis probably not beneficial to keep that up or to contribute to that at all if you have active addiction so if you're chronically using meth or cocaine this is probably not a good idea and for most states that is a contraindication to getting approved for medical cannabis metabolic syndrome so this is interesting I saw Studies on this and I've seen the papers as far as the concerns so if you have high triglycerides or diabetes or obesity there's a cautionary concern there it's not contraindicated I wouldn't say this paper called it contraindicated what I would say is monitor that very closely so if you have hypertension I would monitor your blood pressure after using some see what it does to you and use the same product each time and then for us in the room and Wisc Lera Durham a big caution with immune compromising drugs and so that's a lot of us so we don't know we do know that it does work on the immune system and it may compromise it so that's something that we don't have enough data yet to prove otherwise but it is something to watch out for it if you're worsening while using THC or CBD that's something that you're going to want to consider stopping that for a while to determine if it was that product and then serious heart or liver disease I will tell you liver disease that all those metabolites are broken down by the liver and so we kind of need that to break these down and if not you may just be high for the rest of your life after one puff for some that might be beneficial just kidding okay so question is cannabis addictive so there was a study done as far as where cannabis lies in the addiction category so on the bottom it's physical harm so and then on the top its dependence so are how dependent on this medication are you going to become so obviously heroin and cocaine highest a man of harm highest amount of dependence okay and you start coming further back down and interesting buprenorphine is in the middle which is what we use for addiction but we're moving on and then cannabis still has a good amount of dependence associated with it so whether that's addiction per se or dependence that could be a physiological dependence - so your body gets used to these chemicals so my concern as an individual and as a provider is is this dependence going to lead something lead down the same path as we had with the opioids meaning you know our bodies become dependent on them our bodies adapt they change based on the environment it's given and I know what happens with the body with opioids now because I have three million people to study I don't have that many people on high amounts of THC so ten years down the line is that going to be the same concern that the body has now adapted because we don't understand the endocannabinoid system well enough so is the body going to adapt and make new receptors and then give us bigger issues I don't know okay as far as dependence they talked about nineteen percent of the people became dependent on marijuana okay when you look at it you know tobacco is 32 percent so yes it's less than tobacco significantly less than tobacco and I would take marijuana over tobacco if I made a recommendation but again the smoking aspect I think is the one that I avoid but the most important thing here to consider for those less than 18 when the brain is not fully formed yet that risk increases by 17% so now we are getting closer to heroin when it comes to medical cannabis and so or THC and so that's where my concern lies is again we don't know enough to really know exactly what's gonna happen okay so the other concern is marijuana use disorder so anytime that we have any product we want to watch for any safety concerns any things that you know are gonna crop up to see if there's going to be a bigger problem so if you're using larger amounts over longer periods of time than you intended that's a warning sign that's something that we need to consider if if you are unsuccessful and you want to cut down or control your usage and you can't if you spend your entire day trying to figure out how to get it how to use it and how to feel better after using it okay we might be going down the wrong path if all you can think about is the cannabis if your Social Work recreational activities are decreasing because of it if it puts you in a dangerous situation or you continue use this despite medical or psychiatric harm okay classic signs of addiction there so things to watch out for with this type of product so drug interactions mmm this is one of the most important pieces for me as a pharmacist we don't have enough data and that's my concern I can tell you what I know right now and I can teach you about that but as far as what else we learn further down the road I'm hoping next year I will have a rule or more robust set of data to provide to you there are the CNS depressant effects so if you combine it with benzodiazepines like xanax or valium alcohol and opioids there can be significant sedation associated with that there's there can be mania if you take it with an SSRI and it's an antidepressant so--that's prozac lexapro any of those and potentially even duloxetine which i know a lot of people use for pain management there can be a fast heart rate or delirium if you take nortriptyline or amitriptyline so those are all considerations and then we talked about the you know immunosuppressant properties especially with corticosteroids so if you're on prednisone are we going to suppress your immune system even further in a negative way and if you're taking antipsychotics it may counteract the effect of those and it does have competitive metabolism so that means if you're having if you're on other medications that use these same enzymes which we'll talk about there's gonna there could potentially be drug interactions and so they're going to compete for the same enzymes and unfortunately sip three a four I believe covers eighty percent of the drugs that we have out there right now and that's a big list of drugs that can interact so the interactions I talked about today are only the most severe and the most inhibiting or inducing but there are a list of hundreds and hundreds of other drugs that are also going to compete for that same enzyme to break down so if you have two drugs that use that same enzyme to break down say maybe cell sept that needs to be broken down for your body to get rid of it and you have the THC that needs to be broken down as well the more THC you use the less enzyme this drug has to break down so potentially you could have a higher amount of cell set for instance so there's a lot of different things we don't have data on really what those numbers look like or even whether cell sept is a big issue or not because we don't have the exact percentages but it is a consideration so medications that can increase the CBD and THC so the ones that I want you to be concerned about here cimetidine or tagamet cyclosporine these can all if you're taking cyclosporine diltiazem urethral myosin fluconazole flu the flu oxy teen grapefruit is another one so it's the same interaction as grapefruit interestingly enough ketoconazole itraconazole those are the ones that I've seen most often or verapamil with scleroderma that could increase the amount of THC and CBD so even if you use a small THC product a product that has limited THC in it that could mean that this drug these drugs have made it toward that's a big amount of THC so again something to watch out for ones that can increase THC again the amount of THC you're gonna get is higher if you're on say metronidazole for an infection the other ones that I've seen clopidogrel as another concern and depakote and sulfamethoxazole so septum septum D s is another one so antibiotics things that we need to watch out for so if suddenly you're on this antibiotic you're you're doing fine on your THC and then you start your antibiotic and somehow that high now it just became ten times worse or now it's into mania it really probably is that that antibiotic that caused that but that does not mean not used your antibiotic for the record okay so meds that increase CBD so CBD is the one that's available over-the-counter from hemp platic s'n otherone tagamet another one nexium the as omeprazole that's a concern fluconazole for any type of yeast infection fluoxetine for mood modafinil or provigil I know some people take that here omeprazole is another one that that I would be concerned about so just know that the amount of CBD you're getting could be a lot more so the ones who don't get any effect from THC they could be on some of these drugs so basically these drugs are now making it to where your body is eating up the THC to where you don't really feel the effects and that's phenytoin st. John's wort or tegretol or boson tan so tre clear for PAH and imagines that decrease CBD so those patients her like CBD doesn't do anything for me would be concentration and all fairness but it could be some of these medications too so again st. John's wort and then phenytoin for any type of seizures or other conditions and then any type of barbituates so phenobarbital I've seen used sometimes okay so medications that decrease THC and CBD so there's different enzymes that break each one down and different enzymes have different drugs associated with them so the ones I'm worried about here is again the tre clear the provigil and phenytoin is another one and st. John's wort so I'm gonna keep going back to that one because that one interacts with almost everything I have and then medications so going through kratom has anybody heard of kratom okay has anybody used kratom okay it is a natural product I respect that I am a naturalist by heart I only went to pharmacy school because I didn't nobody could tell me as a kid what the scleroderma drugs would do to me so I had to figure it out myself unfortunately though this is a messy form of tramadol I don't know if anybody's tried tramadol but it works on serotonin norepinephrine and as an opioid and so this was kind of everybody's work around well you know if I can't get medical marijuana then I'm gonna get kratom the problem is is if I thought the products that are being used over-the-counter we're a little sketchy with what's in them kratom is even more sketchy and so it does block serotonin norepinephrine and dopamine even at very low doses those are neurotransmitters that you need for mood you need for functioning very important neurotransmitters so it can cause anxiety and agitation and increase blood pressure so things to consider it often includes an opioid compound so with the opioid epidemic again I would still rather have that real conversation with your provider then go down this route so there was a significantly increased risk of suicide with kratom and then serious death and adverse events have happened with kratom so I do not recommend create him for any reason okay important tips I actually feel like I'm somewhat on time okay there are concerns for the the our fellow scleroderma friends who are below 18 again the brain is not fully formed I don't know exactly what's going on but again it's a risks versus benefits having that conversation with your provider to really figure out what that means try CBD first just a CBD product from hemp is what I recommend first but I recommend one from a company that is independently tested that they can guarantee that they have tested each batch each batch is numbered and you can look at that testing and say there's no other impurities there you know it is the concentration that it says it is so there are two that I have vetted I have no financial obligation with either one of these but plus CBD is one that I have found to be reputable and that was available at one of my local fresh time market right down the street so that's what I found that's commercially available if there's one that you are interested in and you can't get that information email me I'll be glad to look it up for you okay but if you ask whoever selling it whether that's the coops whether that's you know the health food stores they should have that data for you because this is coming so for the state of Minnesota there or I think federally what they're trying to do is mandate it to where there has to be a barcode on every bottle that it has CBD in it to guarantee it so in order to for it to be over the counter it has to have less than 0.3 percent THC but of course the you know federal government can't regulate that as much as they would like to for the three million companies that have cropped up in the last year okay THC can be very difficult to tolerate initially so just caution start low go or yeah start low go slow and stay low THC can increase anxiety and nausea as we talked about please communicate with all your health care providers I can't stress this enough I understand that there are many health care providers who are not as open with this conversation and if they're not open and you know absolutely insist on no I would either a look into another provider that you can at least have that conversation with not every provider has to say yeah gun Co you know this is fantastic but at least finding one who will have that conversation with you as far as what are the risks where you independently especially psychiatry I can't stress this enough with how much depression is involved in scleroderma I don't want to trigger that any further if if we can avoid that okay and keeping your rheumatologist in the loop I know where you know everybody's becoming a little more open-minded I mean come on we're at 34 states now right so it's getting there but but we're not quite there yet but communicating is your best tool and talking about the pros and cons having that real conversation there there is drug so if you have a drug abuse history avoid it at all costs I would even avoid CBD personally if you have active meth addiction look at your state laws very very carefully I cannot express this enough Minnesota has a state law it's and with Wisconsin if you are cut if you are pulled over for driving and they don't even need a reason necessarily to pull you over they can take a urine drug screen and if you test positive for either opioids benzos or marijuana at all any metabolites then they can give you a DUI even if you were not driving erratically okay so most states have these types of laws and I will tell you opioids for instance say in your system usually three days so you can take one dose every three days and test positive every day okay depends on the sensitivity of their test but I don't know about you but I don't like personally sitting in the back of a car cop car personally so know what the laws are know what the laws are about traveling so even if you are a medical cannabis card holder you usually cannot go to another state even if they are a medical state because they are medical for their state now are they going to bust you for it I don't know but I don't know about you but I don't want to attempt that you cannot travel across state lines via air travel via you know your cruise lines things like that and definitely not overseas until you know exactly what their laws are I will say that TSA does not look too kindly on it and there were two grandmothers I don't know if you've heard but they were carrying CBD from hemp legal as of last year in Disneyworld and they were not so kindly escorted out of Disney World for having CBD from hemp okay so there's a lot of confusion about hemp versus marijuana okay don't share don't sell don't give away your medical cannabis it really is a drug it's it might be a natural drug and people tell me well I can't overdose on this and I will tell you the story I give as if any of you have seen the Vincent van Gogh and painting starry night right the lights have halos over everything because he was overdosing on a plant in that was eating on his salad okay that plant very well could have killed him by the way so you know it really there is an overdose possibility I mean you know there are still risks with heavy use the goal really is is if you're gonna do medical cannabis to wean off something else wean off a benzo we you know your opioids like xanax clonazepam oxycodone hydrocodone the goal is to find a product that's going to be used more effectively to treat whatever your condition is more effectively rather than masking it in benzos and opioids both mask vaping and smoking not recommended for long health I try to avoid that altogether for all my patients genetics do play a big role and we are finding with pharmacogenetics that there is a big concern when it comes to genetics and so you might not metabolize THC well and you could be one of those that is a slow metabolizer and one hit will last days you don't know many drug interactions and again back to the limited data so with pain management my biggest concerns and takeaways assess the source of the pain and same with scleroderma assess the source so for us it's an immune response right and it's an inflammatory response treat it as directly as possible use all available options even with medical cannabis or you know marijuana physical therapy occupational therapy mindfulness approaches I cannot express how powerful your mind really is and so usually what I recommend is using some of these products to get a little more stable start learning more tools that you can become empowered to do it without the need of a medication now I'm not saying stop your medications because I think they'd all hang me outside but what I'm saying is the ones that are using to treat symptoms how do we how do we decrease those so that we can decrease the possible side-effects and sometimes opioids are more appropriate than cannabis I have those times and I will tell you that I have those patients who where I say opioids are more important or more appropriate every patient should be treated individually so what you take may not be the same thing that your friend takes and what works for your friend may not work for you and that is okay because our bodies are completely different even though we have scleroderma we have a lot of other genetics that are playing in here and a lot of other medications that were on for other conditions hormones and metabolism errors can resemble pain and fatigue and anxiety so some people may not be able to break down folic acid as a genetic problem so there's a lot more to it so I look at it from addressing the root cause so looking at potentially a functional medicine provider and seeing if there is another reason for some of these symptoms including some of the scleroderma symptoms addressing an inflammatory diet and stress contributors so how do we decrease stress in a in an effective manner that may not have long-term effects the pain toolkit org has a bunch of videos and resources that you can use for pain and anxiety to help take control and to help ask questions to your providers about what you want to know more about YouTube really is our friend and I mean you know there are reputable sites that you can use to get good information on how to do mindfulness and how to do meditation to some degree even if it's just a minute a day and then the other options I don't want to forget the low dose naltrexone I actually use low dose naltrexone for my patients for pain and other rheumatologic conditions before I would use medical cannabis and if you want to know more about that I can give you all the information on that but it is it does use different mechanisms to decrease your body's inflammation and to increase your body's own endogenous opioids and potentially an immune modulator I use different combinations of drugs using gabapentin duloxetine and an anti-inflammatory don't underestimate the buprenorphine or Butte rands for pain management and then topical versus oral like I talked about earlier if you can treat one joint if you have one area of pain that you can point to I'd rather you treat that then treat it through the whole body and then overall focus on wellness so I really whole heartedly believe in the integrative approach to healthcare as minimum necessary requirements for long-term wellness so when I talk about that you know I'm talking about you know diet exercise sleep mental health it all plays in together all aspects of life contribute to your health so I really can't stress the the mindfulness approaches and if you want more information I'll be glad to give it to you and same with exercise and therapy so whether that's you know psychotherapy you know counseling or whether that's physical therapy and movement and exercise it's all very very important but I have no magic pill I have no magic wand I would love to give everybody a magic wand to make everything go away but I can't do that so finally start low go slow may take months to find your effective dose start with CBD from hemp first and then move on to cannabis depending on your state laws use products that have third-party testing and I gave you the two names there med Terra and Plus CBD but there are many others look at the benefits benefits pros and cons talk to your providers I have no minute I have no easy button minimal data so we don't know long-term risks so I would not say yeah medical cannabis for everybody just yet so what I'm saying is let's be cautious use this as one of our tools that we have in our toolbox and use it to to manage your life most effectively in the most integrative way possible and last but not least please please please be an active member of your healthcare team if you have issues with that or one other questions I will be more than happy to help with that so that being said thank you for attending my talk and let me know if you have any questions", "e6dD81GhgiI": "welcome back to the demystifying medicine youtube channel today we will be discussing cannabis and parkinson's disease parkinson's disease also known as pd is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder studies have tried to find a cause for pd either genetic or environmental but none have been confirmed the disease is characterized by a loss of dopamine producing neurons in the substantia negra which is an area of the brain responsible for movement this means that the cells in the brain that create dopamine are no longer doing so the death of these neurons causes loss of motor control because dopamine is important for relaying messages to plan muscle movements this leads to the motor symptoms of pd including tremors muscle rigidity and bradykinesia which means slowness of movement there are some non-motor symptoms of the disease as well including anxiety depression and trouble sleeping the risk of developing pd increases with age especially above the age of 60. the prevalence of pd in the us was 680 000 in 2010 and was projected to be 930 000 in 2020 with the prevalence of this disease continually increasing there's a need for new treatment options and cannabis could be a potential treatment for pd cannabis is a drug illicit in some parts of the world that has both psychoactive and therapeutic effects it is an umbrella term that is given to various preparations of the plant cannabis sativa and has other common names such as marijuana weed and pot cannabis contains many compounds known as cannabinoids cannabinoids are chemical substances that bind to cannabinoid receptors in the body this can be visualized as a key which is the cannabinoid fitting into a lock which is the receptor the most common cannabinoids present in cannabis are thc and cbd cannabinoids due to differences in their chemical properties can have varying effects in the body thc is accountable for the psychoactive effects of cannabis and produces the high sensation cbd works to control or reduce some of the psychoactive effects of thc such as anxiety specifically thc and cbd work in the endocannabinoid system in our body which affects different parts of the central nervous system along with cellular communication which is why changes in the system can be linked to parkinson's disease currently the most common medication prescribed for pd is levodopa also known as l-dopa when aldopa reaches the brain it is converted into dopamine and therefore compensates for the decrease in dopamine due to pd however research has shown that some patients fail to respond to treatment with l-dopa furthermore the drug has been associated with adverse side effects and motor complications over time including involuntary movements called dyskinesias in the last decade there has been an increased focus on investigating the therapeutic potential of cbd in treating neurodegenerative disorders such as pd most human clinical trials have been concentrated on the non-motor symptoms of the disease including anxiety depression and trouble sleeping with results indicating that cbd is successful in treating many of these symptoms although less research has focused on the effects of cbd on motor symptoms a 2004 study using a survey aimed to evaluate the experiences of parkinson's patients using cannabis to help treat their disease the results of this study showed that bradykinesia was the symptom most improved by cannabis followed by muscle rigidity and tremors research has focused on various pathways in which cbd could treat the motor symptoms of pd a 2014 study using a mouse model made it an important discovery regarding the gpr6 receptor gpr6 is a receptor that is predominantly expressed in the brain and is molecularly similar to the cannabinoid receptors this study showed that a deficiency of the gpr-6 receptor in a mouse model of parkinson's disease led to an increase in dopamine concentration in the brain furthermore it led to reduced dyskinesia caused by treatment with l-dopa although this has yet to be tested in humans mice are accurate and commonly used animal models for human disease using the results found in the study in 2017 a research team tested the effects of cannabinoids on the gpr6 receptor their results showed that cbd acts as an inverse agonist to the gpr6 receptor this means that cbd binds to gpr6 decreasing the activity of the receptor and therefore leading to an increase in dopamine this research has identified cbd as a potential therapy for treating the motor symptoms of pd without the negative side effects caused by aldoba although these findings are very promising more research needs to be done on the topic with more clinical trials to show the effects of cbd in humans with pd now that we've discussed the effects of cannabis in the body let's review physicians perspectives on treatment of pd with medical marijuana animal investigations support suggestions of improvement in bradykinesia and tremors but this is unsubstantiated in human studies some patients have reported that marijuana diminishes some motor non-motor cognitive and or mood symptoms of pd 18 studies investigated medical practitioners perspectives on this none of these studies presented results that outright rejected the clinical usefulness of medical cannabis in a separate study physicians were asked to indicate the degree to which the use of cannabis is evidence-based for various symptoms of pd 87 of physicians felt that the literature supported the use of cannabis for nausea 60 for anxiety and 86 for pain responses were divided with regard to motor symptoms in fact only 36 percent of physicians believed cannabis could help parkinson's patients with tremors and 35 for symptoms like dyskinesia researchers need to clarify the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy with cannabis products or medical marijuana will remain largely without scientific endorsement research has to document the full benefits risks and clinical applications of marijuana as a treatment for patients with pd medical practitioners attribute a self-perceived lack of knowledge as a significant barrier to approval a study conducted by edelstein at al revealed that 95 of participants had no formal education about medical marijuana 84.6 reported being unprepared to answer clients questions that were cannabis related medical practitioners also raised issues about the potential for recreational misuse diversion into illicit channels the risk of drug drug interactions driving under the influence of cannabis and the potential risks associated with uncontrolled supply finally rey's concern for the health of individual patients was mostly focused around psychiatric adverse effects more than 10 million people worldwide are living with pd and the incidence of parkinson's only increases with age when such a large portion of the population has an incurable disease it is essential that we explore every possible therapy to help improve their quality of life medical cannabis is a promising therapy for pd and requires further research to investigate its potential as a new and exciting treatment for the disease thank you so much for watching also remember to subscribe to the demystifying medicine channel

md is a multi-disciplinary team-based patient-focused center providing free comprehensive assessments for medical cannabis dr lem welcome and i will pass it over to you now um i don't think you're oh your video is on now wonderful can uh i hope everyone can hear me thank you for that uh wonderful introduction alana it's my pleasure to be here um it was very comprehensive that's uh the introduction i'm not sure how much else i need to see but um just to reiterate i am an internal medicine specialist and i am very interested in the medical cannabis space um one of the reasons um that i got involved with this with this area was because i had my patients um or i explored the the cannabis uh with my patients and found that there was some profound benefits but there was a big lack of data and so the clinics um that i have worked and founded um with is a multi-disciplinary clinic and we are data-driven so our goals are to look at the data to collect the data and to better understand what cannabis can be used for and that's what i'm hoping to share with you today because parkinso disease is one of those diseases that there isn't just one thing that parkinson's patients suffer from there's a host of things and the current standard of treatment isn't if i could be honest and frank isn't great um and so um a lot of patients are seeking um other alternatives and that's what i'm hoping to be able to share and shed some light into uh today because i think cannabis does have a role okay so um as uh a summary of what we're going to talk about um we'll talk about a general overview of some parkinson's theory uh we'll look at the cannabis uh overview and then we'll go to some frequently asked questions okay so uh parkinson's disease right and so um when you look at the causes of parkinson's disease this is just a summary for what i think many of the attendees here probably already know there is things like um you know there's a genetic component to it um like michael j fox there's environmental causes you know listed here some pesticides and carbon monoxide there's this very interesting um thought that's going out right now about this gut brain connection whereby a lot of the gut microbiome actually causes influence to our mind and how we think and it can lead to some um to some changes that cause parkinsonian like uh symptoms then there are you know risk factors like age and a family history males are more likely to get parkinson's than females environmental exposures and then essentially what happens in parkinson's is that you get this breakdown of the nerve cells um and it's mostly the dopamine releasing nerve cells which is why things like the the standard of treatment is like cinnamon or carbidopa which tries to replace the the dopamine and the idea is that some of the symptoms of parkinson's and you'll see as we go through the theory that not all of them can be explained with just dopamine-releasing cells which is why that cinnamon only addresses some of the symptoms of parkinson's so this was a theory that was proposed that i really really liked and it talks about parkinson in stages um and so most people don't re most people when they think about parkinson's disease they think of you know things like the cardinal symptoms which is the bretokinesia which is a slowing of the movements you know or the pill rolling tremor um or they look a bit flat in terms of how they look right or they start tripping um but that you'll see here actually is kind of a later uh a later stage usually in the stage three right so but parkinson's disease may start as early as stage one and this is why i like this because there are subtle features of parkinson's that may um that may be um present before what people think like ah you must have parkinson's or they they start noticing the pill rolling tremor and that's when people start screening for it so when you look at it you know the in the first steps of parkinson's um or the first stage you lose things that are more non-specific so you get less spell you get things like you get constipated and that's as you go up from the brain stem up to the higher levels of the brain okay so just to give everyone here an idea or a review this this is our brain here and you'll see that um the lower parts of the brain are what's called the the more rudimentary parts this is like for you know your breathing center um and what differentiates us as humans is more the upper brain which is our complex thinking and our critical thinking so this stuff down here in the brain stem you know the the green and the whatever stage one it's sort of a yellow green um that's sort of the the primitive centers in our brain okay and so that's where you get things like constipation and smell and then as you move up you start to affect some of the substantia [ __ ] which is um which is where you usually um cause problems um and that's when you start getting symptoms like okay you get these odd pains that really you know you really can't necessarily pinpoint you get some mood just mood issues um fluctuating mood this is where people start noticing sleep right and so sleep is is um one of the things that's really affected in in patients with parkinson's right and you'll see here that you can imagine that when patients present in stage one or stage two it's rather difficult to say that yeah this person has uh parkinson's because these could be from lots of different things right sinus issues poor sleep could be from stress you know mood can also be from stress so it's not until you get to stage three that people start noticing things like okay you're moving slowly you're getting more rigid you're getting some freezing and then that's when you get the pill rolling tremor and then when you look back you start seeing that oh yeah i had all these other symptoms too but what's interesting also is that parkinson's doesn't stop at stage three right and so as you move up into stage four stage five stage six you start affecting other things that actually become more significant right so as you move up you get more emotional problems that's when you start getting more long-term problems and as you can follow this arrow up the brain as it goes up higher and higher you start getting more and more of the um of the areas in the brain uh that makes us unique as humans okay so the critical thinking the memory um the planning the executive planning and so this is parkinson's and i think it's really nice um overview um so just as a very general review all that i really wanted to show here was these are the cardinal symptoms of parkinson's these are like what people think of as classic but this is not all that parkinson patients deal with right because there's a lot of mood issues in parkinson's patients that may go under appreciated there's psychotic uh things that people can start to hallucinate and then there's cognitive like the dysfunction of thinking fatigue is a big thing you know we don't treat very well sleep disturbance is also probably related to fatigue and all of this is just trying to say that if we look at parkinson's we have to look beyond the pill rolling tremor or just the tremor we have to look beyond that we have to look beyond just the rigidity because there's so much more in terms of what affects our park a patient who deals with parkinson's um their quality of life what affects their quality of life pain is also a big one and so here more features you know you can look at them i'm sure that uh for the guests here or the attendees here who suffer from parkinson's they don't necessarily need to read this list because it's something that they already experience in their lives or in the lives of their loved ones so now let's go to uh cannabis so very briefly let's just talk about what like cannabis overview okay so cannabis is a plant this is a plant um there's two different types there's actually three different types of cannabis there's sativa indica and rudoralis root oralis doesn't really have any medicinal properties so i've left it out for the most part in the can sativa are more historical the way that canada has been growing because most of our products are hybrids and it just you know for the most part with the only thing i want to tell you about sativa and indica because you will experience this or you will come across this if you are looking at cannabis treatment is that the cbd or the thc okay which are your cannabinoids that you find in sativa and indica are exactly the same so that was one thing that i never quite realized when i first got into this into this field which is you know cbd if you get it from sativa sativa or cbd if you get it from indica is exactly the same same with the thc they're chemically the same what differs in the sativa and in the indica plants are mostly the terpenes okay which i'll talk about and the minor cannabinoids okay so um cannabinoids are these unique molecules um they're actually not necessarily only found in cannabis they can be found in other plants but for the most part they're found in cannabis um that that um affect the the the host usually through the endocannabinoid system cbd thc are the most predominant of the cannabinoids okay terpenes um are these other uh molecules that are found within the cannabis plant that essentially gives it the fragrance so you know when you smell the cannabis you can smell that's the terpenes but they also have medicinal properties um and in actual fact um terpenes are usually from other plants okay so like spices have terpenes like parsley has terpene and then they've just bred into the cannabis um out in the wild okay but again the only thing i want to mention here is terpenes by themselves have a have medicinal properties and when you combine terpenes with the cannabinoids there's some thought that they may act more synergistically together all right so how can you these are the these are the ways that you can take cannabis i'm going to talk about how cannabis can be used in parkinson's but just generally how can you take what are the methods of consumption or modes of consumption so you know the most common that most people think of is smoking okay this in our clinic is the least favored why is it the least favorite a it's hard to control what you actually get because you're smoking the entire joint for instance um and you may be trading a benefit for uh a long-term um side effect or not a long-term side effect but a long-term problem okay so like why would you get pain control and then get lung problems like why why do that when there's another way to take it if you are you know there's some good things about it because if you do smoke or vaporize it's it has a faster onset but it also comes off less it also wears off quicker if you're going to smoke though try to use a water a bong because it has a water filter on it vaporize is the other way that i think most people may see out in you know in the public and this one you can use usually is you have a dried flower and you put it into a vaporizer it heats it up and you know under different uh temperatures or or boiling points you can you can vaporize the cannabinoids and you inhale it this one you know there's probably some benefit to it uh because it's again very fast onset so if you're in pain you can you can get a you can you can take a puff of the vaporized uh product and you can get effect within usually about five or ten minutes but it also doesn't last that long it usually lasts for about an hour or two the most common in our clinic is usually in the oral route so either a sublingual buccal or a or a capsule okay and so usually you can use you know you hold it for 45 to 60 seconds underneath your tongue the big things to note here is that when you're taking an oral route whether it's underneath the tongue or an edible like like a capsule it can take up to two hours uh to onset okay edibles include capsules and and um with fixed doses and also edibles can include um uh baked foods or like cookies we usually for medical uh don't use uh edibles like gummies because again you you oftentimes trade one problem for another like these high sugary cookies or high sugary gummy bears um and so it has only a little bit of of cbd or thc in it uh mostly cbd and then you take all that sugar in and then there's topical that's coming out on the market um soon or it's there's some products already out on the market i think this has a lot of this has a lot of potential for localized pain um so how can cannabis help in parkinson's this is not just how can cannabis help in general but this is remember this my talk is specific for parkinson's patients how can it help so there are four really four main areas that we in our clinic have seen it having benefits okay so in sleep in pain in the tremor and in anxiety or mood disorders so what does the data show this is the truth about cannabis so is cannabis a miracle drug that cures everything okay so obviously the answer is is no right um is cannabis a real medication now normally in my powerpoint slide these would come up one at a time but in this in this way it just all pops up at the same time so um i sort of give away my answers right away but yes it's a real drug and here's what it can it can help for and we have we have really good emerging evidence that it's useful in things like pain in poor sleep in tremors anxiety and ptsd seizures um and inflammation okay so here's the stats here's what it looks like this is this is real life data from our from my clinic okay so this is for pain specifically for pain you can see here okay that of these people the predominant people had some improvement right in pain and this is all comers of pain right most of them can you imagine three like maybe a third of the patients had a significant improvement in their pain so you're talking like at least a 75 reduction and when you look at the dose it's an average of 25 to 50 milligrams per day 76 of our patients had an improvement within the first month this is actually improving as we get more data and we can be a bit more aggressive in our dosing um 82 right 82 had some improvement at the three-month mark right and the reason for this is because we can we can titrate the or or help the patients adjust their medications or their their um their yeah their medication um as we see them in follow-up and you look at this the average pain and this is pain again all cameras not just parkinson's patients so all comer pain their average pain that they said that they quantified was 7.4 out of 10 so it's pretty significant pain 7.4 out of 10 is pretty significant and the pain reduced by almost 48 by almost half okay so this goes down to about three point eight okay and again fourteen percent of patients improved by more than eighty percent when you look at these numbers this is this is comparable to the opiates okay except that we know that opiates have other issues like addiction um dr lim we have a question if you are up first something um there's a question here are there any issues with interactions with other parkinson's disease medications great question so and i'm going to touch on that a little later but i will answer it as well now the answer is is that cannabis does or cbd and thc they do interact or they can interact with medications now specifically to parkinson medications the answer is it depends because parkinson's medications like i like i had mentioned earlier isn't just one thing will it interfere with cinematic dance or carbidova the answer is no but will it interfere with some of the other antipsychotics or antidepressants that you may be con on as well the answer is yes will it be uh will it interfere with or interact with benzodiazepines which some parkinson's patients are on for instance for sleep the answer is yes and so it's important and we've realized this to have a team manage your care okay so you know i'll be the first to admit even with all my training i am not a drug expert okay um you know there's just too much to know but pharmacists i mean that's their job they are drug experts so that's why we have clinical pharmacists on our team to review all of our patients to make sure that there are no drug interactions so kind of a long-winded way to answer it but yes the answer the short answer is yes it can interfere with parkinson's drugs or inner interact we do have another one here does the dose include thc so yes so these doses are 25 to 50 milligrams of cbd okay i should have been more clear here sorry 25 to 50 milligrams of cbd and there is a little bit of thc and usually the doses of our thc are in the one to two milligrams and the reason for the thc is mostly mostly because none of the none of the cbd that we get in canada is hemp derived which means that there is always some amount of thc in our cbd now i will say that actually this may be a good thing because thc is really it's often needed for cbd to act better or to be more effective so a little bit of thc with more cbd actually is better but this is a cbd only dose this is just for cbd okay so let's look at the tremor so this one we don't have as much data and you can see that the numbers aren't very much but there are there is some improvement okay and so some improvement in our in our uh in our tremor patients uh just because the reason that our numbers aren't very high is most of the patients who are being referred to our clinic is for pain and anxiety and so um again most people experience some improvement and again a significant improvement in tremors um and the dose again about 25 milligrams per day is on average what these patients were uh had effect on so what about insomnia more data right so this is for people uh who have trouble sleeping average dose 26 milligrams per day again of cbd thc also has a huge benefit but we use it more cautiously especially in our parkinson patients because there is a risk of of uh hallucinations with with uh with or uh hallucinations or cognitive issues with um with thc and so we tend to use it cautiously i will tell the attendees here that cbd actually counters the effects of thc so if you have a predominant cbd like let's say you're on 50 milligrams a day of cbd adding say 5 or 10 milligrams of thc is not the same effect as going on no cbd and just taking 5 or 10 milligrams of thc okay so cbd actually directly counteracts the effects of thc and so you can see here that cannabis in both cbd and thc together can be hugely um [Music] effective at treating insomnia right so again you look i mean you know yes a significant number of people didn't find any benefit that's okay right but a great majority of people had significant improvement okay 83 at three months and then anxiety all right so when you look at anxiety um also a lot of people improve okay so 87 over three months average dose about 27 milligrams this is again predominantly cbd not very much thc at all because we know that long-term consequences of thc actually may worsen depression and anxiety um so this is uh you know the point that i'm showing this is really just to show everyone that you know the clinic is a data driven and b we are having data right um you can see here that not very many people get worse right all of these things very little people get worse and so it's safe and it's potentially very effective okay so um are there risks to taking cannabis and the answer is is yes right so there are side effects to cannabis thc i usually break them down into two thc is what we're mostly you know what we hear in the public um that's the stuff that makes people high it make you know so obviously it's side effect or not necessarily a side effect to some people who want it right it makes them high it makes them drowsy this is why it can be helpful in people with insomnia it can make people have um balance issues so they feel a little bit unsteady on their feet which can again we use this cautiously in parkinson patients because parkinson's patients tend to have stability and mobility issues already so we use this cautiously it can lead to dizziness again the same reason that we use it consciously because we don't want to make any of the the uh mobility issue in parkinson's patients even worse palpitations uh dry mouth um [Music] and so uh again and these things right hallucinations and worsening of anxiety and so we use thc very strategically and very cautiously in our parkinson's patients and usually only when there are on much larger doses of cbd so what's the side effects of cbd you know quite literally not very much there are some patients of ours who who report some loose stools or diarrhea i'm actually more convinced from a clinical standpoint that the loose stool and diarrhea is not so much from the cbd itself but rather the oil so the oil that we're using is an mct oil so um a medium chain triglyceride and some people you know if you take oil it's a bit it gives people kind of makes people a little bit gassy and gives people loose stools and i think that's probably more of what the what the issues are from rather than from the cbd but it's it is something that we notice um some people if they take it for insomnia some people get the the reverse they feel like they're totally energized that's rare but we've seen it um and there are some people who develop some lightheadedness or dizziness but we think in our clinic it's probably more to do with the fact that our cbd here in canada always contains some thc and there are some people who are just very sensitive to thc addictions is there an addictions risk so thc there is an addictions risk but you can see it is extremely small so just to show you uh on the line so this line up here is nicotine we know that nicotine is one of the most addictive drugs out there so this is smoking this is why smokers have a really hard time stopping and then you look here this black is alcohol okay we know that our societies have problems with alcohol consumption but for the most part most people don't get addicted to alcohol but you can see that it's got a significant cocaine is actually right up there not that addictive cocaine just as much as alcohol but you look at thc and look at it and this is a logarithmic scale so this is this is like this is orders of magnitude smaller and so you see that it's not a zero right but it's really small okay is there any addictions raised to cbd the answer is long-term we don't know but it doesn't look like it from a clinical standpoint um there are no there's no uh documented withdrawal symptoms so if you stop people are always worried okay if i stop my medication do i get worse in actual fact we found some really remarkable things with cbd whereby as we escalate the doses of cbd and our patients respond what actually they can do is once they reach a clinical response they stay there for like three months and then some of them for financial reasons usually they stop or they don't take it as often and they realize actually that the benefits are still there and so it's not something that i can necessarily explain except for maybe physiologically your body up regulates the receptors and it gets more efficient at this but i have patients who for instance take cbd for pain and after three months you know they would take it every day or twice a day and then after three months they would take it once every third day or you know once a week or twice a week so it's really very surprising with good control and then there are some um there are some studies out there that suggest okay maybe cbd actually can help with other addictions like you know for cocaine addiction or opiate addiction um i have a couple questions here of course sorry to interject again um is cdb obtained by prescription only yes so right here yeah so it's going to be right here so the answer is no um you don't you don't have to get um cbd through a prescription now i will say this though i'd like to think you know we're two years from the legalization of cannabis in canada and yet despite that believe it or not there is still a lot of grey market stores out there they're decreasing but they're still there and a lot of them have fled to online so i have still believe it or not there are patients of mine who order cbd because a friend told them to order from the site and the site is an unregulated site sorry an unregulated product site they're not they're not health canada approved and so they're selling gray market products and you know the fact of the matter is when i ask my patients it's the same price as the regulator product so i'm not really sure why one would go besides the fact that one may not unders may not realize that that's a great market site and so the best thing to do is if you're looking for it um you know go to a government regulated retail store you can go on the bc website and find out which stores are uh have a license and you can also find out which companies are are licensed through the bcbc government website um so hopefully that answers that question do you want to ask the next question alana first before i go into this sure some really good questions here a couple more can you recommend some strains brands where to buy doctors who we can talk to do you see patients yourself and prescribe cannabis it's a great question and i'm going to answer all of those as we go through i i promise okay um the next one is actually about cbd so maybe you want to answer that one cbd cbd isolate versus full spectrum cbd great question great question so cbd isolates are some companies out there that um that will sell you a cbd isolate um and so the the evidence for the difference between the two isn't great but i can tell you that clinically and from a theoretical and physiologic standpoint full spectrum is probably better and the reason is is that full spectrum allows more synergy so there's this phenomenon called the entourage effect that suggests that in combination the minor cannabinoids or all the cannabinoids act together and the terpenes to provide a more complete response rather than a single pointed response also there is some ancillary evidence to suggest that cbd isolates may not act as well because you'll need higher doses so for instance there's a there's a product on the market for seizures called epidialex epidialex is uh used in the treatment of childhood seizures that's all that it's really approved for certain childhood sweeteners and it's 99 cbd now you know you talk to the company and they'll say that it's a full spectrum but the fact is is that it's 99 cbd so it's actually really close to an iceland um even though it has the other things now if you look at the doses of epidialex for treatment of seizures you're looking at between 800 to 1500 milligrams that's a lot so if anybody has ever purchased cbd you'll know that a usual standard 40 ml bottle of 25 milligrams that's usually a standard is a thousand milligrams and so when you look at the epidiolex to treat childhood seizures you're looking at consuming one entire bottle twice a day right so it's a lot um and so it's a bit anecdotal so i can't don't go don't quote me saying that isolates are are not as effective because we don't know but based on all the information out there and try to gather everything um and putting it all together my sis my my opinion my medical opinion only is that the full spectrum is more efficacious or acts more or acts better or more effectively than the isolates and one more question yes um perhaps you can comment on this uh my doctor and neurologist told me there is no real proof that cbd works well that's so so i can say that unfortunately a lot of my colleagues continue to say things like this when it's not true and i've been trying to single-handedly speak to all of my colleagues across bc and across canada about this first of all um you know if they ever say things like that you can tell them about the phase three trial for the epidialettes that i just mentioned so that's medical cannabis epidialex is the is the cbd uh for childhood seizures that has phase three trials so um to not get too technical phase 3 trials where you get this randomized double-blind control trials is the gold standard for evidence and there is phase 3 trials for epidialex in childhood seizures and so there is lots of emerging evidence to say that cbd is useful a lot of the neurologists and a lot of the gps they just they say that because they don't know and so what i've been trying to say is that instead of saying no why don't we co-manage the patient through for instance through perceive md and then we can all learn together right and so that's what we'll be doing so for instance a lot of the um a lot of the physicians the ep the neurologists who did epilepsy at vancouver general hospital they didn't know anything about medical cannabis but their patients were all on it so what did they do is that we work now directly with them so we see all of their patients who are on medical cannabis uh or who are on cannabis and also happen to have epilepsy so now we share their patients and we manage the cannabis side and they manage the epilepsy side they're the pharmaceutical epilepsy side and we work together as a team so i think that that's a much better approach than saying nope there's no evidence don't go and try it okay so if that's all uh for now i'm gonna answer some of those other questions that were asked um but here so i think this is one of the questions i was asked should i just go get my canvas from a store and just try it out myself right because everything is legal i can just go to the store now i will tell you this going to the store and getting it from a medical uh prescription exactly the same product okay i don't want you to think that the store has sub has um has products that are inferior to the medical realm it's not it's exactly the same so you say okay well why don't i just go to the store to buy it well there's a few reasons one is that it's always better to get a medical practitioner involved if you're really trying to treat a medical problem right that's my fee that's my that's my stance on everything i mean if you have diabetes and you're trying to treat diabetes with your diet you should really try to employ the the help of a dietician so that you can do it properly and so that's one thing the second is that um in the medical route you you can get uh compassion pricing so if your income is below a certain level a lot of like perceive md for instance can help you register with uh with a producer that can get you a discount whereas if you go to a retail shop they're not going to give you any discount you just pay a retail price the third is in regards to pricing as well when you get a medical document for your for your cannabis um you can write it off on your taxes because now you get a medical prescription it becomes a medical um uh it's prescribed by by a physician so it becomes a medical expense so you can write it off on your taxes and some of the third party plans um are covering it okay um so those are the reasons the the and and you know it's it's here as well so the no medical supervision do you really want to just go and buy from a retail store and then try to dose it yourself you know if you're getting side effects who do you ask if there's drug interactions which we already know there are who do you go to right so those are the reasons that i usually give patients say hey like why would you go try to do this on your own when you clearly have um you know a medical condition for it why don't you employ um the services of of a practitioner now i will also say right now that all of our services are free okay so i don't want people to go out there and say well i would employ a medical service but if i could afford it but i don't have any money all of our services are covered under msp so as long as you are you know you you have provincial coverage you will not pay anything to get our services i mean obviously you'll have to pay for the product because we don't control that but our services you know you see a pharmacist you see a nurse you see a doctor all free how much is a cost this is another one of those questions that i always get okay so in general it's about i would say on average about nine or ten cents per milligram so if you're on 50 milligrams a day you're you're about five dollars okay um and a capsule they've come and come down in price about the same so you know if you're on 20 milligrams a day for instance you're spending two dollars a day okay so in a month that's about sixty dollars a thousand milligram bottle is about ninety dollars and depending on how how much your dosing is right um some people can get away with ours we have some patients who use 90 dollars every two months and some patients who use 90 every 20 days okay um and so you can see that again there are there are benefits right if you're spending you know 145 or 135 dollars a month it's you know and you and you'll be eligible for for instance compassion pricing and you get 20 percent off or 15 off and you get a tax deductible i mean it adds up right um this is the question that was asked okay so how do you get to be seen so we uh you can just have your gp refer to us okay um and i can give alana all of the referral information we can we even have a referral sheet that the physician just fills out and signs and then sends to us so we are a referral only clinic but again we are 100 covered by msp um we require referral either from a gp or your neurologist or any other doctor and what's the benefits of seeing us well you see a pharmacist to make sure that there are no drug interactions that we need to be careful about you see a nurse that can help with your intake and answer any questions you see a doctor who can also help and then you see an educator or a coach that can help you that can help you register with a licensed producer help you register for compassion pricing uh help you find help you place your first order and then you know once you get your product and it comes for instance in a bottle and you look at it and you're like i have no idea how to take this the educator can walk you through like okay this is how you take it and now we're doing everything virtually so you could just do it from the comfort of your home we use um a virtual care platform called ollo health that we can you know connect with you on by video or by phone and then we can help you through and this is what we help you with right okay so dosing side effects drug interactions education so that's it so this is the this is the uh the uh website for um perceive md this is our phone number in case you want to call us um yeah or you could just email us okay and again alana i'll give elena the whole package of what we need what you need to get a hold of us um some more questions here um can i ask for a prescription from my family doctor absolutely so yes any doctor can can fill out a prescription if your family physician or your physician is not has never prescribed cannabis before i can tell you that they're probably going to say no and the reason they're going to say no is because to prescribe cannabis is not the same as prescribing any other drug it's really health canada has really bungled it up and it's and it's quite it's it's not necessarily complicated but it's very different than their usual practice and so um yeah but if they've prescribed it by all means yes they can prescribe it and if you want they can send it over to us and then we can we can take that medical document and submit it on your behalf and help you and you know so you can use any part of our service right so if you say okay i only want to use your educator service you can have your family doctor um send us the medical document and we can we can send it to one of the licensed producers on your behalf and we can help you educate and we can help you apply for compassion pricing all that stuff that i suspect their office wouldn't want or wouldn't necessarily offer you and i'm not sure about this question if i'm reading it properly do you take pt from usa and cost i'm not sure what the pt means products maybe do we take products from the usa uh maybe guest 879 can you elaborate patient patient maybe oh do we take patients from the u.s um maybe maybe that's what it's saying so we can we can take private patients um [Music] yes uh and we can uh but it would have to be private paid because they wouldn't be they would no longer fall under the bc uh provincial coverage if you're from out of province we it would have to be private pay again mostly because the provinces don't have an agreement with each other for medical cannabis and for virtual if you're from the us it becomes a challenge because then we have to we have to um recommend the product that you have to go look for in the us which doesn't sound hard but the difference between canada and the us is in terms of regulations so um in canada the the federal government and health canada has mandated that all the licensed producers be uh regulated which means that they control you know things like dosing there has to be certain uh criteria for quality and for consistency of the label so if it says like 25 milligrams per mil that there is about 25 milligrams per mil in there so it's like accurate packaging in the u.s those regulations don't exist which means that the package can be anything and it could be completely different what's inside the package and so it's unfortunate which means that in the u.s you could have a much more variable response all right thank you um another question does cannabis help with dopamine levels the answer is no so cbd can affect things like your serotonin and your dopamine and your norepinephrine receptors but cannabis in and of itself does not increase your dopamine okay so now that's not to say that the it doesn't help with the parkinson tremor okay so you just remember that the parkinson tremor is there because of dopamine uh nerve cells have died or have been injured and they therefore can't act on subsequent uh nerves so it's like one nerve here that's dopamine releasing that acts on this nerve and this stops working so this nerve doesn't work normally okay but this nerve can be regulated directly by cbd okay so for instance if it's a hyperactive nerve it can be attenuated so it's less active just like dopamine would but it's not dopamine whereas cinnamon and the other dopamine agonist actually go in and give the body more dopamine which does the same thing to this to this nerve okay so it's called the different nerve okay and can we get a free consultation an initial consultation yes like i mentioned everything is free except for the products again we i don't control that but the whole assessment um this whole thing about perceive mb is free if we get referred to perceive is the consultation virtual yes yes we have moved to virtual for covid and also to better serve our patients um and also we realize that a lot of our patients they have mobility issues so being seen at home is better um yeah so for those reasons we've decided to go completely virtual um i don't see any more questions in the chat box but i have a question of course um so you know i think many neurologists might be cautious in recommending cannabis use and do you think this has something to do with the concern about the hallucinogenic effects or do you attribute it to something else and is there a high risk for hallucinogenic effects uh for people with pd or or does it just vary from person to person it's a good question so uh off the bat it definitely varies from person to person but the issue really how with neurologists or actually any physician who doesn't consider or won't consider recommending or or trying cannabis is really their own biases and no matter what i think sometimes um people may forget that physicians are human so they're just as human as anybody else we're we're not superheroes which is to say that there is inherent like we live our lives and we still get biased by things around us so you know if people or physicians have uh a son or a daughter who got addicted to cannabis or a friend's friend who got addicted to cannabis or they deal with addictions medicine themselves and they see people addicted to cannabis that they would say no this is not a drug but my argument for uh to that would be the opiates look at the opiate crisis that we're in right now okay it's a terrible crisis people die more people die from opioid overdose than from kovit but i would challenge any person to undergo major surgery without opiates no one would do it it's inhumane okay so the point being that cannabis just because cannabis has been abused it doesn't mean that it has no medicinal benefits because it does and so the problem is is that people tend to bring their own biases into their practice because we're just human and there isn't great there isn't great evidence yet but i can tell you that lots of things that we do in medicine don't have great evidence okay i'm sure that i'll uh some people here i'm certain of it must have been given gabapentin as a prescription drug in the past now i would challenge any of you to ask your physicians to show you what the evidence for gabapentin is and i can tell you that it's quite bad same with the opiates not great evidence for chronic pain use but we do it same with surgeries most surgeries have no good evidence that they work but we do it what i'm trying to say is i'm not saying that surgery is bad or that the opinion is i'm just organ pendant is bad or that opiates are bad i'm just trying to say that there are lots of things in medicine that we do that doesn't have great evidence because we learned over time that it works okay when your appendix bursts and we have to go remove it there's no evidence for that right no one did a trial to say okay if we didn't remove it versus if we did remove it do you die because you wouldn't be able to do that study but surgeons will remove that appendix that's all that's all i really have to say about that sure that's understandable you know i think that oh sorry just one other thing i just wanted to say because there was another point that you made there um that i didn't answer which is the other thing this is that most physicians think of cannabis as thc and so yes and i already mentioned it i am very cautious about giving my cannabis patients thc okay about giving my pd patients thc because a if they already have imbalance issue or dizziness at baseline and i gave them a whole bunch of thc and it just made it worse they're gonna fall and they're gonna break a hip and i'm gonna make them worse so for sure do i want my parkinson's patients high no usually not right but there are some instances actually when the disease is so debilitating that maybe getting a little escape from the reality of the terminal illness is actually a benefit but cbd on the other hand isn't doesn't have these issues right and so that's the problem is that a lot of the people when they when you ask them with medical cannabis they think oh you're going to smoke it and you're going to be thc it's really very far from what we do at the clinic yeah i was just going to say yeah that's understandable on the one hand despite its legalization for sure there is some stigma that is still attached to it and perhaps a misunderstanding between cbd and thc so i think when people think of marijuana they think of being high which is really attributed to thc um and a couple more questions here as well does cannabis help with stiffness so the rigidity i'm pro i think that question is probably referring to the rigidity that parkinson's patients feel where it's almost like things get stuck and the answer is is maybe and i don't know the answer necessarily because we don't we don't have good evidence for it and the reason that i say is maybe is because when you physiologically what causes the stiffness or the rigidity in parkinson's patients it's actually not to do with their muscles it's to do with their nerves okay it's the damage in their nerves that cause the sort of cog wheeling okay and that cog wheeling is if you can fix the nerves um the with cbd you can i guess theoretically or physiologically improve that rigidity now if it's strictly a muscle rigidity because there are some rigidity or stiffness from the muscles itself i don't know right there is some suggestion though that cbd is anti-inflammatory so if it's from inflammation then the answer is maybe it does help um but yeah i don't know the answer for sure okay great another question if my doctor or neurologist refuses to refer what do we do so you know if you try um and you really can't get referred uh we can you know we recommend usually like a walk-in clinic okay um to get a referral and if you really can't we have a no refusal policy all right and perhaps you can comment on this comment my mom was on gabapentin for years and it didn't do anything yes i saw that comment actually it's uh it's like what i said right the elements were kevin pence and it just sort of made me laugh when i saw it because uh i know lots of people like this and um and this is exactly one of those things we give things in medicine all the time based on what someone else may have told us and we've never really looked up the evidence and there's no evidence for it that's why gabapentin doesn't do anything does cbd help with pain yes and so that's why i put the slide up again to show you that it does help with pain your own you're looking at almost a 50 reduction and this is a really good question here how about patients already having hallucinations yes great question so in patients already having hallucinations i would certainly um opt for minimal thc which means that again like another reason not to just go to the to the retail store to get this different companies have varying amounts of thc in them so even though the bottle may say let's say 25 milligrams per ml of cbd the amount of thc in there is varies from accompanying the company some people have like 0.8 or 0.4 milligrams per mill and some people go all the way up to one or two milligrams per mil of thc and so if someone already has hallucinations our team would be very certain um to make sure we choose a product for the patient that has the lowest amount of thc in it um and this and and just mostly cbd uh and the cbd can actually potentially help with some of the hallucinations we have time for a couple more questions do you have patients who take is that patient yes so there are yes so i mean you know we've seen i want to say probably like 2700 patients now so you can imagine that we've seen just about every drug out there in terms of combination uh and so yes we have many patients on quotations it's a pretty common drug um and that's why our pharmacists work directly with the patient and the physician to make sure that okay if we're gonna start and there's a potential interaction these are what to look out for and that's why we see our patients regularly in follow-up so unlike you know some other clinics you know that may say okay here's your prescription for six months go away we make sure that we see we see our patients regularly because i mean it's a journey it's a journey that we go along with the patient okay and one more question here what would be or two more questions what would be the best time of the day to take cbd so there's no real best time to take cbd um it really depends so there are some patients that we have for instance that have predominantly insomnia issues and so we tell them to take it at night you know a few hours before they sleep but there are but but sometimes and it lasts the whole day the next day so it really depends on the person and that's something something that we usually try to help the patients figure out um usually the oral oil or capsule lasts for about eight to twelve hours okay and so you know it depends if you're trying to to help with the tremors in the daytime you may take you know twice a day in the daytime and at night or if you're mostly for tremors and it only bothers you in the daytime maybe you're just taking a daytime and not at night all right and what does oh sorry does thc build up or accumulate in your body so the answer is yes thc and cbd probably do accumulate um they're very lipophilic so they do probably stay in fat um but does that mean that you get addicted or does that mean that you actually get tolerant um and the answer is is we don't know there's some suggestion in the literature when you look at the addiction studies that um that people who use like a lot and i'm talking like a lot like 5 grams 5 to 10 grams a day that they do get withdrawal symptoms but 5 to 10 grams a day is is a i can't i mean for a lot of people they may not realize how much that is but that's an astronomical amount okay i think we have time for one last question here um uh two more questions then and i think that we can wrap it up here um i love that you guys have these really great questions thank you it makes for a better presentation i agree when we have that dialogue um how do we decrease drowsiness in the morning when taken at night for insomnia good question so you can either try to take it earlier in the evening so that its effects are not lasting as long so for instance if you're taking it two hours before bedtime and then you're finding it that it does help you sleep but in the morning when you get up it's you still feel drowsy or a bit groggy for a remaining two hours then you may push the dose back uh to take it two hours earlier at night or you can reduce the dose and the last question if using cbd should i stay away from alcohol i mean in general unless one is consuming a copious amount of alcohol probably not i mean if you're drinking you know one to two glasses of wine for instance a day is fine you know if you're drinking you know half a bottle of wine a day then that's a problem but it's not really a problem so much with the cbd because they tend not to necessarily interact it's more problem with the alcohol consumption and the fact that you're going to get drowsy okay great i think we can wrap things up now uh it's a little past two o'clock dr lam i want to thank you so much for taking the time out of your busy schedule to deliver such an informative presentation for our pd community it really was great and i also want to thank everyone for your great questions um and i'm happy to pass along that information that dr lim um was saying if you send me was that the referral form yeah i'll send you a referral form and some information that they can provide that patients can provide their their family doctors and you can look online as well um both on perceive md and concord medical center you know we're in the transition phase right now but i'll send you both information sure and then i can uh email it to the registrants today so thank you so much and have a great afternoon my pleasure thank you everyone thanks bye-bye bye you", "W0sPCDGvBKk": "hello everyone and welcome to wustream bringing willamette to you for today's presentation dr daniel nicolai will discuss the effects of marijuana on the brain dr nikolai was born and raised in oregonian he completed his general psychiatry residency at oregon health and science university and then went on to become a child and adolescent psychiatry fellow at the university of colorado denver before returning home training in those two states we can only imagine how many of his patients used marijuana in fact seeing so much marijuana use in his clinical practice is what sparked his interest in the effect that this drug has on the brain he has given several talks on the subject at community health centers advocacy groups schools and he even testified before a colorado congressional committee on marijuana legislation he just completed his training in forensic psychiatry at ohsu last summer and has elected to continue working there as a member of the faculty thanks for joining us today dr nikolai i'll turn the presentation over to you hi thanks for that introduction and i'm very excited to be here with you all to talk about a subject that i find fascinating and that's you know cannabis and it's in fact its effect on the brain and i have a lot of material to get through so i'm going to dive right in to go yep there goes so i have no financial disclosures to make no conflicts of interest i would like to mention though i i do work at ohsu as a faculty member but i'm not here representing oregon health and science university i'm here talking about my own research my own interests and my own expertise not representing my institution so here's what we're going to talk about today i'm going to talk a little bit about how marijuana is researched or how it's not researched and how other drugs are researched we're going to talk about the epidemiology of marijuana mainly who's using it and how much we're going to explore how marijuana consumption has evolved it's changed a lot over the past few decades we're gonna look at of course the name of the talk how cannabis and marijuana affect the developing brain at key areas of development and then we'll talk about some of the evidence-based uses for medical cannabis what we do with it and what the research shows it can and cannot do so how is marijuana researched so this is not how marijuana is researched this is how a typical pharmaceutical drug is researched and brought to market there's four phases of clinical trials that a medication has to go through to become fda approved and stay fda approved so before a drug even enters these phases uh you have to do you know kind of design the drug test it on animals kind of get your best sense of if it's working if it's safe and then you move on to phase one and that's where you take a handful of volunteers that are young and healthy you give them small amounts of the drug and you watch them 24 hours a day and make sure that it's safe and you're only looking for safety at this point is the drug safe so most of the time in fact the drugs are safe 70 past this test then you go on to phase two and this is where we start kind of giving more doses of the medication of the drug to you know research subjects human research subjects volunteers and now we're looking you know is it efficacious does this drug work you know if it's supposed to lower the blood pressure does it actually lower the blood pressure and this is a tougher task to pass right only about one third make it through both phase um one and phase two so most drugs don't make it past phase two if you make it past phase two and do pretty well you go on to phase three and drug companies are reluctant to go to this phase because it costs a lot of money you know it costs about a billion dollars to bring a drug to market and a lot of it is in phase three this is where you do huge studies thousands of human subjects usually multiple sites all over the country often all over the world they take years to complete we when you hear you know that a drug works in 30 minutes or less or something like that that's based on this research once they pass phase three and show that it's effective and it's safe they can request approval approval from the fda and start you know prescribe doctors can start prescribing it to the masses and they can start advertising it and such however the drug companies aren't out of the woods yet there's phase four clinical trials where they have to um make sure it's safe for side effects sometimes they have to add additional warnings and investigate you know potential side effects that the medication is causing and then um sometimes a drug gets pulled from the market altogether because they find out it's not safe after the fact so drugs go through a lot of tests and a lot of research before they're brought to market now for marijuana we haven't done any of that and the reason for that is on this slide so medications if they have a potential for abuse or addiction they get classified by the drug enforcement agency so they get placed on a schedule so you see schedule one medications are illegal to prescribe right because they have no medicinal qualities and a lot of potential for abuse independence so drugs in this category heroin lsd this is acid ecstasy kod and you see marijuana right there you go down to schedule two and these are pretty tightly controlled um so these are like you know the big pain pills like oxycontin vicodin the stimulants like adderall and ritalin and i thought this was interesting methamphetamine is a schedule two medication so i cannot prescribe marijuana but i can prescribe methamphetamine and the first time i gave this talk i went ahead and looked this up like gosh is that on the formula can i prescribe methamphetamine that is so bizarre and here it is right now so kids six or older with adhd a very common diagnosis can't be prescribed methamphetamine legally i doubt any drug companies actually make this drug i've never seen it prescribed and even simple obesity if you're 12 years or older you can be prescribed methamphetamine can you imagine taking your maybe husky 12 year old into the doctor who's having trouble focusing and he's like oh he's overweight and has adhd let's get that kid some meth it's um a bizarre thing how some of these medications are scheduled through the dea all right on to epidemiology um and of course uh if you guys can guess who this is i played with the effects to make it a little bit tough but i think a lot of you can probably still see that this is barack obama allegedly it wasn't photoshopped so i'm going to talk about who uses marijuana and how much i'm going to start with some national data there's two kind of big national surveys they do this is from the 2018 national survey by samsa which is um the big government agency that funds substance abuse and mental health uh resources so i'm gonna go through a lot of charts a lot of figures i really just want to drive home the highlights and so this slide you know people aged 12 or older a lot of them use marijuana right 43.5 million people which is about 16 of the population and of course this is a national survey so it considers you know marijuana an illegal drug and marijuana dwarfs use of any other illegal drug by far as you can see all right and how many have used in the past year and what age grew so this is people aged uh 12 and older and you see they break it down the blue line here is 18 to 25 year olds and you will see that as a theme that 18 to 25 year olds are the most or the group that uses marijuana the most and if you look here kids age 12 to 17 is the gray line that is quite similar to just adults 26 and older the yellow line so kids and adults outside that 18 to 25 year old range are using marijuana at about the same rate so this is pastor marijuana initiates so who what age are people starting marijuana or trying it for the first time and this is probably one slide where it's not the 18 to 25 year olds it's the 12 17 year olds it's the teenagers and even kids are a little bit younger is when most people start marijuana it's kind of starting to collapse here a little but still it's mostly the 12 to 17 year olds so and now i'm going to talk about another trend which is that people aren't perceiving marijuana as um as dangerous so they kind of surveyed you know do you think this is you know a harmful thing to do smoke marijuana on a weekly basis that's the red line you can see most people said no and this is um for youth this is age 12 to 17 about 40 percent of people thought that marijuana uh smoking marijuana weekly was a bad thing to do um and you can see other drugs are higher cocaine heroin you know frequent alcohol and cigarette use you go to adults age 18 to 25 and you see this line gets cut in half so about half as many people age 18 to 25 see smoking marijuana as a problem compared to those that are younger i'll flip it back so 12 to 17 year olds about 40 that red line there and then about 20 or less for 18 to 25 year olds and this is people who have developed marijuana use disorder so that's you know there's 11 criteria to get diagnosed with the substance use disorder it's things like spending too much money on marijuana spending too much time trying to get it it causes you problems in your life but you still keep doing it etc etc you build up a tolerance you suffer withdrawal when you stop using it suddenly um and you can see again 18 to 25 year olds um about six percent of them marijuana use disorder all right it wouldn't be a bunch of charts and graphs without a good old venn diagram so you see the big blue circle here these are youths age 12 17 who had a major depressive episode so lots of youth have major depressive episodes for lots of reasons why the blue dot is the big one the yellow circle here is youths who had a substance use disorder and this isn't specific to marijuana um but this is kind of the data that was available and you can see a big chunk of this yellow circle has had a major depressive episode right 40 of it so if i have a kid comes in who you know uses marijuana heavy to the point where it's a problem that's a substance use disorder and he's at high risk he or she's at high risk of having a major depressive episode there's a big overlap there all right and these graphs kind of get confusing but so this is age 12-17 and you can see you know about 32 percent of youths had a major depressive episode and you know used illicit drugs about 14 of youths did not have a major depressive episode but use drugs and you can see kind of with all these substance use most of them have had major depressive episodes so people who use drugs tend to have major depressive episodes um you know in this age group and this trend is true also for adults age 18 or older right the red one here is no mental illness the dark blue one is any mental illness and then the biggest one in about every group is serious mental illness so adults with serious mental illnesses to use marijuana at higher rates and this is where i get in my soapbox and talk about the need for better substance use treatment right about 15 of 18 to 25 year olds need substance to use treatment again this is not specific to marijuana it's a substance use in general and here's the people who actually enroll in substance use treatment right 2 so we need 15 and we have two percent so people don't have access to treatment it's it's very unfortunate all right let's switch over to data from good old state of oregon so this is you know the olcc oregon liquor commission tracks how much revenue is brought in by um the cannabis dispensaries and um so you can see this is you know sold per month so about 60 million dollars we've grown um 60 million dollars per month of sales and you can see it's just skyrocketed over the years and even more so if you're looking at units sold this is the cost of marijuana over time so we're making more and more money and selling it cheaper in the industry um right the price is cut in half and this is for a usable marijuana which is kind of the dried flour that you smoke the bud essentially all right so daily marijuana use in teens and this is a dif this is national data again and this is from a different you know kind of survey they do every year called the monitoring the future survey so you can see eighth graders that went from point seven to one point three percent almost doubled in the course of one year and that's you know daily use not kids have used at all but eighth graders who are using marijuana on a daily basis tenth graders that also took a pretty significant jump to almost 5 in 2019 now if you look at daily use of marijuana people are using it more than they ever have before so back in the 1990s a typical kind of like pothead or stoner would smoke a joint on saturday and sunday and that was um you know what we'd consider a pothead back then and marijuana back then it's laughable now it was about four percent thc and that was pretty strong stuff back then it tend to average more around two or three percent um so you know you have a couple joints saturday and sunday that comes out to about 4.6 milligrams of thc consumed you know on a daily basis on you know up for a seven day week now this is data a few years old in the state of washington the typically daily user smokes are consumed marijuana multiple times per day and average thc is about 20 i imagine it's it's higher now especially for daily users i'll have some slides to show on that later and so that was about 1.3 grams per day of 20 thc was the statistic a few years ago so that comes out to about 260 milligrams of thc consumed each and every day so went from 4.6 daily back in the 90s to now or even a couple years ago 260 milligrams so i'll do the math for you that's an increase of about 60 fold so to put that in other terms if you think of caffeine you know caffeine is not harmful in small amounts you have a cup of coffee every day there's even some research that shows that people who do that live a little bit longer than people who don't drink coffee um right so that's about 150 milligrams of caffeine per day is a vendi cappuccino at starbucks you increase that by 60 fold that's 9 000 milligrams of caffeine if you just said hey i'm gonna alter concentrated stuff i'm gonna take this more right it's natural no harm um that's a lethal dose of caffeine that's enough drug to kill you so when people say marijuana it's been around for years it's natural that's not necessarily true right it's highly genetically modified it's way more potent than it's ever been it's not organic it's they use pesticides um which is you know the biggest infraction that companies get is for misuse of pesticides or not using them correctly um yeah and if you did the same thing with caffeine that would kill you so we don't really know what this high amount of frequent use of thc does to the brain and so this is kind of a confusing slide this is each line is a different study here so just look at the black one that's the average and this shows the trend that people who use more days per year so those that use every day use more each day right so if you just smoke every once in a while maybe just socially you might just take a couple puffs if you're smoking every day you're often smoking high potency stuff eating it dabbing it whatever doing a lot of it each day so these are the people where the research shows we have some reason for concern that if you're using a lot and you're consuming it every day um your brain can be in trouble and this is the trend that we're seeing more and more people do right marijuana is okay to use it's not harmful so i'm going to use it all day every day and here's kind of that same line they did some fancy math to make a nice smooth line based on their data and you see it's up to 1.75 grams per day the the statistic i gave you on the slide was 1.3 grams per day right and so many people use much much more than that right and then of course vaping is just exploding right this is monthly marijuana vaping you see that almost doubled among high school seniors um in the last year and of course the cigarette companies have not changed uh their ads right here's an old cigarette ad and here's a new um julian or vaping ad and just a little bit on my high horse about vaping that's really exploded we were kind of winning the war on tobacco for many years um teenagers were smoking less and less the rates were going down until vaping and flavor vaping came out and it's just exploded right so you know about 20 to 25 of high school students at various ages um had vaped in the last month according to this survey all right so really the main takeaways i want you guys to get from all those charts and graphs i spent all that time was is that people are using cannabis and marijuana more frequently than ever before they're using formulations that are more powerful and more potent than ever before and they're starting to use it at younger and younger ages right often 12 to 17 which is of concern for me right because i'm a child and analyst and psychiatrist so i talk to kids about this [Music] a lot so what exactly is marijuana so the marijuana plant is down here on the bottom left there are two species of the marijuana there's cannabis sativa and cannabis indica and so the indica is supposed to be the chill one that helps you stay calm they say indica keeps you in the couch and sativa is a more stimulating strain is what people report so the most common way to consume marijuana is to kind of take the leaves you dry them up roll them up and you put this and you smoke it with a flame and a joint this here is called hashish this comes from the middle of the plant and they used to throw this part away because you couldn't really dry it out and smoke it all that well and then they figured out hey there's tons of psychoactive compound in there let's kind of make it into clay make it into oil make it into all these other formulations of it so we're using the whole plant now this up here on the top left is a hemp plant so hemp it's a different species of plant it also contains cbd and thc and there is a law that you can sell hemp products uh as long as they have less than one percent thc in them so when you go to the grocery store and just see there's cbd or even a doggy daycare we used to take my dog sold cbd products those are hemp derived there is kind of a loophole on the law where they can sell cbd derived from hemp without any kind of restrictions like you'd see in the dispensary the cbdc dispensary comes from the marijuana plants all right so how can you do it well you can smoke it in a vape pen you can smoke it in a joint a bong this is what it looks like this was the strongest strain at the dispensary i went to a few years ago when i took pictures about two three years ago you can eat it right and these look delicious i took pictures of the ones that looked the most delicious to me especially the s'mores i'm a sucker for s'mores dark colored cherry always good throw some cbd in there and of course the peanut butter buddha with the fun little cartoon guy here and then something that really took me back to my childhood was the pop rocks right let's throw some marijuana in them and call them pop rocks it is interesting to note that there are a lot of laws that have been passed uh in states that have legalized cannabis that you can't have packaging that's appealing to children right so in my mind all this has to go even the pot rocks right pot roxy you know it's the rocks with an x there's an exclamation point it's brightly colored i mean how are you going to make and package candy that's not appealing to kids it's pretty much impossible and since marijuana has been legalized and edibles have been popular there are more and more reports of kids small kids like ages two three four coming to the emergency department um with cannabis intoxication um that require emergent treatment all right you go and eat it you can drink it put a little pep in your coffee this is a little five hour energy type drink the cocktails look great especially this bloody mary here with the bacon and everything you can put it topically directly on your skin here's tinctures here's kind of a coconut oil infused lotion type thing patches you can put on your skin and then of course there are the concentrated oils and this is a formulation i really want to spend some time talking about this is the most potent and the strongest way to consume cannabis this is called dabbing this is a dab rig and the bud tender told me when i went to visit the dispensary what you do is you take a grain of a drop of the concentrated oil this is about 100 this is pretty much pure thc you take a little drop of that oil or they happen in waxes and other formulations you put it here on the rig heat it up and you smoke it in out the other side i'll show you a little video and one little drop the grain of the rice is more powerful than a joint it it will get you very intoxicated so you can imagine people that haven't done it before or just pour a little bit too much maybe the size of two grains of rice maybe they don't know what kind of rice the butter was talking about and they can get you know very very intoxicated and even psychotic where they lose touch with reality they get paranoid there were some high-profile cases in colorado um when it first became legalized where people kind of consumed too much cannabis and a kid um became psychotic lost touch with reality thought that like aliens were out to get him or something and he jumped off a bridge and died so there is potential harm especially um when you're consuming or dabbing as they call it right so ask your kids indeed and i work with kids and i ask them kind of every time they come this is dad use marijuana if you use some marijuana how much do you use and do you dab do you eat you know and most kids or dabbing these days that i talked to that used marijuana or at least tried it and it it really messes it can really mess you up here's the advertisement for one of the ones at the dispensary i went to so concentrated one little jar can smell like you're in a whole room full of your favorite strain this is for everyone who can't get enough of their favorite strain a concentrate with all the aroma all the flavor and all the effects only far more powerful and they are not false advertising there this is powerful powerful stuff and of course it's getting more and more popular again we're back to data from our good old state of oregon this was somewhere in california are in colorado and washington data and i imagine california too so this again is revenue by thousands of dollars and the different types so the most popular is the usable marijuana flower which is kind of like the dried bud that people smoke that's where dispensaries get most of their money but again look at what has towered into second to clear second place is the concentrates the extracts the dabbing the oils the waxes that are you know oftentimes 100 um thc or close to that and then you can see the edible tinctures here not terribly picking up steam or making that much money and then this nice orange line which is other and i know you guys are wondering dr nikolai what what is other what does that other line mean well let's talk about that so if you're not into any of the other formulations that i've shown you so far they have suppositories these can be placed in the rectum or in the vagina and the blood tender told me that people use these maybe if they have rectal or vaginal cancer and they want to get some marijuana or cbd right to the site of injury and this is a marijuana-soaked tampon for anyone who might be interested in consuming thc that way so i was like man people really love marijuana especially in colorado when i did my training there this was a small mountain town right i had no idea where the next gas station was but i knew dang sure where the closest dispensary was and it was about 100 miles away from this one and also so when kovid uh the governor of colorado issued the shelter-in-place orders for covet a few months ago people flocked to the dispensaries um right big lines no one was wearing masks right you couldn't get them yet businesses weren't set up to socially distance and so they were really worried that people were gonna you know spread covid like this so of course the governor announced immediately okay dispensaries you're an essential business you can stay open people don't need to flock to them right away and then if that's not proof enough that people love cannabis here is a personal lubricant infused with thc so for people that love marijuana so much they want to have sex with it it turns out there's a way to do that and that people are doing it because this is a product for sale all right let's talk about what cannabis does to the brain so there's you know about 100 different cannabinoid compounds or chemicals in the marijuana plant and then hundreds of other chemicals that they've isolated you know around 400 or so it seems like more and more each year and so here's kind of a breakdown of some of the different ones and kind of what we think they do and what might be therapeutic and it is important to note that your brain does have natural endogenous cannabinoids so endogenous is just a fancy word for hormones so kind of as a hormone in your brain there are cannabinoids that bind to the same receptors as thc the plant form of thc and your brain has cannabinoid binding sites throughout it and it's interesting you know a few decades ago we didn't even know this existed in the brain so all the little yellow dots are where um binding sites where thc uh combined or the you know the natural hormone cannabinoids can bind and you can see it affects things like the pleasure reward pathway which is you know highly correlated with addiction it can affect memory coordination i mean pretty much everything in the brain except for vision right your vision kind of stays the same judgment right lots of stuff so your brain is made up of a bunch of neurons so this neurons is how your brain kind of sends signals from one area to the next and this is kind of what they look like obviously they're much smaller than this so signals come from over here i'm assuming you guys can see the mouse i'm hoping that they come from the yellow end they go down the sheath and it's kind of like traveling through a wire in your house so they're they're insulated right so if you had a wire in your house that wasn't insulated it was just a metal wire and you were trying to light a light bulb that wouldn't be very efficient you would lose a lot of energy in heat um and right you can even start a fire or something like that it's just not an efficient way so the neurons in your body need to be insulated they need this insulation to send signals and information um you know so you can move your arm and have a thought that sort of thing from one area of the brain to the next and so it sends it from one to the other neurons and you know the message you know gets propagated and expanded and right each of these neurons send it to 100 more and do 100 more etc so this is kind of what one zoomed in looks like it goes from this end sends the information along this long myelin sheath to the other end and these are kind of fat pads that insulated the schwann cells so um let's talk about thc and cbd so thc is the more psychoactive compound cbd is less psychoactive you will hear people most of the time including physicians say that cbd is not psychoactive that is a misnomer cbd it works on the brain right that's why people take it because they want an effect on the brain drugs and medications that work on the brain are psychoactive it is much less psychoactive than thc but it is still psychoactive thc binds directly to those cannabinoid receptors right little yellow dots on the brain that i showed you a few minutes ago cbd does not bind to those and that is very confusing right a compound called cannabidiol does not bind to the cannabinoid receptors i think sometimes they make this information so hard and confusing so they can charge a lot of money for medical school so cbd has several effects on the brain and there's lots of theories to how it works but it does work on the brain and here are kind of some of the things we're figuring out it does works on serotonin receptors in the brain glycine receptors um fatty acid receptors um it works as a potent antioxidant which i'll talk about a little bit later so we're kind of learning about cbd and figuring out how it works in the brain it's not a direct binder to the site but it works indirectly to increase how your brain uses the natural hormone cannabinoids that are there so when we research cbd in animals here's what we're finding some promise or what we kind of hope it will do so in mice you can order medical mice uh from the store you can call them say hey i want you know 100 mice with anxiety and 100 mice without they can send them to your lab they're all genetically identical and you can experiment on them give them cannabis or other drugs so in rats it seems in mice it seems to um reduce anxiety maybe it reduces some depression-like behaviors um enhances social behaviors which we're hoping to translate to autism and then you know reduce some addictive potential and again this is in mice and so there's a lot of research that we do in mice and then try to do it on humans and we don't get the same effects right only a third of drug trials make it past um one and two right phases one and two so this is a slide i always show and usually there's a doctor in the crowd or something like this but if you can think of a medication any medication that has a lot of uses you know kind of like the pepto-bismol commercial where it's like bobbing upset stomach diarrhea i'm right there's three indications right there um one i think about a lot of is prozac or fluoxetine which um you know depression obsessive compulsive disorder generalized anxiety disorder panic attacks aggression and autism um you know so you probably think about six seven eight uses for it and that's a lot for medication so you can do eight different things if we look at marijuana it has a vast number of indications that um states have legalized it for medically right so this is just a state of organ you can use medical marijuana for cancer glaucoma uh neurological conditions hiv um any condition that causes cachexia which is like wasting syndrome you're you're not eating you're losing weight that sort of thing wasting away severe pain severe nausea seizures and muscle spasms like those seen in multiple sclerosis and then also post-traumatic stress disorder which many states have legalized the use of cannabis for then if you look you know throughout the us i mean the indications are growing more and more and some of them i'm not even sure how they could have an effect right like pancreatitis parkinson's disease alzheimer's disease anorexia i mean it's really turning into a drug that can cure all our all ales even though there's not really research into most of these conditions certainly not the level of research that would be required for any other medication so if we look at you know where there is some research to treat um things from marijuana or marijuana derivatives um there is actually some good uses right so there are some medications that treat nausea that are you know synthetic analogs of thc so they took the compound thc they made a similar compound and bang got it fda approved and it's actually been approved for a while for decades and it it kind of works for nausea and appetite stimulant and that is approved by the fda in um in the united states so for specificity and pain like seen in ms this there's a thc analog that's not available in the us but about 17 other countries including some european ones where they use a synthetic thc uh to treat chronic pain and then recently um they take cbd and pharmaceutical companies purify it and make pharmaceutical grade cbd pills that can use to be treat seizures and that is fda approved in the united states there's some promising research right like cbd looks like it has some anti-inflammatory antioxidant effects that can be beneficial looks like it in certain types of tumors it could have a nice impact and you know some evidence that can be helpful for the symptoms and problems that cause glaucoma and you see i'm a psychiatrist so i live over here in the you know this realm here where there's really not good research showing that cannabis helps these conditions long term what we tend to see is that people in the short term you know they start doing cannabis oh it helps my ptsd and they say that for a couple months if we follow them out however like a year later they're not really any significantly better and a lot of the times they're worse and people that don't turn to cannabis or rely on cannabis as a medication for these psychiatric problems are better off than those who don't and again that's observational research it's not as good as we hope but that's that's the correlation that we see that's the connection that we see and here are just the names of some of the synthetic thcs um right epiduolex is the new cbd that's available i'll just fly through that in the interest of time and here's a little video about a family's experience with medical marijuana that i want to show all right um so yeah there are a lot of people who are very passionate about marijuana and cannabis and or um you know really tell your story this is really life-changing for me most of the cases i've come across that it hasn't had much of an effect a lot of parents get desperate they try cbd oils and they don't really see much improvement and then of course there's these kind of handful of cases that i see mostly in the media um where it's been life-changing and so this is some researchers i met with when i was preparing first time i gave this talk at the university of colorado denver where i did some of my training and they were researching kind of just what we saw there does the not the pharmaceutical grade cannabidiol but the the cannabidiol oils um that you can get at the dispensaries does that help you know reduce seizures and what they were finding was that yes parents would report yes my kids having less seizures since i started taking these oils from the dispensary however when they hook the kids up to the eeg monitors where they put you know all the chords on the brain and measure the brainwave activity and the kids were having the same number of seizures as before they started the um the cannabinoid oils so uh kind of the research hasn't shown that the oils you get from the dispensary are helpful however you get you know parents it's 85 it's life-changing we need to continue it so it's really important to kind of take it case by case especially because there's a lack of good research we don't have big studies on this all right so there's two times in our lives where our brain is really susceptible to marijuana one is when we're developing in the uterus of our mother and the other time is adolescence so i'm going to start with kind of in utero development when you know we're developing fetus so this again is animal research but phonatal is kind of the rat term for prenatal so before you're born you're developing your mom's stomach and this axis here is um how many uh cannabinoid receptors you have in the brain so you can see the two structures here the copis colossum and the fornix have a lot of cbd cb1 binding sites in utero and then those go down over time and then the cerebellum and hippocampus and the teenage years have a lot of binding sites so your brain has the most binding sites for cannabis the prenatal period and the teenage period so you know there's different views on this you'll see in the media this is the stoner mom she has a fairly popular blog she calls herself the booboo kissing classroom volunteering primrose stoned supermom sent it next to you at school pickup and here was um one of her posts about pot and the breastfeeding mom here's a familiar refrain studies on marijuana using mothers and their breast-fed babies are few and far between like pot and pregnancy there are some things people just don't want to touch perhaps decriminalization would have an impact on the availability of studies and we could ditch the archaic anti-reagan bullshit of the 1980s and move into the future or not whatever breastfeeding i'm a fan without totally outing myself i will say that i am somewhat of a closeted hippie so kind of her take on it and is true that there's not really research showing that breast feeding your baby um while smoking marijuana is harmful for the baby but that study also doesn't exist and you can imagine that study will never exist in high quality research because no parent is going to say oh here take my baby give it some cannabis which we do know it enters the breast milk and you know can get into the baby's brain and just tell me if it's good or bad uh you know no ethics committee is going to approve that study it's never going to happen so the labeling and warnings we see on marijuana in the state of oregon right you know you have to be 21 don't let children do it don't operate you know machinery doesn't say anything about pregnant or nursing mothers that should be advised stay away from it alcohol right pregnant women don't do it can cause birth defects tobacco right they have to put this label fetal injury premature birth and low birth weight marijuana has no such label like that in the state of oregon this is the position statement of the american college of obstetrics and gynecologists you know pregnancy doctors ob gyn and you know they kind of say we don't have the data so we say stop using marijuana while you're pregnant and i will say in medical school i was shocked this is the area of medicine that is probably the most conservative any risk that may be over zero percent to an unborn child is unacceptable in this country and this area of medicine right like i've seen don't do hot yoga even though you know there's not really research shane is harmful i've seen doctors recommend you know don't eat sushi don't eat soft cheeses don't eat sandwich meats you know don't jump on a trampoline i mean being pregnant is just a giant list of things not to do because there may be a fraction of a percent chance that it could be harmful to the baby and it's hard to i'm a psychiatrist right it's hard to inspire behavioral change in anyone except when they're pregnant people comply people will do anything you tell them and to say that marijuana which you know there is some research showing that it may be harmful to young infants and pregnant women um and people are kind of ignoring that or saying the research isn't good enough or just um kind of even thinking it's helpful or can be used as medicine during pregnancy or for children it's it it makes me nervous so from research on animal studies uh we know that you know when we give the mother um thc about 10 of it gets into the fetal um you know the blood of the fetus of the developing baby and we know that the endocannabinoid system right that's a natural system in your brain that has receptors and you have hormones that bind to those sites like we talked about earlier those start developing about 16 to 22 days after conception which is about the time um you find out you're pregnant if you're actively tracking if it's a boobs baby which about half of babies are you probably wouldn't even notice that and this kind of fancy terms is pretty much the brain and central nervous system which are developing and have binding sites already for cannabinoid which can be altered by um you know thc and non-natural or non you know brain um cannabinoids that are different than um the ones that your brain naturally makes so from the plant not from within the brain itself so the research on humans of course is flawed one it's illegal to research cannabis because it's a federal crime so we can't get federal money for it and hospitals can lose their federal funding if they research it and when we just look at observational data and kind of see what people are doing you know there's difference in socioeconomic status how much money people make how educated they are you know all the million other things going on in people's lives that we have to try to control for which is difficult in research like this but kind of what we what some correlations we are finding is that you know if if pregnant women use marijuana their kids will have uh more likely to have lower processing speeds and that's kind of a majority part of the measure of iq where it's exactly what it sounds like how quickly you can process information and also lower visual problem solving which is um kind of problem solving anything other than numbers and letters so doing puzzles reading a map um that sort of thing and when we looked at a big meta analysis meta-analysis means um they pool a bunch of other studies together the data to kind of have like one giant pool of information and draw conclusions from that that you know infants that were exposed to cannabis uh in the uterus you know have lower birth weight they were more likely to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and a higher stillbirth rate right but or in the state of oregon we don't see these warnings on the label and you know i have another slider move but pregnant women are using this more and more you know using cannabis for um like morning sickness and nausea and stuff during pregnancy because they again there's not a lot of research or warning labels and because of the lack of information a lot of people see it as safe all right so let's move on to adolescents teenagers um population that i work with a lot so the brain develops until about the age of 25 and that's kind of the number we've called it for most people that's about the the adult rain i mean the brain develops throughout your life but about 25 you have pretty much an adult brain so as it's developing through those teenage years it's very important to take good care of it what's going on during maturation is what we call pruning and this is a term we stole from gardeners so you can see if i was pruning this little plant here i would cut off cut it here and cut it here because i want the plant to grow up and grow tall so all the nutrients all the energy i want to it to go into making a nice tall plant i don't want these little side things so your brain your neurons do the same thing they make these pathways and when you're you know about 12 to 13 when you're in middle school your brain has more neurons than it ever will and it starts kind of cutting them away it starts pruning right if you if you're kind of learning a second language and doing a lot of you know so you're you speak english and you're trying to learn spanish too those pathways were developed during those years and spanish will probably be your best language other than your primary language throughout your life right if you try to learn a second language at the age of 50 it's going to be a lot harder because that language center in your brain has pruned and the connections have been made and to go back and change that later the brain can do it the brain is pretty amazing but it is much more difficult and with modern technology we can actually see these pathways in the brain which is very exciting this is kind of the new area of research in the brain we used to just look at the structures and kind of measure how big they were and maybe we could see how much blood flow they got which wasn't all that exciting but now we can see these strands and how different parts of the brains are connected and how it sends information from one structure to another right it travels along axons like we talked about earlier and this is kind of like the superhighway of the brain how information is transferred here's a study they did um when i looked at kind of people who started using in their teenage years heavy amounts of cannabis on a regular basis versus people who didn't use cannabis at all so this top one here is people who didn't use cannabis at all and you can see kind of like if you're thinking of this as like a wire nice tight connection can signal and send information efficiently and quickly nice um it's a nice looking connection there if you look down here with the heavy marijuana users it doesn't myelinate it doesn't insulate kind of the the neurons well so it's kind of like a frayed cord here where it doesn't send the information as quickly between these two parts of the brain so kind of with this imaging we can kind of see what it's doing in the brain and the result of that um you know one of the things we we think we know right the research isn't great but that it has an impact on cognition or iq intelligence quotient so this was kind of a neat study that started way back in the 70s um i started with a thousand people and you can see um the total of these numbers is how many participants they left with at the end it was only about 60 so most people dropped out or were lost to follow up which happens a lot with substance use research but you can see the most profound effect here um was the side of the graph so this side is um people that started using marijuana in adolescence and we're still frequently using through the age of 35 right here's their iq as a child and their iq is an adult so it dropped about eight points which is a big drop in iq iq you can see the average here is about 100 um for the average adult and the standard deviation is 15. so you're going to 85 and then when you go down to 70 that's the cutoff for intellectual disability which used to be called a mental retardation so a drop of eight points is you know over half the standard deviations that's a big drop in iq um you can see people who started as kids but kind of gave it up you know maybe had a drop when these lines overlap we can't really stay with confidence that this change is statistically significant um and you see people that wait until adult to smoke marijuana wasn't much of a change um one way or the other so really the people that i worry about are you know they start as kids just teenagers and they smoke a lot throughout adolescence and there's other reasons to be concerned too so right so this is you know people who use cannabis often before they turn age 30 i'm sorry before they turn 17 what do they look like later when they become 30 years old you know they're more likely to suffer from addiction to cannabis right so as we go from left to right these are people that use more and more cannabis so less than monthly monthly or more weekly or more and then daily so daily users are the most likely to be dependent on it again that's not surprising um those that are more likely to use other illegal drugs right and then those that are likely to attempt suicide these are people i see a lot in psychiatric hospitals you know less likely to complete high school less likely to get a degree interestingly in this study there wasn't an increase in depression although other studies do show that correlation and a little bit more likely to be on welfare now your risk of getting cannabis associated psychosis and remember i said psychosis is losing the brain losing touch with reality so you're really paranoid you're worried like aliens are out to get you you're hearing voices that aren't real they're telling you to do things uh kind of losing touch with reality and so you know the more times you've used cannabis the more likely you are to get a psychotic episode um from cannabis intoxication right like once the number hits over 50 it goes to you know close to 30 cases per thousand you know almost doubles um and this is canada use cannabis use that um can lead to schizophrenia and schizophrenia is psychosis the brain loses touch with reality but it's a lifelong disease where your brain is chronically losing touch with reality and you need treatment with antipsychotics which can be nasty medications um and even then sometimes it doesn't get rid of the psychosis all the way it just kind of lowers it dampens it down so you can see um and this one i looked at a specific gene in the body right the akt1 gene and so those that didn't have the gene um you know cannabis didn't really seem to increase the risk of schizophrenia those that had one copy of the gene the same story those had two copies of the gene bang you know seven times more likely to get schizophrenia if they used um cannabis on a regular basis they use it every day so everyone's brain is different some people can smoke high levels of cannabis and it doesn't really seem to have a negative effect on their brain some people smoke it just a couple times and they really lose it and they really can't handle it especially if they dab or use one of the more potent formulations so that's important to talk about with patients that hey everyone's brain is different you might not be able to tolerate it you might most of the kids i see in the hospital as you can imagine can't tolerate it and it's kind of tough to get them to stop and here's another kind of schizophrenia-like psychosis at the age of 26 you know and these are you know did you use cannabis before the age of 18 i'm sorry before the age of 18 years old so if you use cannabis before the age of 18 you were 1.6 times more likely to develop a schizophrenia like psychosis if you started using cannabis before the age of 15 you're four and a half times more likely than the general population to develop schizophrenia like psychosis so one thing i often do is say please please please do not use cannabis for at least a couple years when i have you know 12 13 14 year olds coming into my office i talk about using marijuana if the most i can do is get them to delay it a year or a couple years or at least until they're 18. preferably 25 um i can protect their brain and really ready to make a big impact that's what i try to do um and the effect of high potency cannabis on psychosis right so skunk is um kind of just a term for um a crossbreed that is highly potent cannabis so people that smoke skunk daily right you can see those that develop cannabis 5.4 times more likely than those that have never used cannabis and even using it just on weekends right increases your risk or just even skunk at all right and the low potency ones don't really seem to have any effect at all and someone talk a little bit of research that goes the other way there's not a lot of it but this person was at the national cannabis summit that i attended and he was doing a study in new mexico where he was looking at people with that were addicted to pain pills and had chronic pain and the ones that used cannabis um reported a higher quality of life a better social life they were able to do more activity even with their chronic pain and they reported that they had better concentration um and they also tracked like how many prescriptions they refilled for their you know controlled pain meds and people who smoke cannabis didn't need you know the opiates the morphine that stuff didn't need it as often and a lot of them were even able to get off their their prescription pain killers um the ones that used cannabis so you know he kind of concluded that you know canvas might be a safer and better drug for chronic pain than a lot of the other stuff we have out there we don't have good medications for chronic pain and some of them that do tend to get used are harmful so this is a good i would love this to be a good area of study for cannabis i love better medications for that not to be totally cynical i hope that there will be um more research forthcoming this is the abcd study clever little name where there this is a couple years into the study they took 10 000 kids um you know starting at age 10 and they're going to follow them you know for a decade and they're going to do multiple scans of their brain they're going to ask them how much substances they use how much trauma they've experienced and kind of how well they're functioning and what's going on in their life and we should have a tremendous amount of data from that again we're probably about you know eight or nine years from from getting that data back but uh i'm looking forward to that hopefully come back in ten years and tell you all the stuff uh that's changed or that we've learned at that point so this is my last slide these are my take-home messages there's a growing public perception that cannabis is not harmful and you know usage is increasing animal models tell us that cannabis likely impacts the developing brain during the fetal and adolescent times human research on you know how cannabis affects the brain structure it's flawed um but kind of some of the preliminary stuff is showing that there is cause for concern especially in people who use large amounts starting at a young age and use it frequently um you know there is some good research and studies and even indications for marijuana and seizures chronic pain um not so much research for like ptsd and other psychiatric disorders even though that's you know some of the most common uses for it and there's just a lot of federal barriers they talked about reclassifying the dea classification for cannabis a few years ago and moving it from schedule one to schedule two so that we could research it but that was shot down and i'm not really sure why i don't think anybody really understands why you know cannabis is schedule one and methamphetamine is scheduled to it doesn't make sense to me all right and now i can open it up for questions all right thank you so much dr nikolai for that presentation um we do have a couple questions to start off with um you mentioned that there's you know you gave a lot of data obviously in a short period of time um but you also did sprinkle in some anecdotal observations that you've made um along the way are there any other kind of general kind of overview themes that you might share in terms of you know when you're when you're uh themes you're seeing or the kinds of conversations you're having with your patients um and and maybe you know kind of their general situations or or reactions to you to the conversations you're having with them yeah so there is a lot of variability i mean sometimes there's people that come into my office and say you know i smoke marijuana i do it all the time it really helps when i stop smoking it and before i smoked it i wasn't happy and i am now and i'm doing fine and i'm you know okay that's you and that's your experience and that's fine other people it seems more bizarre i had one patient that checked that came to a psychiatric hospital for feeling suicidal and he was suicidal because he ran out of money to buy marijuana he got about you know five six hundred dollars every month on disability and he spent the entire amount on marijuana because he had to get you know specific strains so that he wouldn't be suicidal so that he could be happy and he was instead of paying rent he was living as a homeless person and spending all of his income on marijuana and you know i asked him the question you know you spend all your money on marijuana and you can't pay your rent and you're homeless you know does this seem like a problem to you and he looked at me like i was crazy and said of course not i need marijuana um i don't need shelter and you know people just really love and rely on this drug and to me that sounded more like an addiction than you know something that was having a positive effect on his life and i will say that so many people use marijuana now but it's hard to tell the effects that it's having so i did um i worked at a clinic in oregon that focused on you know teenagers that were having their first episode of psychosis right are they going to develop schizophrenia this long-term thought disorder where they lose touch with reality and there were a number of cases where you know they didn't really have very many risk factors but they smoked a lot of marijuana and i will say the ones that we could get you know it seemed like their brains couldn't handle marijuana maybe they had that gene you know we weren't able to test for them um with the ones that we could get off get them on medications tend to stabilize and do well and you know the psychosis would go away and they wouldn't develop schizophrenia and the ones that you know just kept smoking and couldn't stop tended to do worse and drop out of treatment and you know be in and out of hospitals and that sort of thing um i guess the final thing i'd say is that dabbing that is a huge part you know please do not dab do not use the concentrated oils on a regular basis that is you know i've had people come in and one kid started dabbing he did it a few times his parents brought him in he was talking to the fireplace and being very odd and he had psychotic symptoms for about a year and we treated him and gave him medications and he was able to go back home and then as soon as he got back home he started using again and turned 21 had easy access to it and kind of disappeared so those are kind of three things i see a lot in my clinical practice right on and it sounds like um you know one of the things you had mentioned earlier were some of the symptoms that you see in terms of elevated depression and things like that and then based on the the answer you were just giving it sounds like some of those trends are kind of correspond with marijuana usage in terms of if if folks are using heavily or used when they were younger that those that those effects would continue but it does sound like in some cases those um you know those symptoms are reversible in some ways i mean number one it sounds like it correlates to some degree when you stop using um but then also there are there may be some other treatments um available as well so i mean i guess part of the question is is it a lost cause when someone you know has already used when they were young or are experiencing some of these depressive issues or symptoms etc yeah so i'd say um it's it's never a lost cause there are i also work at the um oregon state hospital which is where people go that have kind of long-term psychotic symptoms they're dangerous and they can't kind of function in regular society and a lot of those you know so they can be stuck in the state hospital for months or even years and you see a lot of people i mean methamphetamine is a big issue here and people that have done a lot of damage to their brain and after um even kind of sometimes it takes several months or even a year of sobriety we do see brain function come back um you know there's definitely some damage that seems to be permanent but that you know they're at least able to stay in touch with reality kind of you know live on their own be safe that sort of thing um so i'd say it's never too late even if you've had this horrible drug habit for years and years that if you get clean and somewhere your brain has this remarkable ability to recover um and marijuana obviously not doesn't seem to be as damaging to the brain as methamphetamines um one thing with marijuana it really sticks around in the system a long time it takes your body a long time to metabolize it and to get it all out of your body and so that can be tough for people because you have to go through this very long withdrawal period and a lot of cases where you're nauseous and grumpy and having vivid nightmares because you for you know weeks or even months on end because you're withdrawing from cannabis but once you get through that people that used really heavy and were struggling i do see the brain recover and they get better um you know your body repletes its pleasure hormones so that our antidepressants and other medications can be more effective um so i mean everyone's different if cannabis is a problem for you and you can stop it and say yeah it's it's never too late um but again if you can do it um don't smoke throughout your adolescence because that is tough to recover from yeah it seems like those are the two biggest takeaways right if if you don't smoke in your adolescence um and really you know obviously just avoid it in general but it sounds like there's so much development going on in the brain during adolescence and that seems to be when it has such an impact so um you know thanks for explaining that correlation i want to remind viewers while we have a time for a couple more questions if you do have questions you can scroll down with your mouse at the bottom of your zoom screen and there is a q a feature there and it looks like another question just came in actually so let me read that to you do you know anything about using cannabis to sleep i'm unable to sleep without it after using daily for a long period of time yeah so a lot of people report that cannabis kind of has this calming effect on them or can help them sleep and i think the story with cannabis is similar for sleep aids in general which is that sleep aids can be effective for short-term use so if you're kind of going if you're traveling or if you're going through a period where you're stressed and having trouble sleeping that using sleep aids for a couple months can be helpful um or if your sleep schedule is just all wonky and you can't get to sleep that kind of using sleep aids for maybe a couple months to kind of get you sleeping at night and awake during the day can be helpful when we see people just use sleep aids life long right i take a sleep aid every night that's the only way you can sleep um again it's kind of the story we see with a lot it's helpful the first couple months but then after that sleep gets worse again and then it continues to get worse and worse and then people get stuck right i'm taking a sleep aid i've been taking it for years my sleep is terrible um and i i have this habit of being stuck on the sleep aid so that's always a tough challenge too because things generally need to get worse before they get better so you have to stop the sleep aid sleep is going to get even worse but then eventually your brain chemistry will start to normalize and then we can work on proper sleep hygiene and getting you you know good restful sleep so if you're stuck on cannabis you can talk to your doctor about maybe kind of just trying a different sleep aid to get you through the withdrawal when you'll probably have lots of trouble sleeping um if that's kind of your motivation to get off it you can talk to your doctor about trying things like that all right thank you that's i think that's something that is important to remember just if it takes so long for the drug to get out of your system um you know that to have the patience to to wait until your brain is able to normalize before you would um you know then kind of try to to to move in in a different positive direction um i this is a quite this is a personal question for me because i i remember reading it in your introduction about your opportunity to testify in front of the colorado congressional committee and i was just wondering if you could tell us a little bit about that it sounds like a very interesting opportunity yeah so when i was in colorado as part of the legislative committee for the um the psychiatrist organization and the child and adolescent psychiatrist organization there and there was a bill being proposed to legalize um prescribing medical marijuana for autism for kids and adults so me and a couple other physicians testified that we didn't think it was a good idea to legalize marijuana for the treatment of autism that kind of the research wasn't there or at the very least there needed to be additional safety measures put in place um so we talked about that and as you can imagine people are very passionate about this um the dispensaries paid to fly a lot of families out that camped out at the capitol for weeks um there was probably a dozen families that testified how helpful cannabis was for their kids with autism and was life-changing kind of like the video i showed earlier i'm just with autism instead of seizures and um the bill passed through nearly unanimously uh and now autism is uh an indication for um the use of medical cannabis in colorado however our organization we did kind of get some safety measures in place but the you know the diagnosis of autism in kids needs to be confirmed by a physician and another mental health professional and that um you know there was a pediatrician as a member of congress that really wanted the pediatrician the primary care doctor to be made aware that this was going on um so they don't want to interfere with her you know the pediatrician's medications and what they were doing um so yeah it was a really interesting process to go through uh it's you know i'm on the legislative committee with the psychiatrist here and it's you know work i plan to continue excellent excellent one final question uh to to wrap us up this evening um could you talk a little bit about the future kind of where you see things going i mean there's a lot of data that you share tonight that indicates that trends are are are going up in terms of usage um a greater portion of of of kids are are trying or using marijuana regularly the the the percentage of thc is increasing um so you know where do you think we're going from here yeah so i think with recreational use it will continue to increase a little bit longer than i imagined it will plateau um you know i think there's a set of people that are going to try and experiment with drugs and you know you know but also a set of people that really don't have much interest in it um we haven't hit that plateau yet but i i imagine it's coming here in the next few years with the rates of how quickly it's growing in popularity um as it you kind of this amount of powerful and frequent use of marijuana is around longer and we have you know kind of more research and we see what it does i think that will inform us a lot um and inform you know kind of the future youth whether it's something that they can get away with whether it's something safe or whether it's something that can cause um a lot of harm like we suspect it may and then i hope medically that it gets you know rescheduled by the dea so that we can study it and have high quality research from it i think there are you know we can certainly derive pieces of the cannabis plant that seem to have therapeutic targets and can be used as medicine um and it's important for us to be able to research that and prescribe it and use it like a medicine um it's a very odd feeling for me if i want to sign a marijuana card and give it to a patient that um hey go to the dispensary and kind of figure it out there's no dose there's no formulation right i can you know hope they're taking cbd and they're getting and they're just going by and you know dabbing um you know without having to pay taxes because they have a marijuana card um another issue there is that a lot of kids i talk to you know where to get your marijuana oh my friend's 18. he has a marijuana card for anxiety or something like that and he can um buy it for me so i mean cannabis it's everywhere kids are trying it and experimenting with it my hope is that we can get the more reliable information on what it does and doesn't do i think use is gonna continue to increase it's gonna get stronger it's gonna get cheaper um and there's gonna be more and more of it at least for the next couple years well that's the kind of a mixed a mixed out look i'd say right it's it doesn't look great in the short term but some of your uh some of your predictions i really do hope they come true with the ability to do increased research and um and hopefully have the ability to prescribe in a more specific and practical way um for your for your patients well dr nikolai i want to thank you once again for for uh this presentation this evening it was it was very interesting and informative and i hope our audience enjoyed it speaking of our audience i hope that you tune in to wu stream for upcoming content that we will continue to add on a weekly basis and thanks again for joining us tonight thanks again dr nikolai thanks everyone take care [Music] you", "6dj7gFDjUME": "using CBD oil for anxiety miracle cure hype stay tuned and find out [Music] my name is Douglas block I'm an author and depression survivor welcome once again to your depression recovery channel where each week we talk about practical tools and coping strategies for healing from depression anxiety well today's title the video is CBD oil for anxiety miracle cure or hype before we find out of course we have to tell our joke and I was gonna be one that I thought was pretty good but Jerry my videographer liked this particular one so this is for all you with history buffs out there what do they call a history book about cars an autobiography we both like that all right so let's go to our subject here which is anxiety and a while ago ed maybe you're so I did a publication of a video called which is worst depression or anxiety oh my god I mean they're both horrible aren't they but a lot of you chose anxiety and I can see why because when you're anxious severely anxious over time you become disabled you can't do your regular routines you can't go out meet with friends work and pretty soon you're not accomplishing anything and that can be very depressing and so I exoti often turns into depression however unlike depression where you can have any depressed since which you can take for a long period of time those of you for whom they work anxiety medications known as benzodiazepines or habit-forming or can be and you can create dependence with them so as a result many psychiatrists these days are reluctant to prescribe them thus I became intrigued when some of my group members told me that they were using something called CBD oil to bring down their anxiety I thought well this is interesting so before I talk about my take on it I just wanted to give some basic definitions of what it is so CBD oil is a natural compound found in both the marijuana and the implants and because it contains less than 0.3 percent of THC which is the psychoactive component of marijuana you can't get high from it so unlike smoking pot when you take CBD oh you don't feel anything now the story behind CBD oil is quite interesting it burst on the national scene in 2013 there was a six year old girl named Charlotte Figi who lived in Colorado and she rare form of epilepsy called Rebbetzin Roman she was having multiple seizures in fact 300 grand mal seizures a week it was eating up her brain the parents were desperate nobody knew what to do and then someone suggested using marijuana and because medical marijuana was legal in Colorado at the time they found a grower and they got a strain that was very high in CBD oil and very low in THC and they gave it to the girl the doctors were quite skeptical but sure enough the seizures stopped first for an hour then for a week and pretty soon the girl was healed so now I think she's 11 she maybe only has 2 or 3 seizures a week and most of them are sleep so this this strain of marijuana CBD was called Charlotte's Web and it's now famous and there's a bunch of brothers in Colorado six of them who had developed the foundation where they give this away to people who need it and it's a wonderful thing they're doing because you know in a lot of places people can't afford it so good for the good for Charlotte and good for humanity that this substance was discovered the next question we're going to cover is how do you take CBD oil well it's taken by mouth and it comes in many many forms when I took it it was a tincture but you can also use pills chewable gels vape cartridges cream on your skin and foods like chocolate that's how marijuana is often delivered - well remember marijuana brownies anyway the amount and quality of CBD oil and these products can vary greatly so the next question I want to address is is CBD oil addictive well no not pure CBD but many of the products also have THC in them as a matter of fact and the research i've done talking to the pharmacies in oregon and washington they tell me that a ratio of nine part CBD to one part THC is very helpful because the THC potentiates or increases the power of the CBD oil now if you're taking something like that and there's THC you might be affected so the key is to know what you're taking and what percentage of CBD THC it is but if you're just taking pure CBD well derive from the hemp no addictive properties and again no soy no psychoactive properties so the next question that comes up is what conditions can CBD L treat now if you remember it became famous or you know became used initially because it helped this girl with the seizure syndrome called Trivette syndrome epilepsy and sure enough it's been researched there also for pain my brother takes over pain inflammation believe it or not psychosis and also it helps people supposedly break the addiction to cigarettes and drugs like heroin methamphetamine cocaine because it relaxes the muscles and gets people more at less anxious state so people are investigating CBD oil for a variety of conditions nothing definitive has come yet but I know do know people who did take it for pain and a nurse I know it was quite involved in in the alternative care industry here in Oregon says that a lot of her patients take it for pain okay so now we finally get to the topic in the video or the main topic which is CBD oil and anxiety now when I first heard about this connection I thought to myself well this makes sense because CBD oil is an anti-seizure medication as we saw in the case of charlotte and klonopin which is a benzo that I used to take it essentially saved my life even one of my episodes is also an anti-seizure medication so klonopin and anti-seizure medication helps with anxiety cvbl and anti-seizure medication should help with anxiety well here's a testimonial money ol from oh one of my group members who first turned me on to it he she said I've been using stevia orally for a year now I've been experienced quite a lot of anxiety due to stressors in my life I was having a hard time sleeping I started to take a dropper full of bedtime and again if needed when I woke up too early in the morning the CBD oil greatly reduced mind's eye and had a nice side effect or side benefit of reducing joint pain as well I've never felt groggy in the morning after taking it I highly recommend CBD oil this is one person who obviously worked for now I want to bring up my particular case so in June of 2000 17 last year visiting my brother in New York unfortunately has chronic pain by the way for you any of you out there who are dealing with pain I'm going to be doing a video on depression and chronic pain because as you imagine that's a really bad combination anyway he was prescribed in New York medical marijuana is legal so he was prescribed this by his physician and he ordered this stuff on the internet but it had a strawberry cane he didn't like the taste it was a hundred eighty bucks I said wow that's a lot of money he said no you take it I'll get I'll get a different flavor so I took it home back to Oregon and one night I woke up and late morning or 4:00 in the morning as they often do with you know anxious discrimination my heart was beating rather rapidly and normally I just lie down there and breathe and try to calm myself down but this time I reached for the dropper you know put it under my tongue took about two drops and I start to notice that my heart rate went down slow down and it's my heart rate slowed down I felt more relaxed and my muscles were less tense and within about 10 minutes I was back to sleep so it really took the edge off the anxiety and got me back to sleep a lot quicker than I would have had if I hadn't had it so fortunately I haven't had very many of those awakenings but when I do I have the the oil by my bedside to use in case it happens finally I talked with a worker at a local pharmacy here in Portland on medical marijuana pharmacy and I he mentioned to me that he's been using CBD oil to replace an X the anti-anxiety drug he says at night it helps him ah breathe more easily relax the muscles of his chest and as he breathes deeply ah he can relax more and go to sleep he also said that some of his customers have used it to minimize the brain zaps that come when you come off on a depressant and also that they have used CBD oil to minimize the withdrawal symptoms when people take opiates after an operation so it obviously has many many uses so now comes the $64,000 question is how do you obtain CBD oil well first a good news if it just is derived from the hemp plant and has no THC as was the case with my my group member you can get it in any state in the country us except for Idaho on Nebraska and South Dakota and they ban all marijuana even products coming from the hemp plant which which I said we're not psychoactive so most of us can get CBD oil over the internet or in various other places however if the CBD oil has some THC in it I mentioned that the THC helps to make it more effective then you can only get it in states where medical marijuana is illegal which i think is only four or five states so you're much more limited then but still the hemp derived CBD oil can be effective and you're much more likely to get that so in conclusion the purpose of this video was to describe my research and looking at the CBD oil as a treatment for anxiety and also for pain and I found that many people do use it effectively now this doesn't mean you should run out and get her I'm advocating you do it you should probably check with your prescriber or your doctor to make sure it's not going to adversely interact with any medications you've been taking however I did call the pharmacy right before I shot this and they said it what they tell their customers as long as you don't take the CBD at the same time that you're taking your other drugs maybe wait two three hours then there shouldn't be a problem but again the final authority is your physician well this
