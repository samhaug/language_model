{"pbEgYV5-p0Q": "what is going on welcome back to another edition of our Strang review series a cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today I am going to be looking at a brand new strain to the channel it is the banana punch bread by symbiotic genetics and we're gonna take a look at it right here on the ice mocha Channel just before I get things kicked off I want to mention that this video is sponsored by seedsman go over to their website if you want to enter hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of seeds from some world leading breeders I will leave a link in the description on with the video let's talk about the background of banana punch banana punch has a lovely sound name to it doesn't it this combines two strains banana og also known as banana cush and purple punch combined together by symbiotic genetics to deliver the banana punch now going back into the genetics a little bit further we would expect both of those strengths to fall more on the body led side but there's gonna be a spectrum as there always is when we consume cannabis speak up to marijuana Mike the grower on this one you can see from he's Brandon I've really liked the branding we'll talk about it a little bit more as we move on to the appearance of this cannabis strain as I just mentioned in the intro called branding starting to see a lot more in this glass jar with a metal lid making it fully recyclable this has got a cool compartment where you can look through at the flowers inside opening it up you can see that it's a nicely presented buds inside so the buds themselves try not to move on to the smell section I'll save that for just a moment by I am getting the smells coming out for the butts themselves a really cool look to it this one nice trim job sparkling with trichomes light colored pistols good development it's got that kind of organic nicely grown bud look not to like beefed and puffed out and just uniform like with PGR influence these buds have got their own look their own individual look to each bud very light in appearance that kind of sparkly right matte and green shade have I ever said sparkly matte before that's weird in it if you look in the light is sparkly if you look out of the light it's kind of got a matte Sheen to it really cool it's complex but no Purple's no blues is just greens and and hints of the orange yellows of the pistil it's a really nice look to the banana punch actually reminds me of the look of the purple punch quite a lot trim to perfection no leaves left on there that covers the appearance let's talk about the smell of banana punch as I was opening the jar for the appearance section the banana smell literally hit my nostrils while the while the jar was still down here it smells like banana with hints of like fruit salad like maybe like pineapple or something like that but the most prevalent aroma is the banana now also sitting underneath that is it's like mother of all berries type aroma that what I used to describe as a coffee cannabis type of smell that is definitely sitting in there as well what smoked a lot of mother of berries and I can smell that slightly in this purple punch I've also smoked a lot of banana cush not so much but it smells absolutely fantastic let's break one of these buds open and see what we can gauge from the inside here we go 'banahna earthy hints of like we skunk that tropical skunk like Hawaiian haze hints not quite but like along the same ilk and it's got kind of like a a dankness to the smell as well it's not just light and and aromatic is also like oh it's also got some of that power creeping into the aroma as well really interesting stuff let's talk about the taste of the banana punch some to consumption methods today as you can see got my bong here I've got my mighty vaporizer that's going to give us a good idea of both the flavor and the smoking experience of the banana punch so I'm gonna grind up one of these buds also let you know if I'll get any more smell prop up there on a smell to it wah but honest meal to it that your night not something I come across as often as the other fruit flavors and honors technically a berry but the fruit flavors that are often prevalent in cannabis are citrus oranges strawberries this banana is out there but I don't come across them as much meaning that this is a nice and somewhat different smell it's what I'm normally standing here reviewing so I'm gonna put some into the mighty vaporizer we're gonna heat that up and while that's heating up we're gonna smoke a bomb of it so if you are getting yourselves ready to join us get those bowls filled get those joints rolled get those fabrics heated up preparation time right about now got the mighty on join me for this one and I'll see you all on the other side Cheers [Music] delivers a very earthy taste to it actually those oh gee flavors coming through the fruity notes can also be tasted somewhat but perhaps not as strongly again as came through in the aroma we see how the mighty treats us because it will give me a much better idea that complex flavor than smoking it through the bomb the smoking experience was enjoyable it didn't feel the need to cuff we have got the mighty you heat it up now let's taste the vapor oh man that's got a really nice taste in vapor 'banahna like eucalyptus or mint or mint feel like something around that area of terpenes is is coming through the vaporizer we have like a really nice banana taste that sits on your tongue as well this isn't aptly named strain I think it's come away a fair bit from the purple punch from my experience of smoking purple punch as I said I haven't tried banana OG but what I can say is this delivers a lovely unique flavor profile like nothing that I've tasted before which gives it good marks from me in the flavor Department from the vaporizer I'm definitely getting a really nice tasting vapor nice and then a lot of stuff I put free unique different and distinguishable enough to give it very good marks through the bum I'm getting a nice smoking experience but not as much of the flavor as I'm getting through the vaporizer it's still tastes nice and as I always say a bong is a great way to get high so I like it from the smoking experience perspective but unlocking that banana no flavor or in the vapor either is a must do if you want to truly appreciate the flavor of the banana punch saying that I'm gonna smoke another Bowl so join me for this and I'll see you all on the other side [Music] it feels like I'm getting some of the flavor notes but the smoke may be burning slightly hotter than some of the cool smoking strengths that I've been talking about recently not in an accurate way not in a way which suggests that it isn't clean or isn't grown as well might even be a strain dependent might be to do with the trichomes some strains are more expansive than others the platinum jelly that I reviewed last time was super smooth actually through the bonk so this could potentially be less move because of that but yeah I'm really liking the flavor anyway let's talk about the effects of the banana punch so as I'll talk to you right about now we've had two bongs and wait some continued into votes um it has now been several minutes since I smoked and vote the banana punch and I am feeling the effects nicely I can tell you that this hits on the body LED side of the spectrum it has got that pleasurable high that comes from the purple punch side of the lineage which gives me a really sort of nice most like cuddle type height if that makes sense to you guys it also has the familiar relaxation that you get from smoking those og strains what we classic you call indica is present you know and it's and it's nice it feels like it's not a strain that's gonna induce anxiety or paranoia compared to other strains on the hybrid or head-high side of the spectrum my mind feels quite calm but my body feels very relaxed I'm certainly feeling this nice body led feeling burn on a punch hits reasonably hard I know I've smoked two bowls of it and had a vaporizer as well so I've consumed a reasonable amount but I'm feeling nicely relaxed for the time of day I like to smoke fresh in these reviews so that you guys get a good idea of how the strain hits me and actually I'm glad that I waited a little bit before filming the effects segment so you could see the effects kicking in a little bit more it's made me sort of happy a little bit on the giggly side very relaxed and just chilled is the best way to describe it and also feels like it could be good on the pain relief inside if that's something that people are suffering with unless something's up so today we've been looking at symbiotic genetics banana punch a lovely cross of banana og and purple punch I've got a lot of love for one of his parents trains and this I must say has also impressed me its impressed me more than the mimosa which is purple punch cross with Clementine appearance-wise it looks similar to the purple punch but hasn't got that nice sort of edgy looked at at Budds I'm sure that differ from Fino to phyno and know this was grown from seed and that there are other seeds that they can potentially grow in the future so some really cool stuff might come out of that pack smell wise I like the smell of this one now again there's probably going to be some variation between phenotypes but this captured the banana wonderfully it captured sort of pineapple notes this tropical xxxx pungency that really delivered a nice smell so I like it is unique good marks from me and the aroma flavor-wise I've really enjoyed the flavor through the mighty vaporizer particularly where I've got those banana notes that tropical nests that earthy sweet taste came through nicely smoking it in my balm maybe a little bit hotter but still smooth smoke just not delivering as complex a flavor profile as I got when I was vaping it which is understandable when you feel terrine it through water and smoking in a bong anyways more for the smoking experience and the power then the flavor fire this consumption method in my opinion and effects wise it's a really nice hi guys I like it for the daytime because it makes me feel chilled and happy but getting pain relieving qualities as well it's what would traditionally be defined as an indica strain but we're going to try and move away it's just hard because in my vocabulary and synonymous with the culture for for the whole time that I've been doing this but we'll try to move away and start describing it in more of a accurate modern terminology I've always in the future when people watch these videos they'll think I'm outdated overall I'm really enjoyed smoking on the banana punch it's a nice strain nice genetics I don't know if I've had any of symbiotic genetics strains before run the channel but this has certainly been an interesting one that is gonna be it for the video guys what I want to know from you is what is the fruitiest cannabis strain that you have enjoyed leave that in the comments and remember to hit that like and subscribe button if you're enjoying

\u266a Feel it, feel it, and feel it like this \u266a \u266a How you doin', Wendy \u266a \u266a Let's go \u266a Now, here's Wendy! (theme music continues) Thank you for watching our show! Say hello to my co staffer studio audience. And of course the virtuals at home. How you doin'? How you doin'? I'm ready to go. Let's get started. It's time for... Hot topics! Come on! (audience cheering) Well, I'm a woman of my word and I did watch part two of Aretha Franklin mini series. And I'm also a woman, I'm allowed to change my mind. It was dark. It's like... I try, like, I have to... See and right after she swigs from her husband Ted's flask, she goes out on stage and falls all the way out. And there were implications in the movie that she and Martin Luther King, Dr. King, were very flirty, flirty. And look, Dr. King is smoking. I know! The thing about Ms. Franklin is that... And he was smoking Kools by the way. See that right there? Mm hmm, mm hmm, mm hmm. I didn't want to see. At this point, I really wanted to turn it off between passing out and Dr. King. And Aretha was never happy except, you know, certain times, but Aretha just, she was just never happy. Like I, you know, I kind of understand now and we're only two shows in... Now, tonight it plays again on Nat Geo and then tomorrow is the end. But I kind of understand what her family was feeling about this movie. I mean, the acting is superb and the story is deep, dark, and will give you nightmares. Like you've got to watch something really funny that'll take your mind off of it. For me at 11 o'clock here in New York, it's always Seinfeld. Two back-to-back episodes. Yeah. (audience clapping) Norman, have you watched anything? Yeah, I watched a little bit of Aretha last night and I do agree that it was like a lot to take in about the queen of soul. A lot. She had a baby when she was played by the younger actress. She was that young. Yes. Yeah. Like it was a lot going on. Yes. Like, Aretha? Aretha. Yeah. I don't know that I'll be there tonight, honestly. I've been researching alternative programming and I know \"The Oval\" comes on and I know \"Basketball Wives\" comes on at eight and I forgot what comes on at nine, Oh, \"Dallas Housewives,\" which is not my favorite. I try, but I just... And I love Dallas, but I just, but you know what? I might be forced to watch that. (audience laughing) Just cause I can't. And then the 10 o'clock news. The news is never great, but the news is what it is. You know, it informs you locally of what's going on, and then Seinfeld, and then go to sleep. Yeah. (audience clapping) So. Last night though on American Idol... Did you see? Clap if you saw. Not one tastemaker. (audience chatting) Which is totally contradictory to what I'm being told how it's doing. I thought it was doing well, but apparently, no. Well, one of the contestants passed out on stage. Oh! Mm hmm, I know a pass out. Aretha knows a pass out and now so does she. Now she is okay, but I'm gonna warn you, it's a hard fall on her face. Take a look. You got yourself to the end and the problem is- (loud thumping) (tense music) Are you okay? Flip her over. She busted her chin y'all. They didn't check her teeth. Check her teeth. Wiggle her nose. Listen, she and her partner, apparently it was duet night last night, so she was up there with her friend and they sang really well and the Idol judges are gonna push her through to the next thing. But, the reason for her passing out according to the paramedics who were there and everything, is that she was very dehydrated. And I gotta tell you, I know like when Halloween happened here... Like they could've edit this out 'cause this is a taped show, but they didn't because Norman likes that kind of drama in his shows. (Norman laughing) I do, I'm sorry, I do (laughing). And when we were doing Halloween, it was a live show. But even if we were doing a taped show, I would want them to include it in the show. Because I'm okay. So sometimes like falling, tripping, and passing out, there's a little humor in that. But then you want to know why. So she was severely dehydrated. When the paramedics came here to Wendy, that was one of the things they were like, you are severely dehydrated. And I drink so much water. I'm like, how could that be? They're like, you're drinking too much water at one time. They gave me directions on how to drink water. Since when do you need directions on how to drink? And also I was lacking vitamin D. They said they never saw a worst case. So now I try to get to the sun, but it's dangerous in the streets. So I'd rather have my prescription and wait until I can go some place civilized. But she's okay and good for her. (audience clapping) What happened? Nothing. (DJ Suss laughing) Exactly. (audience laughing) What happened? What happened is Bethany Frankel is finally divorced. (audience cheering) Yeah. So you know, they broke up nine years ago. She and Jason Hoppy were only married for a couple of years. It took nine years for this divorce. Apparently the divorce ended up being finalized in January, but it was in the newspaper today that she had gotten, you know, it's finalized. Good for her, you know. (audience clapping) She used to not be a favorite person around here. Not that she is yet, but we always believed that Jason Hoppy was such a nice guy, you remember? But we're allowed to change our... I like Bethany and I love her hustle. I miss her on New York Housewives. I do, I do, I do. So, yesterday she was spotted with a huge diamond ring on the finger. It's not too soon. She's been dating this guy, okay, she's engaged, the rumor is, to her boyfriend. His name is Paul Bernan. He's 43, Bethany is 50, but a youthful 50 can definitely take down a 43 year old, so. You know what I mean.\n(audience clapping) And the word is, is that Jason has fled New York, allegedly he lives in Boston. And these two have been together for a couple of years. So we were just talking about this yesterday. I was like, once you get to a particular age or station in life, you don't have to date around or wait to date when you get divorced. So if they've been together and now they're engaged, I'm happy for her. And you know what? I know she had a prenuptial with Jason, but there was a whole lot of other stuff going on behind the scenes. He just became super weird, super creepy, and slightly, in my mind, dangerous. Yeah. He was like, allegedly, sending her nasty emails and showing up at the kids' school, and... Turning up the Wendy Show and hiding the remote. (chuckling) Yep, yep. Feel it, feel it, feel it. At that time, I guess she didn't particularly care for me either, so- Right, exactly. He thought that would drive her crazy. Right. Well, Bethany, I am really happy for you and I hope that you guys go on and have a wonderful life. And I know both of you will have prenups. He's super rich, but she's richer. Yeah. (audience clapping) Yeah. Good for you. And as far as Bryn, Bryn, the daughter, is now 10 years old. I don't, by the way, I don't know whether her fiance has children or has ever been married. We tried to look. We tried to, huh? I think he has two kids with his ex-wife according to some old notes, but I think so. Old notes, okay, okay. Well so then they've both been there and they'll know how to do the prenups and why not be married if you don't want to date anybody else? Why not be married? Yeah. (audience clapping) I hope it works out very well. Bryn has only known fighting adults. That's all she knows. In her household. That's horrible. Poor Bryn. So update on Gary Owen. His wife, his soon to be ex-wife, Kenya, has broken her silence on why they're divorcing. And it was allegedly a mystery woman named, Dallas Texas. I know doesn't that sound like a stripper name? I like it though, but, Gary not Dallas Texas. And so, allegedly, this Dallas Texas is a friend of Claudia Jordan, friend to the show. And she said all her info on social media, which is way too much, you know what I mean? She says her therapy, she bought five therapy cards though, and it doesn't start until next week. So I guess she's therapizing by, you know, typing in you know, after midnight, when it really gets down and dirty, when you don't care what you say. So Kenya tells Dallas Texas, excuse me, yeah, Dallas Texas, she'll deal with her soon. And said expect a storm and you can have him. But you will not disrespect me or my kids. (audience clapping) I don't want her to fight. I don't want to know any more about this. I mean, I kind of do, but, I don't want Kenya to fight. You know, she's got the kids to take care of. And if he's with Dallas Texas, or you know... Well he's on tour now, so he might have one in every stop if you know what I'm saying. You know, Carol Chicago. (audience laughing) Brooke in Boston. Yep, Brooke in Boston. (Wendy laughing) Well look, she broke it down Kenya did. She said, look, I met Gary 23 years ago when he was driving a pickup truck, a raggedy one she called it, and had no place to live and had good credit. All of a sudden I'm scared of Kenya. Dallas Texas, you better be ready. And Claudia Jordan is like leave me all the way out of this. And so she got on social media and I'm glad she did this 'cause I believe every word she says, take a look. I came on here to tell y'all is that I have absolutely nothing to do with it. I do not have a friend in Dallas or anywhere else that is this man's mistress. I don't know of any woman. That's his mistress. I do not know what the hell y'all talking about. Kenya, I will, Tash has given you my number. You can call me and we can talk about it. And I'm really aggravated with you that you chose to go messy on a blog when you could have reached out to me. Yeah. I'm mad that we have to know all this and the paparazzi were out today again. Again. And people seem to feel I call paparazzi. Oh, that was yesterday. See, they're one day behind. That's yesterday, struggling to the car to come here and make with the happy and the yuck, yuck. Why would I, huh? I like the hair though. Thank you.\n(audience clapping) That's me in the streets. But look, I do believe that they're waiting for me to be leaving with a gentlemen, I do. And this one today, yeah, the one today was hiding... I was wearing a white coat. And he was hiding behind a school bus. And so the doorman says, \"they're to the left.\" I said, okay, see they're onto the game now, too. So as soon as they say that, while I'm inside, I know, Okay, look down, just keep walking, mask up, let's go. Anyway, what else is on the agenda? I can't wait to see Don Lemon. (audience clapping)\nI can't wait. Is that Don? Yeah! Now, wait a minute. (audience laughing) Oh, Donnie. Very handsome. (audience clapping) Very handsome. (Wendy giggling) So, okay, NBA YoungBoy was arrested after trying to escape from the police. Now here's the story. So first of all, YoungBoy stands for... Wait, NBA, never broke again. Okay, he had outstanding federal warrant. One as we know of. And he was in California and just driving around with his friends. I don't know whether he was driving or the passenger, but he was with friends and the cops noticed the car. It was probably a loud rapper car. They attempted to pull the car over. The car sped up and gave a short pursuit. Then, NBA YoungBoy, I guess he tucked and rolled and ran away down the sidewalk or wherever. So, the cops set up a perimeter and TMZ got the video of all the action. And then the cops brought in a tracking dog and now the FBI has him in custody. Not the regular cops, not the Sheriff's department, the FBI. And I was like, well how the dogs know, if they, you know, how do the dogs know what he smells like if the cops didn't catch him, you know, to sniff his clothes and stuff? I guess maybe they opened the door and woosh. Oh, by the way there was a gun found in the car. No word on whether it was NBA YoungBoy's, but I do have my suspicions about it all. He's got to go to jail. How do you do a hot pursuit? They're innocent people out here. You could have hurt innocent people in your hot pursuit and running through people's backyards. Nobody wants that. Bringing down the property values. And how was it that you do what you do with seven kids at only 21 years old? And I wonder what Yaya Mayweather's father, Floyd, is saying about this. Well, she did speak out. She did a short post. It said her day has been ruined. (audience laughing) You know, Floyd, if she just goes to jail, then Yaya will move on. I know she has a baby with him and everything. One of his seven children. (audience laughing) So Mike Tyson, he's 54 and he backed out of a fight with Evander Holyfield who's 58. Mike Tyson turned down $25 million for three rounds scheduled in Miami for May 29th. Look at Papa Smurf though. And I was the only one in our hot topics morning meeting that said good for him. I'm glad he did that. That means... And a couple of people said, well, he's got money problems. And I said, you know what, if he's at peace with himself based on where he came from, how he grew up, you know, money is not everything. And $25 million is a lot, but when you're 54 years old and you've been through so much, one punch in the head, you know, can send you off the deep end. And why wouldn't he want to go out on top as opposed to getting his behind beat. You know, the last fight that he had was with Roy Jones Jr. and that was a draw, so nobody won. I think that he should go on with his life and be a ringside announcer. I know he has a high voice, and a slight lisp, and sometimes he stutters, but that's Tyson. Don't you want to hear him commentate a fight? (audience clapping) And I wonder if all this is gonna be played out when Jamie Foxx plays him in a limited series. Yeah, Jamie Foxx has been working out, his body is Tyson-esque. Tyson approved of this. Martin Scorsese is the executive producer. I don't know the network yet, but I'd watch that. (audience clapping) We don't have time for him. That's it? I think that's it. It's 20 minutes in. Can't this be a 23 minute day? (Norman laughing) Well, we got to get to Don Lemon. Right, right! We got more great show for you everybody. Up next, CNN broadcaster, Don Lemon. So grab a snack and come on back! (upbeat music) (upbeat music) Welcome back. Our first guest is the host of CNN Tonight. He's got a new book it's called, \"This is the Fire.\" Please welcome back to our show, my friend, Don Lemon. (upbeat music) I don't know whether to come through the TV and hug you or start crying. You know, me and you, me and you. (kissing sound) I love you. Thank you, Don. Wendy, we've gotten such a bond lately. We've created such a great bond and such a great friendship lately. So thank you for that,\nOut of nowhere. it means the world to me. Please, you invited me into your home. Your vacation house in the Hamptons. And Tim, your fiance is so lovely and all your friends and we sped around on your boat and we sped in the vintage cars and it was just a really fun time. And because I'm a watcher and you know, my mother had a big crush on you. She didn't care about Tim. She's like where's Don? And, but you were just so nice to me. I honor that. Well, let me tell you, when I... Thank you, Wendy. When I meet people and I love them, I love them. And I told you from the very beginning since I've known you, how much I loved you and how much I cared for you. And I wanted to establish a friendship with you. But just over the last couple of years we have been able to truly establish that friendship for reasons that we both know and will remain silent. So back to Tim. An engagement for two years? 'Cause here at the show, especially if you're a particular age... No, just 'cause you're wearing it doesn't mean you mean it. When are you getting married? What you talking about, Wendy? Why you getting in my business? What do you want to know? When are you two getting married? So who says we're not already? No, we're not, don't start that rumor. So listen, during the pandemic, we have all of these people some of them, family members, Wendy, quite frankly, planning these weddings, trying to plan a wedding around a pandemic. And it just kept getting pushed back, and pushed back, and pushed back. And then it was like, you can have a limit of 15, you can have a limit of this or what have you. And then the weddings were just, it just, we don't want that. I thought it was selfish when people did that. And I know people are watching, they're gonna be mad. But I thought during a pandemic, who wants to go to a potential super spreader event or who wants passed Hor d'oeuvres during the middle of a deadly pandemic. So Tim and I love each other. We're gonna get married. I just thought now is a right time. Don't be selfish. Deal with what's going on in the world. Love each other and your friends. And then get married when the time is right. That's it, there's no nothing. You look so young and so good pulled together. I can't believe you're 55. (audience clapping) Double nickels, Wendy. There's a lot of moisturizing. And look, my forehead works. So you know. No Botox. Maybe I should get a little shot right here. And your hair looks good and you know, it's not too lined up. It's just good. A real good gentlemen. Thank you, Wendy. Wait, is that a new ring? Oh, your other ring is being cleaned, that's right. No, this is it. He redid the whole thing? Yeah. What have I missed? A lot of shows. Oh my gosh. Wendy, I've been launching my book, so I have you on DVR. Well, it's okay! So as you know, when you're launching you're doing Zooms all day, but that ring is I almost said a bad word, fabulous with a bad word in front. I love it, oh my god! Thank you, Don. Thank you. That's beautiful. Thank you, Don. Congratulations on the new book. The first time I met you, you came on this show for your first book. And then I recall us having a conversation when I was in the Hamptons with you guys, and you said, I'll never write again. I don't want to write a book. I said I will never, I'd never wanted to write again because it was so tough. But when you were there is actually when I was going through the process of figuring out this book. You were there, you were there after or before George Floyd, right? Yeah. So it was really after George Floyd and all of the unrest in the summer is when I started to write a book because books are hard, as you know, and they take a lot out of you. And everyone thinks like the hard part is the writing. Sometimes if you're passionate about it, it pours out. But the real hard part, as you know, why I've not seen some of your shows, is promoting the book. And especially now during a pandemic, you're not on an airplane. You're not in every city. You are sitting in front of your computer, literally, from sunup to sundown, Wendy, in front of the Zoom thing going from city to city to city promoting the book. TV show, radio shows, all over, and people just don't want you on the phone anymore. Now with Zoom, everybody wants to see you even if it's a radio interview. All right, so I watched \"The Bachelor\" and I feel very guilty. I was so invested. And I understand that you did too. I watched \"The Bachelor\" and you know what, I never had any interest in that show. I felt so guilty for watching it... Go on, what do you want to say? No, me too! I never, I had no interest in the show. It wasn't part of the bachelor, the bachelorette nation plus there was never anybody on there, I mean, except for one or two, once or twice, who looked like us and they never got picked. You're like, he aint gonna pick her, she aint gonna pick him. And so I just never watched it. And I just thought it was just kind of weird show. And then when I saw, quite frankly, all of these like girls and this black man with this harem around him and it was on in my office at night I'm watching I'm going, Oh my gosh, look at that. But then when the whole race controversy started I was like... (audience laughing) Do you think that he handled the racism healthily? Who him? Uh huh. Healthily is word. I think there was probably a lot that we didn't see because by the time it came out I think they were finished shooting and he had already picked her. But I knew from watching the show, look that we've been around for a long time, double nickels and you are as well, so, you know, I'm like, that's the one he likes. He's gonna pick her, look how he looks at her. Look how he treats her. And he's not, he doesn't like those other girls. He wants her. So I knew that he picked her, even like during the controversy, I was like, yep. And that is, boy, what is that gonna do for this show? I don't really, I think that the person who handled it the best out of all of them, you're gonna be surprised, is actually Rachel herself. I thought her, I'm not giving her a pass on what she did, but I thought her apology was sincere. She appears to be willing to do the work and do all the right things. I personally don't believe in canceling people. So if you have a racial blind spot, which is what the book is all about, you have a racial blind spot, you have an issue, learn from it, apologize, listen, take action, and do the work, and then move on. Do you think that Chris Harrison should move on? You think they should have him back? I don't. Sorry. Okay, so look, I don't like again, canceling people or for people to be out of a job, but I don't, I'll put it this way, I don't believe Chris's apology was sincere. I don't believe he handled it well. There are better ways to handle it than a Zoom interview on the morning show. Not that it's a morning show, but he could have gone in studio. He could have had someone over at their house. They could have done something socially distanced. He could have done something even on the show, a show that was dedicated to it or something that was heartfelt where it didn't look like he was protecting his brand and the brand The Bachelor Nation brand. I don't believe his apology, I'm sorry. So that should answer your question. So you and Chris Cuomo, and I always tell you this, one of the best parts of my day is your crossover at night when you two laugh and talk. And I witnessed that relationship in person. So I feel weird talking to you about it. Do you feel weird talking about it? I don't feel weird talking about it. What I feel weird is is the pressure and all of the focus that's on my friend because my friend is not the governor. My friend is a governor's brother. So my heart goes out to him and the entire family because I love Chris. I love his wife and his kids. I, you know, I've only met the governor once, maybe twice. So I'd never really spent that much time with the governor. And usually it's, you know, at a, some sort of, you know picnic or family function, but just, you know a bit briefly, hey governor, how are you, good to see you. But I know, and I love Chris. So is it hard for me to talk about, no because I'm a journalist. And Chris has been in this business for as long as I have, so he knows we have to do it. And is it uncomfortable for him? I'm sure. You cried when he found out he had the virus, you cried right in front of all of us. I did, because that's my friend, but I'm not crying, look, I'm not... This is something that his brother's having to deal with. But I cried for my friend because this was in the beginning, in the very beginning, Chris was one of the first people I knew who had it. I had a couple of friends who caught it and they died. And I told you about that over the summer. And that was really hard. But I didn't know if my friend was, how sick he was going to be. If I was going to hear from him. Chris and I are the last two people in the building at night. I'm the last soldier standing at night and he's before me. So usually when I walk in with all of my stuff, if I bring the dogs or whatever, I'll walk by and I say, say hi to Uncle Chris, or I go into his office and we talk, I'll say, what are you doing, ugly, you look fat today, or whatever. You're gonna wear something different? (audience laughing) And we just joke around like that. And he'll like, throw something at me and say get the F out of my office or whatever. And then it was, we were the, there was nobody there, but me and then I walked by his thing and I saw his big sign. It says, Cuomo Tonight, let's get after it. And I started to feel like what happens if my friend is no longer here? 'Cause he's more than a colleague, he's my friend. I love him. And he knows all the words to Good Time. And you, people were mad at you 'cause you gave him what they call a pass. But I already knew that you guys were friends. Tell everyone what had happened. Because I know his intentions and we have to stop. When we know someone's intentions and we know someone as an ally, we should know who our allies are and we should give our allies room to talk. And that's, I'm not discounting, however you want to feel about that comment, it depends on who it came from. If it comes from someone who is a bigot or someone who is making fun of people of color then I would understand that. But it came from someone, we were joking around, and that's what happens when you're in relationships with people. That's what I tell you in the book. The only way we're gonna solve this race thing, this issue is, is if we have relationships with people who don't look like us, and we have someone who can give us some honest feedback. So that's the way Chris and I speak in person. They were doing the Good Time song and Chris knew all the words and just kept going. And so Don leaned back he was like - I said how do you know the words to Good Times? He said, I'm black inside. And so everybody had a fit. Yeah. What else do I ask you? They're telling me I have to wrap up. When am I gonna- Oh you can ask me anything. Wendy, you didn't do shoe cam with me. Oh, Shoe Cam, please. Go! Where are your- (magical music begins) I'm at home. There's nothing better- Very nice. Comfy slipper and a really nice pair of pajamas, Wendy. So Wendy I have to ask you, I ask Wendy. Okay. So, has Wendy found love? No, but I really liked Mike and I am, you know, my feelers are always out to date and things like that. Wendy wants a boyfriend, you know, it's kind of fun dating, but I'm a wife, I'm a girlfriend. I'm not, you know, a floozy. Is Wendy coming to visit me this summer with the potential love? Would you like? I would. Absolutely, I would. And if you want to bring one, one weekend and one the next, I'm fine with that too. Yup. Okay! Oh Donny, thank you so much for being here. Good luck with your book. I'm so proud of your journey. I love you so much. You're one of my dearest friends now and I can't tell you how much that means. Thank you. His new book is available now and we'll be right back. (upbeat music)\n(audience cheering) Okay, time for ask Wendy. Now Lillian is in Queens. Hi, Lillian. How you doin'? Hi Wendy, how you doin'? Good, what's your question? Or what's your problem? Okay, so me and my guy have been on and off for the last seven years. Now, I know we were young and in college and I just couldn't get it right. I was dipping it and doing it, but we're really serious now. How old are you? I'm 27. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. So we've been talking about moving in recently and I liked the idea of us moving in, saving money, and him paying the bills, but I'm just a little nervous. So my question to you is should I allow my potential forever bae to move in with me, you know, or should he save up and get a place of his own, 'cause... Wait, you said he moves in and he pays the bills? Do you work? Well, I'm saying that we've been well, you know, you know the pandemic and everything, so I lost my job last March. Okay. You know, so, but I have a degree so it's not big deal for me to hop back into the job market. So is he your boyfriend? Does he have that title? Are you his girlfriend? No. We doin' something. Nope, then don't move in together. Don't move in together 'cause that's dangerous. Because if it doesn't work out then you want to date, you know what I'm saying? And then he'll want a date and then you'll be stuck in the apartment together. Where does he live now? He lives in Manhattan right now. What I mean is with who? Oh, with his mother. Okay. You can continue dating him, I don't mind that. Do not have him move in with you. He can have a toothbrush and a piece of a top drawer and that's it. That's it. Okay? Okay, thank you so much, Wendy. You're welcome, Lillian. Now Kyle is in Portland. Kyle, how can I help you? How you doin'? How you doin', Wendy? Fine, thanks. So Wendy, I need your help with something. I have been with my girlfriend for the past year. She is a beautiful person and the sex has been amazing. But there is one problem. Recently she started running into the bedroom and turning off the lights beforehand. She turns down the shades. She turns off the lights and she runs underneath the covers. Now I am somebody who likes the lights on. I like them, you know, I like to see things. I don't like to be fumbling around, and reaching for things, and elbows here and there. Do you like them all the way on? I mean, could I suggest dimmer? Dimmers work really well. And so do candles. Not real dangerous candles, you know, like one candle with three wicks in it. You know, over there, just something to glow. And so I guess your question is to me how can you make that happen or something else happen besides a dark room? Well, I think that there's a problem here because I think this is due to my girlfriend has gained a little weight. And so I think that she's not feeling good about her own body. I think she's absolutely beautiful. But I think that she has some problems. So how do we find that compromise between her wanting lights completely off and me wanting them on? Put the TV on mute, just you and she sitting close in the living room and you tell her exactly what you told me. I think that's sweet. You love her exactly the way she is even with a little weight. And I think that there's a common denominator. There is. Okay? Perfect, thank you so much Wendy. All right. More Ask Wendy is next. (upbeat music) Time for more Ask Wendy! Anais is in North Carolina. How you doin'? How you doin', Wendy? Good, how can I help? Hi Wendy, Anisa from North Carolina. Yes, thank you for having me. So look, Wendy, I recently stepped up and moved my mother and, and became her source of support with no help from my sisters. They didn't call, they didn't check in to see how she was doing, nothing. Not only did this hurt me, but it also hurt my mother. Recently, my niece asked to come up and visit. She came and we had a great time. However, this upset my mother. And my mother was talking to my sisters behind my back. This subsequently caused my mother to move out. She moved out, Wendy. And so I want to know Wendy, should I heal this relationship? Or should I just love them all from a distance? Well, you should try to heal it. If your mother was well enough to move out, then why'd she move in with you to begin with? I mean, is she on death's bed? Or did you just move her in just for a little assistance? Well, I just moved her in to give her a new start, Wendy. She wasn't getting a lot of assistance there. She is a diabetic and she does have some, you know, living arrangement issues. So I was just trying to get her here with me and my family to help her out. My sisters don't call. They don't check on her. And I got her here and she felt like she was in the middle when my niece came up. And so it's caused a wedge between our family. Well, maybe you reach out to your sisters, not your mother and not your niece, your sisters. And you say, all right, mom is living over there. I'm living with my family here, but we all have to do our effort to check on her. You know, it's not time for her to move in with you. It doesn't sound like she needs you to manage whatever she's going through. So call your sisters and get them on the three-way, or the four-way, or however many there are of you. Well, the problem is with that, Wendy we're not speaking either. We don't speak. Well, call, send an email, make something happen, it's important. Me call? Yes! Good luck, Anisa. And we'll be back. (audience cheering) It's time for Pop Quiz. Elizabeth is in Nashville. How you doin'? How you doin'? Good, thanks, Elizabeth. Oh and happy birthday! Thank you, thank you! Okay, Justin Bieber released his sixth album over the weekend. What's the name of his new single? Banana, raspberries, or peaches? Peaches, darling. (bell ringing)\nYou got it.

(person coughing)\nNice.", "3Jdor1kvgz4": "it's about turning from a calm placid person you're the most aggressive person on the planet morning and all welcome to day 14 i think so pretty much halfway through chugging down with rain but don't bother me i identify as an amphibian your mind gives you the tools so walk today i might do a hit circulate there actually nice breakfast quite a bit of housework today look after the cats and then a bit of a leg workout today so get the steps in first thing fresh air beautiful weather living the dream and then i'll catch you guys in a bit a nice hot cup of coffee to put me up after this back home now and gonna re-warm up with a nice cup of coffee and i just like to appreciate that i am in a privileged position where i'm able to you know come out of wet cold weather and just be able to warm up a nice room over my head a hot cup of coffee you know not everyone is in such a fortunate position so i always do like to kind of think about that um don't forget as well as collagen protein in here so i'm trying to get my uh a little bit extra eating soup throughout the day like i said apparently that is good for your tendons your ligaments your hair your nails and your skin but as i said before i'm on a peaky channel so go speak to them now what i'm going to do next is um it's going to be a mixture so i want to train legs today i want to do a hit circuit day as well but i'm going to do both i'm going to combine the two and what i'm going to do is hit circuit and i want to talk about something called controlled aggression so what control aggression is is as as as as men we are quite we've all got rage inside us when you get older it tends to dissipate a little bit but when we've all got this anger this rages energy inside us which we're not we don't use in the thesis i get the very rare that we use it so what control aggression is it's about taking that rage that anger whatever it is that's inside you whatever you know something something pisses you off or you just you're just angry about for whatever reason it builds up it builds up so what control aggression is is just being able to switch it on being able to just let that out in a direct manner to where it is you want to go if you don't do this general tends to happen it'll build and it will manifest itself is something usually quite negative but with control aggression we can turn it round into a positive thing whatever it is so what i'm going to look at now is a hit circuit and i'm going to be using the controlled aggression for each exercise so it's gonna be short duration exercises each one i'm gonna go for 20 30 seconds just all out much i can put into it and put everything in that whatever i'm trying to do is i'm trying to destroy it i won't be able to destroy what i'm trying to do what i'm doing because i'm going to be using punch bags i'm going to be using slam balls i'm using dumbbells but i won't be able to destroy them but it's about just putting everything into it and just doing that from time to time it just stops the the pot from just boiling over just let a bit of steam out and i mean i i'm not doing this today because i've got rage built up inside me i haven't i'm not angry i'm not in a mood or anything like that today but i wanted to talk about this point whilst i go into my hit circuit so i can just use that and channel it through the hit circuit it's about turning from a calm placid person to the most aggressive person on the planet straight away within a split second and then afterwards when it's done just being able to turn it off at will it's about controlling the energy the rage the anger and not letting it control you welcome to the circuit so we're going to be doing 30 seconds on 30 seconds off three exercises so it works out as a nine minute workout first exercise is going to be mental slams so the second exercise is going to be punch back ground and pound and then the third exercise is going to be done by cleaning and press and after that then after the nine minutes work i'm going to do a set of well i'm getting for 35 40 reps 500 kilograms on the squat all right so i'm going to warm [Music] up [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Applause] [Music] [Music] so [Music] ugh on to my next meal guys so uh after that workout i have protein jig with creatine whey protein powder and milk i also had a banana then i had my shower then i came down and i had a satsuma whilst my food was prepared was being cooked and warmed up do i say because this is good it's mostly cooked yesterday so i got a pot there off and minced beef my protein whole grain pasta for my um whole meal homemade whole grain but whatever it is pasta for whole wheat whichever one it is pasta for my my carbohydrates there is a little bit of tomatoes and peppers in there very small amount but then i've got a bowl of beet root there then to have alongside it people who's one of my favorites sir bloody goodness in that one i'll try and eat uh quite a bit of it every day after my first evening meal i've got a uh i've got scrambled egg bread whole meal bread and it's the ones with the pumpkin seeds and sesame seeds and things like that in so good quality bread uh and i got some tomatoes in there as well so my favorite protein sauce eggs very i really like eggs uh there's only four eggs in this one's i had six eggs this morning four eggs here um tomatoes make as makes a nice taste and it also it it also adds some extra vitamins antioxidants into it and then decent carbohydrates then to help me refuel after that intense session earlier and evening meal now i've got mint beef very similar to the previous evenings lettuce tomatoes cucumbers avocado peppers beetroot i'm gonna eat this guys and then i'm gonna say good night so i shall see you in the morning thank you for watching have a nice evening bye", "02vHrvCrSLw": "is there even a pokemon type edgier than poison type dark and ghost well that didn't take long but yeah i guess so but poison is still pretty edgy media often portrays thieves and assassins using poisoned daggers and poisoned flasks as dark and evil sort of thing and it kind of is poisoning someone is rude like you could just kill them here and now but instead you poison them to make them suffer for their final moments it's messed up but i guess it's also entirely natural there are so many venomous and poisonous insects and reptiles and even a few mammals and birds and the plants oh god i'm so allergic to poison oak as a kid it hospitalized me it made my eyes and esophagus swell shut nature is scary so honestly if i were to get hit by a pokemon move i'm pretty sure a poison type move would be the last one i'd want to get hit by but hey let's go ahead and explain all of the poison type moves in pokemon explain what they do whether or not it's poison or venom and just have some fun gather your antidotes and let's get started [Applause] hello you need a vpn just telling it to you straight it's true though because without a vpn i know all about you and your little hobbies you like pokemon and enjoy breathing oxygen you most likely enjoy smash brothers possibly dipping your toes into alpharad's sphere of the pool from time to time the nintendo meme funnyman and oh yes i know that 53.6 percent of you are from the united states

use the code lockstone to get a two-year plan with a discount plus one additional month for free [Music] for our first category let's do the types namesake the moves that are very clearly actually poison and that means we gotta define it poison a substance that is capable of causing the illness or death of a living organism when introduced or absorbed that's pretty straightforward collegually venomous animals actively inject you with their toxic venom through a bite or a sting whereas poisonous things are things that are bad for you to eat or come into contact with poison dart frogs secrete poison and you do not want to touch them poison oak and ivy have waxy leaves covered in poison and you do not want to touch them tide pods while great for cleaning are poisonous when swallowed heck alcohol is technically a poison but it is a mild one that humans happen to like the effect of and have you heard of iron or water poisoning take too much of either and you get really sick as it does damage to your body really so many things can technically be considered a poison it's all just a matter of what the dosage is so clearly poison dart frog poison is worse for you than water though both can still kill you now i'm sure poison type pokemon are more along the lines of poison dart frogs and less along the lines of just a lot of water let's start with the move toxic thread let's look up the definition of toxic poisonous well at least it's to the point this is the signature move of arya dose where it shoots poisonous spider webs all around its opponent to both slow them down and poison them spiders are one of the more well-known venomous animals so what having a signature poison move is pretty good even though poison and venom are sort of different things but we'll get to that when it comes to spiders most of them have to actively bite you for their venom to work while most of their webs aren't poisonous at all most of them meet the triconfilla clevipes or clever peas i'm just gonna call it the banana spider cause that's also what it's known as it's the banana spider it's a lot easier to say while the banana spider spins its web it secretes a neurotoxin all over it making its web technically poisonous when a bug touches the web not only do they get stuck to its stickiness but the poison eventually reaches their brain and shuts down their nervous system paralyzing them aren't spiders wonderful let's look at something docile and nice like plants with the move poison powder the user scatters a cloud of poisonous dust that poisons the target and looking at the pokemon that learn this move they are all grass type or are bug type moths we'll get to that but this move is essentially the poisonous plant move generally speaking plants don't want to be eaten their fruit yes themselves no thus various plants develop things like capsaicin thorns and poison most of the time the poison only acts if the plant is eaten like water hemlock being absorbed by your stomach which then actively turns your blood itself into a neuromuscular junction toxin which will make you feel drunk until you die in as little as 15 minutes scary but that's what happens when your brain's breathing and heart beating signal can't reach the lungs or heart anymore as for the powder that likely refers to pollen pollen by itself is functionally a sort of poison to those of us with allergies which on its own would be enough to justify this move but we can go deeper some plants like the pea plant and the econotum will actively poison their own pollen if a bee goes in to drink its nectar it gets the poisonous powdery pollen on it and brings it back to its hive spreading throughout it it irritates the bees digestive tract and can be fatal if they have too much of it producing nectar takes a lot of energy and some plants do not just want to share that willy-nilly so they have co-evolved to have pollen that's poisonous to certain species but not others as well as only poisonous if the bees happen to get really greedy see even nature wants to kill bees but how about those moth pokemon well moths are already known to be covered in a sort of moth dust hence dust docks in reality they are shedding their wing scales all the time and they also tend to hide in really dusty areas and so are just covered in normal dust on top of their own scales shedding but on top of that there are in fact poisonous moths stomachaches if you eat them and hives if you come into contact with them so both plants and moths have this association with powders and poisons and thus moth and plant pokemon are the ones to learn poison powder oh also ricin ricin exists it's terrible it's just a poisonous powder that destroys your lungs at the cellular level don't now powder isn't the only way poisons go airborne there's also poisonous gas so many wonderful gases so awful and inhumane that using many of them against enemy soldiers is considered a war crime but i guess it's fine to use them on your own citizens mustard gas tear gas chlorine oh boy and then there's the silent killer carbon monoxide this gas is the most common type of fatal air poisoning in most countries you can't see it can't smell it and can't taste it how wonderful is that oh and it's produced by burning fossil fuels how wonderful how does it kill you a dizzying headache that turns into seizures and bleeding eyeballs because the molecular makeup of your blood is wrong great but yeah this is a pokemon move a poisonous cloud of gas is forcefully expelled to poison the target there's all sorts of different gas as it could be i'm sure it's different depending on the pokemon using it like gallarian wheezing carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide salazal probably hydrogen sulfide or sulfur dioxide those come from thermal vents and volcanoes skunk tank well that's just farts oh and i guess these gases would also explain the move smog the target is attacked with a discharge of filthy gases this may also poison the target smog is typically a lot darker colored it's the beautiful haze you see over major cities that are too scared to use nuclear energy which would solve all of our energy and global warming problems while we wait for renewable technology to advance more and looking at the pokemon that learn smog there's a lot of fire types here likely to reference those vents and volcanoes again and i mean the smog in these cities does come from burning fossil fuels after all so fire type now venom drench and venoshock based on the names you would assume they were venomous moves not poisonous but no it's poison and guess what most of the actually venomous moves are the ones that actually have the word poison in their own name isn't game freak just the best both venom drench and venoshock douse poisonous liquid all over the opponent i mean even the description of venom shock still has the word drenches in it where they defer is in their game mechanics venom drench lowers the attack special attack and speed stats of a poisoned target and veno shock doubles in power if the target is already poisoned interestingly they both have already poisoned mechanics what's up with that well if you have a poison in your body you typically want an antidote and not more poison that is what's up with that the only thing worse than being poisoned is having your body fail on you due to more poison doing things like making it harder to move your muscles which neurotoxins do that would certainly reduce your speed and attack and going into shock is a medical term that does so much damage to your body and of course poison is capable of causing it though typically only if there's a lot of it hence venoshock it's really bad and does a lot of damage now for the um actually they should be venom type moves moves even though the actual definition of venom is a poison that is actively injected so really all venom is poison but not all poison is venom it's that whole thing so i guess most of them having the word poison in the name isn't bad it's just kind of dumb because of those two moves named after venom that aren't venom anyway let's start with poison sting it's really the most apparent and obvious poison type move there is insects bite they sting and typically defend themselves from things that are bigger than them things that they would have no chance against without the added help of being venomous it gives a deterrence to their attackers oh you gonna fight me you better be careful wasps ants scorpions they all have venomous stingers and they all contain chemicals that cause nerves to go off essentially making the sting significantly more painful than it would actually be otherwise i mean it's just like a near microscopic thumbtack poked you like yeah it hurts but it's just like ow but no now there's venom that tells your nerves that this is the most intense pain possible and some of these stings even have lingering side effects like dizziness nausea trouble breathing but for the most part humans won't die from them and this is very similar to how poison jab functions the target is stabbed with a tentacle arm or the like seeped in poison this may also poison the target neato king sea king arya dose they got poisonous horns so those horns are pretty much just like extra-large stingers tend to cruel well jellyfish tentacles will mess you up just brushing against a box jellyfish tentacle causes tissue necrosis meaning the part of your body that touched it is literally rapidly dying at the cellular level and it spreads and it's extremely painful and deadly and this pokemon here is actively trying to jab you with it that's why it's cruel as for the arm in that description i'm sure that's for krogunk the move was added the same time it was and that's like its whole thing punching you with its poisonous arms it's a poison dart frog which use betrachotoxins to cause paralysis to the point of death it just stops your heart from being able to move great then poison fang another obvious one snake fangs are literally injection needles the most common snake venom causes limb numbness weakness nausea and blurred vision but it can get as bad as a loss of consciousness and death poison tail is an interesting one you would think it's referring to like gligar or skarupi but they don't naturally learn the move at all naturally of course meaning via level up rather than through tm breeding or a trainer the move is described as the user hits the target with its tail this may also poison the target and that sounds very generic so i guess this move could be just poisonous or venomous depending on the user the viper is definitely venomous with its blade tail but goodra i guess its tail is coated in poisonous goo and now some of it's stuck on you you touched it it's gross it's poison cross poison is a slashing attack that may also leave the target poisoned it has a high critical hit ratio really it's just scratch with sharp poison coated claws it's similar in concept to shell sidearm the signature move of gallary and slowbro now we know that the shelder on slowbro and sloaking is venomous various pokedex entries mention that it releases toxins into them as it bites down this theoretically is why slowking is so smart so in the case of this move it's just hitting the opponent with its venomous shelder friend what's neat though is that this move can inflict physical or special damage based on which would be stronger when physical you just get hit by its toxic spikes but when special you get shot with poison so i guess this is also either or venom or poison it's only venomous when physical painful bunker is another venomous signature move this time belonging to toxopex toxopex is based on the crown of thorns starfish which has a super mean venom found in its spikes it's a neurotoxin that causes intense sharp pain that lasts hours like think of the pain of actively being stabbed not just like oh you're stabbed in that hurt and now it's kind of sore but you know at least you're not actively being stabbed no it's the initial stabbing pain but always for hours and the pain itself is bad enough that it causes nausea and vomiting just because the brain can't handle the pain it's painful indeed then toxic i'm not sure if i'd count this one as poisonous or venomous either it's kind of both so a new category i guess you could probably throw some of the old ones in here too the category is it's kind to both i mean the move toxic is so generic in name even and so many pokemon learn it naturally and the ones that don't learn it naturally can learn it through tm all but 23 pokemon prior to gen 8 are able to learn it via tm and if we don't count the ones that eventually evolve into pokemon who can learn it through tm we're left with only six and all six of them have gimmicks that explain why this is worthy of a video on its own but i'm sure the idea is that any living thing can potentially be toxic metaphorically speaking and literally i mean we all poop we all have bacteria in and on us we all spread germs coughing and sneezing these are all things that can make others sick heck did you know that deep tissue human bites are potentially lethal we are not venomous we just have all sorts of nasty viruses and bacteria in our mouths that infects our victims fun fact i found out while researching this did you know that 20 percent of all reported bite related injuries in germany are from humans what are you doing over there cat claws are another good example cats aren't venomous but their claws can be covered in all sorts of nasty germs when they bury their poop they get the dirt and the poop all over it and that's why cat scratch fever is a thing so yeah just about anything can be toxic anything besides medical robots punching bags and cosmic horrors that is then with toxic spikes the user lays a trap of poisonous spikes at the feet of the opposing team the spikes will poison opposing pokemon that switch into battle it's just the move spikes but extra spicy the user could be scattering a bunch of old stingers on the ground or like shedded horns a bed of thorns poisonous thorns are poisonous and they do pierce the skin but do they actively inject their poison thus making it venom you know but also since garbodor can learn this move perhaps it's just generic in nature i'm sure garbodor just throws a bunch of sharp gross trash which can cause things like tetanus or a simple bacterial infection and speaking of garbodor new category time that's nasty with gunk shot the user shoots filthy garbage at the target to attack i mean that's pretty self-explanatory and in the anime it's only been used by garbodor and look at this that's just like a glowing trash bag in the games it kinda just looks like well gunk sticky goo gross bubbles but then i love the gen 6 animation because it literally throws a metal trash can clearly that hurts and trash often has decaying food scraps in it or sharp rusty middle bits used tissues waste you know things that'll get you sick now there's three sludge moves sludge sludge bomb and sludge wave and they too are pretty self-explanatory sludge is gross especially since raw sewage is typically a sludge and that explains sludge wave sewer surfing sludge then just throws a handful of the stuff and sludge bomb does the same but more so so much that it explodes all over them it's disgusting but at least it's not gmax mal odor the signature move of gigantomax garbodor garbota at this size is a living garbage dump and it's just seeping trash juice all over you and then geysers it up gee to the roast even just doing that with water would hurt and this is trash water filled to the brim with germs [Music] then with belch the user lets out a damaging belch at the target the user must eat a held berry to use this move sometimes when we eat we swallow air that air needs to come back up and that's why we burp but if we happen to be digesting certain foods well that air was just in your stomach accumulating rotten smells i know my wife hates when i eat pork chops the burps are the worst and in pokemon that smell can be damaging especially if the burper's stomach is filled with poisonous things already because they are poison type or because they're like snorlax who is able to just eat poison and be fine but speaking of the stomach new category acid is acid poison didn't have to think about that too long yes it causes irritation and damage on contact or ingestion acid burns are no joke acid acid spray and gastro acid are all moves similar in concept the user hurls up its stomach acids on the foe the user spits fluid that works to melt the target opposing pokemon are attacked with a spray of harsh acid while gastro acid is clearly stomach acid in name and in description the other two could also be regular sort of acid sprays which numerous animals are capable of doing like the spitting cobra wood ants and bombardier beetles to explain why acids burn and melt things would take forever so here's a super short and simple summary most acids are proton donors they get into whatever they are melting at the molecular level giving them protons breaking up their own bonds just forcing itself in there and then they evaporate or dissolve after doing the damage it just comes in to deal as much damage to the molecular unity as possible before just up and leaving rude and clear to see why these moves do damage their secondary effects are interesting though acid reduces defense as mini acids are used to dissolve metal or bone rapidly so just melting the enemy's defensive shell acid spray reduces special defense special defense is a sort of mental defense but it has some physical properties as well it's a bit complicated when you really start trying to quantify it but i know that if parts of me were actively burning i'd be pretty mentally distressed they don't want to deal with these stupid ants anymore and gastro acid eliminates the effect of the foe's ability there's an odd one i guess sometimes it makes sense like the ability battle armor it's melted now fluffy now you're bald dry skin how about no skin anger point i feel like this would make them more angry corrosive gas is also acid but in gaseous form talk about a spicy butthole the user surrounds everything around it with a highly acidic gas and melts away items they hold as previously mentioned there are poisonous gases and some of them are poisonous because of how acidic they are like hydrogen sulfide and even carbon dioxide technically then acid downpour also known as acid poison delete in japanese this is the poison type z move the user creates a poisonous swamp using its z power and sinks the target into it at full force the description says poison swamp and swamps are pretty icky and poisonous and cause disease but the name and animation say acid rain remember those volcanoes that release poisonous gases well when it rains the water traps those gases and the rain becomes acidic it causes a lot of damage all over the place and generally is not a good day to walk the dog so with the z power they make acid rain and an acid puddle and then they dip their opponent into said puddle like they're trying to dissolve a murdered corpse in a tub except they only faint and are fine should have used max ooze the generic poison type dynamax move in japanese the name of it is dye acid so this liquid is acidic ooze and it just do what acid do but a lot there's a lot more of it because big new category it's just pukamuku or i guess other because this move does not fit any of the other categories this category has the move purify exclusively in it purify is the signature move of pukamuku the punchy sea cucumber using it makes it heal another pokemon's non-volatile status condition such as being poisoned and heal half of its own hp sea cucumbers are pretty resilient and poisonous they have holothurin which causes extreme weakness and permanent blindness lovely but that doesn't explain this move a poison move that heals well it could be seen as a reference to how humans have used venoms and poisons to make all sorts of treatments and cures for things heck right now scorpion venom is being used to treat brain cancer so yes a poison can be used to heal it's science it's cool but why would sucking up someone else's paralysis heal you though huh well some say that there are health benefits to eating sea cucumbers the non-toxic ones of course eating them can help speed up your own wound healing and make you generally healthier thanks to their neuroprotective anti-tumor anticoagulant antimicrobial and antioxidant effects that's that that's just a list of things that want to kill you huh so maybe there's something there but perhaps more specifically this move is magically manifesting one of the primary abilities of the sea cucumber into an attack to quote national geographic sea cucumbers are the purifying species for the ocean see they even use the word purifying feeding on scraps of food the creatures spend their lives inhaling salt water and expelling clear liquid and sediment in many areas their depletion has led to murkier more polluted coastal waters so clearly they quite literally clear the icky gross gunk out of the water by eating it and eating in video games pokemon included tends to be how you heal because that's literally how it works so it's sucking all of the bad stuff out of the target purifying it and healing itself awesome now final category time the poison type pokemon moves that truly should not be poison type in my opinion anyway and there's only three no shouldn't the venom moves all not be because venom and poison are different and the first move is acid armor you'd think acid so yeah acid is poison but there isn't inherently any acid involved in the move at all the move's japanese name is just liquify even the user alters its cellular structure to liquefy itself sharply raising its defense stat and i guess acid is capable of altering cellular structure because that's what it does but it isn't inherently needed and normally acid removes things thus all of the other acid moves lowering defense and if you look at the pokemon that learned this move most are already viscous alchemy is whipped cream melton is mercury cryogonal and vanillish they're literally ice vaporeon and theon can practically melt into water muck is muck so i assume the original intent here is that they are all actively making their bodies more liquid-like because it's harder to do damage to liquids compared to solids i mean go punch some water and see what you do to it i assume this move is poison type because back when the move was first made it was basically the signature move of muk though vaporeon could learn it too it's got crazy cell structure powers though so it's sort of the same reason withdraw is water type going into your shell to defend yourself isn't inherently watery whatsoever but all of the pokemon who knew the move in gen 1 were water types so just make the move water type too there you go that's what they did but with poison up next clear smog smog is poisonous absolutely but the act of clearing it though would adding more smog to the air clear the smog that's already there is it like how most anti-venoms are made from venom but it's air pollution instead wait it's not even smog the description says the user attacks the target by throwing a clump of special mud all stat changes are returned to normal what yeah mud it's gross and icky i guess there's germs mud is found in swamps swamps are filled with disease i don't know but this move is harmful like a poison if the opponent is buffed because it makes all of their raised stats lowered and normal again but if their stats have been reduced this move helps them i guess most medicine can become a poison if you have too much of it eh it just doesn't feel right but i'll chalk this one up to interpretation if you don't like this move in the knot category just pretend it's in the other category however this last move i don't really think you can argue in favor of being poison type the move is coil like with withdrawal having nothing to do with water coiling has nothing to do with poison sure leeches snakes and centipedes are venomous and are capable of coiling but freaking this ferret can coil too so what the move's effect is fine though the user coils up and concentrates this raises its attack and defense stats as well as its accuracy it's like what cobras do when getting ready to strike they first take a defensive pose coiling around themselves then raise their head ready to attack and strike accurately so yeah the move has an association with a venomous creature but the move in and of itself is not poisonous at all so it should not be poison type and that is that that was the video oh and uh remember all that

make a nice healthy breakfast beverage right now i'm featuring this morning pumpkin beautiful pumpkin right now one cup of cubed pumpkin listen to this guys we'll give you 30 calories it has in 0.1 grams of fat no cholesterol at all right one milligram sodium eight grams carbohydrate 0.6 grams fiber 3.26 grams of natural sugar 1.2 grams protein it has in vitamin a vitamin c potassium vitamin b6 iron magnesium and it also has in calcium so pumpkin is a good food so this morning i'm going to show you guys how to quickly make a pumpkin and banana beverage right no what i did with my pumpkin i lightly so this is like about half a cup of cucumber so i lightly steamed it for about a minute this is soft evolution but i'm not going to use all of it in one it's going to be too thick i'm just making you know for me right i'm going to use half of that and put this in my blender just lightly steamed for about a minute half of it all right that's a quarter about quarter cup yeah in the blender right and then i'm gonna i freeze my banana so i have one frozen ripe banana that goes into the blender i freeze it without one i don't know when bananas get too ripe about the wheels anything so once they're getting a little too ripe i just cut them up freeze them have them make my stuff right now to that i'm going to be adding one cup of coconut water and we already discussed the health benefits of coconut water i put my coconut water in there and then i'm going to add one tablespoon of the irish moss the sea moss gel no i'm gonna put two tablespoons i'm putting two tablespoons of the sea mass gel in my blender and then now i'm gonna add the seeds i don't want it too too thick so i'm gonna put one teaspoon so i'm putting one teaspoon of the pumpkin seed all right that's one teaspoon of pumpkin seed in there and one teaspoon of my flax seeds this is my jars i have these little jars keep all my seeds in them so i put one teaspoon of the flax seed and then i'm gonna add to that one teaspoon of the sesame seed you guys know the sesame seed in the health benefits of sesame seed is very high in calcium and one teaspoon in fact i'm going to put two teaspoons of the pumpkin up the sunflower seed because i want to be nice and rich so two teaspoons of the palm of the soda flour seed and then a tip just a little tip of the pink himalayan sea salt to bring out the flavor and for all those wonderful trace minerals that we'll find in that and then lastly i'm gonna add uh one tablespoon of honey now i don't really measure with my honey let's pour a little i can guesstimate what a tablespoon is like now once that is all in the blender i will simply get my base where's my beast once it one second guys i forgot to carry around this all right so let's get my base right cover it up and then i'm gonna blend it up [Music] all right so been for about a minute or so no this is actually a full complete meal tarzan proteins has the carbohydrates healthy fats minerals and vitamins right we'll combine the pumpkin the raw banana the coconut water a little honey flaxseed pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds sesame seeds and a dash of the himalayan sea salt and two nice heaping tablespoons of the asimos or irish moss gel and this is our pumpkin banana beverage this will hold you as a lovely breakfast meal until lunchtime it is delicious absolutely delicious filled with new trends for the body to see in good health now my word for you comes from acts chapter three no i love acceptance one of my favorite and the reason is because it takes our eyes away from looking at man for healing the body and understand who's the real healer of the body so here we have in obstacle three peter and john went up together into the temple the hour of prayer being a night owl and a certain man leaned from his mother's womb was was carried who they laid at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask the arms of them but entered into the temple who's seeing peter and john about to go into temple ask of arms of a big peter and john some morning right peter fasting his eyes upon him with john said look on us and he gave heed unto them so the man look upon them expecting to res receive something from them then peter said silver and gold have i known but such as i have give i unto you in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk he took him by the right hand and lifted him up so when we're working with persons who are sick help them take them by them right that's why i'm doing these videos this is why i have my facebook page this is why i have my office in ochi this is why i reach out to people around the world because we've got to let people understand that jesus christ of nazareth is the healer so we help people right we held them up and he said that peter lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength and he leaping up students and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising god no guys this man was born in this condition he couldn't walk right and he when he was able to walk was leaping and dancing and praising god now tell me how many you have put how many when you can walk today how many of us are telling god thanks for our feet thanking him for our hands thanking him for our moat thanking him for our eyes thanking him for he hears thanking god for help come on people the bible says and other people saw him walking and praising god and they knew it was he which sat for arms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they that were there um happened to be looking at him right and as the layman which was healed helped peter and john all the people run together onto them in the porch that is called solomon's greatly wondering and when peter sighed he answered unto the people ye men of israel why marvel here this or why luke heed so earnestly on us as though by our own power our holiness we have made this man to war we don't make people um healthy we don't make people restore health god does it we're the servants like peter and john now tell me with medical school peterborough tell me which medical school jungle the power comes from god so when i work in my office as a medical missionary as we have several medical missionaries in the seventh-day adventist movement right and i'm not working as a naturopathic doctor it is not dr deborah healing you i am only getting the instructions from the lord i'm just learning about the plants learning about the food learning about water learning about sunshine learning about rest learning about trusting in god it is god that brings the healing we are servants to you we're serving you helping you to understand how to regain your health peter goes on in verse 13 and say the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob the god of our fathers have glorified his son jesus whom he delivered and denied him in the presence of pilate when he was determined to let him go but he denied the holy one the just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you you killed the prince of life whom god have raised from the dead we're up we are weaknesses i have a weakness that god can heal from disease remember i had cancer in 2012 no chemo no radiation didn't cut off my breasts no hormone therapy and here i am in 2020 healthy at the age of 50. praise the lord i feel so good in my body every day because god has anointed me with the holy spirit he has removed darkness from me and sent me to go and teach his people how to be spiritually and physically healthy right and in verse 16 oh here's the cliche with peter peter say and his name jesus name and his name through faith in his name has made this man strong whom he see and know yea the faith which is by him have given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all so this morning i want to encourage us to say the word jesus christ is our great physician the lamb that will slave before the foundation of the earth the father sent him the father loves us right the holy spirit is now sent and the holy spirit is here as our comforter and so wherever disease is we've got to learn to take care about the temple going on a natural platform drinking all water exercising eating the natural food not over garbage you know but garbage process processed food flesh too much pleasure it builds up uric acid in the body poison the blood too much chemical is not being pumped into the animals right so be encouraged in the lord we have a savior who loves us he's in the most holy place in the heavenly sanctuary and he's interceding on our behalf yeah he's preparing to come back soon he has to be ready say a prayer read the word share with your neighbors enjoy life god bless you all have a wonderful day", "cwM7ZsJyGj8": "how y'all doing fam

yes sir bro this one rolling wise super easy to roll like it just sticks like a log you know i'm not rolling joint because it's going to be a long ass video probably a little fetish you know pulling a quick little grin push the [ __ ] down and let me know what you guys want to see next on the channel here like let me know some crazy [ __ ] that i want to see like some crazy smoking [ __ ] i don't know something maybe i'll start doing vlogs too i gotta go a gopro now do some vlogs that'd be nice but the vlogs i got to do it in another channel all right [ __ ] is rolled up i'm gonna get it it's just amazing too smell and flavor this wheat is really up there really really up there the taste i don't know rather not that's always what i get stunned like i don't know how to [ __ ] describe the flavor like this well it's fruity fruity but if you ever smoke purple punch you can you know feel the flavor of the purple punch when you exhale but you feel more the taste of the banana when you inhale don't really know if that made sense it made sense to me and bro how do you taste your weed is by exhaling through your nose through your nose i get that you know you're gonna be able to tell if you exhale through your mouth too but like how you really get the taste of the weed is when you puff it and exhale it through your nose and then do the thing because it's just like the same thing when you're sick and your nose is stuck you're not able to taste anything you're not able to taste the food so that's the same thing with the weed if you want to taste the weed you got to [ __ ] inhale through your nose not inhale exhale my bed do just like this then you exhale then you can tell the [ __ ] flavor yo because i know some other ways to like this they do this you can feel it too like this but through the nose is just like way cleaner taste and you can just taste it the music is that portuguese [ __ ] you already know this one is alpha g netflix and chill go show him some love bro he shows me some love to be sharing me on his page smoking and [ __ ] bro so you already know bro we representing portugal smoking wise this is super smooth strong on the lungs because you can feel that that punch in there and purple punch coming through that's where they lose some points right here see me and salt and pepper is not black you know but it's not those fire ass ones that we're used to having this one is grown by casco bay botanical so imagine just because this black asian does not mean that it's not gay gas or it's good or nothing like that so blackish from what i've known now i thought that blakeish just came because you flushed it wrong it's not because of that only it can beat because you flush the wrong too but it can be for when you're drying it your weave if you dry it too long you can get that black edge bro that's crazy i did not know that like it's some sort of process that it stays on the plant for too long that it turns this to burn like this don't ask me what it is because i'm not a pro bro i just throw that so if your weed is burning black you gotta talk to a grower and be like yo bro don't let it cure so much help them out this one i got it at maine i started going to maine again it's a drive yo it's a little bit far but it's worth it because you'll be getting gas and way cheaper bro like all this so i bought an ounce and 14 grams all that was 300 bills 300 bills if i wanted wasn't the ball here just an ounce of any of this it would be 250. that's the lowest that it goes like for exotics or for some good but over here it's 250 bro 250. no problem for good quality but especially like this that i showed you guys like this [ __ ] they'll be charging 275 almost 320 is it the plugs this is not the spacers the spacers charge 360. i gotta do a video going to a disco here in maine and do the difference and go to a disco in a plug no but it's very tasty the weed is very tasty it's not harsh at all but you feel that punch in your lungs bro every time you inhale it's not like some joints that are super smooth that you're not even feeling that you're like you don't even feel like you're smoking this one you feel that punch in your chest okay and it's resting up too i don't know but it's resting up right there it's always a good sign too that means it's [ __ ] oiling up this good bud and yeah bro strain reviews are pretty much always the same bro i'm just me talking about this new strain that i have but i'm gonna start doing it like remo chemo does bro like once a week like once a week i'll drop a video that is a strain review but you know still keep the other days to put some different type of content you know because i noticed that people like to see like more crazy all my crazy videos are crazy but you know the that you smoke a lot get the most views and me i thought that like showing off cool bugs would get a lot of views too but it doesn't get as many but i'm not hating like i love doing this that's why i do it because i love doing like the strain reviews because it's just like i'm so lucky of getting of being able to get so many strains that is just like you know it's just right to show you guys come [Music] i love doing the other videos too it was a crazy [ __ ] smoking i just ran out of my because bro on instagram i've been doing all the crazy [ __ ] so i'm i'ma start bringing the things that i did on instagram to youtube and just show you guys how to do it because on instagram all i did was smoke i didn't teach you guys how to do it so some of my crazy videos imma teach how to do and then smoke it too of course but yeah hopefully you guys are going to like that too because bro instagram i've been doing a lot of videos over there but like i've been doing instagram for like seven years you two i'll only be doing for six months [ __ ] up i don't know like i know how to roll them i roll them up but like not even close to the joint bro like i cannot prefer like i cannot roll a perfect backwards now a joint every time every time i'm going off track so banana punch this [ __ ] is fire rotating super good let's rate it now so let's rate it it looks gets a 9.5 no problem 9.5 it looks no problem then nose in terms of smell gets a 9 very strong smell very tropical like fruity smell you know uh smoking it's a nine two gets an eyebrow because it's tasty not harsh and it's strong and okay and you know um edge wise that's where she loses some points because i might have to give it a solid eight because it's [ __ ] you know it's salt and pepper salt and pepper bro it is what it is it is what it is it's still good but it's salt and pepper so it gets the eight so overall this stream gets a nine it has to get a nine bro because on the looks and smell is that nine point five smoking gets that nine and it just loses points on the ash bro because even the nook structure on this like it's smaller notes oh yeah i give you the smaller nibs but the nugs are just so beautiful and so crazy probably like it just smells so good so you got to give that you know fix the ash a little bit other than that perfect hope you guys like this video if you liked it don't forget to leave a like comment subscribe follow me on instagram topsoil for 420. and yeah bro this week to the next video it's going to come out soon this joint is done stay tuned to the next video", "3VvU4-0Syrc":

a spoon of peanut butter to this as well so the 80s peeps yeah my banana give me a sponge thanks for watching", "P8E8X2eYW2s": "you know what's going on YouTube today I mean to one another glow extract cartridge review today I'll be reviewing the banana punch cartridge says it's a hybrid it doesn't have any other information about like percentage or anything because you guys didn't know if it tells you the percentage then it's [ __ ] fake and also before I get into the actual review on the cart if you guys didn't watch my last video the globe extracts it's a black market brand which means it can be verified with the QR code because they are vastly produced technically illegally or whatever which the only reason they're it's illegal is because they don't have actual lab tests and stuff I believe on their website they may have some sort of lab test but it's not like approved by the whoever regulates this stuff I'm not sure I want to say the FDA but pretty sure that's on me for like food and [ __ ] but anyways enough rambling this is the banana punch hybrid the person I got these from they previously did verify the the QR code on the box that includes all of these and so I know it is legit in that aspect this is what the cartridge itself looks like it was laying on its side since what that big bubble is but I have already hit it I know what I think about it but I'm still gonna hit it live for you guys and give you guys my raw taste test on camera so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and hit it but you're gonna think oh you guys this this is [ __ ] it's really good it definitely has that banana flavor to it but I definitely wouldn't like relate it to like a Laffy Taffy or any sort of banana like that like if you ever had a banana puff bar or something don't think that this is what it's going to taste like it's more of like a banana terpene like kind of like a banana I can't really describe it 100% but yeah an earthy banana honestly but overall I find the opportunity to choose between any of the flavors from the Glos this definitely wouldn't be my first like my first choice but it definitely wouldn't be at the bottom the only reason why I say it has cuz the I've had other glues that just had like way more of a like add a bit to it like just more of a Terp profile I guess you would say I just they tasted more earthy and made you coffee more but this this is really smooth but it's like not too smooth to the extent where it feels like you're hitting a [ __ ] like a vape or something like I don't know but overall I would definitely get this a solid an 8 out of 10 just because my personal preference with carts and pins or whatever is I like getting that like straight of dad hit like I don't mind coughing my ass off and like nearly dying because that honestly makes you preserve the cart longer and but at the same time it does make you sound like a crack theme so I'm gonna go ahead and stop talking guys hope you guys enjoyed the review go ahead and leave comment for anything else you guys want me review I'm gonna try to continue uploading consistently and I actually have an elgato coming in the mail soon so I will probably be able to start live streaming if that's something that aim was interested in so if you made it this far in the video drop a comment below peace", "2JLDP9F-2fw": "[Music] hey cubs welcome back to my youtube

right that's my guess it's a crumble um the terps on this like i said so g leaf has really low terps she leaves her terpene profile on their um cured crumble stuff their trim run stuff is super low um we got beta car 0.45 we got humiliating 0.13 we got limonene 0.11 we got linoleum 0.10 we got alpha and beta pining combined at point um we're going to have it at 0.1 but we'll round out to 0.1 beta merge 0.03 so you know what's at 5 6 7 8 9. we're not even at one percent we're not even at one percent total terps that's shitty that's shitty it is um it's shitty so banana punch mm-hmm let you guys check us out let's see what we got popping off here looks pretty good for a crumble it looks like a good it's pretty good stuff right pretty good stuff this is my waking bake um i i wanted to make those capsules get those capsules popping you know it's football as soon as 12 30 hits i'm on the couch i'm on the couch so i'll be dabbing be dabbing my face off today tell you october man october third and fourth touchdown huge festival massive festival it's really gonna be a good time i think everybody will enjoy it i think that [Applause] i think there's going to be some cool things there rosin rosin will absolutely chase up your banger rosin rosin does it so here we go let's check out some of this i'm just gonna go right right in no [ __ ] cheers why didn't i expect that to happen i don't know what that happened i don't know what that is but look that's my oil yo sorry again yeah explain that one to me explain how my oil just explain how my oil turned into carbon ash explain how this happens explain how that happens anybody can tell me you're running too hot man the fire alarm didn't even go off and use a watch no when the fire alarm goes off wow that's bad that i'm glad i'm making capsules out of this that's bad when you heat your banger up for like 40 seconds and you go in and it turns into a ball of tar turns into whatever the [ __ ] that is whatever that is from hitting that and i'm saying plant material i'm saying plant material so it looks like i'll be going to the dispensary to get more oil because i'm not dabbing that now hey what's up little squirrel babe what's up brother you need more food buddy you hungry old dad get out there and feed you a little guy that's hey listen it is what it is right [ __ ] happens but uh i'm not i'm not jazzing up my banger man yeah come on seriously come on that's not cool man that's not cool bangers clean though bangers clean all right so there you go there's that but it's just what is that what is this what is this what possibly could that be what chas charred up [ __ ] is this so i don't know that was intriguing um definitely got a little a little spicy funk to it it's basically flavorless um it wasn't that hot man like that's kind of weird because it was i didn't go in that hot i really didn't oh man well we're going cold we'll give it the benefit of the dap right i'm just gonna wipe this down one more time get the get this [ __ ] absolutely one thousand percent clean yeah got a nice clean banger bangers clean let all that evaporate off look at that clean banger we have a clean banger okay i don't wanna hear any [ __ ] it's clean [ __ ] it's clean so bangers clean all right um i don't know i just don't know is it good is it bad uh the effects you know like i said it's super low and i'll also wonder how come every one of those has a 0.2 cbda it's kind of a weird thing but yeah it's right there it's the thca is 79 um i mean do i have it do i have a little bit of a medicated buzz yeah i do i mean it's my wake and bake and i ate a [ __ ] 500 milligrams of cbd last night shout out to willy wonka no willie what is it willie 420 what is it you know who you are you're on cali bro shout out to you for hooking me up with that tip i've been eating massive amounts of cbd every night and i wake up i feel great hey back feels you know phenomenal i have to use that word because it feels phenomenal it's like a phenomenal back feels great um yeah man things are going good uh so here i bring some stuff over some some things just a couple nothing crazy you know we're not getting whatever i'm just i'm just making [ __ ] still um also getting ready for so you guys know i've been talking about doing a subscription box right all right i love pumpkins i think pumpkins are cool man i think seriously i think pumpkins are [ __ ] dope right whether they have one eye or two i just love them i think they're [ __ ] cool [ __ ] i like making them i like [ __ ] with them um these make great stir sticks yard plant pokes yard art you can use them to pick your [ __ ] nose with whatever you know check him out right i just think it's cool i just really enjoy working with glass i really enjoy doing it so shout out to everybody who pushed me to do that i appreciate it so yeah we got these pokes here man right is this one i just think i just i think working with glass is just it's so i didn't mean to give you the finger there but it's amazing so yeah so we got a bunch of glass going the shirts oh man i'll give you guys a quick tour here i mean i just been i just been real busy i mean this is all this is all so here's the jones i did yesterday just [ __ ] around remember i broke that [ __ ] what's it called yeah i fixed it just made some more [ __ ] yesterday um so that's pretty much what i got going on all and your shirts [ __ ] i made all these yesterday and the day before so a [ __ ] ton we have a lot we have quite a few quite a few quite a few boxes full of completely folded and finished really big fan of folding [ __ ] i just gotta say it um i'm not so i was looking at my finances i might just say [ __ ] it and um so i got uh extra large and 2x hoodies he's right here all right this right here is [ __ ] 600 isn't that crazy 20 hoodies 600 bucks i also heard um i might do up i was thinking maybe i will maybe i won't i don't know yet don't know yet they're 2x um i do have a bunch of 2x but i i i might do those up i don't know so yeah so um i have i'm gonna grab some large um i have some some large hoodies i'm gonna grab a large and medium all right i feel like large and medium should cover everybody then so then we'll have we'll basically have um medium large extra large 2x the 2x and 3x there's it's just a little bit longer it's like it's like a half inch longer that's it does not you know i get it if like a 2x is tight you probably wouldn't need a 3x i get that i'm gonna have 3x stuff but the hoodies are just not there right now it's just not there so here we go science let's see if we can get close and get some see if we can get some of these bubbles about if i can't catch it you see it see it decarbon see them bubbles i i just think absolutely science is [ __ ] amazing like the whole act of it the whole the whole deal how it works all right like look at that that's an actual reaction right now the heat it's [ __ ] crazy right [ __ ] crazy man it's so crazy man you're crazy bro you're wild nah not at all so what else what else let's go do another dab just want to let that set in um like i said this right here this is the stuff that i my personal opinion should be like 20 or 30 bucks you can castrate me all you want you just can [ __ ] say whatever i'm just saying honestly i really feel like that yeah that [ __ ] turned crazy dark in my banger now stop it all right me go back in i'm not going to go in big because apparently this isn't this isn't that kind of oil this ain't that kind this ain't that kind of oil to be doing fat ass dabs with this is kind of what i'll be doing little dabs with because if you go too big you may or may not just i don't know it's weird like what what what causes that to char up like that right cheers [Applause] cheers uh yeah it's just not this is not a good taste there's a lot of other stuff out there mpa we can buy that tastes way better like this in terrapin lately just been shitty um i mean it's it's not gross i don't know what that taste is man there's like that like light funk to it ah [ __ ] it all right well there you go you can't win them all i will say this uh it makes great great great edibles um my capsules because trying to find rso trying to find rso for 60 bucks in pa right it's an impossibility you can find terrapin but this goes i know guy i shot sparky talking the other day and uh i was like i needed a grandma rso a day man where can i go listen there's people out here that are doing their thing good people um you know and it's like you know we got people out here making medicine we got you know these companies are kicking ass you know some some are doing better than others okay some have better quality cleaner meds all that um you know the thing that's like the thing that the thing that gets me a little bit is this is you know um you have good people out here the hard-working people hard-working people getting up every day going out there breaking their bodies for somebody else or themselves whatever you know contributing members of society you know not crazies not convicts not this not that you know not out polluting the [ __ ] world causing hate and discontent not doing it good people good people getting out even in the cannabis industry good people and they just can't afford their meds man it's not cool so um so for for for you bro the answer to that question is g leaf my dude you just got to try to figure out which ones kind of look close to what you're looking at um but if you look at like straight up and this isn't this isn't a jab at anybody this is just it is what it is it's legit science if you look at rso some of them have depending on okay um like if you look at like grassroots rso that you can dab because it looks like to me it's distillate but it's really terpe right and some of this stuff is really chirpy okay then if you look at like a lot of the other ones like if you look at like um like let's say terrapins right terrapins terrapins is not as chirpy and that's okay because rso if you look at how rso is made and what it is you'll see so that's why i'm like for me it shouldn't be that much the rso should be one of the cheapest things on the menu and it's one of the most expensive so for you buddy look it looks a terrapin 55 a gram look towards g leaf 60 gram if cresco ever drops trim again which probably not um cured runs right for 55 but um yeah that's that's what i would say and then take look to making your own i know it's you know it for like a lot of people like i don't have the time i can't do that you know all these things and it's like yeah i get that but you know every sunday i make my meds for the whole week um it takes me two hours right i'm just you know two hours or just spend all that money and it's like so much money you gotta spend you're spending all this money on [ __ ] and you know you just can't afford it and then you're like dude i can't afford this [ __ ] anymore you know then you're in [ __ ] pain so everybody be cool have a good day and go birds", "qtYotH5xiGY": "was happening was handing [ __ ] you to you with Genesis back in this [ __ ]

and bake and i figure i might as well do this strain review before this train is completely done but we've got the strain here called banana um punch i keep forgetting the name for some reason this is banana punch and i remember reading on the comments a while back that someone had mentioned without a punch and it was a good string so the other day i'm over here green farms in mesa my wife has a meeting she has to go to so i drop her off i'm like down the road from green farm so i head over there i wasn't intending to get a strain to like do a review on i was just want to get something you know just to burn some time with this wound up being a really nice strain and i didn't get the smell or anything i just kind of saw but i don't know punch sure sounds good let's just try it out so i grabbed it it was on the top tier the top shelf um from what we know about banana punch this is a 50 50 hybrid and the tc those on this can get like 26 so she's pretty high up there at least in those upper mediocre levels as far as the genetics go this is banana og cross with purple punch so you got good stuff in here while purple punch is a wonderful strain i've heard a lot about banana og but uh purple punch from what we know is uh larry og crossed with granddaddy purple and larry og is where you're gonna find yourself in the valley og crossover kush so you've got good stuff in here like a lot of stuff that we do like we love saving our valley og we love og because we love granddaddy purple but on og i have i have high hopes for i believe in it every time i come across a banana strain or pineapple strain i'm always looking to try it out because i never come across anything that tastes like banana or pineapples except for like a few moments where i have found a few strains all the banana strains i've ever tried have just been kind of like meh there was some banana pudding that was okay this was good stuff it was my golden planet but i didn't really have anything that made me think like wow this is a new favorite for me until now i'm like wow this is a new favorite for me this is banana punch and she's absolutely wonderful um i puffed on this the whole entire day the first time i got this nothing but banana punch [Music] and it wasn't until the next day i've been using the chilum so i've been extending the life of this strain it was until the next day where i figured i just gonna puff this once a day and i figured that's where it is this is the kind of strain that you can't be smoking all day long i mean you could but i feel like she loses her luster you know the first time is always the best after that the level of euphoria that's behind on this on this high is kind of kind of you know dims a little bit she's not as spectacular but she's there you know um but you have to put into work you can't just let her you can't just let her ride the whole time you gotta get out and push she's a wonderful strain and um from what we found uh she's very happy very uplifting euphoric she's got this wonderful cerebral buzz and she's got this really nice tingly body buzz it just it's the cherry on top man i hate to over hype strains but i feel like this is a nice strain i i really did enjoy my time medicating with this and every single day where i puffed on this i just had a wonderful day she really does put you in the mood you know you're you're in good vibes you're giving off good vibes and i felt like you know um well you know we'll take some toast before we head on we'll talk about experience after but cheers you guys there's so much i want to say about the strain but i don't want to be all hopping around we have this oh yeah this oh yeah this the way him bake is very uplifting it's happy you're like high in the sky and it's not the kind of highway you're just like oh so high it's engaging i wouldn't say it's caffeinated it's just very uplifting and you'll find yourself like mary poppins you'll dance on the breeze over houses and trees with your fists holding tight to the string of your kite well to the string of your high it's something that's kind of active and engaging and um like i said you gotta meet her halfway because if you just sit here smoking this you will just get stoned um one of the things i read about on leafly i think it was leafly but it mentioned that this is a tranquil uh high i didn't know what tranquil was exactly i saw tranquility lane on fallout 3. so that's google and google pronounced it tranquil but she said tranquil means undisturbed and calm and i was trying to figure it out when i was puffing on this i felt very like high not caffeinated but very like motivated uplifting very hopeful looking forward to starting the day i feel like there was nothing i couldn't handle emotionally um but probably like 25 30 minutes into puffiness like every time we take a strain for a test drive we always hit her heavy the first time and we did i took like maybe i don't know four or five bowls but i was sitting there smoking for like probably a good half an hour in my car i'm just sitting there talking it up and at first i feel like man i think i'm on top of the world i'm on cloud nine and then it seemed like probably after like 25 30 minutes i got stoned it felt like somebody had came and threw a weighted blanket on me but it was like an emotional weighted blanket you know how you put a weighted blanket on like hyperactive kids in the kind of you know weighs them down and it kind of like settles them down that's kind of what this was except on an emotional level and it wasn't until probably the second day where i realized that's where that trend that's where the trend cool high comes from and this thing is important i i i smoke quite a few strains since i've been here so i've been recording strains a lot of strains are happening there's some strains where i don't do reviews on them there's or anything i just kind of i don't do anything but definitely record it i have over a thousand strains since i've been here in arizona i've got like 600 in my book i've got another 600 on on youtube but there's like a whole bunch that i haven't done and all my time being here i've never come across this train that had me feeling that weightedness that like there was a a paperweight upon me it kind of like the hand of god just came down i was like chill and it wasn't forceful it wasn't bad it wasn't negative i thought it was just comforting almost like if you've ever had like a like a hyperactive kid or even like a dog or animal a cat even on like fourth of july there's fireworks going off and they're all like shaking they're shivering they're really scared and you kind of hold them you cuddle them you give them love you make them feel okay and they start to settle down and before you know they stop shivering and they start falling asleep kinda like when you your dad gets dirty lickings yeah you did something wrong in front of you dirty lickins and then your mom comes and comforts you you hug you and then you know that's kind of how it was it was very comforting almost you felt it almost physically i mean it was there emotionally but physically it kind of felt like wow i'm stoned it's like one minute all the cells in your body all your personalities like oh yeah this freaking strain is good bro we so freaking high yeah and you turn around and there's the stone it's sitting there when it's legs crossed just looking at you and you're like when did you get here and he's like i've always been here i was just waiting for you guys to notice and then you notice i was freaking stoned and the moment i felt that stone i ever think to myself like whoa this thing just hit like that just came out of the shadows hi i'm stone how are you and you're like oh i'm stoned too how are you and you you feel like the stone just hits you bro and i remember at that moment i was like hell yeah bro i crank up the wailing souls and i freaking drove home i was like i felt so good she wasn't intoxicating she wasn't sedating it was very comforting i think this is where that tranquil tranquil height comes from i came home and my house was a mess when tornado came true i was like what the hell brought kids just laughing here kids giggling rustling around the rooms they're having fun i went to the kitchen and like it was like everybody just ate breakfast and left all the plates were on the table nothing was done to sing i looked around i was like and rather than do what i usually do which would be to go and go into the room and start snapping at everybody instead of snapping at my kids i went straight to that big speaker but with this big karaoke speaker and turn them on and i was like this thing pumps bra next up bluetooth my freaking reggae christmas music bra i was i was literally having a fun time i was having a blast i found myself by like and we're dancing through the dishes five freaking bust the moon walk by in the kitchen turn i'll do my spin wow i got all the dishes done i got the countertops done did the island everything bro and like my wife comes and she goes oh jam man i was like yeah she was you making anything for lunch i said what you like tuna fish salad just like you got it bro i didn't just grab tuna fish and mayonnaise and salt pepper bar freaking king the salad toppings the dried cranberries and diced apples sliced tomato i was all over that brah i feel like this has such a creative high but that trend quill high that's in here i think comes from that weightedness and it's to the point where it doesn't get you shook it she has like anti-ship properties and that's needed but especially in today's day where people are offended at everything but people will be offended at how you say things how you spell things when you mention things people get very offended and when i say people i mean all of us i just like me i get offended too when i go oh my freaking house is dirty the kids are like goofing off but this this didn't shake me bro you think about waking big how about shaking big with this bra i was like i came home and nothing could shake me i was unshakable bro i'm not no freaking martini what you gonna do this to me you can't do this to my emotions not when i'm on this train bro i kind of feel like yeah we're not shaking we're not stirred we're just as is and i feel like this kind of string would help out for a lot of people out there because in today's society people are offended at everything and this is something that would even if you're getting roasted by your family members you'll be laughing you'll be laughing along too you're like freak man you know it's it's something that kind of makes you a little bit more bendable a little bit more flexible to handle those winds you know when you get a little seed that sprouts up and you have all these big trees around it shadowing it it doesn't get the sunlight it doesn't get the the wind factor so it doesn't strengthen it doesn't get hard but and it goes up to a weak tree but just like when you're getting slow spread you gotta like you know stabilize get the wind on them constantly helps you know get them nice and strong and that's kind of what this trainer i feel like it kind of helps with you to do is helps to withstand those whirlwinds of life man sometimes life is blowing hard the rest of society is blowing hard you got to be able to withstand that man i feel like this strain is good bro she's got a good spf factor that stony protective factor of like 60. she's long-lasting but i felt like the more you puff on her that kind of diminishes too the first time i hit this was probably like i don't know 9 9 30 in the morning and i was good like after lunch i didn't medicate again like just before we left to my daughter's chair practice and even then it was a first day cheer practice i was like i will puff on this before we head out bro we head over to the chair practice and like i'm very anti-social yeah i don't like looking at people talking to people associate with people i walked in and only had like maybe two people with their kids so we get in there we got in there early and more people started coming in and i was like there was one like tree guys in there and i'm like i was one of those tree but i wasn't worried i didn't feel out of place i didn't feel like i didn't fit in i was just kind of in there in that moment and whatever was happening i was there even when they called my parents to come to stand with their kids in the front where they do the chairs like i went up there but i was like i hope they don't ask me to cheer i mean i'll do it but i gotta hold my pants up because it's kind of falling yeah so i gotta hold like one belt buckle and i'll do my whatever they want me to do but they didn't ask me to do anything so i was like good that just reminded me like um yesterday morning i hit this on the waking bait before we left the house before we went to go we walk every morning every morning we wake up we'll walk we go drop i graphic school and the rest of me and my family we we walk we do a couple laps around the park so we do about i don't know like three miles and i go in the evening and i walk like a mile with irene in the same park because she feels left out so i gotta take her afterwards after dinner but um i went with my son in the morning time and we're walking my wife's usually carrying him around and he's going off and i found like i found some like baseballs inside the the field and i was like trying to juggle them yeah and i was like i was feeling misery but i was trying i was like i was gonna juggle so and i look over and i see my son and there's this dog bro the dog's like it's on a leash but it's like way ahead and the the orders then they go my son went straight for a dog i was like and i tried to get closer i started going you know towards him and i was like when i saw the dog the first thing i thought was like is that a freaking dog well it's like yeah what did you think it is and i was like it had a smile like a it looked at me it was smiling and it had like a nose it was like it looked like an ewok it didn't have a dog's mouth and whoever's the owner put little barrettes in its hair it was like it looked like somebody was all dolled up and my son i have no idea where he learned how to associate with dogs we don't have a dog and he's only two years old so we probably just saw it on tv but he walked straight to the dog he squats down front of her and grabs by her ears and starts petting her massaging her this dog is love he's got big spots he's licking his face licking his face his dell is wagging my son gets up he's like yeah and he just walks he doesn't even look back at the dog he's just going towards like whatever's next and it was then that i realized like he's in the now he's not even worried about the past or the future and that's my problem i'm always thinking about what's going to happen and if i'm not thinking about that i'm thinking about all the things that have happened and i'm hardly ever in the now and that was something that i picked up on that i was like man and this strain does help with that it has you now like when i found those freaking baseballs normally i would be like save these for the dogs in case any wild dogs wanna come looking for some action i'll be action-packed but i didn't think i'm like oh yeah juggle these things why should i juggle the freaking baseballs but i was like you know this is a good strength and i only picked up a gram of this and it lasted about three days um this isn't all i smoked for three days though the first day this is always smoked sweet i'm glad i grabbed this and thank you to whoever mentioned that in the comments section i know dean always puffing those crazy strains one of the reasons why it makes me want to move to washington i think that's where he's at colorado is washington and colorado in the same place hey google she's not even on here where the hell is she no washington is different from colorado because denver's in colorado and washington's in washington i think i grew up in hawaii so we never really learned too much about mainland stuff like we know there's 50 states but we just kind of stick to hawaii because i figured this is where i'm going to live and die i'm going to live in hawaii all my life i need to know about where you know louisiana or baltimore or all those places are i don't even know i know it's ignorant but you kind of feel like living being born and raised in hawaii life was very simple i didn't even think about school or education you know it was like i'm not allowed to put a red dead redemption problem with my wife she's been reading too many gosh darn books education what has it ever added to society i'm not like that i believe in education anything else we are feeling good deep down i want to hit one more bowl but i'm like take it easy champ i know i know it just feels so good that's all anyhow as far as the strain goes we love it we enjoyed it and if i saw this again on top shelf i grab it she lasts a long time because it doesn't take much and if you're wise with her you won't be hitting her all day you know once a day is good and if you're doing it like that she's going to last a long time but she's one of these kind of strains you want to supplement with she would come in handy if you're having a bad day you're having a stressful day maybe things aren't going your way you know maybe there's a funk you just can't shake or something you know you're feeling down the dumps life has been giving you the dirties for the past who knows how long someone just gotta you know shake off that negative vibe you know that's residual it collects it's like tartar just like you got like freaking uh what's that stuff caught i'm always forgetting it connective tissue you get connective tissue builds on you overnight you wake up in the morning stiff this way you gotta stretch and like feel the bones cracking you feel like all that pain that's that um connective tissue dissolving it's being broken up and you know breaking apart and i've seen videos of it they call it the fuzz yeah because it looks fuzzy they had cadavers by open up them the skin where you show the muscle and tissue if you go to the store you get one piece of beef and you know there's a fat part you kind of put inside there's that clear stuff that kind of when you stretch it kind of disappears it kind of opens up that clear tissue that's connective tissue bra and that stuff forms all over your body every single night it's like tartar on your teeth but it's like on your muscle tissues and if you don't stretch it gets thicker it builds and builds and builds i think that's why kobe beef they always massage a man that doesn't have that muscle that that tissue build up anyways have a good one you guys", "l54jsmQHaZc": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hey guys welcome again to our channel we are going to make Joanne homemade banana punch okay and the reason why I'm giving it that name is because we don't really have a Pacific title for it and we just utilize whatever we have at the time first of all the banana is all cut up small add to the blender I've got cinnamon powder nutmeg and also I pour some milk okay and it and I'm basically blend this all together alright and then I get mixing great so now that is all blend out I am just going to add some syrup okay in my bowl right here I will not be using any sugar whatsoever because banana is already a sweet fruits like I've said before in a previous video and syrup is also very sweet okay so all my banana that I've learned with the milk I know added into this bowl okay it's very easy and simple honestly we just came up with this idea and we just thought why not just try it and honestly it really really tastes good okay that is just some of the extra bits from the blender that I just pour in instead of adding water so this is looking absolutely perfect already now all I'm going to do is add some vanilla okay because all these milk is shake type of drinks or punch I like to add vanilla and my mixed spice as well in them okay so now I'm going to put in my mixed spice and I'm just going to mix that all around as well and all you need to do is just serve this with some ice really cool have a sip in the garden share with your neighbors and it is all refreshing the same and we try not to mix it too thick eyes okay cuz we hate it when it's really really thick please feel free to share this video and try leave your comment let me know how it goes thank you so much for watching you", "BDAYWMFM8yQ": "was popping was popping you to your boy [ __ ] Genesis back up in this

Big thanks to Bright Cellars\nfor sponsoring this video and for their continued support. So today, I'm going to be\ntesting a heat alleviator. I have heard that this\ndrink, Paldo's Banana Punch is supposed to alleviate\nheat, meaning spicy heat. So I'm going to be making\nup some spicy ramen and giving this a taste to\nsee if it is true or not. Theory goes that capsaicin\nwhich is the chemical ingredient that gives you that burning\nsensation, is fat soluble. So something like milk, ice cream, something that has a\nlittle bit of fat in it are supposed to act like\na solvent and kind of wash some of the capsaicin away. I don't see that there's any fat in this, so that doesn't really fit the theory. But I'm very curious to see\nnot only what this tastes like, but does it really work? I'm going to be testing this\nwith some instant ramen. I've never tasted this\ninstant ramen before. This is made by Nongshim, which is a great maker of Korean Ramyun. And this is the K-Army Stew. This is an instant\nversion of Budae Jjigae, which is army-based stew, which\nis made with ramen noodles and a bunch of different\ningredients put together in a pot, as shown on the picture. This probably will be mildly\nspicy, but to up the ante I'm going to be adding a bit of this. So Samyang Bulldog hot\nchicken flavor sauce. This is the sauce that is in\nthe famous Samyang noodles which I love. So I have my own personal Ramyun cooker. And I'm heating up\nabout two cups of water. So while my water is heating up, let's go ahead and give this a taste. This is Sun Shower Riesling, and a Riesling is a sweeter wine, with a little bit lower\nalcohol percentage, and it's supposed to go\nreally well with spicy food. Rieslings are also served\nat cooler temperatures. So that will also be handy when it comes to combating the heat. Alrighty, cheers. Mm. That's really nice. There's some sweetness to it,\nbut it's not overly sweet. I think this is gonna go\nreally nicely with the noodles. Okay, I can hear my water\ncoming up to the boil. Comes with a puck of\nbright yellow noodles. I'm gonna drop those in there. And two soup-based packets. I'm gonna add the vegetables. Ooh! Which also includes some beans. Isn't that great? So to this I'm gonna add some mushrooms. Chopped spam as well. It gives you a little\nhandy chart and it says if you want your noodles to be al dente, on the firmer side, just four minutes. Oh, I see some chili peppers in here. So this is gonna be a\nlittle bit spicy, I imagine. I'm gonna to add my soup base. Ooh, yep. I'm gonna drop an egg in here. Whoops. Not the shell, just the egg. (chuckles) 30 more seconds. Okay, that looks marvelous. I'm gonna add my kimchi to the top. Open cheese. Where's the seam? Here it is. Seam? Seam. Seam. Boop! Now I'm gonna add the\ngreen onions right on top. (upbeat music) Alrighty my lovelies. This smells amazing! \u266a Da da da da \u266a (Emmy laughs) This is the first time\nI've used my Ramyun pot and I love it. Perfect. I'm just gonna\neat right out of the pot. I'm gonna stir everything up. Get the cheese and the egg. Look at that. Doesn't that look awesome? I prefer having my egg a little bit runny. I like how it thickens the sauce a bit. Others prefer their egg more hard cooked. This is your instant noodles. Make it your own. Alrighty, here we go. Itadakimasu! (liquid slurping) Mm. That's tasty. Just mildly hot. Just a tiny little bit of spice, but the cheese makes it so nice and rich and the noodles I really like. They're nice and bouncy. There's a little bit of\nsmokiness from the spam. Mhmm. Mm. The green onions add some\nbrightness, some freshness. Let's try some kimchi. I love kimchi so much. It's got this great tangy,\nfunky, peppery, tangy, delicious flavor to it. Love kimchi. Oh, this is so good. And it's hot, so it's\nperfect for a cool day. Delicious. So if you don't like a lot\nof heat, this is perfect just the way it is. But we're here to test the banana punch and whether or not it\nrelieves any spiciness. So let's kick it up a notch by adding the Samyang Bulldog sauce. (light music) Ooh, I didn't try any mushrooms yet. Uh-huh. Alrighty. It definitely makes it taste more like the Samyang noodles in flavor. A little bit sweet, tiny bit of sesame. A little bit of garlic and some heat. Oh man, that's good. Mm. Let's add a little more. (Emmy vocalizes) Look, there's a reconstituted\nbean right there. Wow, I'm impressed how\nthat bean reconstituted. It's just like a, like a chili bean. Alrighty. Here's a piece of\nreconstituted ham, I think, that was included. No -- fish cake! Let's have a sip of wine\nand see how the Riesling goes with it. Mm, it's cooling. Slight sweetness of the\nRiesling really echoes some of the sweetness that's\ngoing on in the Ramyun. It's actually a great pairing. Alrighty. Now let's try the banana punch. Here we are. Hmm. It smells a little bit\nlike banana marshmallows. Hmm. Alrighty, let's give that a taste. Cheers. Ooh. It tastes like it, too. Wow. That is sweet. I'm not a hummingbird, (chuckles)\nbut this is what I imagine a hummingbird must feel like\nwhen it tastes sugar water in a hummingbird feeder,\nlike \"ah, it's fake, but kind of good.\" It's totally, artificially banana. It's thin with a little bit of viscosity. There's no fizz to it whatsoever. It's very sweet. And I think it is kind\nof alleviating the heat. I'm not convinced though. It might be simply because\nit's been some time since I've had something spicy,\nso let's eat some more spicy and then drink some and see what happens. Hmm. Alrighty. It's spicy again. Let's give it a go. Not as spicy. Does it go away? No. It's still there, but it\nkind of like tamps it down a little bit. Initially when you have the punch, it kind of feels like it stops the heat, but then immediately it comes right back. And I think it's because this is sweet and you've got the banana flavor going on. You're distracted. (laughs) But do I like it as a drink? Not so much. I mean, I think most of you\nknow that I'm not a huge fan of banana flavor, real or artificial and this is definitely\nartificial banana flavor. So you feel like, say like Laffy Taffy, you'll probably really like this. Let's see what it looks like in a glass. Ooh, tan color. I appreciate the fact\nthat there's no seemingly any artificial colorants to it, but, yeah. Not exactly my favorite. There you have it. Instant Ramyun noodles with banana punch. Banana punch does temporarily\nkind of sidetrack the heat but it does not eliminate\nthe heat whatsoever. It's still spicy, but\nI kind of enjoyed that because I like my heat. I like that pleasure\nthat comes with the heat. I don't know what it is, but I like it. Alrighty, so thanks so much for joining me and big thanks to Bright Cellars\nfor sponsoring this video.

"bZycGsl9mmY": "my name is trina i'm a medical cannabis patient i partake of cannabis on a regular basis for ptsd arthritis from both my knees and ankles social anxiety and a few other conditions you can learn more about if you're watching the previous shows on this channel this is a productive cannabis connoisseur a channel dedicated to medical cannabis patients and adults 18 and older so hello good evening if it's evening for you i decided to do a strain review on the strain i just got called banana punch i haven't tried it yet just got it so i'm going to read a review on it from wikileaf and then i'm going to give you my impressions on uh what i think about it and if wikileaf is on it with it so first i'm going to take a a smoke out of my bong here beautiful bong that i got as a gift from a really nice friend and if you want to see a video i did in tribute to that that nice friend who gave us this bong please feel free to check out that video it's a nice one you might like it and this is a nice one a free bong look at how beautiful this it's a work of art it's like what the [ __ ] you know it's beautiful it's a blessing so um let me find the banana punch i put it into a container um they usually um when you buy um cannabis from dispensary they usually come in these um in this kind of packaging and it tells you what it is tells you usually tells you the amount of thc that's in it but not always so but i don't need to know i can look it up you know if i want to so it's kind of when he's a little baggy so it's just a bigger baggy but sometimes little baggies depends on what they have available i usually put it put them all into a jar glass jar to keep it fresh and sometimes uh for a curing process to cure it make it stronger so let me show you what this banana punch looks like that we got and i have not tried it yet has a sweet smell to it so i'll show you what it looks like and it's a hydroponic cannabis so that's what hazy hazy tree farms and that's the name of the dispensary i ordered from you can check them out i'll put the link in the description below thanks to them i've been anxiety free pain free it's just been a blessing to find the this uh dispensary very kind and compassionate people this is compassionate prices and high quality cannabis is you can't do any better than that so here we go i'm going to put some in the bowl i think i'm going to grind some of it up in this little thingy i was calling the cartouche but i'm going to put it in here grind some of this up and smoke it smoke it in the bong i was going to roll a joint but i don't want to roll in a joint i might you know blow through a lot of it so i want to be able to make it stretch so i'm going to roll i'm going to just grind it and put it in the bottom so yeah i got some crumbs on the um on the tray on the rolling tray but it's from another strain and that's straight i'm gonna do a review on as well so get ready for that coming up after this video it's gonna be a strain on blackjack so i don't believe i reviewed livejack before i think i oh i'm spelling some of the herb i don't think i reviewed blackjack before but i think i may have tried it before though because it smells very familiar so and i've i've smoked a lot of strains well for me i've smoked a lot of strange i know people probably smoke more than me but um yeah let's do this let's put the herb inside the bowl if you want to know what the music is playing in the background my husband's playing his guitar and also there's uh this is three hours of relaxing music kind of deal on youtube i'll leave the link for the specific video that's planned it's a website that our youtube channel that has all kinds of music on it nice relaxing music so take the edge off the day or the evening cheers everyone thanks for joining me for today's strain review [Applause] oh that's beautiful i can't take a sense of banana in there i see what they're talking about i was skeptical skeptical skeptical yeah that's the right word i was skeptical about whether or not it was going to have a banana flavor to it because some of these strands will name it something and it doesn't taste the same as it's named so it's really good another puff [Applause] oh yeah that's a nice flavor i can kind of taste the banana on my tongue too so that's really nice i'm gonna put this to the side and read the review read what uh wikileaks has to say about banana punch let's move this over here i got my computer right here okay okay are you a lover of all things banana flavored if so consider spending some time with banana punch a powerful bud that's sure to fulfill all of your flavor fantasies the mysterious individuals at symbiotic genetics have done some amazing work by crossing banana og with purple punch resulting in an evenly balanced hybrid that's a great that's great for a variety of uses most nugs are a delight to look at but banana punch is quite pretty as each bud is an olive green shade that's freckled with purple undertones dark hairs and amber trichomes she tends to be on the stronger side with a thc potency of 26 percent yeah so it's advised that only more experienced users give her a go i just want to make an interjection there somebody recently put a comment actually today on one of my videos saying have you ever tried lore thc cannabis yes i have and i don't like it i feel like i feel like what's the point if it's not high in potency i don't need it because i have chronic pain and i have symptoms from ptsd where i can have anxiety attacks panic attacks so low thc means no makes no [ __ ] sense to me for me uh cbd that makes no sense for me and i've tried these so i can say with confidence that i know what i'm talking about for me personally that doesn't work i need a heavy heavy high thc count in my canvas that's all there is to it some people like that like a lower thc account and you know more sativa than indica or only sativa everybody has their balance of what they like and what works for their body and i'm doing this medicinally so it's not like i'm doing ooh which one's gonna taste good which one's gonna you know to me it's not about that so i have to make sure that i say that because some people assume that people that partake in cannabis on a regular basis are just party animals shiftless no good bums that do nothing and don't work all day okay so i had to clear that up all right next what was i at as you would have guessed the bud is rich in banana flavor and aroma that's not all that she offers banana punch features strong notes of pineapple and her sweetness is offset by a hint of spicy berry as well making her a well-rounded afternoon or evening treat i don't know about the berry and pineapple okay some strands are quite fast acting while others take a while to kick in banana punch is definitely on the latter end of the spectrum with most users stating that they have to wait quite some time before they feel anything at all i don't think so i i feel it already so and i've been smoking joints all day and i just you know had this puff of a banana punch and i'm feeling it it's delightful so okay banana punch often infuses users with happiness calm before transitioning into a heavily a heavy bodily experience okay i'm ready for that even if you're a seasoned smoker there's a good chance that you'll find the strain to be highly sedative yes i like that hungry hunger may strike towards the end of your experience so make sure snacks are within reach you know what this is kind of silly when they said my cheese thing because well not really because the sativa strains are the ones that give me the munchies that make me want to eat when i'm not hungry that's why i don't i don't like like a pure sativa strain all the time so i'm not saying i hate sativa i'm just saying i don't like because it doesn't work for me the way that i like it too you know and you can't make a strain work away work the way you want it to work you have to find one that works right for you for you so [Music] banana punch is a great is great for relaxing at the end of the long day but what if you need a bit of help when it comes to medical issues many claim that this strain is excellent in therapeutic applications helping to ease anxiety and depression for hours on end given this bud tends to be rather relaxing in nature you might want to explore how well she battles insomnia those who need to overcome a loss of appetite or treat instances of bodily aches and pains also describe banana punch as a true lifesaver if she couldn't be any more amazing homegrowers seeing the praises of banana punch noting that as long as you keep her warm and dry she's a chanch a cinch to tend to both indoor and outdoor environments are suitable and you may want to consider using screen of green methods to get the best results quick to flower in about seven to eight weeks this gal is said to produce a sizable harvest it's good to know if you aren't a fan of banana flavors then simply move along but if you can't get enough tropical fruit goodness in your life consider trying banana punch between her strong effects and sweetness she'll bring to you bring to your tongue there's no reason not to incorporate her into your daily routine be mindful of your tolerance and remember that it takes a while for this bud to really get going actually it doesn't i disagree with that but you know whatever i guess everybody is different but at first smoke first took i felt it i mean it depends i guess it depends on how sensitive you are to just in general to tastes and aromas and because some people said i can't with canvas when i smoke there was one person i was watching i can't remember who it was but they're saying that they can't really describe tastes and flavors and all that but they just are really into just the effects of the cannabis maybe there's some sensory thing going on with them where they can't really smell you know really smell the herb and it also could be that the herb is dry too um sometimes when it's dry or hasn't been cured then it doesn't have that rich you know terpe uh goodness smell to it so it's a very important uh process in harvesting the cannabis to actually cure the cannabis as well so that'll be a whole nother show i've done a show talking about that and when i used to grow on a um on a bigger level i don't grow anymore as of now but when i was growing on a consistent basis and i was getting really good results i've learned that so anyways that curing it is a good thing so they're saying the common usages is for depression loss of appetite anxiety insomnia and pain and then the typical effects is relaxed sleepy hungry happy and sedated so the highest testing for um for banana punch is 35 35 thc so that's pretty high up there who knows i might have that one but yeah this is a really nice strain let me just kind of click out of this uh yeah see it's a hybrid cell and hybrids are nice uh um it's feeling more it's feeling more indica than sativa but who knows but yeah i like it i like it a lot i'm gonna smoke the rest of this here and give you even more insight on what i feel about it without the review from wikileaks [Music] i don't know what they mean by the berry hints of berry flavor in there i might i might have to smoke more of it to really get the just just about what they're talking about so let's put a little more in there see if i have any the berry aromas i am feeling that relaxed happy and anxiety-free feeling so it's fitting the bill on that there are some strains that work more on wanting the other like some strains that are more of a mental thing than the bodily thing like for pain like chronic pain some strains don't do as good for that some work more on the on the mind mental and some do a balance of both it seems like this is doing a balance of both it's working on both the mind and the body for me so which it said it would yeah it's really nice it's relaxing me um i went for a walk today so it's really calming down my muscles um i've been going through menopause so uh it's helping with hot flashes i mean i'm just hot cold hot more hot than cold but yeah this is nice i like this oh yeah now when i cough i really taste the banana yeah oh yeah that's really good huh yeah i feel it in my head because my head right in here right where my third eye is at a lot of tension right in there and it feels like it's loosening up it feels really nice oh my god yeah what a difference a toke makes so yeah thanks for joining me today for the review on um banana banana kush banana punch i like it a lot 500 thumbs up it's like those hindu gods and goddesses with all those arms they would be holding each nug up this is really good very good strain if you can't find it and you are experiencing lots of anxiety and chronic pain banana punch for the win and uh if you're in the area in california and you'll know where this area is when you check out the website hazy tree farms they've got really good prices compassionate prices and quality cannabis really high quality and go on over there you can use the code trina in all caps if you buy anything from them and they're really cool about um deals and stuff if you purchase from them on a regular basis they'll kick down some deals i got a free pre-roll and last time i got a free eighth of tangy so i mean but you gotta go there and get get it while it's still there because they sell out really fast because their herb is really good i gotta unclog my bowl my bowl as well i said can you tell this that's how you can tell this herb's really good if it's so it's that sticky that's clogging your bowl of then again to be fair my bowl was already pretty kind of clogged already i thought it cleared it out though because i cleaned my bong just for this all right let me have a little bit more and then we'll end this video but yeah thanks for joining me if you want to

blessings to you all i'll see you soon and stay highly elevated", "LvjrT5jbbiI": "we thought you might like a recipe for a fruity punch that you can serve at any time but nice to have for special occasions this recipe has bananas as the base and we're actually going to just process them and then add other juices to it and the juices that we're using a pineapple mango apple orange juice and orange juice thank you and it's 500 ml of each now you can increase that of course and make it in a very large quantity but that's the quantities that we're working with today and so to process the the bananas we're going to put them into this jug and I'm just going to add a little bit of the juices just one of them so we've got a little moisture there might need a little bit more I think and just by using one of these stick mixers but you can use a food processor of course just processing what this does is to give a lovely creamy texture to the whole of the the fruit punch and you can actually freeze the bananas first and then you finish up almost with a bit of an ice cream that's interesting yes and you can really make some lovely textures and flavors and so if you could take this Jade take it away thank you and we're just going to pour that into our punch bowl so this is just the bananas with a little of the fruit juice there's something about bananas most people like them do your family like bananas my family loves bananas but my husband doesn't like them so what can I use it's a pretty punch if he doesn't like bananas okay well you can use other fruits you can use mango you can use any other fruit yeah you won't get quite the creaminess because most of the other fruit doesn't have the starch content at a banana die which gives that that lovely creaminess however it would still be nice so you can use any other fruit thank you and if you freeze the fruit first and then pull it out of the freezer just put it on a tray just in pieces pull it out of the freezer and just wait until you can just indent the fruit with a fork so that it's not frozen hard okay so not quite freezing oh it's just starting to defrost a little yes and with a little bit of the juice just like I did that will give you a creamier texture initially if it sits there for an hour well then you will lose that but initially you will get a creamier texture because of the fruit that is frozen okay that's good idea so this should be a nice um drink it's a lovely drink and now comes the really difficult part and that is just putting all the juices in and this is mango and apple and pineapple and our good favorite orange juice I did bring a whisk but I I can probably use this little machine again can't I you can actually do this with a hand whisk so don't feel you need to use your little machine but we will do that today all right now ideally you would leave that for around 30 minutes and you can leave it longer if you like pop it in the fridge so that it stays nice and cool and then you would add a little bit of ginger ale and we've used the low jewel and also a little bit of mineral water and when I say a little bit it's a cup of each however today we're just going to put that in here now we'll just give that a stir so that there's a slight fizziness yes Thank You Jade and that's our fruit punch I hope you enjoy it [Music] you [Music]", "5Z7AwG5w3cs": "hi guys tiffany here from lake light state of mind and welcome to another edition of Thirsty Thursday I am so excited you guys are here with me right now because you are coming on vacation with me and drinking a vacation mode cocktail why do I say that because I should be on vacation right now we should be on a Royal Caribbean cruise in the Caribbean going to Puerto Rico st. Kent the special island that Royal Caribbean has in the Bahamas somewhere and instead obviously that was canceled so we are home and to trick myself into thinking I'm on vacation I decided that for today's cocktail I was going to make a rum punch specifically a banana coconut rum punch because nothing screams Caribbean to me more than some sort of rum punch and if I was on vacation I can pretty much guarantee you that I'd be sitting by the pool or by the beach right now enjoying some sort of rum punch that the cruise created or the bar by the beach it's just something that's kind of you got to do it while you're in the Caribbean so you're coming on vacation with me and we are making banana coconut rum punch I'm making it for one super super easy for you to take the same cocktail and make it firm or you can make it for a party have it in a pitcher you can have it for a group of 10 once you know the measurements it's very easy to just switch them up to make larger batches or smaller batches so I will tell you how to do that once we get to pouring just wanted to let you guys know too that in addition to all of these videos that I make on a weekly basis I do write all of these recipes up and house them on my website lake life state of mind calm under the drink section so all of these Thirsty Thursday cocktails are in one place for you to look at and just get the recipes I also give other tips i link different products that I use that have worked well for me so if at all you ever come to something and it doesn't make sense this is also in writing so feel free to go to Lake place FINA my calm and check out all that I've written about these wonderful drinks that I've been making since I think March now so yeah we've been drinking for a long time and it's been amazing so anyway we're gonna get to this easy rum punch banana coconut rum punch so what makes it banana is we're using a banana rum this is Cruzan I love this brand they have all different flavor rums we've used them enjoy it a lot there are plenty of other companies that do different flavored rums and so this just literally what I had on hand so that's what we're using today so banana rum we're going with Malibu coconut rum Malibu's my favorite for coconut rum you can actually get a coconut crus and rum if you wanted to as well though so there's different companies that make them but it's important thing is banana rum and coconut from these are your two liquors that we're adding in our rum punch we're also adding some pineapple juice a little splash of grenadine honestly if you wanted to leave this out you could but I just like the layering effect that it makes on the drink it's just super pretty and of course I always like to have some sort of garnish so we're using again my jumbo maraschino cherries again optional but something that I just think takes your drink to the next level so if you want to use it if not it's okay alright so simple enough those are your ingredients the ones that you have to have banana rum coconut rum pineapple juice a little splash of grenadine okay so we're gonna get to corn in here super easy I've got a shaker with some ice inside of it I also have my cup with ice waiting so we're gonna strain our drink so we're not going to pour this ice into the cup we're gonna pour it over fresh ice if you're doing this for a party and you're making it in a big pitcher when you just have ice like a little bucket of ice next to it and people can put the ice in you'll do all the stirring and everything ahead of time so you won't have to worry about getting a shaker out but because you're just making it for one it's fine so here we go we're gonna start with the banana rum now the banana is the flavor that's going to actually come out the most in this drink in terms of the alcohol so we're gonna do two ounces of this or a quarter of a cup of the banana rum and we're gonna do a little bit less than the coconut so this is a 1 ounce pour I'm going to do 2 of these in here of mini in a row so we've got one and we've got two and then we're just gonna do half of that for the coconut rum so we're gonna do one ounce of the coconut so grabbing my Malibu we're going to take 1 ounce of that and there we go putting that inside so both of our alcohols are in if you wanted to make this a bigger amount instead of an ounce you can use the cup instead of two ounces you could use two cups you can use four cups of this you can do two cups of this you can do eight cups of it you can do four cups of this so the math see where I'm going it's two parts of this one part of this so 10 cups five cups make sense half of whatever the number is all right now that I've got your brain all going with math let's get back to the cocktail so we're gonna do pineapple juice for this we're going to use four ounces or half a cup but because I have my pour out instead of getting a half cup instead of getting a half cup measurement I'm just going to four of these and one more of pineapple juice and that's it we're not gonna put the grenadine in yet so that's why I said if you wanted to leave the grenadine out you absolutely can we're just gonna do that right at the end we're gonna give this the shape okay got our glass here and we are going to just take the side of the shaker and I'm going to strain it it wants to be temperamental today a lot of condensation so I can't get a good grip let me see here Wow there we go alright so we've got this undone and we're going to strain it into the top here and let's see looking good nice and yellow for the pineapple juice making a mess as I always do you guys wouldn't expect anything different would you if I didn't at least make some mess and have to go for the paper towel ensuring my cocktail time alright perfect so we've got our drink and this is delicious just like this so you're perfectly fine if you want to stop right here and drink it and call it a day but we're gonna add that little splash of grenadine right at the bottom because I love love love how it looks it's gonna just sit nice and pretty at the bottom so I'm gonna put close to the side of the glass when you put it to the side of the glass you could also use a spoon it just makes it layer and of course it in a little bit slower which makes the whole process a lot easier and makes it look nicer so notice how it layers just perfectly on the bottom it kind of looks like a tequila sunrise in a sense and I already have on my fun little pineapple sphere some of those jumbo maraschino cherries and there is your cocktail my friend this banana coconut rum punch is phenomenal I'm gonna take a sip because I have to taste test breathe as a horse mmm definitely taste the banana like I said you will definitely taste banana pineapple next coconuts just a little bit of a hint in the background if you wanted to add more and do 2 ounces also of coconut and 2 ounces of banana feel free to do that but so so good such a good combination of flavors definitely speak summer definitely speaks vacation that I'm not on right now but you guys will love this one so easy great for a party again you're just doing two parts of the banana rum to one part of your coconut rum so if it's again 10 cups of your banana then you would do 5 cups of your coconut can't talk can't think look one sip and I can't even talk anymore more details about how to do all the math for that in my blog post if you're interested but until then cheers happy Thursday to you guys hopefully you guys are enjoying your summer if you are on any vacation let me know so I can live vicariously through you and make sure to have some sort of rum punch if you're in the Caribbean or you find your way out there this summer thanks guys have a great day and we'll be back or I'll be back to see you next Thursday have a great day you", "yOgw_8c5Asg": "[Music] welcome back guys through the greens channel today I'm going to share a simple Jamaican

welcome back to the channel welcome back to fortnite and another rare quest type video this is similar to the punch cards from the previous season and the challenges that we can usually complete this particular one we're talking about consuming bananas there are five stages to complete the first stage is collecting uh or consuming 10 bananas 25 for the second stage 50 for the third 100 for the fourth and 250 for your fifth and final stage 15 000 xp available on each stage that is complete and we have a whopping 75 000 xp available completing them all this will take you a little bit longer than the apples one i posted a few days ago but let's jump in to the favorite location of mine to complete this particular quest and that is west of coral castle there is a kind of hilly area where the oyster shell and some palm trees are around beneath those palm trees you'll be able to find bananas that spawn in each game it can range between as low as five around these trees um but all the way up to around 20 for a collection of them so up on the top of the hill i usually get between 8 and 15 and then further down the hill slightly before you get to coral castle and looking over coral castle you'll be able to find another spawn of them around those palm trees as well and usually 8 to 15 on those as well so you could get up to probably about 30 maximum in a game just from this location alone so it's going to take you a few games to complete this but it's my favorite location to try and complete this rare quest as i said five stages 75 000 xps well worth doing another location just to just to jump in there and give you another one is catty corner so with the fruit and vegetable boxes and the spawn rates of bananas do come in these fruit and vegetable boxes and you're likely to get a few from that location so if that part of the map is a place that you like land in uh for most games this could be another location to do it remember to consume them you have to have some damage done to your health itself so that could be jumping from a building and to get some full damage or you could do this in a storm obviously coral castle is rarely in the first phase of the storm so it's quite easy to do in the storm and consuming all those bananas if you pick them up so they're my locations they're my tips and tricks for consuming bananas in the rare quest for

respect my region.com here today with a quick west coast week 2 review featuring alpine vapor and their gmo times bp9 hybrid live resin cannabis oil it's a vape cartridge it's a one gram 1000 milligram vape cartridge and my oh my i'm excited to try this i vape live resin every day i dab live resin about every other day and this is a limited edition run um from from alpine one of california's premier cannabis uh extraction companies and so i'm going to read a little bit about the packaging and kind of share some information i've got a battery here um we're going to dive right in so it says here our limited edition cartridges are craft candidates at its finest they're made using only pure live resin from sun grown cannabis these small batch releases are true to the natural aroma of the plant and are an exploration and taste outside the norm instructions you our cartridges are designed for use with 510 batteries inhale for two to four seconds for maximum flavor use at the lowest voltage setting on your alpine bakery now unfortunately on a previous review video i did use the battery at the lowest setting and it wasn't powerful enough to really really give the car what i would consider as the best representation of itself so i'm going to honestly move it up one twist on the voltage here for the battery so that way i can get slightly slightly warmer than the lowest temperature to make this really rip in terms of the gmo times the bp9 i do have a little bit of information it says gmo times banana punch number nine a true hybrid cut with cannabis cup lineage of purple punch banana og and gmo so this is going to be punchy og and gmo it says this cultivator yeah this cultivator is a great blend of sweet and sour with undertones of gas tropical fruit and curried spice that's a big claim so we're gonna see if i get that earthy spicy punchiness here we go how do i wanna i don't really wanna i don't really want to open it up from the top and ruin that beautiful stickers oh came right out there we go check it out all right so we've got we've got some terps in the jar here and the two i like it when it comes to the cartridge we've got a white ceramic and glass cart i love it we've got some nice chunky holes on the bottom right here that's where that pull is going to come through and be kind of sucking in the oil for lack of a better way to put it 510 thread brand new battery here literally brand new not even using the one that i used the other day this one is quite literally unopened all right beautiful packaging nice chunky battery here all right so one two three four five hits to turn it on branded it's on the lowest setting now i'll rip it just to show them that i just don't believe this battery is the right one at the lowest setting for this cartridge so i'm gonna do it it's not on too tight but it is sealed here we go chris you ready moment of truth absolutely nothing yet one two three four five try it again all right that's a five second rip right there kind of light in terms of the vapor and the flavor although it was there i didn't actually get enough of an inhale to really taste that much terps and so i'm going to go a seven second rip again on the lowest temperature try to give it another chance at 2.6 volts here we go all right so on that one a little bit more turks a little bit bigger cloud and what i'm really tasting is this light floral spice i'm getting a little bit of pine and a little bit of berry flavor the fact that i can get some actual good flavor on this lowest setting without a major cloud i think it's impressive um i am going to twist this over to let's call it one line two lines we're gonna go up to three volts here and we're going to see what that does maybe it maybe it burns it maybe it doesn't here we go it's definitely a different flavor and taste experience in terms of how it ends up in your mouth i feel like at a slightly higher temperature it gets a little bit more on the earthy spicy side comparatively to the light and floral so we've done three hits here i talked about that on the first hit you i gave it a second chance with the seven second uh blinker right there and then on this last one we turn it up to three volts three hits let's see what i'm thinking here for a score out of ten presentation appeal color taste potency i think this is really coming through and hitting nice um what i what i'd really like to see is some of the genetics information that's on you know the piece of paper need to make it on this i want to see the terpene profile i want to see some of that strain lineage and information it helps the consumer know what kind of high we're about to experience um in this box the presentation is very attractive i like i like the sticker i like the label i like the black and the shiny metallic i'm really attracted to this the color of the oil looks great um is this the best battery for this cartridge i don't believe so um the big my least favorite thing is the battery it doesn't match i don't think it powers this vape cartridge the right way um i've had better experiences with c cells classic just draw and pull on it um and so all things considered um would i recommend it yes more information there's solid information on here i'd like to know more about the genetics and the lineage and the terps um but with all that said i'm sitting here thinking this is an 8.75 it's a very solid high score i definitely believe that this is 100 sun grown flower cannabis you know pure live resin there's no distillate there's no popcorny experience to this no taste no that kind of flavor um but yeah the battery in my opinion is just really holding this experience back and so um we'll use this we'll use this battery again for the next review and i'm going to bring another battery on again to see if i get a better or different experience but for now let me know what you guys think 8.75 is my score big thank you to alpine vapor for working with this on the respect my region west coast we tour and don't forget to subscribe to our youtube channel y'all i'll see you all down the road appreciate you guys peace",

favorite each day stay tuned to find out how you could win a cannabis 101 podcast prize pack all right chris here we are the end of the line the final cultivar of our 12 cultivars of christmas you did 12. i'm about to give my 12th and then somebody is gonna well many people have already submitted uh they're gonna be sending in their list if you can get all 12 all of chris's all of mine you'll go in the mix for a wonderful prize package that we have you're going to absolutely love this prize package that we have going and i think everybody's gonna love uh this cultivar that i'm wrapping up with it's banana punch and it's in the shatter form uh that i just grabbed uh from stigma cannabis uh so uh a nice friend in high places to help me out with uh some some shatter before it gets out into the market and i like this the first of all the strain is a 50 50 hybrid so right down the line good for that uh the batch that i have has 90 points 96.7 cannabinoids 829.24 thc megagrams per gram so craig chris we've we've tried to figure this out in the past of of the packaging uh that would be around the 82.9 thc would that be for 829.24 yep that's correct dean for sure man uh when you see the milligram per gram uh you're just going to move that decimal point over and that will give you the percentage perfect math live is not always the best thing but we managed to get through that so the lineage behind this is banana og and purple punch and uh first off uh banana punch uh is uh it's a it's a heavy hitter and then you throw it into shatter and man it is indeed a fun ride um but it's not a ride you should take a loan for the first time make sure if you're dabbing or using concentrates for the first time you're with somebody else because they are so much more potent now this one was created by symbiotic genetics and uh the name does not lie with banana flavors i i find it also has a ton of tropical fruit taste with it whether it's you know you go you go on those resorts and you get kind of those mixed fruit baskets together in your room or something like that and all the flavors so it's got a tropical fruit flavor for me and this cultivar we've talked a lot about different things helping different people this one has been helping people with chronic stress anxiety irritable bowel syndrome insomnia and appetite loss and you know a lot of those things can be just they could just wear a person down and if you can get some relief with some cannabis that's awesome so i can tell you this one did give me the munchies i had some shatter while actually doing this list and uh went to get a snack in the middle of it i literally had to stop what i was doing because i was like all right i'm going to get my snack so it definitely did give me the munchies the banana og is from ghost og which means og kush uh goodness in there the purple punch also has some og kush and some sour diesel which brings in so many defining cultivars from chemdawg to super skunk to afghanistan northern lights granddaddy purple i know that's a big favorite one of yours uh and now as for the shatter uh this came in perfectly it looked exactly like what shatter is supposed to look like it uh it actually i got something right in this thing right now i just remembered but uh in the slash so you know shatter should come and it should look in my opinion like shards of glass this one had like the the swiss cheese holes in it it just looked awesome it made it easy to load even though this has a built-in loader and you fire it up between 315 to 430 degrees for this thing it's got a uh the red is what you want to go with the the two click auto load and according to stigma grow it's a 315 to 430 and you're going to be into for some fun and and like i said this is the perfect way to get into dabbing so i don't know banana punch is beautiful i know uh shatter and some of these other concentrates are really really coming onto the market so i'm i'm i'm excited about some more shatter to hit the market and while you talk about that i'm gonna fire this one up so you you could talk about shadow while i hit this yeah dean uh so i mean to market right now we have seen uh you know fireside's got some shatter we've got uh other concentrates too um there's some uh resins and rosins that we've got uh um i haven't seen this this banana punch yet uh so uh i'm a little jealous that you uh managed to get your hands on some uh some early early bird banana punch um have you haven't even tried that cultivar before either sounds delicious the genetic makeup of it is uh uh that's something i'm a fan of uh as you mentioned anything with uh granddaddy perps uh you have my attention so uh it's uh so this is what the uh shatter as i uh pull it out i'll try to put it up to the screen um i think that looks uh just gorgeous it's you know it's translucent uh it's got good color to it yeah and like i said the uh the flavor is just uh simply oh and i have it out i might as well load it and take another hit right like it's only so i i would offer you one if we if we if we could but i'm sure you have something uh ready to go as we wrap up this 12 cultivars of christmas so this is banana punch the shatter from stigma grow and this is my last cultivar chris thank you so much for once again being a part of this and doubling your workload this year the check will be in

"this week on project nerdy we are talking about our favorite drinks be an alcoholic or nonalcoholic I personally don't drink I've never had a drop of alcohol in my life so the alcoholic drink thing is not really a topic I'm really well done first and to explore in a video here on project nerdy but there is one drink non-alcoholic I do make so I'll know when I focus video on that it's actually a recipe I got for my mom she got from somebody else not sure where originated from they always love this drink when she made it so when I got a job and moved out several years ago I asked her the rush new job of copy so everyone's well at least a couple times a year I make this recipe so here is a recipe for banana punch which first opened I need the name banana pudding because the drink does it have a very strong banana taste to it so I think it can be a better name but that's the name that comes with a recipe so here we go let's go first their ingredients you know say I'll put this recipe in the description box below so don't feel like you know don't worry about missing something when I'm doing my description you know check out the written recipe and low so the ingredients are three cups of water two cups of sugar three rock bananas 146 ounce can of pineapple juice one 12-ounce can of frozen orange juice 16 help can sorry 16 ounce can eliminate diluted in three corpse of ginger ale and here is the step-by-step instructions dissolve water sugar mashed bananas and add pineapple juice orange juice and lemonade combine all ingredients and pour into Ziploc bags and fries take off the freezer in one hour before serving break into small chunks place in a punch bowl add ginger ale that's a very simple recipe but is the most licious punch in the world it makes the rope and just delicious it's hard to explain it's one of those once I make it I have it first you know week or two and I most drinking it kind of slushy style that's awesome it's one of the things if I almost wish I had all the time but I'm not the person that's the most effort to pairing things so it's it's hard to move my voting myself even to make something as simple as this but I do at least a couple times a year so that's my recipes banana punch I hope if you trying to enjoy it a lot my nerdy pleasure this week is actually upcoming has it happened yet that's fixin to divergent is fixing to come out the

kind and you have some left over don't chew it in the bin this is a recipe for you all right so basically i'm gonna show you this is my part look what i think you say tick all right so that's i'm using a tablespoon that's two tablespoon i mean three tablespoon so we're going to make a green banana porridge punch all right leftover pie juice a leftover pirate disguise honestly all right nice one so roughly you want a boat about quarter a cup after of your blender which i'm not using at the moment to make this punch because this is the banana purge left over so what i'm going to do i'm going to add some irish mush to it nice one and also we're going to add some vanilla this is the jamaican vanilla we've got some chisel seed that add a little bit of this to it got a chisel seed really good for us espresso i mean yeah build up your indium system rough about a teaspoon we got some pumpkin seed we're going to put a tablespoon of pumpkin seed in it nice one ah so we got some this is some sunflower seed very good feel nice one not all of that we're gonna put a little bit of uh what's in it and i mean i'll put some raw what's in it i remember i know i've got about two teaspoons of oats in it all right let's put a little bit more off there yeah inside of it that's the um irish mush salaf um to be honest bubba said the purge already of all the spices and everything the ingredients will be in the description box so you don't need to add any more spice to it i them think that you know if you have guinness you could add a guinness to it why don't i have any killers and i mean i'm not a hardcore person still all right well yeah i hit listen let's blend it up i'll make you guys can see exactly one it's gonna be a little bit nice but i'll say things set remember everything united already sweet we got condensed milk we got everything in it already so you just want some at the purge just leave a little bit apart left over and this way [Music] [Music] so what a nice one let's give it a ship so [Music] nice one all right so what i'm going to do is just take a simple look at it all right now i have some [Music] peanut butter to it all right that's the peanut butter if you have raw peanuts you can use it let's blend it again so [Music] nice and lovely guys so that's exactly what miata bought so basically as i said before in my video i want to make it clear if you make some jamaican banana porridge i make some peanut porridge how you make some green plantain parrot you can do this at work if you don't have that ingredients you still can't make it blend up some ingredients to get up and make an energy drink we're looking for all right this one is a magic drink all right now we're going to help let's serve it up and hopefully you guys definitely can see exactly what we have about another kitchen honestly guys i like to a lot a lot of people keep asking me for different kind of recipe and i said to myself saying our i'm just gonna definitely give another recipe what am i looking for but i know the reason why they might ask for the recipe god i know chef ricardo always gives certain kind of recipe which is the bomb recipe no as i said this is the king at night then what kind of drink yeah you have to be you know i mean just don't drink it unnecessary because you want to drink it this is to build up your immune system boots up your body and i don't think that look for the energy where i look for eating at this right there all right guys you can just drink this in at any time you feel like i said okay now doesn't run at me i'm going to drink this one let's drink guinness uh you know yeah look at it it's no matter what that exactly chef recorder but let's taste it oh my god that's exactly what i'm talking about you can taste you know what you can taste the peanuts you can tears you can taste the spices then you can taste the vanilla flavor everything here tastes like they can tease the irish mush and add everything there yeah but the best way to serve this kind of drink is not anywhere you got some ice it's good to serve with some ice and get the coolest outfit all right so what may i say guys don't get this thing wrong if you're at home and you make some porridge please i left back at least a cup of it and just blend it up with other ingredients or chocolate gummies in it and i don't think and get what you're looking for that that's got what's going to be wrong i mean the magic power but as i said this is another normal drink guys honestly this is a drink what you're looking for from chef recorder all right here it is let's pour it out cheers so that tick yeah that matter but look at that that is not a normal drink from chef ricardo when i said i'm going to give you something differently i always tell you i

banana punch to the left to the right baboon cookies mmz", "4AQKVpVJ-9I": "[Music] hi guys welcome back to another video from Sandra's yard style cooking okay so today I'll be doing some Jamaican strong back okay this drink has many name it is known as strong back it is known as Guinness punch are peanut blend up as well as Magnum and there are so many other names okay but I'm gonna be calling it dangerous strongman because anybody will have my drink can tell you there is no other like it okay so when you are doing this drink there is four five main ingredients all right that they normally use but I like to add it most of the men so it's with a twist so the four main ingredients for this drink you will normally use Ginny's oats stop again milk as well as speed not four five alright so if you're a person if you do not drink alcohol or anything you can substitute the guineas for Martha so you use the motor instead of the guineas all right with my no I normally use add to manganese and you can use half of the guineas a lot of the user or container because it will tend to be a little bit liquid and you don't want that all right but because based on your monitor me using I'll be using the whole bottle as well as one drug installed Spitfire alright and I'm not just using a regular drug and sold I am using a Spitfire as well as one container of Irish mush I'll be using some vanilla flavoring as well as some nutmeg powder as well as running some cinnamon flavor abusing two ripe bananas as well as the good old fashioned really wet Rock alright so I normally go ahead and start soaking my boots but you don't have to soak it you can just go ahead and bring it just like that alright wanton milk remember the guineas the soap kujan as well as the peanut and a pinch of salt forties okay so I'm going to go ahead cut my bananas up and then I will show you once I start blending okay it's ahead and add a Cocteau and this is raw peanut okay so I went ahead and had after the blender so in order for me to get this refine I don't need to have some liquid you could have a little bit of water maybe a quarter cup of water but based on the fact that I have all this liquid already I'm going to use half of the guineas and this is just for society okay so gonna blend that you okay with that alright so no I'm going in with the Irish Marsh I'm gonna you why it's wrong so that should be good please give it a little bit off okay I'm going in back again with a little bit more fun Ibaka's are not chasing that so at 1 teaspoon see not tasting salt so I'm adding a little bit more salt sweet so that's ok as well as a little bit more so that's 1 teaspoon 1/2 teaspoon sisters I've already had one in there of the cinnamon extra ok so I'm gonna mix our own finish this up once that is done oh let me add some nutmeg to eat and that should be good I'm gonna mix this around once this is finished then I will be showing it to you ok so there you have it guys my delicious strong back okay Joe meek and strong okay so I'm just gonna go ahead and pour something you guys can see the consistency and what you could do you could add a few cubes of ice to your ease I didn't add any to man because I'm not going to drink it right away I'm going to allow it to chill okay so I'm going to be adding some freshly grated nutmeg to this just a little also a little chilly toothbrush peanut you know we just have to fix up the team right and then what is up to destroy these are not a fancy straw add two straws series alright then the next thing you're going to do you're gonna turn on some nice Jamaican culture music in your background sip listen to your music and enjoy what more could a person once okay so I hope you did enjoyed today's video and if you did please remember to go ahead like share and also comment and subscribe and tell a friend to tell another friend and invite them to come on over to send Jeezy art style cooking alright so let me just clear up a few things so remember I said if you do not drink alcohol you can always substitute the guineas the stalled as well as the ROM for you can use matzah okay for it if you are lactose intolerant you don't have to use the milk you can use some coconut milk as well as almond milk to eat or maybe you don't have to use the coconut milk you can just substitute it with soya milk okay alright so that's that for that until I come away again with something delicious from my kitchen to yours sit back enjoy chill and drink off your strong buck and take here okay you", "wmZ0_mE9QxU": "there's like

this one all them smoothie please gonna be put out of business this year is the extreme peanut punch from Caribbean pop calm let's start off with a couple cups of milk and my magic bullet you're going

got some ice cream in some vanilla ice cream a couple heaping scoops of vanilla ice cream get that all in there and this is not your typical traditional peanut punch this is going to see a lot of elements of a shake basically I've got some good and this is just like your pretty much everyday chocolate but this is a milk chocolate I want to get six pieces six of these squares in there just going to give that a quick break and that is how we're going to sweeten this traditional on peanut Punch won't have chocolate and it will be sweetened by condensed milk and lastly a ripe banana this is a small banana just going to peel it all I want to do is pretty much chop it into a food processor whether my key is the magic bullet and hey that's it what I forgot to mention guys will make sure the milk is nice and cold because we didn't put any ice in there this is meant to be a cold drink so all we going to do pretty much buzz that up until you get nice and smooth and you're all done and that's it guys able to shake took about a minute and a half because you really want to break down that chocolate if you want you can certainly chopped up chocolate before you add it to the the blender

"[Music] the recent and somewhat tragic demise of our local punch and juice company has created a moment that other manufacturers are trying to cash in on but don't fall into the trap once more of subjecting yourself to substandard punch there's no debate really the best punch you will ever drink is the punch that you make for yourself and that's because you could have it exactly the way you like it and i really have to shout out karen for giving me the idea to do this video because it really didn't dawn on me to do it so big up to karen and there's no one set way to make punch i myself no longer possess the type of constitution to manage these amazing milk-based beverages back in my youthful days i would pull up by tentacity and call along a peanut c moss and fake blend from harry's but these days i would only venture to drink a punch in the comfort of my own home if you know what i mean today we're making tree punches peanuts and guinness fig and a dairy-free sauce up coconut punch and using spices up there too like cinnamon nutmeg and tonka bean first in the lineup we're doing a peanut and guinness cutie junior gum [Music] blender starting off with some ice didn't want to add the milk sweeten any punch with some condensed milk which will also make the punch thicker and smoother add another 2 3 cups of peanut butter half teaspoon of vanilla essence and about half of our guinness a few dashes of bitters i want to cover and blend until smooth now people would add oats and wheat germ etc to their peanut bunch but i actually prefer a smooth peanut punch rather than one with a lot of textures happening but that's just my personal preference feel free to add oats or anything else that you want to finish this we topping it off with some granola and some wheat germ and freshly grated cinnamon and there's a well balanced peanut and guinness sponge you get this smooth creaminess from the peanut butter and the condensed milk and the vanilla the bitters and the cinnamon add in more complexity to the drink and that food are tames the bold flavors of the guinness so it's real nice next up is a fake punch and starting with ice again then your milk and add in a touch of vanilla essence and a dash of bitters now going in with some freshly grated nutmeg i find nutmeg pairs well with bananas that's add great flavor add in some granola and some wheat germ to this one because i don't mind texture as in a fake bunch i find a thick bunch you know just be nice with little textures in it and for a fake punch you definitely want to use overripe bananas they tend to be sweeter so you could use a less additional sweetener in 90 drink and i didn't get any overripe ones here but i bought the ripest ones that i could find you want to blend until smooth and boom big punch done finish it off with a light dust in a freshly grated nutmeg and a sprinkling of granola and wheat germ and it's a fairly straightforward fig punch but really delicious and the additionally nutmeg really takes it to another level and last but not least and definitely my favorite is the sauce up the sauce up really is one of my favorite fruits if not my favorite fruit and i ain't feeling to share this one so i'm making it dairy-free more for meaner first thing is prepperly sauce up you want to peel it or cut it open and remove the flesh from the skin and have no dainty way to deal with a soursop when i add a bit of water with a pulp and using a clean hands work the flesh into the liquid and make a sap we're trying to extract as much flavor from the fruit and not waste it so what's up not easy to come by these days and you want to use a strain on a spatula squeeze and press the sap to the strainer to get a smooth pulp and instead of using dairy i'm making a coconut cream starting off with two tablespoons of white sugar because i'm not using any condensed milk for this i'm gonna add a packet of coconut powder and about a quarter cup of hot water combine well and the spice are going in with here to incorporate in this one is tonka bean and this will take the place of the vanilla essence as well i'm not adding any bitters because i don't want to disguise the taste on this one as i say i really love sauce up and i want as much of that flavor coming through the cream wasn't thick enough so i added another pack of coconut milk mix well when i add some ice to our blender add the coconut cream then add the sauce up and i want to blend that until smooth and i realized just how much i prefer this one because the easy one that gets poured into the mason jar hashtag hipster i tap on this with a little granola and i'll be gym and boom that is it dairy-free sour sap and coconut punch so these are three basic punches that they could make the wheel is your oyster at this point have your punch just the way you like it if you like this video please give it a thumbs up and a share and if you're not subscribed to the channel please take a moment to do so

the to the room now to be veg dope for him for weeks and then be flipped and then we got a bit of the lemon and then Daisy all this them seeds what I add the new flavours what will be running for 2020 got the purple punch there for the back there's a whorehouse so we'll be partying I was probably like around today you know it's getting them in the bigger pot Strider why because she should pull understanding the big parts raided or us I think that's what I'll be doing this afternoon now the part I just wanted to keep them in a Haiti propagator because this was easy this is the electric one just to make sure the ground speed it up and down to go pretty quick anyway we had free of the free of the other purple punch the normal ones feminised those all popped out CAI and then we got the dass ER das stock popped out Chi Chi square a that popped our Chi rookies his block use and then we got the Tropicana banana we're weigh-in still for the one tropical pinkish still to pop that one pops but I better look anywhere the tails out on the Tropicana banana in the pink course I had to look for that seed and I can't even find where that one's gone now so I didn't want to mess too much you guys have had you down a bit so much but the pink posh if you can remember when we put these in tissue for 24 hours and on the last video he was a bit cracked the seed guy seemed was I don't know if it's gonna it's not like 100% guaranteed to to pop really I wonder side but hopefully he does I mean when when I got it out Leticia pie but I did see like a little bits of what it's inside swelling up and I thought I just went even see how it goes like see if you see did come if it did come through but I'll give it a week just in case it sir a bit shocked and its a bit slower' summer it's not the kind of banana that should be fair today or tomorrow he's got the little tile out it's just some reason he just never took off like the rest of them but yeah anyway so that's me and bedroom we'll be looking for some new phenotypes out of these we'll just run the purple punch authorized get them finished quick in the next eight nine weeks then we got out of these ones then we'll be picking a

I've got text on quarters off the ones what I put in what keep him off or out if he because I have had it for years he's a fire strain still it's a good one for crossing with the other ones as well because a good solid plans across with its across that one be the change I said a few years back and it was fire I know I'm asking one of them seeds was one of them what got mixed in she did the leaves up a bit thinner so yeah that's the affair German that's keeping you all to die peeps and yeah man so peace out and I'll keep you posted I'll have some strain rate is coming this month on the

notifications all that happy crap for that stuff all right let's start off with our banana hammock r1 at 14 um banana hammock is a cross between grape god and mandarin sunset we got one little bud left to this this was a nice decent sized bud i've been picking at it a little bit this is an indica and even at 14 for me this did the trick it put me to sleep the flavors on it wasn't bad uh it has a little banana flavor but it's more like a banana peel it's a little drier than a normal like banana taste but still not bad i would definitely get this again like i said even at 14 it doesn't the trick for me so i slept good on every night i smoked that so if you're looking for a good indica give that one a try we also got the banana punch which is supposed to be an indica it's a cross between the banana og which we had from liberty it's one of the reasons i got this and so it's banana og and purple punch and we've had purple punch remove and banana og from liberty so we had both apparent strains the flavors on this are supposed to be a hazy berry um pineapple and banana i get like a berry but to me it's more like a cherry like a dry cherry and then i guess maybe some of that banana or pineapple in there but to me that doesn't mix it's almost like there's some kind of rotten fruit in there or something i don't know i wasn't thrilled with the taste of it it's not super terrible but just not something i like plus it did not work as an indica even coming in this one was 20 focus yeah 20. that one was 14.8 and this was 20.8 so 6 percent higher um and a lot weaker in my opinion the banana hammock i get through about half a joint and i'm yawning already um so the kick in time is pretty good on this this one was supposed to be a creeper um i didn't really notice it creeping up on me either i got you know high from the get-go and that was pretty much about it um so like i said a little disappointed in the banana punch i probably would not get that one again um you know the effects wasn't there the flavor wasn't there for me so just not one of the top of my list for sure like i said the flavor is really really i can't quite put my finger on it maybe just a little bit of that pineapple mixed with that berry or maybe it's the banana or maybe it's a combination of all three but something just tastes a little bit off almost like there's a spoiled fruit in there somewhere or something so like i said did not work for me um was a decent hybrid but at the price i i probably would definitely not get that again all right so since this is my second take like i said i'm almost through with this joint uh we did get some stuff from uh cetera we'll show that real quick and then make this one quick i left the tags on this one earlier that's why i start over um we got the coral reefer tans you choose and we'll show these in a video real soon i'm not going to show them tonight um those was 30 bucks so they're like five more than true leave this is the one we got some live bubble hash we got gas monkey or grease monkey and i don't know which because it just says ggsm um but i think it was grease monkey pop it over and take a look at i haven't even tried this yet i just got it earlier today on the way home from work i ordered it this morning when i've seen it kind of has the look of the thca powder just a little darker brown whereas that was more white this is more tan and it looks sandy i put it straight in the refrigerator when i got home and it was cool today but it's a little just not really wanting to focus on that but um it's a little clumped together in there you can see i can lift it up like a whole puck so we'll have to try to break it up or something like i said i have kept it in the refrigerator um it never got warm in the car because it was like i said pretty cool out today here in florida even so this stuff does smell amazing it's got a real good gassy smell to it let me put it back in the fridge real quick all right sorry about that it's been sitting out for a minute because like i said i did the first video i messed up on um so looking forward to trying that i will have a review of that it'll probably be close to a week on that i like to try that stuff real good the edibles will probably have here in the next day or two because pretty much we're just going on flavor for the edibles to be honest um they're all pretty much distillate so we're going to pack about the same punch at the moment we haven't got anything else here in florida yet uh when we do i will let you know because like i said i'm looking for something besides distillate gummies and distillate chocolate bars and all that like some can of butter um i know they make some edibles with um shatter and stuff even i'd like to see some of that too maybe so but like i said we do got live bubble hash now edible so like i said keep an eye out for those videos i'm gonna call this one i'm gonna try to upload something to instagram too so hopefully everybody's having a good night we're getting close to christmas i am gonna put some giveaways out i'm trying to get them done before christmas i'm trying to get a couple more things together too i like to make the giveaways as you know unique as possible so that's going to be it for me guys make sure you subscribe go follow herbert anything else i missed just ask me down in the comments um so merry christmas but i'll probably see you before then um so that's gonna be it guys peace out um and as always keep on toking my friends", "7XzkGknBDcM": "today we're trying Paul dough rice punch from Korea hey everyone welcome back to obscure Cola today we're gonna try Paul dough rice punch and as you can tell it's from Korea I picked this up I forgot where I got it somewhere in Hong Kong I got it some store I saw it I said what the heck's that rice punch yeah so spin around since 1993 it's gotta be good right as it's important in Hong Kong it has the importation sticker so I can actually read it I actually didn't even see the rice punch here I was like trying to read it in this super super super small text here and I was like right right Reiko Rico punch what is it a rice punch so yeah it's actually really impossible to read as you can see it comes in a super tiny can this is like half the size of a normal camera or less it's only 238 milliliters which is I don't know whatever it's like four ounces or something so anyway let's give it a try I have no idea what rice punch it's supposed to taste like the only punches I've had is fruit punch right Pepe I mean you can't even have apple punch no great punch no rice punch no smell discernible I guess not really okay so let's try it taste kind of like a soy not exactly soymilk a little bit soymilk or like some kind of almond when I was like humming drinks that bad got kind of some sugar cane II taste to it yeah so I don't know if it's really punch I guess it's really rice not that bad better than I expected at least put it that way so one of the things is it did say to shake it I kind of shook it when I was carrying over here so hopefully it doesn't get really bad towards the bottom if I didn't shake it enough the other thing is it lists the sugar here as a whopping 17 grams but then I noticed not all these labels are consistent in this case it's for the whole serving which is one cam which is like 238 milliliters so that means it's less than half per hundred movies which is a normal way of measuring it so 100 milliliters if it was half it would only be 8.5 or whatever but it's actually less than that so maybe it's like 6 or 7 which is actually quite low because coke is like ten and a half or ten point something and some of the really bad ones like the VLT that normally use it my reference is one of the worst ones is something like 13 plus grams of sugar per hundred milliliters and this is only 17 for the whole cane which is two two point four servings give or take whatever two point four hundred milliliter units anyhow I guess you guys don't really care about that I can't read Korean so I have no idea what this says I'm assuming this says something about rice and punch but caldo is the only other English besides rice punch that's really on here on the actual label as I mentioned sometimes like sometimes there is no English logo or whatever so pretty much the only thing you can go by is like the URL so it's called Oh drink co dot kr so yeah you know it's a Paul dough from that okay and as always I give my final verdict as well so for the final verdict on the Paul dough rice punch from Korea I'm gonna say not much of a punch but actually better than I expected okay so that's it for today don't forget to subscribe give us a thumbs up check out other videos all that con stuff I got type C videos or coke videos I got weird you know no-name brains like Paul doe definitely check it out some of my videos actually getting kind of popular because I'm finding all this random and

punchers nothing more wholesome and good than peanut Punch for this I'll be using a black magic bullet but you guys me if you don't have a magic bullet you can use your blender put it about eight to ten cubes of ice in there then you want to put a couple tablespoons of peanut butter I use creamy you can use crunchy whatever peanut butter you like and the reason why I put the ice versus because the peanut butter will sit on top of it and this way the peanut butter and the condensed milk and everything else reacted will not sit at the bottom of the food processor all the magic bullet did not get to work properly to this I add 1 tablespoon of condensed sweet sweetened condensed milk and if you don't have condensed milk feel free to use sugar I start off with maybe about a tables a teaspoon or so and add as needed and then took but a 1 cup of milk this will make enough for one to two people then you're gonna seal everything up and give it a good whizz in the blender so all we have in here is the milk the condensed milk ice cubes and the peanut butter now as as you start experimenting with this a bit you can also add granola you can add bananas you can toss in a a little bit of cinnamon or nutmeg in there you can be creative as you you get better at making this but this is a wonderful and very simple peanut Punch recipe I hope you guys give it a try it's great I mean I use

back at it again and today we'll be doing a punch it'll be carrot sweet potato and banana punch i never tried this spot before i only tried the carrot sweet potato but this time i got adding the banana as a natural sweetener and i can see how it come out and i will be sure to put a recipe in the description and i will be actually making this recipe as we go along so i have no recipe beforehand but as i go along with this punch i'll be tasting i'll be testing and i'll be writing on the recipe i will make sure to put it in the description below i believe that it's going to be good and greetings again people so i back at it again right now i just show you my ingredients i have sweet potato here i have some carrot i have some frozen banana you do not have to use frozen banana you can use a normal ripe banana but why purposely froze these because the more sportier banana is the more ripe it is and the more sweeter it is so these are like going black you know like they say that banana you know good for sweet bread banana bread but i wanted to freeze these because i want it i want the plant sweet as possible and i'm trying my best not to add any added sugars so we can see how that works out for my spices we have the cardamom again we got sumac i wanted to use this star anise but i didn't see any so i can just replace it with bay leaf and i am hoping the babies gives a good flavor when i was younger i used to love bay leaf tea i used to add it with milk and like i was so obsessed with the bay leaf tea so i used to tell my mother i want pokemon tea right so i'm using bay leaf some cinnamon we got some nutmeg and we have some coconut milk but you could use any type of milk you want to hi peoples i am back at it again and i promise a recipe and here i have averaged to four mini leaves of bay leaves three cinnamon sticks and one and a half tablespoons of cardamom and the water is here boiling uncomfortable [Music] so the spices has been boiling for 10 minutes now i am going to taste it as you can see the cinnamon has definitely colored the water so i can taste it and see if i can on greetings again everyone so i'm also going by the color profile of the boiling spice and i really do like the color profile i bought it for 25 minutes yeah and i just put it off set it to decide to stick because i really wanted to cool as much as possible you want it to cool as much as possible because i do not want to put that hot water in a hot blender and it also smells very fragrant and i love the color yeah so currently we have two and a half cups of carrot and so far we have three cups of this spiced water and i will be taking notes with spice water so so far two and a half cups of carrot all the carrot and three cups of spice water [Music] so i added one more cup of spice water we can see how it goes also i have the blender on put two speed so make sure it's all finely and roughly purified we are ready to blend the sweet potato so as you can see all of my spice water is gone and to be quite honest with you i involved a lot of space water but some thoughts filled in the process so right now i have here is the two to three flutter two and two buttercups obviously potato i have one and a quarter cup of spice water and two cups of alkaline water and we're gonna blend this and we're gonna pour in both ready sweet potato in the bowl do so three two one oh it's time to strain um sorry not sorry yeah it's time to stretch so we're gonna strain any carrot we're gonna turn this potato we're gonna have everything in the bowl then we're gonna finish off the coconut milk add in the sumac but nutmeg and it's tomorrow yeah and we need to take our bananas yeah we need to take our bananas from the freezer color put them back in the fridge so let me get a word guys so keto what is this that you've started to strain this is the carrot that's why we're gonna sprint [Music] you guys strain this out today you guys turn this off oh and this pulp that is left out you could definitely use this in bread cookies even soup pastries it's up to you but you know this is good don't throw this away this is good to eat you know i recommend it to put it in breads breads you know sweet breads or even cookies definitely bacon yup definitely bake maybe i should give a recipe about how to use pulp sweet potato and carapal let me know what you think in the comments below so what we're going to do we're going to just try to squeeze it and grind it it's not much juice it's coming out of that strainer he says we can get it see yeah you want this as dry as possible you know dry as possible we need to press it let me sweet potato now [Music] yeah people so this is the sweet potato on the carrot i strained it one last time because i did not want any pulp at all whatsoever in this mixture here because some of the pulp dropped in while we're straining it separately but this is it all together so i just strained it one more time and i will put some of this in a blender with some of the bananas and i'm gonna give that a little blend and then i will pour it back into the bowl get everything going everything's stirring and we can see how it turns out yeah people so i peel my tree frozen bananas i chop them up i put back in somebody carrot i need sweet potato mixture just gonna blend it try to get it bananas fine flame fine and then i'm gonna pour back the bowl and i am going to whip this thing yeah we can just whisk up everything when i put it back in the bowl okay everybody this is your final product i did end up adding sugar which i did not want to do but you could add in one to two more bananas if you like i would definitely recommend that if you don't want any added sugar i added in half cup of sugar brown sugar but a quarter cup is fine you could probably even add in more coconut milk if you want to i would have probably added in more coconut milk because i love a creamy look a creamy texture but that's fine too so right now you're gonna have the ts oh i am the ruthless taste tester here to get my verdict on this drink let's go okay i'm excited [Music] i can't keep my face i [Applause] so what do you think it needs more coconut milk i generally don't know i really already broke i really like the flavors it's just it may be a bit too light for me i'm not sure i guess it may just be i'm not used to these flavors but it does taste really good um i think it's just that you're not used to the flavors yeah so it's really good and i could definitely get used to it i could definitely drink it again in fact i'm going to you", "YJLTVGappOM": "Bret Vader here and today we're gonna do a review on banana punch it's a mostly indica strain let's see if I can show you the bag it's hard to see but I want to show you the buds I already have the ball packed what's rated on the scent scent 10 out of 10 it's a banana scent one of the best cents I ever had taste will taste it when we take the head but it's a 27 to 24 percent THC so it should be a pretty strong hit well it's time to get high let's see if this it's any good tastes amazing 10 out of 10 and I'm already feeling nice and high when we cook one yet took a nice big hit and I think they'll be good probably for next few hours eyes are getting watery nice I would say so overall 10 out of 10 on scent 10 out of 10 on taste 10:02 10 on effect but is it the best weed I've ever smoked I don't think so I've probably gotten more high I mean I've smoked some really strong stuff over the years but yeah this is strong this is about as strong as you got this is a great week highly recommend and it wasn't even that expensively because one of the cheaper ones on the list definitely we I recommend to anybody if you want an indica strong buzz go with this",

yeah let's get going so what I'm gonna go into the bathroom cuz this can be a little bit messy and you want to start out with a okay the way I'm going to come over here you're going to start off with a nice little tip of water adding a banana peel adding suck um banana leaf adding some banana and add in yellow not many the animal then it won't be right and then it you won't have a banana punch you'll just have much so don't forget to add in yellow and it will need beyond wish if you don't add waters yeah and also don't forget to add water or else nothing will happen as you can see this can get a little messy so don't forget to have paper travel to your right and let's drink it so that what you're done you wanna be you want to make sure that you take the color and squeeze if you don't

would be a vegetable it wasn't reagan that thought that a tomato was a vegetable because it's a ketchup was a veteran ketchup was a video that's right I knew it was something just totally bizarre random but no I am bad as a fire inside I came up with some some ideas using her banana Dave came back with banana kool-aid I thought that was good except it's its trademark so yeah a straight punch be dispelled with the sea aid with you oh yeah of course and they'd be like uh you're gonna add me with bananas that are cool it sounds like some kind of homosexual Club I think so hero is this oh

long night I guess haha so anyway this is a wonderful sketch and what's the title of it is called Jesus cab Jesus cab and it's written by by me oh right brentano it basically to give you a quick background it's uh the cab driver who really doesn't have a name doesn't he's never it's never happening um he's a recurring character it started with da know back in two thousand five thousand five writing a sketch where I played the cab driver and he played Batman and the Batmobile was in the shop getting effects does the check engine light was on exactly and then so me is the cab driver I pick him up in Gotham City yeah are you throwing suing you brought my Brooklyn microphone now we've dumped my camera haha anyway moving on yeah I think I think that was my hand hitting the table yeah

get a chance to do the Kung Fu thing there's two Centurions walking up the sidewalk now get anything I can cover my face with yeah just duck down behind the seat there", "shKtTYrCvAc": "we thought you might like a recipe for a fruity punch that you can serve at any time but nice to have for special occasions this recipe has bananas as the base and we're actually going to just process them and then add other juicers to it and the juices that were using a pineapple mango apple orange juice and orange juice thank you and it's 500 ml of each now you can increase that of course and make it in a very large quantity but that's the quantities that we're working with today and so to process the the bananas we're going to put them into this jug and I'm just going to add a little bit of the juices just one of the so we've got a little moisture there might need a little bit more I think and just by using one of these stick mixes but you can use a food processor of course just processing what this does is to give a lovely creamy texture to the whole of the the fruit punch hike and you can actually freeze the bananas first and then you finish up almost with a bit of an ice cream oh that's interesting yes and you can really make some lovely textures and flavors and so if you could take this Jade I'll protect Italy thank you and we're just going to pour that into our punch bowl so this is just the bananas with a little of the fruit juice there's something about bananas most people like them do your family like bananas my family loves bananas but my husband doesn't like them so what can I use with the fruit Freddie punch if he doesn't like bananas okay well you can use other fruits you can use mango you can use any other fruit yeah you won't get quite the creaminess because most of the other fruit doesn't have the starch content at a banana die which gives that they're lovely creaminess however it would still be nice so you can use any other fruit thank you and if you freeze the fruit first and then pull it out of the freezer just put it on a tray just in pieces pull it out of the freezer and just wait until you can just indent the fruit with a fork so that it's not frozen hard okay so not quite freezing out it's just starting to defrost a little yes and with a little bit of the juice just like I did that will give you a creamier texture initially if it sits there for an hour well then you will lose that but initially you will get a creamier texture because of the fruit that is frozen okay that's good idea so this should be a nice um drink it's a lovely drink some and now comes the really difficult part and that is just putting all the juices in and this is mango and apple and pineapple and our good favorite orange juice I did bring a risk but I I can probably use this little machine again can't I you can actually do this with a hand whisk so don't feel you need to use your little machine but we will do that today all right now ideally you would leave that for around 30 minutes and you can leave it longer if you like pop it in the fridge so that it stays nice and cool and then you would add a little bit of ginger ale and we've used the load jewel and also a little bit of mineral water and when I say a little bit it's a cup of each however today we're just going to put that in here now and we'll just give that a stir so that there's a slight and he sent it phys eNOS yes Thank You Jade and that's our fruit punch I hope you enjoy it you", "ygS3UsIZaqI": "I really seeing me to drag this out any further than we need to I know but I'm

review that I literally just got in the door banana punch cured sugar Qi leaf extracts let's get into it 81 percent THC hybrid let's go that's Instagram you can see all that let's let's get into this very nice-looking sugar definitely very very nice-looking granulated sugar when I dip my tool end I get a little of this and there get about it good dab in okay okay that should be hung enough it's about - dabs right there anyways guys let's hit it whoa I had that a little too hot and did that hold a band like one hit definitely earthy woody you with that banana that banana after tongue the banana after tones see I'm not a real big banana fan usually when I have a banana it's mixed with something or and eating it just like plain but but holy crap does that hit the volume of vapor was nice on it it really went nicely the effects were are definitely immediate um they have definitely passed like that threshold of like five who are not feeling it physically I'm definitely a head hit head rush if anything right now give me one second I want to open break a window because it's but um now that it's cooled off a little a little more going not I'm not gonna do a huge one this time do a half a one because I need to save this for later today anyway it list now now it's trying to get in there and settle in you know what guys I think I'm ready to get my thing on this on it's at least an 8 out of 10 it's hitting me very nicely still a more of a 50/50 high on not leaning one way or the other on that type of high for me it's in the middle of like I know I'm high but it's not like oh I'm sleepy high oh I'm like you know energetic heights right in the middle um definitely a nice one um I don't remember if I tried this one or not though and did a review of it I may have tried it but never got to review it I've honestly lost count because on some of these reviews you know how you had it like a bye list you have so you have a list of it from your transactions this place they don't have a list of so I don't have a really a list of all the strains I went through I should probably start doing that though so I can cross things off the list but besides that let's take a combo hit to end this on um I still got some of that rocket fuel left um shout out to green goods they had this 255 and they also have a first-time customer discount check them out they are really they really helped me out with my medicine and honestly I rather drive there than some of the other places because literally you're on 22 for like the whole way mmm beautiful I love it but anyway Oh Tony you're crazy he's a madman I tell you no water even you're bored yeah I'm not gonna take all of that I'm gonna mix this in and then like take half of that so I just get a row Porta this is like like this concentrate has larger chunks of diamonds and it - it's not just all sandy I just pulled up like I know you can't see that but that's like the that's a diamond son hold on this is why I need more silicone stuff if anyone would like to send silicone trays or stuff my way on definitely hit me out my Instagram I would love to rep anything honestly cuz my medicine exists is expensive and I am very poor you can also help I don't even actually know donate below yeah yeah there's a link down there somewhere right - yeah PayPal PayPal me down below donations always welcome thank you guys for a sport horse buggy never but um I'm not gonna I'm just gonna leave that as is I'm just gonna do a whole another one on and try and not get a giant diamond this time even though my diet a neom can handle it I cannot right now and I know these two together will knock me out oh by the way on this rocket fuel it's actually pretty good I it may or may have not have giving me a weed nap as well um you know take that with a grain of salt I sleep schedules kind of [ __ ] right now but um the rocky field turned out to be better than I expected when did I read it like a seven out of ten you can bump that up to it like an eight definitely wanted to pick up especially like I paid what it was going retail for fifty five a G and with that discount at Great Green Goods I got a pretty cheaper much cheaper and I got like two of them so you know discounts I love you okay that's about right anyways guys Cheers Oh you guys need to try this oh my god this is good I usually like keeping some my strange separate but after a walk by um deep down I like mixing them all that way it's like Oh get a little of this get a little that you know in your system add sand for Putin see I just wishes like glass containers were a lake a little easier to get stuff off of honestly would it be that bad to just say just put these in like how much do like a silicon container go for like what a dollar at some places why not I'm wondering ye people just don't put their [ __ ] but the concentrates in a silicon jar and then seal it that would probably be better if any companies want to reach on baby royalties for that idea hey I'm here you could probably do include a little tapper tool to like the other company in California does little parchment paper to man you hit get a lot of people interested but anyway final verdict I still think it's a solid eight then the rocket fuel together it's just a wombo combo I need to stop using that because everyone's using it now I'm kind of need a need a new thing pissing me off now but anyway I'm going to go do stuff um still a hybrid hi-yah even though I mm-hmm you know so but anyway guys it's been real peace", "xGis_DyN0OQ": "he's gonna find never mind

go to the grocery store and get like a steak and they know how to pay for it well yes walk I just as you're still mobile enough to go do it yourself yeah I mean well if you think about it what's what's the last big milestone as far as discounts when you become a senior what is it like 55 going a movie yes should have another like super old man discount you don't remember little like living another you know 45 50 years after 55 and for something exactly they stuff like those super wrinkle discount really catchy fun names to it you know I do it definitely yeah at 90 everything's free

if I made it to 85 I just going to walk out into the woods I don't want to live that long yeah that's like the sounds through just ridiculous I was gonna say another word by belong no not gonna you I'm not going to do it some of us in this room are closer than miles German so when you get close to the milestone of getting your discount do you start thinking about faking your ID so you can get it get it get it sooner yeah yeah now I'm gonna put that off as long as again ah that's really good i'll be glad when that time comes oh I'm glad to pay full price hmm ok just wondering that's awesome though that you're doing this and you're involved we're having a good time you know you'll remain a punch and you've got a lot of different age groups going on and see in the shows and in the shows and that's important that keeps you young and we've tried we've had this handsome guest stars no and then yeah Barney barb Magnar Oh Bart I like Alan Barbara Barr pressia yeah yeah I should hold him

does grandpa dog he has a show on too yeah Saturday night's eight o'clock nice you know what's what's the what's the gist of a show um it is also a religious show yeah cool I think so a lot of the shows on here religious shows but someone got it some are not and some talk about toilet paper yeah we got the name is show is Hebrew roots okay yeah I was I was flipping through the website today and I saw it yeah cool yeah definitely very cool yeah so what do you have you ever had anyone get really offended over this sketch I've never heard about it no no and actually I've got a couple of friends of mine a theater friend and her husband who are very religious and um she she had asked me when they were looking to come to one of our shows whether there was anything to be concerned about because I think we do pretty pretty clean stuff we're smart smart um and they saw Jesus cabin actually quite low good so no really yeah that's cool yeah that's very cool I mean you're not out just to offend your honor to actually make really have no interest event yeah jit you know honestly just making people laugh and if we make a point along the way fine mm-hmm definitely so do you think that uh do you think that Jesus had he had the option would have run away from his crucifixion", "3mFRjfGtlX8": "you know you could write a novel and Martin Scorsese could write a movie about that atmel burn not Mel Gibson Yeah right no I mean I just wonder cuz you know I mean a lot of people it you know I wouldn't say particularly Christians more what we've heard about in the news lately anyways Muslim people is you know martyrdom and dying for your faith and and things you know Mike is that is that something that you think is good I mean you don't sound like you're someone who's hardcore religious but I mean how far would you go for your religion not that far all right yeah misery okay only if I can stop at my personal yes only we get to pick a black jack black cats not blackjack that's Vegas sorry it's all good no I mean I said I find that interesting so I mean a lot of people are just so you know so into their religion they just they would die for it they do anything for I have to because if I don't I'll get the mark of the devil 666 um that that's what happened when you got your debit card and then the end times if you don't have that mark you can't buy things you can't sell things you can't work so eventually I will be little weight we don't have to work is it like welfare no then times in our world market goody mark is a beast when you get your UPC label on your back yeah Nick the barcode the barcode then you know 666 this is only after the rapture whenever a desk ears yes by the way actually think this is right before the rapture no i don't i think well according to those christians we still be here no they're gonna be gone no no the ones that believed they're gone in the rapture and then afterwards is when like the whole then they have a decision to make yeah and then you get the markers oh yeah and then like once you die if you believe at that point i think you still get to go yeah you only get one chance after that yeah but if you die and you don't believe in Jesus after that or God or two later then Julia mark in the sky yeah if you had a baby goat on back here next to think how many fewer pieces of ID you would need to care I would that be nice oh just falls out to hand in your pocket you could never fake it either mm-hmm wasn't Sarah there yep I know that'd be awesome I saw him all about using the fingerprint thumbprint and stuff oh yeah like that'd be nice I'd do that definitely you know but that's really isn't it just one more way for the government to keep Tom Anya oh no you know what's really interesting is that when you have a baby in any state the United States they take your child's DNA and it goes into a bank stays there depending on which state you're in how long it stays there so you know beowulf's DNA is kept for six months actively and then it's moved to an anonymous thing or something and they also make sure they also record if your child is born with any birth defects or anything and they keep that because I had a phone call last winter wanting to know if I wanted to get my son vaccinated for the swine flu because they knew there was the CDC that called me they knew that he had a heart condition well yeah I don't know how they knew yeah and they check their DNA for genetic stuff so if there's any genetic problems they notify the doctor on record and then when you go to the baby set appointment they're like oh by the way your child has blah blah blah you're like what I know it's me a sick yeah I didn't even know this was going on CNN told me Wow yeah they're all up in your business definitely yeah no I know that this could spawn a new radio show I wish the government would just butt out mm-hmm butt out of my life no exactly I need a revolution we do we do I'm all for holding its long a rebellion it's like as long though as we don't turn into some super uber religious society run by super religious Christians or Muslims or I don't Mormons Mormons or any of those people like an idea gonna they're gonna take over after we revolt the Mormons they could there's a lot of them I don't think there's that many well there's a lot of them they all have a lot of well not all of them some of them I won't say all Mormons do that but I'll some of them do the whole multiple wise thing see now if there is a religion where I could have like ten husband's I totally I'd be like y'all go to work stay here and then one of you needs to stay home and clean yeah yep and I get one as a pool boy oh boy he does he stays home and cleans the pool outside and on the inside cleaning one oh yes see the sweet this is the way it should be but then what I've each of those ten husbands had ten wives well he's not allowed to have any other wives he only gets to go to work man has come home do cleaning or something cleaning your something in them yeah something I suppose I probably want some of them have girlfriends they wouldn't bother me all the time I'd I think I'd work oh yeah you know I just send me a check every month don't even come home and it's all good don't make me look at you it's like when I was a kid I said I should marry a truck driver she'd be gone yeah you only seem one weekend a month hahaha that horrible yeah I determined otherwise definitely we have to wrap things up folks I know it's the end of the show that's not it is we ever over Carl's cannabis corner is up

so y'all stay tuned in today's video is on how to prune your plant for maximal production and I'm explaining exactly what this does as you guys can see this is the banana punch now see how why she is right here I'm gonna show you how her sister as you can see we have not been there out at all not yet the reason why I started a training process to these girls start low stress trying to know and what that allow now what I did was you don't need nothing inside all that she down at the bottom we removed all those growing in her nose whatever Dean contours the top at this point we don't want you know I mean like I left some wrenches down here like these lower ones those are clones we didn't really cut those off but we cleaned it out and what this allows is for all the nutrients uptake to be how you say it what it does it allows all the nutrients from the bottom of the stock to go straight up to these top all these tops now these tops were lowers I was a low stress trying of now they became tops now to initiate a growth take off you strip down all that inside stuff and what that does is oh I missed a little piece yeah and like I was saying what that does is it Creek it creates a growth stimulate through the plant well see that little girl right there we got these all over the plants this season hey some good little spiders so far so good but a little quick video like I say what that allows is for this plant I'm gonna show you guys this plan the week y'all gonna see how fast of a growth it has from this point now two reasons like I say I did that and from this point on

alright y'all peace", "En9LTxk7jK0": "hello and welcome today I'm going to share with you my recipe for beetroot punch and for this recipe we're going to start off by preparing our beetroot now if you can't get the fresh beetroot you can buy the ones in the tin for this recipe and to prepare the beetroot you want to make sure you wash it and there's no dirt on it and you want to cut this part off and you can cut the other part off put it into a pot of water to boil and boil until it's tender now when you put your knife through it it's really really tender that's what you want our plates finish we'll go ahead to peeling the skin off and then moving on to making the punch so I'm going to put lines up to boil on medium heat until it's nice and tender on the inside of my beetroot finish boiling I just want to show you all how to peel let you just take your knife and you run it along the outside and the skin comes off really easily so all you do is peel all the skin and then cut this up into small cubes or chunks or yourself when they are unclean my beetroot and I've cut it up into small chunks the other ingredients you'll need for this recipe are some whole mill austere fresh milks some salt vanilla essence or almond essence or mixed essence condensed milk evaporated milk not made and or cinnamon and I have here two tins of subtle Jen I may or may not use boats I want to see the thickness and the consistency that the punch is at before I add both ends but I'll start off with one so let's get started on getting this together before I continue I just want to let you all know the list of ingredients for this will be down below in the description box so add your beetroot to your blender to this you going to add your milk which is the will milk evaporated milk vanilla essence condensed milk now I'm just adding a little bit you can add and adjust the sweetness when you're finish you are not meg and or cinnamon pinch of salt and your wanton of suppli Jen to start off now blend until smooth so my punch has already nice consistency it's not too thick and it's not too runny if you watch my spoon you can see pieces of beetroot there if you want a very smooth punch with all those pieces I suggest you strain the punch and then serve it or you can have this as is so I just tasted my punch it's perfect it has everything in the right amount so I'm not going to add that additional tin of suppli gem but if you want to you can so I'm just going to go ahead and pour this out and show you what it looks like so here you have it maybe my beetroot punch recipe I hope you guys try this recipe make it let me know down below if you like it if you cannot get suppli Jen where you live then I suggest you substitute for evaporated milk and some extra vanilla extract essence so thank you all for watching and I'll see you all another day with another one of my recipes enjoy", "BDEzVhNCzVU": "that was so funny as opposed to real mannequin yeah yeah yes because the real mannequins on like you know full moons they turn into real people and older drive around gone dates and stuff really yeah like in that movie mannequin I was about to say there was a big mannequin in the movie mannequin yeah exactly oh we have visitors outside the window hello now they're on the screen hello people of Des Moines in the skywalk hanging out what do you do in the sky walk on the weekend sighs look at us oh how we're walking on I see a lot of people power walking I always feel like we're kind of like in the zoo in here people are like whoa what's going on up here in that's super awesome so okay so anyway I don't remember what we're talking about my weird weird its creator that's right so wasn't based on a religious ideal or know a lot of our sketches I think have anachronism I love the idea of a guy driving a cab through yeah zeroth century Jerusalem well yeah that's kind of late wait did they have caps dress man and then you know the cab driver apparently doesn't age she exists yeah maybe you know maybe after so many of these different sketches not skits oh um you could turn it around so the cabbie is actually like the all-knowing powerful real God the two baby is God maybe cabbie is God there you go just didn't even know it as you were writing it most people think of God is being smarter well okay have you seen the dogs that are born with three legs a button boom Wow I'm just saying yeah I know there's a lot of really really inappropriate things I could say right now you know hahaha one of our one of our listeners is chatting with a joke oh there was two old ladies sitting in a church after a long time one lady said to the other my butt fell asleep and the other one said yeah I know I heard it snoring that's what Scooby shy have a whole show about have you ever farted in church and send your own pew yeah confusion confucius say man who fart in church sitting on pure ice and you know so do you have a you know Don oh I do you have a faith that you follow or oh you know I to answer that question I would go back to what Woody Guthrie said when he was admitted to the hospital in like the early sixties when her this was they needed a religion to put on his wristband and he said all and they wouldn't they wouldn't let him say all okay so he said well it's either all or none nice awesome let's go I see the validity and so you do you do believe in a God though or you don't Regis hey you know whatever i am not sure that God can be known so so you probably fallen like the agnostic time yeah I I think I respect everyone's yes things cuz i know we know that Dave isn't he's really not into the whole God idea yeah i mean we're eating me or even or dairy or dairy no dairy no no dairy no meat no God what do you do on saturday nights drink hahaha super awesome yeah no I mean I I respect everybody's right to their own religion and such but yeah I'm just not a believer in organized religion so it yeah yeah you know yeah you know at my whole thing is if you look back at history and the role religion has played throughout history and it just seems to be responsible for a lot of or involved in a lot of bad stuff and and just the fact that you know if I don't what what says our religion and our religion being you know mainstream Christianity or whatever that Christianity is the right religion if you look back over time you know what the Vikings and various other you know well yeah I mean apples it's real new right I mean it's like it's like do you go out and buy a Prius or do you wait until they recall it you know yeah it's the new God he's the new God so do you know do stick with go with him or did you just wait to see if he gets recalled I don't know maybe he's meek all right does he work for Toyota apparently not Oh boys in the car would be perfect oh well then again three-legged dogs there you go you know it's awake oh so do you go to church da know and I know I grew up going church hey Jim do you flip through on Sundays on the TV till you hit the brown nun and be like whoo I went to church today I used to do that because I was always like I was like oh look that is there's a religious channel I went to church today and then one day I decided that those silly because I didn't believe in that anyway so now when we accidentally get stuck on the religion channels on Sundays it's like he's out there Jason's out in my living room our living room like watching it and he's totally laughing I'm in the bedroom and I usually can hear it i'm laughing and we're both just laughing at it that's not very nice but it's funny it's like entertainment's like why I haven't Comedy Central for people with gout cable just like mark kennis and the Jesus bus yeah what oh come on you have to know about Mark Kinison the Jesus bus I don't end the Jesus river yes man we do we brought it we did a parody of that one time to hide it but Jesus bless it drives around here in town yeah you've never seen it if you ever seen as old a public access TV now oh man oh if you want to talk entertainment laughing we should have him wow man you mark kennice mark Kenneth yeah I don't know and it's like I know that I don't think his teeth are if he is haha that's not very nice no it's not but you know I shouldn't yeah it's all good now that's funny because we kept talking about buying a Winnebago and like bedazzling it with the Jesus on the back and we drive it around the country and with a little slot on the back donations for Jesus and we just use the money to buy beer beautiful yeah well you know how do you know it you pay to the church is going to like good things exactly I mean do you really think about the money you tied to your church that ten percent a percentage of that ten percent goes

on 45 seconds is up I got to fix my camera that keeps falling down it's all good whatever what is that kind of sweater so we're talking about this toilet paper now and I heard about it on Bobby Tom a few days ago and I can't for the life of me figure out what it's made out of but it's like really soft did you find it on there John it starts with a CH o Shah sound yeah I think yeah cashmere cash gosh you're right here the key right Doug it is captured image they had sickened wrong 379 ever a roll I think they said it was 370 something for a four pack is it which isn't bad actually know that

I'm bad at games okay there you go", "sZpkVSIySQA": "[Music] yeah you think it's a [ __ ] game son it's alpine it's referral but society you know as soon as i get home girl imma smoke some alpine baby imma smoke some alpine baby soon as i get on girl imma smoke some gmo for a while now baby imma smoke it all night long i've been locked down for a while now baby imma smoke it all night long oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah what up it's your boy weaver [ __ ] room man and welcome to the scythe on this beautiful thursday where i'm kicking it and i know 450 [ __ ] fact that you guys are kicking it if you are over the age of 21 make sure to like comment subscribe hit that notification bell that way you are always informed on the latest and greatest drop here at the [ __ ] site you did and if you are under the age of 21 of my ass place you get the [ __ ] out of here not against you personally but right here right now is just not the time of place for you it will be the time of place for you today you get a wreck or the day you turn the age of 21 so until then get the [ __ ] at it before we get down with the video i want to give a big shout out to 777 filthy underground music for definitely pointing me into the right direction he was like yo reef alpine is coming out with some liquid diamond sauce vape cartridges and i want you on the site to be one of the first to review it and he didn't have to do that considering he's a cannabis influencer himself in this game i see a lot more selfishness than selflessness you know what i mean so the fact that he did that and the fact that he went out of his way to provide content for the scythe means a lot and we thank you so if you don't know about 777 make sure to hit him up so when alpine came through they dropped off two different cartridges two different pods two different vaporizers the first one was boom skittles punch indica fire i've been smoking on this bad boy for a good week now look at that look at that sauce [Music] ah amazing the skittles punch was amazing but when i opened the bag i saw something that literally gave me butterflies in my stomach you know what i mean because number one it's one of my favorite strands it's like my top favorite strand in 2020 and it just it looked like a killer you know what i'm saying it just looked like something that just came out of a [ __ ] movie in the vape cartridge so i i was like yo imma smoke this i'm gonna try the skittles punch out i'ma see how it is and then we're gonna save this bad boy for the actual review so the first cartridge they gave me was the skittles punch fire fire fire the second one they gave me boom gmo crossed with banana punch number nine what i'ma say that again gmo crossed with banana punch number nine that's [ __ ] wild you know in 2020 it's been a lot about a lot has focused on crosses when it comes down to the vape cartridges not the soul strands you know what i mean like to know the girl scout cookies or the skywalker oh geez nothing wrong with those and those are crosses but these are two totally different type of crosses you know what i mean these are two very exotic crosses that i could never imagining seeing in a vape cartridge you know banana punch number nine and gmo cookies like a part of me thinks that that won't even make sense but obviously it does or they wouldn't chose it in a vape cartridge we're gonna find out in a second so without further ado let's get down to the nitty-gritty labs on this bad boy are coming in between 75 and 80. it's so brand new the labs haven't even really been posted yet obviously everything is a pass everything is a go minus the thc content and total active cannabinoids but they all vary between 75 and 80 this is actually the first time i've ever had alpine you know what i'm saying i've never had alpine before this not because of any other reason other than just i haven't seen it around as much as i've seen everything else around but the simple fact that they're doing this diamond sauce is really going to get alpine going you know what i mean because in 2020 it really seems like that's the consensus everybody's smoking live resin everybody kind of just dropped off on distillate i still smoke distillate so i don't you know i don't i don't give a [ __ ] but i'm just saying that's really the consensus here so the fact that they're doing their due diligence and just kind of easing their way out of the distillate game and going into the live resin game is definitely a good look for them all right off the bat the packaging is simple but dope you know what i mean because the black box you know generic black box but what really makes the black box stand out is the sticker on top you know what i mean sometimes it's little things like that that can really just like you know stand out when it comes down to you know going to a dispensary and picking something up store in a cold place ceramic core 510 thread so let's just crack this [ __ ] open and see what we have in store look at that that's nice that's nice when you open it up there's a little booklet probably tells you like where to you know limited edition live resin cartridge now here here we have it tubular totally tubular man banana banana banana and yo let me tell y'all i know i say a lot about gmo but i love anything banana too baby i love anything to banana i love anything banana too before we start blowing down on this pause i'm gonna do some dry hits to see if i you know taste anything super significant banana [Music] with a little little garlic wow banana with a little bit of garlic wow that tastes good already so these are absolutely i love the oil i love how it looks i love the ceramic on the inside it makes it look i don't know it just looks very distinguished like that as soon as i saw gmo cross with banana punch number nine i hit up alpine i was like y'all are creating frankenstein up in that [ __ ] y'all are like banana punch number nine cross with gmo is wild it is wild and it's a first for this cannabis community that i've seen in a vape cartridge so if you guys are not smoking gmo cross banana punch number nine from alpine make sure to pull out whatever you have let's go on this wild wild ride look at that look at that lord have mercy shaboy reef man gmo cross a banana punch from alpine liquid diamond sauce salute oh my goodness wow wow holy [ __ ] totally not what i expected because i've been smoking on the skittles punch for a little less than a week now so i guess i had my mouth set up for skittles punch but man i mean no disrespect but that [ __ ] gmo banana punch number nine cross ain't nothing nothing compared to that skittles punch the skittles punches fire too though i want to make that abundantly clear skittles punch is fire but when i had that gmo smell the car smell it smell the [ __ ] car oh my [Music] goodness and that's what a lot of vape vape cartridges do they're good on the inhale and you can taste it a little bit on the exhale but when you blow it out and you can straight up smell like garlic and a little bit of sweet like fruity that's wild that's wild and that's live resin you know what i'm saying that's live resin because you don't like if i go and pick up a distillate cartridge there's a good chance that it might not smell it's going to smell like some kind of og kush it's not going to smell like a you know tur like just super just flavored terps and [ __ ] like that you know what i'm saying this is this is it you know what i'm saying i can only imagine what this is gonna cost you know the day it comes out because number one it's just so flavorful it's sauce you know diamond sauce and you know the ceramics and all of this and it's just it's just wow [Music] i smell both the banana and the gmo god damn holy [ __ ] where the [ __ ] the other battery got now i'm gonna try the actual alpine battery we'll put it on my hands are sweaty because i'm so [ __ ] high 3.8 oh my goodness oh i'm sweating my upper lip is sweating i like beads on my head right now you see that wow wow so tasty holy [ __ ] [ __ ] this [ __ ] is giving me [ __ ] hallucinations in a good way you know what and this is why i'm grateful this is why i love doing what i'm doing because you know not for nothing you talking to a dude who was you know he i love certain brands like whenever i went out it was you know just certain things now because i'm doing this i don't have to just stick to one [ __ ] brand we get complacent with whatever brand we're smoking and we're like yo this brand could do nothing wrong ever i'm sticking with them and i'm sure that brand appreciates that at the end of the day but if you do that you missing out on this banana punch number nine cross

considering i have been giving you back-to-back 20-minute recipes i thought let's take a little break from that and make some refreshing drink to wash it all down okay saka fett youtube and let us make some delicious carrot punch [Music] so guys over here i have my freshly washed carrots very important to wash your carrots before you make this carrot punch this is my version by the way for ingredients you're gonna need your carrots of course and over here i have some cinnamon and in here i have some nutmeg of course i have my condensed milk to go in this recipe and over here i have some of my barren foods essence it's nearly finished but it will be enough okay i also have the water i will be using to make this carrot punch and let us get started so i'm actually just going to go ahead and just peel my carrots and you don't want to take off much of the skin this is why i'm using this peeler i really like it it just takes off a nice thin layer from the carrots okay and make sure to wash the carrots before making this recipe to get rid of any impurities that is very important so you see this peeler just takes off just a thin little skin from it and that is perfect okay you [Music] so now that my carrots are nicely peeled of course i'm now just going in with my knife and i'm just going to be rough chopping this you need to be very careful i don't actually like to put my carrots in my blender hole like this because hey i don't want to spoil this blender man so i'm just going to be chopping it just into smaller pieces so guys this is my carrots all done as you can see it's looking amazing and because i already chopped it and washed it it's good to go so now i'm going to be blending it all right i've got my blender and i'm going to be blending this in two parts okay you don't want to put too much carrots at once and another thing if you want to boil your carrots beforehand to do this recipe it's up to you but i don't like boiling mine i love the fresh taste of the carrots in my carrot punch so i'm blending this in two parts so i'm putting about two and a half cups of water for each part okay so i've got my bowl and i'm just going to strain this in using my strainer i'm just using a spoon just to get any juice out of the pulp okay some people actually go ahead and use their pulp to do other things i don't know maybe carrot cake carrot fritters you can use it if you don't want to discard it it's entirely up to you okay i'm just squeezing all of the juice out gorgeous so we're gonna do the second batch now i'm gonna add in my water of course badge done time to strain okay i'm just trying to get rid of the foam at the top okay okay guys so this is looking amazing nice and rich so i'm now just gonna go in with my cinnamon and you just want to mix that in very well followed by my nutmeg my vanilla essence of course and now i'm going in with my condensed milk guys because i won't be using any sugar in this dress using the whole can of condensed milk and this is about a cup and a half okay guys so at this point you just want to taste it adjust it for sugar to your preference you can add in a little dash of rum in this if you want to it's all to your preference but yes my darlings my carrot punch is all done look at how amazing it's looking nice and rich guys this is so creamy so so delicious so guys it's time to serve myself a nice glass of this beautiful carrot punch absolutely amazing so i hope you enjoy this carrot punch recipe if you do try it don't forget to tag me on instagram at tyrion's kitchen don't forget to subscribe and

really safe so of course he's gonna keep going for it how many times he misses yeah i mean um honestly i i gotta say in the 1v1 germ has been getting f man like whenever it's him against the two of them or him in a 1v1 situation it's it's mainly like the follow-ups that germ does i would say and then it's geniuses like fundamentals and crowd control yeah that's winning him winning the rounds as the better faster character yeah jerry's really there for support but like since they know each other so well jerry can be there for the things that is going to be there for there we go that's why

thought joe's going to keep fighting football from that dunes handler yeah there we go these players are just rolling around yeah i almost got a follow-up just the pressure of having two people on you and the fact that uh oh okay that this is a good enough situation germ left genus in a good enough situation for this one one to happen um i think genus diaz can figure out what you're up to if he doesn't figure out what you're up to then and he wants to win he'll win that's why he's not approaching cliff anymore he's like he's waiting for me to get close so you can just hit him with all he did

oh come on Laura this is a real recipe this is a real recipe give us real recipe this is going to be too easy and I'm with you it is a really ridiculously easy recipe but the reason why I'm sharing it with you which by the way I completely debated on doing that is because so many of you have been requesting for more smoothie recipes and my smoothie recipes are super easy because I to be honest with you not a big really big fan of complicated smoothies I just like them to be simple good this is the way I like them so this one is my pineapple banana so you're gonna need some pineapple juice some fresh or frozen pineapples pineapple pieces banana and vanilla yogurt and that is really it now let me just tell you when I made this recipe it was completely because of a mistake I was in a completely hurry I was totally in a hurry one day I'm at the supermarket in the freezer aisle getting my frozen mango pieces to make my smoothie that night I come home I'm getting ready to make my smoothie I open up the package and I realize I accidentally got pineapple chunks instead of mango this is there were both yellow so they looked similar and I'm grabbing things and going so the sign I just go along with the recipe anyway it was delicious when I remade it the second time I substituted the milk for the pineapple juice and it was had been it's so simple it's so good I'm just going to get right into it I'm gonna put in some banana some pineapple I will need all that pineapple the banana it's optional but I love the taste I love bananas and also gives great sweetness cuz I don't like to add any additional sugar I just like to have my fruit and this is some natural pineapple juice this is what really gives you that pineapple kick it's just really really good it's really simple and it's really easy I'm going to just blend this up and so you desired consistency and you're done boom now you could add some ice to this if you wanted to I'm just gonna serve it as is for myself I will put ice in my husband's glass though because he likes his drinks super cold compar shil and it really depends but since the pineapple was in the fridge and pineapple juice was in the fridge it's pretty good mmm it's so sweet but not overly sweet you can taste the pineapple you can taste the banana mmm for all my adult friends out there if you wanted to and only if you wanted to I'm not twisting your arm and a splash of rum some frozen some ice in there mmm a really good one absolutely go to you must try go to laurainthekitchen.com to get the exact measurements of everything let me

together the dried ingredients I didn't expire sold the mill chia all of these ingredients are optional you will need like you know the vanilla and nutmeg but most of these are optional so cut the condensed milk was unnecessary because the nutriment is already sweet as it is so I just wait this is coconut condensed milk as well because I'm just trying to limit the amount of milk I put in so I'm gonna head off of the nutriment then another half a cup of almond milk then I'm gonna add in the oats also added in the sea moss and the vanilla forgot to mention the vanilla in the beginning so and the vanilla about a teaspoon of vanilla and also if you have frozen banana you can use frozen banana I got fresh banana so I'm gonna use fresh banana you can also add some eyes they give a bit of coldness but the milk is already has already been in the fridge so that was if you just blend and that's it quick quick one two three four five you know this - probably about five minutes to make don't need Miranda and you can get really really creative with this with this punch you can add blueberries you could add anything you want literally anything you want so that's it guys and yeah just thank you guys so so much for watching I'm gonna add load chia see eating a little desiccated coconut on top and I know what's a momma I miss the other daughters guys thank you for coming thank you for watching and I hope you enjoyed this recipe I'm just gonna chillax here and drink with my sweet sweet darlin you want some in the trace is it nice is nice I should say it nicer I didn't my turn hmm yeah this have been a sweet side it's nice and rich um it could do with a Guinness but because we breastfeeding I can't really you know have any alcohol you can but I don't want to you know [Music] you answer it's still sweet for you isn't it yeah not really it's a bit sweet but we shouldn't have put there coconut condensed milk I think it's a lot sweeter than normal condensed milk sweet hmm as always guys thank you so so much for coming say thank you thank you mm-hmm all right guys thank you for coming like share comment right right there right it subscribe yeah right there right

[Music] [Music]", "JJEbZQcs7Uw": "[Music] hi Beautiful's I'm yogi guide Hector tontz that enjoyed reading personalizing yoga for you again today this is a big part of sharing so that's the green figs I'm gonna Carlton to the bottom and of the top and then place it into this pot of boiling water which has a bit of salt and a little bit of oil to that I guess like this bananas doesn't stick around okay okay so here we are with the tips cut off and I'm taking them and placing it in the pot take the skin off and literally then put it in the blender with some other good stuff soon to continue so beautiful here's the green bananas or green figs that I've been boiling for at least 2025 minutes you can almost see here where part of the banana inside the green figures poking out so it's all in a bit it lets you know it's cooked I used a cookie a broom - Pearson can see if it's ready but it's ready I can tell sorry and now I'm going to literally take it out of the pot drain it put some cold water over it soak and cool and then take it from here take the skin off it's going into the blender along with some hemp seeds pouring some cold water onto the boiled cooked green fix and cools it down a bit secondhand as you can see the skin has split that's one of the ways you also know that it's definitely ready and receipt of salt and oil in terms of green figs and particular holes already are planting video what I'm gonna do is take the spin off drop it into the blender like that I'm feeling it alright and then I'll do that for the rest of them put it into the blender and we're good to go yeah you see across over to this to work that I'm gonna be making but I'll focus on that this is big much intimacy beloved's as you can see the love it's beautiful there is the green figs in the blender cooling a bit have added half a teaspoon of hemp seed flax seed powder and this is of what happens it's very great all right and then blend it up condensed milk oops sorry bad cinematography there holding the camera or whatever the proper term is but that's the candy in the blender and I'm gonna [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay finished product pouring it into my job put my big

making a mess and we are gonna put it right in yes we're gonna put in all of it I thought we would not we're gonna put in our peanuts and this is like here about a half a cup of crushed freshly crushed peanut can y'all we are gonna put in maybe a one and a half of our banana we don't want we just want to get the taste of the red banana and if you can't get your right but not your banana more right more like effective once with it freckles fine so we are going to use about one and a half we just want to get the banana taste won't go we don't want to overpower or meal here with the banana

this is you're a teaspoon of molasses and tried to get the molasses that looks like this know what more watery okay y'all this is how your molasses is supposed to look right now we are going to put in our malt beverage and that's just it now we're going to remove from right over here now onto the base of the blender and we are gonna just simply puree you know we're gonna have some nice [Music] we are going to get form here out here right really clear and we want to go one more time seems to be good inside there so what I go through I wanna you know you don't want to leave too much of them the

Panchito", "51iNbiruxWY": "I'm chef Mike Moses and welcome to my\nkitchen you know the nose knows in fact there is\na gas station here in Nova Scotia that when you walk through the door you smell\nhome baked banana bread does that entice you to buy banana bread do you bet it\ndoes and it's not cheap but they sell a lot of banana bread and\ngas I'm not gonna sell you anything today and I wish this was smellivision\nbecause we are going to make the best banana bread coming up if you like this channel please don't\nforget to give me a thumbs up and if you would like to see more please subscribe\nI post new videos every weekend right here just for you\nbanana bread brings back lots of memories and a nice warm piece of banana\nbread with a little bit of butter on it it is so so good top nice and crispy the\ninside moist full of banana flavor well we're gonna recreate that and we're\ngonna do it and you need some special things like overripe and bananas don't\nuse fresh bananas let them sit let them get dark let them get over ripe because\nthat just brings out the sugars and brings out the flame for our banana\nbread his robe we're going to need 3 overripe and bananas 1 cup of sugar 1/2\na cup of butter 1 and 1/2 cups of flour 2 eggs beaten 1 teaspoon of baking soda\n1/2 a teaspoon of salt and 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla we're gonna bake\nthat in a 350 degree oven for about 55 minutes let's make some banana bread I\nhave all my ingredients already measured out because of some fun price and\nmeasuring greeting this is no fun but Oh overripe bananas and peeling them that's\nthe fun part I've got my bowl here and I'm just going to take my paring knife\ncut off the tops of the bananas then I'm going to slice all the way down\nopen them up and they are going to be gooey and just drop them in the bowl I\ncan almost smell the banana bread cooking now and don't throw out your\npeels use those in your compost if you have a garden I'll introduce you to a\nlittle friend of mine coming up once we get this all mixed up that I thought\nwould never happen Nova Scotia three overripe and bananas are in the bowl the\nbanana peels go in the compost and they're gonna take a fork I'm gonna\nstart mashing them up now over ripe bananas mash really really easy and you\nwant these to be mashed really really well because you want the flavor to go\nthrough the entire banana bread all right so my bananas are done I'm going\nto add 1/2 a cup of butter and I've already pre melted it\nthat's my unsalted butter that I used exite around and we will incorporate the\nsugar I'll just do half of the cup right now I don't want things to dry out too fast\nand I want the sugar to sleepy melt and we'll add the rest of it so that's one\ncup of sugar and like I said it's my kitchen I love to make a mess\nthat's my wet ingredients okay and I'll get two eggs here and our second egg do\nmy fork I just want to whip them beat them up\nI want your eggs are beat up you add those to the mixture so all the liquids\ntogether and all the dry ingredients will go together as well you want to mix\nit up so that you don't see any yellow of the egg yolk nice and smooth and that\nis our wet ingredients already done sets that aside to end our dry ingredients I\nhave a cup and a half of flour half a teaspoon of salt teaspoon of baking soda\nand of course for a little extra flavor half a teaspoon of vanilla and they're\ngonna mix all those ingredients up all right it's time to add the wet to\nthe dry and I've got a spatula here pour in the banana mixture all of it all of\nit every little bit using my dessert spatula and now I'm gonna start mixing\njust take the flour from the sides and roll it in don't forget to get the flour\non the bottom the oven is preheating to 350 degrees I want to make sure you've\ngot all the flour incorporated what's gonna make this rise is the baking soda\nand the salt and the chemical reaction okay so now I'm going all the way around\nmaking sure I have all the flour from the bottom very nicely mixed I'm gonna\nput this in an ungreased pan just a regular loaf pan non greased loaf pan\npour it in smell the bananas then try not to\ndisturb the sides too much level it out I'm gonna give it a couple of good taps\nto make everything level when the oven comes up the temperature from going in\n55 minutes 350 degrees okay the ovens up the temperature let's\nput the banana bread in the oven and I'd like to introduce you to my\nlittle friend this is an avocado tree I never thought\nI could go on from a seed but here you go so this is Groot and it's about two\nand a half months old he likes a lot of heat which we don't have a lot of in the\nwintertime so grew will be sitting in my office throughout the winter ticking in\nthe sunshine and growing we won't get avocados off it you need to do some\nsplicing and some other things to get out picados but he seems to be a very\nhappy little tree lots of leaves have appeared that I got out of an avocado in\nthe store so my little friend Groot all right we've got the banana bread out of\nthe oven oh it smells phenomenal and then just gonna take a skewer or put it\nin the middle comes out with you dry you're going to have banana bread here\nvery shortly we wanted to let this cool down for about 10 minutes in the pan and\nthen we're gonna put it on a cooling rack so it can cool underneath what I\nwant is an outside that's crispy nice tender inside and then we'll dish up a\nlittle bit you may find that the bread doesn't come out your banana bread\ndoesn't come out all at once that's okay take a knife take a flexible knife it's\njust like this run it around the edges a couple of times and it should just pop\nright out just like that cool still nice and warm I'll let that\ncool down for another ten minutes and we'll slice her up have some banana\nbread okay it is time for the big reveal you're that nice crunchy yeah pieces of\nbanana bread nice and grime flaky in the middle and I'll use some of my homemade\nbutter this is the end of the homemade butter from the last episode what I like\nabout this homemade butter there's a little salt in it so it's a very low\nsodium recipe the outside nice and crunchy mmm they're really good banana\nbread you may have noticed that didn't rise as high as some of the banana bread\nyou see and that has to do with temperature humidity and everything else\nright now in my area we're under a thunderstorm watch the humidity is\nalmost 95 96 % it's very hot very humid didn't allow it to rise much if you make\nthis in the fall it'll rise in another image and a half you can always add just\na little more baking soda mm-hmm well there you go thank you very much for\nwatching if you like this video please don't forget to give me a thumbs up and\nI post videos like this every week so please subscribe also if you'd like more\ninformation head over to my blog the personal chef blog where I post this\nrecipe that you can print off thank you very much for watching I look forward to\nhelping you cook better eat healthier and shop smart", "Dmj42zD8yEs": "it's 5mm you'll let's give this a try [Music] according to the da Lemaitre just a hair over 8 tons there's a slug that came out the bottom [Music] guess my Stringer's could be a little bit stronger not too bad let's try 8-millimeter about 12 tons made to about 15 tons there's the slug for that all in all looks pretty alright I think I need a stronger spring or laughter that this shouldn't be a problem this is some sheet metal I think like a drywall stud I clean the hole comes out of this I don't even make it to 200 psi so after that chop press build I thought it might be interesting to take you guys long for this other ride this what you see here is will become hopefully my first punch and I set I got some of the these two pieces of tool steel this is a K 100 and best I can tell it's about a d3 equivalent and I may use that for the for the die and this is a silver steel or drill rod this is about six tenths of an inch in diameter it's about the size I mean 15 millimeters about the size I you know I thought I'd start off with this is like a W or an o1 something along those lines not exactly sure what the silver steel translation is this is the biggest spring I got and I'm thinking about using it as a kind of a stripper I don't know what thickness material I mean I have an idea of sort of the average and that's what I'll used to dad clearances to the die but I thought this might be a little more handy than say like a fixed stripper plate that's the attachment you guys saw in the shop ghost build so I'm thinking just like a shoulder to hold the spring like a floating donut let's call it act as a stripper and then this punch on the inside and hopefully none of this will move around too much when I try to heat treated here in the garage so the battery on this camera died and I yeah I apologize for poor planning on my part I usually you know decide to make a video kind of last minute and try to find all the bits and pieces but you didn't miss much so I basically just again nothing exciting just took these turn these pieces out of it this is what's going to hold the punch now it's probably not ideal to have a two-piece punch I'm guessing there I've usually seen them with a nice beefy taper you know where they transition but um hopefully this will do the trick and it's just got a bore for fifteen millimeter drill rod wrong way I tapped a little hole there's it through a hole there and a countersink for a little m6 screw so the spring goes on like this that's a sort of a slip fit there let me put it on the side first this is a bit of a tighter fit I didn't want coming off of that end that fits in like that it's a little marker and that should hopefully work as my stripper I don't know if that's beefy enough text rip is that a tool I suppose it depends on the dye clearances that I have but I can always replace this something stronger or maybe even like a urethane the urethane spring so that's tooling should fit in the press now next we got to build the die this is 14 millimeters we're shorting shooting for 15 so we're going for 15 nominal I wouldn't usually drill straight with a 15 millimeter drill but I know this one happens to drill a little bit undersized this will get us to 14 9 something about that and then we can go ahead and part these off and clean them up with a boring bar I always get a little bit nervous a tool steel my experience seems like you hesitate just a fraction of a second and next thing you know it's impossible to machine anymore three quarters of an inch I think should do it gave it just a hair more so we can clean up the other side with a facing cut [Music] okay so we've managed to part off a couple of these 3/4 inch thick dyes I just set this up quick and took a quick clean up cut just face that off now I'm going with a boring bar clean up the sort of that nominal diameter and then cut about a two degree taper after say the first quarter inch seems like a lot maybe a hair short quarter inch five millimeters or so since we're only talking about two degrees of draft it's gonna be hard to see see that inside of there especially inside that 15 millimeter hole so I'm going to do is I'm going to go into the bore until I see the boring bark come out the backside touch off there and start my two degrees in the back and watch that land increase until I come into again that four or five millimeters from the front okay looks alright I think back of my boring bar might have done a little bit of rub in there whose dive all that three millimeters just like we said we were gonna do okay I lost some video there hopefully this punch and dial will work better than yeah and my video skills basically saw me flip the die over just try to square it up with the parallels and I cleaned off the backside now what I'm going to do is switch this out put in the four jaw and I'm going to bore this just a piece of block that had in the in the bin to take that die just kind of a temporary support we've got a little punch mark on there I mean it's not critical but it'd be nice it was pretty close to Center and I've got my got a Center on here I'm just gonna eyeball that that punch mark in I just counterbored a hole in this block take the die like that sticking up maybe 30,000 and put in a couple of holes for some countersunk screws that way I can hold this down and I might pin this to decide I'm not sure what the best way to keep the dye from you know coming back up with the with the punch but I think I just like a spring pin through here maybe a set screw but I think it's a clean spring pin hole or a roll pin hole might be easier to sort of pick up when I make another one of these so I can clamp the whole thing in pick up that same hole and just drill the next die [Applause] all right so we've got a 2m 8 screws and the little bores for the roll pins all right so we've got all our parts laid out I think that's everything but at any rate we need to harden these a bit so I'm going to get the punch in the dot move some of this stuff so no heat treat expert but I think anything we do to these is going to help to improve tool life a little bit as long as we don't as long as they don't end up too brittle so what we're going to do is temper them get them as as hard as they could get and then try to draw some of that back I go by the oxidation color technique I have no real control over this like again this is very Mickey Mouse type heat treating but again I think anything we could do shy of getting them too brittle is only gonna help us out got all my stuff out protective equipment I got the apron on I've got some oil here this may just be superstition but the oil is at room temperature here which is about 17 degrees so 17 degrees what I'm gonna do is just heat up piece of scrap you can see it's it's done this before dunk it in the oil and that'll just take knock some of that edge off of it I always try to get that in there sort of as square as possible and that's where the little fishing poles help out if you dunk it at a bit of an angle you'll get some differential cooling and your parts will turn into bananas and just won't be a happy scene all right so all the way up well this side should still be soft dish you can see that sort of cutting on the file members skating off the end next up is to die okay so the die didn't turn out so well I had to quench it again came out soft so I could scratch it I could cut it with a file I think what happened is I just I'm running low on oil and the preheat plus dunking the punch probably got that too warm and then get him enough sort of thermal shock let's call it harden quite fast enough so I just waited for the oil to cool down not really room temperature just because I wanted to get this done but chillier than before I went through the same exact process dunked it and now it looks like we're still I can still kind of get into the back side but the top skating nice couple of spots I think back here there's a little bit warm I'm gonna call that good okay so now these things are are hard we want to sort of draw that temper back so it's in the in the you know sort of a the tool range and for me that's typically something like this going by the oxide collars about a yellowish straw yellow and but the first in order to see that we're gonna have to get all this oxide and scale and goop off I'm gonna do this on the lathe alright so the four jaw Chuck is on the way that's not going to help our cause here man that's a lot to get off all right should do it all right well meet the world sketches heat treat furnace don't worry I did mitosis before this so I've set it to about 200 it's anywhere from the 230 to 15 range that's probably about as accurate as I can expect from either the toaster oven or the the thermometer here I'm gonna call that good I've got a couple of tiles in there I'm just gonna put the parts in between the tiles just because I don't want any participation from the radiation from the elements in the past that's kind of come back to bite me in the butt because it gets a lot hotter you can get your parts a lot hotter than than what the internal temperature is I made just a simple little wire form just to hold the punch up and keep the tile off of it about 201 i dropped the temperature a little bit from before i don't usually keep the door open this long but i don't think i heard anything so that's what the setup looks like we'll just leave that cook okay so there in about an hour and a half I don't know if you could tell what color they are you probably can't set a hard time myself I'd stick it on to the daylight it's hard to do this kind of stuff under any kind of artificial lighting but there's a piece of white paper for a comparison and you can see sort of that yellow oxide on there could have been just a hair darker maybe I could go in a little bit hotter I took the measurement on the tiles the temperature measure on the tiles that was about 205 206 you know within whatever accuracy that thermometer might be probably plus or minus 10 degrees but I think this should do the job trying to not trying to win a Nobel Prize here but for just kind of playing around and you know the amount of use that we'll see in my hands that's just some loyal goop they're cooked on the oil I think these should do the job so the next step is to touch them up a little bit get them sharp and we can give them a try alright so why not just keep trying to pile on the hacks here I've got the punch in a collet Chuck I've already dressed the smallest stone that I have for this I'm not even sure how long it's gonna last trying to do this and I've got the homemade tool post grinder this is set on 0 the top slide is 5 degrees and what we're gonna try to do is get a little bit of a dish the concave cut in there to try to get sort of the required tonnage down and get sort of it the perimeter exerting most of the force so we'll give this a try I'll start in the center and start working my way out I think this will that way should be a little bit safer in that I expect this wheel to wear down quickly so by the time I get to the outside I won't accidentally cut a concave shape make things worse for me I don't know if you guys can see how much this is here it's maybe thirty thousand uh for not it's not like we're trying to make a water melon baller here let's give it a try would you believe it took me about 20 minutes to find this piece that I just made battery died and I lost that last clip but all they did was get the dye in the tool holder with a couple of roll pins so let's get the rest of this together try this out all right so this will go and this is just temporary [Music] [Music] all right this is a 3/8 about nine and a half millimeters see what happens about 15 15 tonnes and it started dropping away that mark there is from this Bend pretty all right that feels okay alright I think we just need a bigger stripper spring here's a slug by the way you", "N0IBnyhDTuE": "[Music] [Music] so [Music] you", "_Y5Zgr0hpOU": "welcome back everybody today I'm going to be making an easy fresh banana milk drink this is creamy and refreshing to start I'm going to be using two ripe bananas I'm just going to peel them and chop them if you do not have ripe bananas you could just use regular bananas that aren't as ripe you'll just have to add the sweetness in this drink to your taste so I'm going to add all of my chopped bananas into my blender and I'm also going to add four cups of cold water next I'm going to add two teaspoons of vanilla extract and I'm also going to be adding a quarter teaspoon of ground cinnamon now I'm just going to blend this until everything is smooth and creamy now I'm going to add this to my glass picture you'll want to use at least a 2 quart pitcher then I'm going to sweeten it with sweetened condensed milk if you are using bananas that are not as ripe as the ones that I used use the entire can of the sweetened condensed milk I'm also adding one full can of evaporated milk and now I'm going to whisk this together if you're using a spoon that works as well but I find for some reason a whisk does definitely get things going so now I'm going to add 1 pound of ice I'm going to give it a mix and this is ready to serve I hope you give this recipe a try I hope you like it and thanks for watching

it's peanut butter jelly time peanut butter jelly time peanut butter jelly time you you", "Ga6Vr3Ec2Mc": "100 pushups 100 sit-ups 100 squats and 10 kilometres of running repeated every single day saitama's workout routine is quite popular but how effective is this training routine in real life and will you go bald when you do it first we take a look at the exercises every exercise in this training routine is a compound bodyweight exercise this means that they are really effective because they train a lot of different muscles at the same time there are still three major problems when it comes to the exercise selection first there are no pull exercises included push-ups train muscles like the chest the triceps the shoulders and the abs sit-ups are heavily focusing on your hip flexors and abs squats mainly emphasize lower body muscles like the glutes and the quads and running is also a lower body dominant exercise even if it's more endurance than strength focus but what about your lats traps rhomboids and rear delts these muscles are very important to build an evenly trained body not only in terms of looks but also of health neglecting those muscles can lead to imbalances and imbalances can lead to poor posture and injuries the second problem are sit ups sit ups are one of the worst exercises you could do if you want to train your abs effectively one of the issues of sit-ups is too repetitive spine movement doing hundreds of sit-ups every day can wear out your spine and the discs between the vertebrae much faster than it should be another issue of sit-ups is that this exercise heavily involves your hip flexors when these muscles are too tight they can create several problems like for example imbalances and back pain in addition they take away the load from your F's which makes this exercise ineffective for them when you do a set up your apps only work in the first part of the movement in the second part you mainly use your hip flexors to lift your lower back off the ground now you might say all right I'll do crunches instead well the crunch is very effective when it comes to app activation but we still don't recommend to do them too often as mentioned before the problem of the repetitive flexion of your spine is similar in both sit-ups and crunches it's not a problem if you include crunches once or twice a week but don't do hundreds every day the last issue is 210 kilometer running don't get me wrong running itself is not a bad activity but 10 kilometers every day is one of the worst things you can do when it comes to running it's very important to have the right technique and experience if you never ran ten kilometers before you should start with the shorter distance and let your body time to recover especially your tendons and ligaments need time for adaptation so how should the exercise selection look like instead you can keep the push-ups the squats and the running but we sort out the sit-ups and include body rows instead as mentioned before you need an exercise which activates the biceps lats traps rhomboids rear delts and other muscles on the backside of your body the body row is like an inverted pushup and perfect for activating those muscles when it comes to the sit-up and you really want to add an extra exercise for your apps you can replace it with crunches but as mentioned before don't do this exercise every day it's also possible to just stick to push-ups rows and squats because in all those exercises you have to stabilize your body and this also activates your abs now we have to take a look at the training frequency and here we have to ask the question is it really good to train your whole body every single day when it comes to working out you need to understand the concept of super compensation this means that your body needs time to recover after a hard workout you won't build muscle and increase your strength during the workout but in the rest period so if you are a beginner and you do hard full-body workout sessions every day of the week you will sabotage your own progress that is the reason why most beginner workouts include only 3 full body strength training sessions a week of course it always depends on how hard your training is and what exercises you do if you do easy activities like walking cycling or even mobility training you can even support your recovery instead of slowing it down so the most important point when it comes to the amount of training days a week is how challenging the training is if you do exercises which are really hard for you and you train to fatigue in every set every exercise and in every workout you will need more time to recover as if you do easy exercises without exhausting yourself on the other hand if you only do easy exercises or activities you won't get challenged anymore and with that you won't get strong and won't build more muscle even if you train every day if you are an intermediate or advanced athlete you could split your workouts into different muscle groups or body parts like push-pull and legs or upper body and lower body this kind of training allows you to train more often but we still suggest to rest at least one day a week and don't go all out in every session even if you train other muscles your body still needs time to recover as a whole this not only includes muscles tendons and ligaments but also your brain if you are mentally exhausted all the time you won't be able to concentrate on your workout and with that you won't be able to perform well progressive training should always include harder and easier phases with this kind of training you stay away from injury and overtraining and you will be able to max out your gains the last issue we have to face is the fixed amount of numbers 100 pushups for example are much harder than 100 squats most beginners struggle to do even 10 proper push-ups on the ground while they can do 10 squats easy so in order to build an evenly strong body with the right muscle proportions you should do exercises that challenge you on the same or nearly the same level another problem of the fixed reps is that there is no progressive overload 100 pushups a day could be too much for a beginner but if you are already in a good shape it can be too little to improve yourself further if you don't overdo it and stress your body too much it gets used to every kind of training or activity this not only slows down your progress it might even stop it the solution for this is simple add more variety if you just started working out 200 incline push-ups instead of regular ones if 100 pushups on the ground are not challenging anymore try side-to-side push-ups you can also adapt the other exercises for example you can change the angle when doing body rows and you can do jumping squats instead of regular ones if you always adapt the exercise to your level you can constantly improve yourself and avoid stagnation and overtraining alright now let's sum up all points again you do 3 full-body sessions a week and choose variations and progressions that are hard enough but not too hard for you you can also include running but as mentioned before don't start with 10 kilometers and let your body time to adapt and recover after a while you should still change the whole workout structure to improve yourself further and make your gains lasting there are so many exercises variations and ways to train that you would waste your time and potential if you would always stick to the same routine if you are looking for a no-bullshit workout

enjoy nice you", "XC5JTWuzfMM": "hey y'all it's amber and today we're making banana bread so this banana it's pretty easy it starts with a stick of butter white sugar brown sugar flour three bananas mashed you want them to be really really right so that they match easily and they're pretty sweet I'm adding Greek yogurt that will add some moisture vanilla and egg and then on top I'm going to do a streusel which I like the crunchiness of a streusel on top so we're ready to get started we start with our butter and sugar I'm going to put in half a cup of sugar add a cup of brown sugar and then I'm going to mix those together you want to make sure that your butter is room temperature so then it'll crank together pretty easily I always like using a hand mixer because and brings back memories of like my mom they eat and then she always let us lick the beaters alright so that is pre fluffy I'm going to add in one egg and I went ahead and bend it and then over here I'm going to add in my break younger this is vanilla Greek yogurt because that's on I didn't have plain but normally I would put in plain yogurt but I put in the vanilla and just decreased my vanilla extract a little bit so it's only a teaspoon of vanilla extract mix all that together before I put that in I'm gonna mix in our egg and then I'll sit in our flour I don't always stitched but sometimes it really makes a big difference so this is a cup and a half of AP flour do just a little bit of salt this is 1/4 teaspoon teaspoon baking soda and then I'm just going to sit back so this is why you sit frighteners do much left alright so I'm going to mix that in and it's gonna be pre thick because I don't have anything wet in there yet except for a bit so we go in with our wit which is our bananas there is such a thing as over mixing okay I have a lot of fans that I've sprayed and I also have these mini loaf pans because sometimes I have a little battery left over and I don't want to waste it but it's not enough to make a whole another loaf so if you have a bigger love painting probably fit at all actually now for the streusel in this little bowl I have a few tablespoons of AP flour dirt a cup of brown sugar some cinnamon and I'm going to put some cold butter in there and to me the easiest way to do this is just use my fingers because you want to be crumbly so that it's crumbly on top so I'm just going to put the butter in and just start mashing it up with my fingers and when it's cold like this it's kind of difficult at first that you eventually start melting with that butter down I feel like my mom does a lot of things with her hands maybe that's like I always remember seeing my cream both of my grandmother's worked with their hands like biscuits and any kind of bread okay so everything is mushed together and you just want to crumble it on top my fingers do have clean hands step into a 350-degree oven this will probably take like 45 minutes and then our banana bread is done it cooked for about an hour in my oven so I would say anywhere from 45 to 60 minutes it's probably going to be your cooking time just depending on your oven okay so our banana bread is done I like to have the streusel part on top so we flip from pan to a play complaint to this board and like the smell knocks your socks off because it smells so good and the streusel is all pretty on top and melted into the bread and I'm ready to try it tastes like banana so this still approval", "10e7nJOLG5I": "bringing trees", "bptiP4Rglcc": "can we get some hammer bananas in the chat in like chat or comment section

got down like 50 degrees because we lost power and it's been going on and off so hopefully we don't have any issues with this recording but let's go ahead and jump on into it okay yeah we're doing this make sure you're subscribed by the way that we don't don't miss future videos also um we used to be doing lightning used to do picture in picture he still does picture-in-picture he just uh posted it in the animated pip chat on my discord server so check that out because youtube deletes his comments in the past six months when first time i said to train like your life depended on it i don't think your skills will ever improve you have no talent for the martial arts you are hereby expelled from the dojo oh is he the person that he talked about how he hurt all the other students so i could hear any audio right now because copyright like i said youtube started deleting all of lightning's comments he still does it so make sure you show love to him because i don't ask him to do that he does that for you all so hopefully we can uh get that issue fixed with youtube but yeah go was he the student like cause i remember when they went to his dojo he was just like this is your he's your best student he's like well one of my student my best student hurt all the other students he does all that's left i think that's what he said what was the um somebody said with the fabuki blizzard i don't know apparently there's like 30 members in it and they went to rough up saitama yeah i don't think it's gonna happen so is that where garu came from but how was how did he become a monster is he like is it like saitama where like he seems like a normal human but there's something like specials going on with just him you know because like saitama's on basically the level of a god this what is garu on the level of you know it's very interesting here i'll give him that that face freaks me out every time it does that all right oh boy i wonder if king how long can he keep this going on you know it it's so goofy he's so goofy uh why hasn't he moved his acting strangely that's right he changed my training to full contact and he he beat me mercilessly he felt so kind hearted before there's something going on so that wasn't guys something might be i do not know bang like the class s hero silver face okay do you live there now don't know if you saw but we're kind of trying to play games here king relax i guess the group is grown however yeah make an educated guess it probably has the church of saitama the guy who was kicked out of our dojo what did he do i see did i just get the right answer by doing the wrong problem take it garo is now known as a criminal he has been added to the association's wanted list as a violent monster [ __ ] bang himself has volunteered to take him down a monster caro apparently there was an incident that man has been roughed up the association has been keeping it under wraps but should a violent battle ensue it could quickly spin out of control perhaps that is the reason why bang pushed you away apparently it doesn't kill anybody no idea so master bang considers me a burden but possibly my hypothesis your thoughts master i don't know man i mean it's not like you can know the old big brains silver fang now that's a cool hero name yeah keep calling get stuck with caped baldy oh so they've gotten that news there's still one thing bothering me though what mario ko a piss aunt who is bank's current top disciples you two have met huh for real wait when when do they meet what do they mean allow myself to be a burden for the sake of my master i need to stop garo you're going to stop garu it's not like he's gonna pop up right next to me he is going to and even if i did manage to find it might only uh numb nuts numbnuts i never thought i would hear that in anime or shorty yes movement writer i'm called moon writer hunt what on earth hunting heroes this entire discussion is a bit odd to kind of leave my evolution into a monster i don't like that prey like you there you are tank top you sure this is the guy oh my god it's all tank top guys now time for a little payback oh right in the face you're here seeking vengeance tank top vegetarian i left you within an inch of your life and now you throw that life away oh his teeth are all stupid your muscle head friends will be there so oh is he actually killing them i thought he didn't kill yeah i hear you roughed up my friend oh he's the s-rank or the class s looks like i hooked a big one this is perfect i'm free he's the one picked up i think i wonder what gym they all work out at oh my god he's super fast dude he does not skip like that signature the tank top tackle has taken out tons of monsters even though it wasn't a tackle and lane did it perfectly no way now watch things like that you got lucky freak who in the hell is this guy he's very good is he i'm human he might be have you put all your affairs in order i'm an old man alone in the world the same as you don't master ridiculous i'll have you know i bid farewell to several hundred disciples this man doesn't have a sprinkler you had to come to your younger brother's aid and for that you have younger brothers well oh so he's super old he'll come after my dojo soon enough of course i came we must be careful with this one brother you cannot imagine how fierce and powerful that wretch may have become by now [Music] one thing's for certain what i'm saying he's human but then why why are my senses telling me to kill him here and now wow that's weird oh god he's been blood with a punch a movement writer's gonna save his life oh my god moving right just took it right to the face have you forgotten who you are a class-ass hero on the verge of killing a human you already won the fight we're supposed to protect people this bastard attacked a hero it's his own damn fight he attacks movement writers though he's a legend he says is true i didn't know dude so girl identifies do harm to humans listen up let this be a lesson to never uh he's definitely gonna stop his evil ways yeah all right i'm leaving sorry for the trouble what i can't believe that you're about to say slaughter every last one of you [ __ ] that's too bad but expect it you die right here right oh my god right in the face oh my god he said no you like it i try to avoid using the old geezer style i can't believe that oh my god is this what the silver fang is capable of no way he was hiding his true strength yes a class s hero down on his knees don't think you've won you caught me off guard so is he just class s because he can bench more than the rest shut up and stay right where you are you got a front row seat to see garo the monster murder all your bros he doesn't kill people though no he's that human who calls himself a monster gonna put that together no please don't do it leave them alone how did he get that much height um oh no oh god that's so much blood that's not good no which one of you is next i really hope you survived that i don't know if you could that fighting style of yours is pretty predictable you're all done tank top master i think i've mastered that so what's left is a little clean-up as he's going to cut through all of you like he's carving a cake like it's embarrassing himself the fact that they're still trying to fight like every like fist fight in a movie ever so you're going to stop garu huh [Applause] that's enough you're a disgrace to the dojo did he just die did you get turned into confetti it seems we have arrived too late truly the horrible side to behold are they all dead so tell i don't see moomin rider do you have any idea what garo's next move might be and the fact they're still there probably means they're dead oh well he's beat up pretty bad okay he sees his former student or that the hero hunter took down tank top master no way he defeated a class s hero what are these outfits tops disciples and movement writers he's got to be b-class so he's hunting heroes from class s and class c what are we supposed to do come on show a little backbone will ya how about the three of us capture this hero hunter ourselves what are you going to do he beat a class s remember yeah yeah but think about it isn't some scary monster he's just a tough human being yeah but he learned how to fight from silver fang who happened he happens to be everywhere also if an opponent comes at you like this complex attack from the front first you dodge then punch hi he's there and he's really tall i can't believe you came all this way to see me moomin writer's alive yes sure yes some bananas on the way ah that sounds great bananas that fruit i've never eaten well apparently i ate it when i was a baby but i read about the first thing that happened in the hero association of course i don't remember it it said that dozens of heroes were beaten by a single butt kicking monster but they're not dead here i have a banana his arm's probably probably did it what but he called himself a monster and he was tough as hell scary strong for a human being was he stronger than that fish monster thing we faced before yes while deep sea king was insanely tough this guy was different somehow oh his moves what they're supposed to have martial arts techniques it seems silverfang raised a true monster when he turned that freaking guy oh tank top master uh who's this guy that butted into our conversation what that's tank top master the classic hero oh he's alive the newspaper it said he took it i guess they all survived at least he hasn't left the best fight damn i never imagined i'd lose to a punk like him those martial arts he used were brutal as hell martial arts how about a banana banana fixes everything does it really so this monster guy my neighbor oh nice ball cap my kid oh whoa he just teleported interesting looking book you got there wait is that a dude oh he didn't kill him he's a class s hero he's the strongest ever and this

whatever's at the end of this episode let's see what it is what do you got in store for us it's the aftermath of garuk and karate chopped that explains the intro scene this doesn't he like cut it down not too shabby master has it come to that hey it's not like that i'm not planning to wear a wig the rest of my life for anything hello doctor jenno's here there is an emergency no it has to do with master saitama's condition it's created artificial hair fibers is it possible for them to be grafted in the living skin yes it appears necessary after all black hair fibers are available correct how soon would you be able to perform the implant procedure wait so tommy can get hair stay next week all right then yes i too will be there understand cool preparations dinners looking out for them begin

all day he's been looking all day for orange hair wig thing and he just happened to run into garu it does it not wait that means saitama wasn't trying because if he was trying there's no way he would have survived so that was just kind of like a like get why what are you trying to do peasant get away from me like stop that was gonna like he shoot a fly away because like he wouldn't do that to like just a civilian like he if a civilian tried to rob him he wouldn't just like make them explode so he wasn't trying and still was able to do that but gary did say he's going to get stronger so we're going to see how he holds up against that maybe all this like practicing is like building up his strength maybe i don't know it's certainly going to be interesting maybe he'll enter that tournament

give me the energy and feed my brain feed my brain so my red banana is in it then i'm gonna add two tablespoons right two tablespoons of my roasted oats powder i've already poured it out but you don't have to pour it out all the time i just do that because i'm always baking with it right and it's easy to make my cookies when it's poured out like that now once i've added my oats and my banana in my blender i'm gonna just add one teaspoon of ulama seeds so i have one teaspoon of my pumpkin seed one teaspoon of my sesame seed calcium right one teaspoon of my sunflower seed okay getting my protein in there for my sunflower seeds one teaspoon of my flaxseed flaxseed is a very good source of omega-3 fatty acids which is essential for your body to be in good health and one teaspoon of my chia seed chia is also a very good source of calcium and other essential vitamins and minerals so there we have it the five seeds are in the oats is in your right banana is in right and then i'm going to add

be thick enough so you have to eat it we don't want to drink it down too fast right you want to take mouthful by mouthful and eat it so because this is so nice and thick i'm gonna have it with a spoon let's take a spoon [Music] praise the lord praise the lord all right now that is one awesome breakfast alternative for the entire family we're going out to work but remember you cannot leave your house without the word the word the word and prayer so i woke up early this morning i already had my prayer i already had devotion but i have one more word for you guys so i'm going to read for you from psalm 115 the heading is god is truly glorious not unto us oh lord not unto us but unto thy name give glory for thy mercy and father truth sake wherefore shall they he then say where no is there god a question but our god is in the heavens he has done whatsoever he has pleased hallelujah their idols are silver and gold the work of men's hands they have moats but they speak not eyes have they but they see not they have ears but they hear not noses are they but they smell not they have hands but they handle not feet have they but they walk not neither speak they throw through their throat mercy mercy mercy it they that make them are like unto them so is everyone that trusts in them trusting stop behaving like whatever you focus your mind on number nine says o israel o israel o israel praise the lord trust thou in the lord he is their help and their shield oh also aaron trust in the lord he is their help ana their shield ye that fear the lord trust in the lord he is their help and their shield the lord have been mindful of us he will bless us he will bless the house of israel he will bless the house of aaron he will bless them that fear the lord both small and great the lord shall increase you more and more you and your children hallelujah praise the lord ye are blessed of the lord which made heaven and earth the heavens even the heavens are the lords but the earth he has given to the children of men the heavens even the heavens belong to god by the earth the earth that we occupied he god has given it to the children of men 17 the dead prayer is not the lord neither any that go into silence the dead cannot praise the lord that is silent they are in the grave waiting for the resurrection morning whether it's the first resurrection which is the best one unfortunately this second resurrection which is for the wicked we do not want to be the second resurrection one come up in the first resurrection when christ shall converse children 18 and last but we will bless the lord from this time forth and for evermore praise he the lord now the commentary in my study bible the commentary on verse 8 says a law of the human mind it is a law of the human mind that by beholding we become changed man will raise no higher than his conceptions of truth purity and holiness if the mind is never exalted above the level of humanity if it is not uplifted by faith to contemplate infinite wisdom and love the man will be constantly sinking lower and lower so my friends if the only thing you do is focus on the things of this earth you can't rise above what you force your mind on so you have a focus in mind and god focus your mind on heavenly things and as you focus on god the holy spirit takes you higher higher higher to a higher reality silver and gold and all these things and the earth is passing away the lord word stands forever and christ is coming back for his children the last commentary on verse 17 says dead do not praise god the dead do not praise god popular theology represents the righteous dead as in heaven entered into blissed and praising god with an immortal tongue but hezekiah could see no such glorious prospect in death with his words again the testimony of the psalmist quote in death there is no remembrance of thee in the grave who shall give thee thanks question the dead praise not the lord neither any that go down into silence and that's quoting from psalm 6 verse 5 from psalm 115 verse 17 coming from the book the great controversy page 546 by helen g white the dead praise not the lord the living praise the lord the dead is asleep until the resurrection we thank god for his holy word we thank him for healthy breakfast options we thank him for jesus christ his son for his holy spirit and his angels and as we go this morning we go all charged body is further spirit is further covered under the let us go in the name of jesus let us pray heavenly father we thank you for your grace and your mercy thank you for your word thank you for your holy spirit thank you for your son and thank you for being our father who art in heaven lord indeed the heavens and heavens are yours and you have given the earth to the children of men we thank you lord no man has destroyed the earth but jesus christ was replaced adam is coming back and he's gonna completely recreate this earth we look forward to the return of our lord and savior lord ask your blessing over my life over my son over family members and friends i pray for our staff for friends and clients all over the world i pray almighty god for your children from the north and seoul the east the west and we thank you great god that you have not left us orphans that jesus has sent the holy spirit to convict us of truth and of justice and of sin help us lord to walk the narrow road that goes through the straight gate that leads to everlasting life this is our prayer with thanksgiving for all of your children on this platform all of your children lord as we minister day after day to your children calling them autobabble and babylon calling them into the arms and the safety of jesus the ark of safety is jesus and we enter in moment by moment day by day by the power of your holy spirit thank you lord jesus for being our advocate that you're in heaven advocating and our interceding on our behalf you are our high priest our intercessor and we look forward to your return we thank you for your love and we send love right back to you thank you heavenly father for your goodness your grace and your mercy as we pray with thanksgiving in jesus sweet and holy name amen amen there you have it guys god bless you all from dr dibs have a wonderful work day", "0rLxfK2W2jk": "[Music] we are going to make some banana puns fig punch smoothie let's begin this is the ingredients that you would need for this recipe let's get started we are using two ounces of granola three green fig or bananas 2 ounces of sweetened condensed milk we're going to add everything into the blender and give it a good blend unless you want to have little chunks of granola then you know it is not a blended as long as I did all right so I am NOT going for any big bits and pieces of granola in my mouth so as you can see it is very smooth I'm very refreshing now if you don't want this as thick as you are seeing here you could also add more ice or my used 1 cup of ice so you can add an extra cup all right and this is how I made my green banana smoothie or green figs Marie or green fig punished however you call it in whatever country are looking at this so guys thanks so much for stopping by don't forget to Like subscribe and share if you haven't already and have a blessed and wonderful evening bye", "WehSYvqc4DA": "[Music] hey guys it's Mike and Holly you got a new game today called fruit punch dance so this is gonna be a quick Matt Matt quick well you what you wanna do is you wanna oh and I do you need today let me go games for sending this to us it does squeak dogs right outside so what you have to do is where each gonna have piles of cards and we have to flip one card on the top face over they need to be shuffled you're the dealer so go ahead and chocolate and the idea is to keep a fast pace and try to get 5 of the same fruit once you see five of the same fruit on the table from the cards that have been flipped over you pop the banana and then you get to if you're cracked you get to keep those cards five five okay so we're gonna take our deck we're gonna distribute them evenly the whole deck if you have four players you just you read four players I guess we're just gonna play two because it's just us two which it's two to six players okay so so you keep your cards face down and on our turn we flip over the cards and once there are five matching fruits so like five bananas total or five strawberries total you pop the banana this is cookie time and if you're correct you get to collect all the face-up cards now in the directions it says that you put them back into your stack we kind of think that that would make it go back on your stack that means you're ready to play them again potentially the game could go in my mind on and on and on ever end because I could do very well but build a big pile and then all of a sudden you get on a winning streak and you build your pile up and it could go back and forth so what we think we're gonna do is as we win the top cards we're gonna set them aside and we'll just kind of see what happens from there so I guess I'll go first you see deals oh I was ready to flip you gotta watch for those fives cuz there are some I was ready to flip my card and I'm ready to pop I need to do that oh do you like what oh wow look at you well if if I know that's already three lemons and you know to be liars yeah them suck and I see two limes I know I've got it click I don't know we both kind of made that motion it was six now this does make it a little bit more difficult with just two players because there's only two piles if you've got four or six players you've got a better stylist going to potentially make matches what happens if we get too young and there's that's why you're supposed to I think put the cards who got it I don't know I think you motioned first but I think I got there first I'll give it to you that's that's a lot of cars a lot of cards I don't know I'm not sure you really want it all guards now who flipped it I don't remember oh oh you got that one those are five those fibers okay let's see how fast that went we're at the bottom of our deck already it's not about fastness the problem is it could keep going on and on and on but I think that's the whole idea though is to get to the bottom I think I got that okay you ready ace just a fiver get ready oh okay well then let's do your thing you've got the larger pile than me what do I do with this one put it on the bottom of the pile oh because your pals know that's nothing that needs to stay there okay okay so we're gonna continue on and see maybe at some point yes somebody's gonna run out of cards just it could go on for hours ah think guys a split second quicker oh you know we need like instant replay you have on the camera but I don't know until I have it oh my gosh now see there now this time you're doing don't end up the big pile yeah I went no oh no what happens I'm supposed to you're supposed to give me a car card as a penalty I put it on top oh I guess stay there then I guess so what are those doing over there I don't know I must have put them off to the side thinking that we were putting our cards off to the side yeah cuz I had to grab my pile and restart I guess just throwing on the bottom there your cards I just didn't know why they're over there yeah well I laid card so you lay a card now okay there's time does that count I don't know I don't know that's definitely not in the direction yes okay but we won't count that how good I don't know I think I might have got there faster no okay wait before we go any further our hands need to be on the table okay because you're if one of us is a player but yeah it's be fair oh wait I think think of us me no you got it just me second faster Oh would you see how I was [Music] Oh see see see yeah okay not even the thing fruit mmm oh those are good piles I'm getting pretty depleted here very pop look at this yeah take mine as well okay there's no way your ear supposed to flip away from you oh yeah you are and you flip over so you are getting I was doing it too yeah we're all doing this together it's backwards isn't it see I can't I can't look that way I can't flip that way of course I'm doing soft-handed too oh dang it okay but it's like one card one card look easy no penalty my penalty I saw five strawberries I got excited it's worth the risk yeah I'm about out of cards and that is good that's it you're out oh my gosh like I still got one card no I'm out if it would have been anything other than aplomb like I knew that was a five I'd have been there right right away okay oh that it went through that time but I could have got a big piles then she go back and forth yeah so the first time I got a bigger pile then the second time you got a bigger pile and then I want clearly but I mean the odds of probably pretty good yeah I guess in theory it could just keep going and going and going that's kind of part of the fun of it I think but wow I'm I was more or less can we've have to film a video long yes and if it went three hours long I'm always thinking like this hood go on oh no and if we keep adding those cards back in which life and it does say the games tend to run about 15 minutes so that's about right yeah look at the time when though he and I 11 minutes he and I are pretty equally uh talented I think when it comes to this type of game so it's fun and you get four players you've got four six players you've got that many piles keep an eye on two other matches about all the different types of I think if you're going around and you're trying to like match up more sets of cards that's definitely gonna make it trickier competitive yeah it's easy when it's just two players cuz it's you know right now what you look for right away where if there's cards around the table yeah you gotta kind of there was a deep fruit punch game so thanks for watching guys be sure to thumbs up

stands for extraordinary eric if you want to be a dick about it but i decided not to isn't that kind of your thing yeah it is it is um folks the e the e stands for extraordinary that's what i was waiting for eric you're going to be a dick about it welcome to strain on society everyone all seven of you appreciate it um i have a guest today you can see him to my left he's the co-host of what are you the co-host of it's the least we could do the least you could do is tell everybody the least you could do is remember the name of the [ __ ] podcast i just gave it i remembered it i wanted you to i hate to i tend to over talk it's a it's a little show that we do live on saturday evenings from 8 p.m to 10 p.m uh myself my partner in crime mr jimmy preston and our intrepid producer kyle bauer what an adjective to use for kyle in traffic if he watched the show he would see it that's true statement well dwayne's not also oh no only the co-host because they only do that once a week and it's not like the other hours of the week he just sits there turned off he's got a father he's got a father he is a father how about that he's a husband uh right now he's also a professional teacher you could probably tell looks like every teacher i ever had uh he's from he's a louisiana native uh yet not racist so go figure uh how man that took a lot of work i know a lot of those folks that aren't racist uh they're all black uh but yeah let's start off with that because you know earlier this summer obviously the civil unrest things uh the apple george floyd and duane and i talked a lot throughout that process because for me we're both members of the austin facial hair club and in the bearding world uh a lot of people showed their asses and it was i don't know if i was surprised as much as just really disappointed we raised a [ __ ] ton of money for non-profits and um in low-income areas in our community in austin but we do this all over the [ __ ] world so what were your thoughts when you started seeing that happen uh in our beard community in particular honestly man like i didn't i don't know a lot of those people well yeah i don't either they were facebook they're i mean because we're on facebook i don't know a lot of them well either yeah we we schmooze at beard comps and whatnot and have a good time but there was never really any any deep conversation about you know your theories on life and whatnot right there was no like connection connections no no i mean that's hard with something that's that's normal because when we're at comps there's a lot of people uh oftentimes we're hosting and you're running around doing things and also chatting with people getting drunk but um yeah you don't sit down and have like a hour-long deep discussion with anyone and who have you know we're always [ __ ] up anyway i mean to be honest we all it's not like that time where i like tell me about you know what do you think about metaphysics i mean don't get me wrong there's been some good connections with some people through the writing community you know but was i surprised no i wasn't because what i was surprised by was the amount of people that i've known my entire life that i i held some some sort of deep respect or love for that i never would have thought that i heard some of the things coming out of their mouths i never would have thought i would have heard those things come from their origins you know what i mean and all of a sudden it growing up where you grew up in louisiana and yeah a lot of folks that haven't left that you know growing up louisiana has known the south it's deep south um you know my mom from alabama uh father west virginia but even grew up in ohio you know your kid you hear that you there's racism you know it exists and all that right and i guess that's surprising when i realized if i recognize that they're friends that are my age now they still hold those beliefs and then they're also often attached to that is they've never left the town they grew up in and they've never let go of those beliefs that they you know that that were created from that place in time there's a lot of places across our country like that all you gotta do is drive through louisiana all the way down into florida uh i made that trip before an rv or coming back and it was is a lot of places that time forgot that feel forgotten um yeah and i and i understand that we drove through some places where all the industry's dead they all were you know manufacturing or whatever so i was uh i would see a lot of trump signs in those spots oh yeah well i was i was i was happy that you were out smoking about it and and um occasionally i felt you know out there like uh it was just it's just nice to know that you have a team or a tribe of people that are there um yeah and that and that was great that was a great experience to have you and jimmy and a lot of my friends from doing personal development work um to me there felt like a stronger bond going between all these different people right uh for that reason and it was only for that reason of like we were like what the [ __ ] shut the [ __ ] up [ __ ] you uh i don't i personally don't i don't want to be involved uh i i won't be involved with with people uh of that mindset and i get to pick who i hang out with and [ __ ] them that's kind of how i felt but i i was i was angry it made me realize the biggest thing that it made me realize was that over the last i don't know five ten years i've done a pretty good goddamn job of picking my friends because they're all not [ __ ] so you know what i mean yeah yeah yeah and yeah i think that's true is being surrounded by the group of people we're surrounded here in austin it is and often in and of itself is it's not like you go out to bars on the east side and stuff and you're going to get hit in the face with some racism and [ __ ] because i should know why after proud boys who went to the east side and started trying to start some trouble a couple years ago and left in ambulances yeah they got beat the [ __ ] down so it's not like so it's not it's not something that's in our face i mean you live up north a little more so you you might have some experience with that more in in in my world here in austin is it like that and i've lived in hawaii before like that where everybody really brown so maybe it didn't really happen i i don't like i'm up in flugerville which is a little bit northeast of austin not by much but it's just making me look younger by the way if i do no not at all it's like my wrinkles countervail is a little bit more diverse than some of the other ones like if you like if you go see the park leanne okay okay it's a little different but flugerville is pretty diverse a lot of biden support in that area you know so i saw that they did i actually did a new special um because trump had uh had begged suburban housewives you know for for their votes and everything yeah how do you know that flukerville was one of the cities where um the housewives were listening and they didn't like what they heard it was also i was driving the other day um i just went for a drive and went i was going to zilker park um when it's closed as they prepare for um whatever the christmas thing they do i forget what it's called oh the lights but they start doing that at october uh the day after halloween so i didn't know that and so i ended up just driving around it and going up up the hill there that goes through like the west side with some mansions and [ __ ] and i swear to god dude every other house had a biden sign and i was just kind of taken aback but we weren't far far west like um b's caves you know it's still austin but i was pleasantly surprised that just about every house had a biden sign in it in the front yard not the front yard you can't see the front yard because they're gated but in the tree line on the other side of the gate uh or the wall they retreat and i was just kind of like oh wow that's really uh interesting and and i'm and happy to see that uh yeah well pleasantly surprised i guess is what i felt i made i made quite a few trips back to louisiana during this since march because uh you know had some sick family members my stepfather passed away a few weeks back and man it's a punch in the gut to like get out of travis county into these more rural texas areas and man it's tell you right before the election right so i'm like man is this [ __ ] gonna win again like it's a strong possibility this [ __ ] might win again yeah i don't know why people thought it would be such a landslide i did not for a moment think it was gonna be a land i thought it'd be close i don't know we'd still be sitting here waiting but it doesn't surprise me because it's right up to trump's alley uh but i didn't think it was gonna be that i mean there was way way too much trump support i saw um i i thought mine would win and i would have probably admit that a lot of that was hope and yeah but i didn't think it'd be close i didn't think it'd be a landslide and i'm i'm disappointed uh because that is a reflection of a value system where our country is divided on a lot of values um and i'm i've been thinking like how do we breach that and one thing i have found uh that was a blessing i guess out of that was how many states legalize cannabis and red states or what we would consider conservative states so um i i do see a bridge between red blue and what we are is cannabis might be that um common ground because no matter what political stripe it seems that people want to want it legalized i mean i'm not talking about texas because what the [ __ ] we're doing i have no idea well uh we smoke we obviously don't give a [ __ ] because we smoke anyway there's a bill going up in texas this next session you know i posted about it when it happened it was and it's a senate senator elect you're not even in yet i i didn't understand that uh i worked in government and all this stuff it's funny that that texas state senate only meets every other year or only uh votes on law and i was like whoa so he got it so i read that he got that in so it would be voted on uh 2021 and uh man i'm how do you get one of these cake jobs where you only have to work once every other year right the [ __ ] well well what the [ __ ] what do they do the year that they're not in session i mean they're all it's always people there i guess i haven't been uh exposed to this form of governing so um let's let's run for office i i thought about it um that's right you've ever seen [ __ ] in my background dude you run for mayor i'm gonna run for sheriff as of right now see that would be great you know i always think about uh if you've seen the movie the the documentary um gonzo about hst uh hunter s thompson uh it always referred to the the guy that was sheriff that was supporting his run for sheriff and he's always smoking weed with his [ __ ] uh his with his uniform on and i've always liked see that's the kind of sheriff that that we need um a little calm down understands the people and uh gets a little off of it gets more off of the uh more of the serve and protect versus the law enforcement um neither of us have to worry about that because we're whiter than lily white damn near transparent and i've never had a [ __ ] problem living here um or anywhere i've ever lived smoking pot openly and uh and a lot of from my friends that aren't white have um so that's something that i'd be great to change i love living in austin when i moved here it was the first time that i was in a spot where you know you just [ __ ] smoke weed in the street and not wear it yeah nobody's gonna give you guff really i've done that everywhere i've lived um never really i mean i can't say i haven't thought twice about it uh but i've definitely pushed it and i always refer back to when i lived in columbia heights in uh washington dc at the time was a it was more low income it was just going through the beginning of gentrification and um when we lived there a lot of my friends that i had uh there that i met through a bar i managed and all that and they were they were black and um my landlord in the house behind us we had a backyard and then it was all row houses so there was an alleyway going behind the row house and all that there was shady [ __ ] going there so cops would patrol it often and we were barbecuing my uh landlord had this beautiful like brick grill uh it was just gorgeous we would have grill on it often and i was out there with my friends and one of them had a blunt and i was like let's smoke the blood and they're like well okay let's go inside i'm like nah man we can smoke it right here and uh my friend duck was like no you can smoke it right here yeah i was just kind of like whoa like i didn't even consider that and they're like these guys are from that neighborhood you know what i mean like i'm new to it i'm the outsider white guy and uh and in their own community they raised they were just i was i was taken aback and it was a good moment for me to to recognize that oh [ __ ] being white does have a privilege to it uh i just never noticed i didn't know how would i know nobody's ever stopped me or smoking a weed and they have arrest records for cannabis possession like get the [ __ ] out of here so dumb um i i mean growing up in south louisiana in especially late 80s early 90s we spent all our time hiding in [ __ ] cemeteries smoking weed trying to stay away from the public you know that's something that you definitely did whether you were white white or black yeah cemeteries were probably some of the first places i ever went because i was a punk rocker and a lot of girlfriends so that was their go-to just hang out place i think that's right around when i first started smoking weed was going to those i just let everybody know that duane isn't far away dwayne is betraying the camera he actually there he is we just wanted to let you guys we want to do this live and it's more fun and actually uh duane saw the interview i did with uh our friend joe uh that i released this past wednesday a poet's breath and as joe was talking about the story that happened that christmas and dwayne the guy dwayne gave him a ride home it was after all these questions or whatever that's doing i [ __ ] yeah that's funny because i i i recognize as i might have been telling you that the whole story joe was telling about the brownie story at christmas and i kept saying that he had holes in it and i was gonna point out what really happened afterwards and i was smoking that uh mendo breath and it's a super strong indica and so by the time i just ended the interview the only reason i ended it was because you know when you get hit with that i just want to watch t like my brain i was doing well and then it was just kind of like oh [ __ ] like i was hot and i didn't want to talk i didn't want to think i wanted to like stare at bob's burgers or something that i don't have to think about it's gonna make me laugh and so i would and so i never told the end of the [ __ ] story until dwayne brings up a very great point go ahead tell them the best part of that day and that's probably not the part of the story you wanted to hear but the best part of that day for me is your [ __ ] apartment was packed right wait there's like 40 people we were sitting on over on this opposite end of the balcony that i'm on it was you me doc and joe and we had probably a two-hour conversation about comic book movies oh i do remember that and it was amazing philosophical just it was a beautiful conversation joe [ __ ] disappeared and i was like where where the [ __ ] joe go you know he's gone so i went inside doc's like oh so you can go find him so i go inside i'm listening i'm looking in the kitchen looking in the kitchen i thought he was gonna grab some more sham and no joe no joe anywhere and uh isn't this a pop smoking show i'm gonna light this joint paul yeah um and i didn't see joe for like 20 minutes and when he came out of that bathroom he was not the same person that he was when he went in like he was not he was not the same dude that i was having a conversation about comic books on the balcony it was like a [ __ ] zombie dude here's how it went down so we i remember that conversation now because i don't know it was you i remember me joe and somebody else i cut the brownies all the same size and they were definitely big boy sizes they were like they fit in your hand what about you because we were in the kitchen and there wasn't a whole lot of people there yet maybe there were there was a lot of people there but about 45 minutes later he came up to me and he's like hey paul you're thinking about eating another brownie and i was like no i was like i gave a hand size and i said he's like well it's been about 45 minutes i was like bro give it i said i'd give it at least an hour hour and a half before i'd make any kind of choice like that he's like i got you and then an hour or so later i see him sitting on the stool and uh right up against the what the [ __ ] is that called the the wall kitchen the kitchen no the how it's open and there's the bar area on the kitchen on the countertop [ __ ] yeah excuse me so he he was sitting like this and his head was kind of like this his sweat was dripping down his face and i stopped i looked like joe you're all right he was like uh i said he ate a second brownie didn't you he was like yeah and i was like i told you man damn he was like i think i gotta go and i was like well because i think he had taken a bus there over here and i was like all right man well we'll get you home he wasn't driving then no because i think brian even said he'd give her i think we'll get you settled and if you need to lay down you certainly can and he said i go to the bathroom and then i was like at least a half hour gone by for luckily we have two bathrooms uh but somebody was like man whoever's been in your bathroom have been there for a minute i knew i was like oh [ __ ] knocking on the door hey i'm okay i'm okay all right so he gets up and i love how he tells the story about all the bikers it's so funny because it's funny because we know these people like tony and all them and uh tony's not a biker he's a mechanic um and uh but we all like bikers yeah look like a stereotypical bike it's so hard you're a biker i mean some people are but it's not like we just look like that and everybody also wears cuts and uh has club patches and everything on so his memory after that the first time he messaged me he was just like you know the nicest bikers i've ever met i was just laughing about it but so we did like we we formed a egg shell around him to get him downstairs because joe's a big boy and if he went down that could be it's a first a a concrete staircase and it would also if he got any momentum behind him he'd wreck whoever was in front of him easy and that was me and i was just as high as he would well not just i only ate one brownie and uh yeah anyway so i did i didn't bring that up in the show the whole because he he told that at brian's memorial he also left out the the second brownie in that one uh maybe that's just how he makes himself feel good anyway he had left i came back in i walked by the bathroom and i just looked in it because there was a scent coming from it and it was spotless i mean it was spotless so i knew he did something and i was like man it smells clean in the bathroom but it didn't it smelled like he had double dutched uh you know and i've been there i've double dutch before and it's not fun and he cleaned it up but he still could smell it so i had to go after you guys left i had to mop the bathroom and i couldn't plan just walking by it it was grossing me out but it's all funny and i get it we've all we've all all been there uh but uh now i get to end the story with wayne because it's the part of the story but joe doesn't ever tell it fully correct and at the same time we're all high too so there could be some distortions and even my memory of it um but i remember it so strongly because it was just funny like he said in the in the in the podcast he felt like obama because he had security trail secret security um he what he said about the ride home was absolutely true though like i did just i asked him random questions the whole way home because he was just oh i could imagine dude he got and i've never gotten that place off of weed i don't think that i've gotten like literally uh nauseous and sick i mean i've gotten too high where kind of just melt into somewhere but i don't know if people react to it differently i'm not saying i was just like it was hard for me to gather like are you nauseous or like you hear it all the time don't talk [ __ ] about edibles the minute you talk [ __ ] about edibles oh they're gonna kick you in the balls and he thought he even admitted other thing when i came out who had asked was all right he's like i can handle my [ __ ] or whatever he had said you know okay second off this now that dwayne's smoking weed this is a weed show uh well it's a conversation show about conversation and everything too i just want to mention dwayne and i are both drinking this so i a couple episodes ago i explained that there's a coffee company called bean flickers and they're uh we're having we're having discussions about sponsorship and is that really the name bean flickers yeah my friend my friend's a total [ __ ] clown man he's a star i met him outside in a parking lot of a karaoke joint in uh in outside of waikiki in hawaii years ago and i was super high and drunk and he was standing out there telling jokes to his friend and he was so goddamn funny that we ended up with our friends and that was just how we met and um so a couple weeks a couple episodes ago i did the goat wait a minute you liked him right away i was put off by him right away which then made me that makes more interesting made him interesting no i wouldn't say i liked him he's a pro because you generally try not to like people you're very unsuccessful at not liking people because you try very you did the same thing with me that you did your touch i care too well i had a reason talk was annoying uh when i first met him carrying around that goddamn briefcase handcuffed to his hand what the hell i almost i almost brought it with me tonight today oh [ __ ] um and i've seen him around the writing circles before and uh he was just loud and boisterous and and we've already seen each other and talk well the first time i met him he was on like almost trying to pick a fight with me patrick jeffrey and uh was it you nelson brian nelson no brian wasn't brian it was someone who was after a meeting and we went down to uh liberty and we were playing darts and he told us to quiet down and i was yeah i heard that story from his side so you know it's funny he said the same thing i didn't like that [ __ ] paul guy yeah that's all right i don't like me sometimes too so then again we went back to liberty or uh we're at the grapple sorry we back the grackle and jeff ray comes out jeffrey doesn't drink anymore he was really drunk at the time we had we were playing cards that night out at our friend andrew's house up north and he comes out with brian i gotta introduce you to brian and i was just like oh so brian said downtown that's the attitude i had and then i actually saw him perform and uh at the weapon and we got outside and just were talking and he was very vulnerable and raw and i read his book um and his book is called uh um squalor squalor and it's filled with squalor and he's also just super vulnerable super raw super real in his way he writes and as soon as i finished his book and then we were sitting outside i was like god damn it i like this [ __ ] i don't want to like him you know i mean like i don't want to like him but i do and then they ended up joining the official air club and uh we and if you guys we me and joe talked a lot about brian last time and he was one of our members of our club a deer member he's an artist uh from brooklyn and uh he passed away last year um at the grackle as a matter of fact about it so i don't know how we got off on that but we sure do miss that mother and the dude was uh a curmudgeon except he was young curmudgeon but we'd have got uh to hear his commentary through the last through this year 2020 oh my god that would have really well i think we have seen the best of brian uh doc's work come out because he would have been shredding this whole this whole year in all the participants shortly shortly before he passed away um he and i had spent quite a bit of time talking about doing a show because we had done some stuff together on other show we had been on other shows together and we were like man we should just do it and like the saturday before he passed away we were talking on the phone about we used to do these uh double feature movie nights at his apartment and we would pick these two random stupid ass movies we were starting like eight yeah that's why i never went they started eight that's why diane never went because we'd instead of watching movies in our house to fall asleep on the couch we just gonna go with ryan's fall asleep on his car we just walk across the street to st rocks afterwards and smoke weed on the patio you know i've definitely done that with him i've done a lot of things at st rocks but but we had talked that saturday night about uh probably not everything was closing did close i mean like pretty sure did there's no more which is yeah that's a great great great [ __ ] and the folks that owned it were from louisiana and boiled all the [ __ ] time holy that's why i didn't like him what is this you gave me juicy juicy jack you're smoking juicy jack so you know me uh me and dwayne are good friends and everyone else i like jack hair a lot and uh this so this is um uh one of the parents strange is jack hair and the other strain is uh juicy fruit um and i like i i love jack hair and one of the reasons i love jack hair is just because i can be effective and do work like um and i'm not smoking jack right now i'm just realizing um you're not i love jack here and so i love that our friend oh [ __ ] i almost said her goddamn name i had to edit that um had jack that jack i did that the first time i read a podcast was in uh 20 2009 or 10 in hawaii my friends convinced me to do it the first night we did it we drank a bottle of vodka we were out of weed and uh my weed dealer showed up and uh we all were like hey we said his name full [ __ ] name i was like what are you doing are you recording we're like oh we're doing probably started a podcast and all that he's like you just said my [ __ ] name and we did i didn't even know how to edit so he just kept it in there he don't think he got i don't know he wasn't my dealer very long after that um so anyway uh i love jack hair and um a friend of ours before just like a month or two ago had super jack that's what we were talking about earlier and that was really really good it's just one of those strains like i said where i can perform or i can write i can be effective on it and still feel really good so that one to me i like i like as well juicy jack because of it's it's flavorful um because it's one of those it's one of my favorite uh sativa strains yeah and so what do you got that's what you're smoking over there and i get for me what we did for this particular episode um i provided uh dwayne with a strain and dwayne provided me with a string and so i've never had and neither of us had ever had the other strange so tell them what uh what am i smoking right now uh by the way is really really tasty you are smoking a 50 50 hybrid strain called banana punch um that is a cross between purple punch and banana international favorite yeah and one of our goals sorry go ahead oh yeah it's a great it's very flavorful uh tastes very fruity can i have more fruity flavors i like dwayne got me hooked on these uh king palms but what i've noticed is sometimes if i do like the first time i smoke a uh a strain that the blunt it's it's a little harder for me to get the whole flavor profile because the palm leaf isn't tobacco but it still has its own flavor profile yeah um so this must be pretty [ __ ] tasty because i taste it tastes really really good and i'm smoking it yeah if you're smoking that in like a pure hemp paper you get a lot more flavor like it well i'm getting a lot now so that's that's impressive yeah the wrap masks it a little bit but it is a very flavorful strain and um i i enjoy it it's an energetic strain to me for a for a hybrid especially a 50 50 it's not heavy on sativa but it is uh it's an energetic strain for me i feel like it gets [ __ ] done on that particular strain that's good i like it i love trying new ones and that's what i was telling dwayne earlier we were chatting before we got this all set up and figured out which took him in a minute people have asked me in fact i did i mentioned on one of my one of my shows months ago like why don't you ever disparage um a string and i have my preferences i like you know i like lemon i like citrus a lot i like i like sativas sativa especially like sativa hybrids uh uh like 60 40 is really good for me or 70 30. yeah but all of the things that i talk about are me and wayne are talking about these flavor profile we'll talk about terpenes and all that to me or just added what i really judge a strain on is how do i feel afterwards so it doesn't have to taste great it doesn't have to overwhelm it doesn't have to get me excited about citrus and all that because some of the best strains are the nastiest ones that are [ __ ] skunky and disrespectful and they smell so bad like moldy [ __ ] cheese and those are the [ __ ] they taste like and they're awesome the [ __ ] that's the most potent and usually they're indicates um but i love those you know what i mean so the other thing that we discuss is just is preferences um however there's a lot of people that smoke and smoke medically uh medicine use it as a medicinal product that want the the the terpenes are just as important because they want the flavor profile sometimes yeah i mean a lot of what that follows more important yeah well it does have an effect um for me it does and they say science scientifically god damn it somebody had an article on here's the problem i've been i researched weed constantly now because i'm doing this i have so many articles uh save and guess when i go back to read them never but this one was what why terpenes what why terpenes are important at cannabis so i was like oh i should save that and read it because i talked about it all the time yeah it's it's never ready it's in there in the [ __ ] garage heap of all the articles i have saved from cannabis to dogs to beards to everything else but i i like the banana one i think is a really great cheese i'm kind of excited i like 5050s um i did flow walker a couple weeks ago i said i bought my pool and it was a great way because i could immediately feel the body hot like the relaxation and yet i could keep focused concentrating like talking and making sense um and those 50 50s and i find and maybe you don't but they're harder to come by than than 60 40s or something like that like the flow i've had a couple um and now this one and and then [ __ ] the last two years i think i've had three 50 50s um i don't know do you know why they just aren't as popular or i mean i guess and i don't i don't run across a lot of 50 50s most what i run across is either a straight sativa or 60 40. you know oh wow and it'll be either sativa heavy or indica heavy like that other one i brought you is uh peach rings i'm sorry about that oh peach rings peach with a z yeah peach rings yeah that's why i'm excited about it i love peach i brought that other one for you that one is a 60 40 indica but what i like about it here's what i like about it with a lot of indicas what people complain about you hear body high and head high right and a lot of people complain about that melting into the couch feeling that you get from an indigo where you can't really do anything and you do kind of get that relaxed feeling from the peach rings but it doesn't do your head that way your head's still clear you can think you get real creative with the p-train i like that see that's like i like it because that make me feel the smell of the couch but i can only i like them in the evening for very obvious um uh reasons and yeah it's your bedtime i've talked a lot about ice cream this year that's my favorite uh have you did you get a chance to get some of the ice cream i did have i did try it yes that's one of my favorites i've had this year and i just i don't know how i was mistaken but i looked the other day um and it's a 60 40 indica dominant and i thought it was a sativa um and i don't know why i thought that because i've been smoking it since the beginning since i first got it back in like april um i got it it's my favorite strain because of the way i i feel so relaxed yet very creative very uh uplifted mentally like not compromised at all in fact it makes me high in that way where connections start getting made that would not happen if i wasn't high right where i could just kind of looking to see everything and i loved it and it's a 60 40 indica dominant and it's still my favorite my favorite strain probably of 2020 and and i like those in the 5050s i like too um it's just those hard indica see what i guess before i knew enough about cannabis and living in states where it's been illegal we're both old so this whole legal thing is new to people like us interesting thing i'm gonna go back to that um this one site i follow that also does is aggregate um cannabis articles and and and things of that nature and they they're the ones that shared one of my videos they got like 30 000 views and i don't see a [ __ ] word in the whole goddamn thing um that's irony for you and they had posted a poll uh yesterday and the poll was how many of uh how many of you buy or it was do you buy from a dispensary or do leave by black market and it showed the black uh the black market was way higher the next question was do you live in a state that offer that has dispensaries where it's legal and the majority of people that lived in states that were it's legal bought from black markets still and that really kind of i was like oh i wouldn't have expected that it's not it's really not surprising because most of the states where it's legal it's also legal to grow so you've got a ton of people that are growing their own and [ __ ] with you know hybrids and well i want to that's what i'm going to crossbreed seeds i wouldn't yeah i wouldn't if we legalized it here i wouldn't go to if i was going to dispensaries that no i'd even order my seeds from [ __ ] uh from hotland and [ __ ] or amsterdam netherlands rather um but i would immediately start well okay no online i would go see them because they're gonna be things here that i'm not gonna be able to make and uh but i would i would immediately start growing my own uh at least a couple plants and i mean that's one of the reasons why we want a cabinet a ranch here though 100 acres is banking on that risk uh banking on the fact that this inevitably the the dominoes will fall just because there's so many people in this state behind them pushing them um and the amount of money it would bring to the state i mean look what it did for colorado and their schools i think that's why you saw so many states legalize it in this election cycle is tax money well the way the economy is right now man that tax money is a is a boon to these states oh you know and texas is the second biggest state in the nation man i mean i saw an article recently that said first year averages for uh for tax revenue on legal weed in texas at 3.8 billion dollars a year that's a lot of [ __ ] money bro yeah colorado didn't it didn't improve all their state they like uh infrastructure on infrastructure schools uh yeah and all of that didn't know that came out and so i have an issue with taxes and all that we live in a state where there are no state taxes um however if you're using money try owning property in this [ __ ] state oh man but i'm saying you're using this money coming from it's like it's like brand new money uh and you're using it now to pay roads and schools and stuff you're also that's bringing in so much money in the state to be used for other necessities i mean we keep talking about we're scared of [ __ ] mexicans we're scared of all this [ __ ] and i got a [ __ ] flat tire a block from my house yesterday because the goddamn roads here i don't know i'm supposed to be afraid of a [ __ ] uh mexican color taking my job i got a flat tire on a brand new goddamn guy were you on your way to were you on your way to a parking lot wrestling match so i was on my way to therapy i got almost the same yeah the the yeah man sold out the tire i could imagine therapy with you and a parking lot wrestling match is probably pretty close to the same thing uh my favorite all i do is i go in and i vomit and then she points out lots i don't see and that's therapy and i said yeah that's the way i like it's like having a coach and uh my therapist she's writing a book uh and and i'm wants me to be in it um just because i got case study well because i've done i've actually regrown neural pathways where um the trauma that creates them and i've regrown them through doing the various yes and uh i can't remember the various modes of therapy and just doing the [ __ ] work which means when i get to that anxiety and get to that anger place to be able to stop take a break take a pause and then shift to something else and i don't always do it but i'm way better than i have and i used to follow it with breaking my laptops and televisions i've broken more cell phones over since cell phones have been around and not doing that and not attacking them been there bro yeah so it's funny because i go to a therapist who's attached to the city um so there's modes that have to go through there but my insurance covers it i mean i have a copay um and because i'm doing well so i have a psychiatrist also and a therapist right like insurance could use that as a reason to stop paying for therapy because they're because they have to turn in the notes and that they read all over that they could say oh well he's it's working it's worked and so my therapist and my psychics told me that last time my therapist was telling that i was like uh so should i should i start making some [ __ ] up or whatever like like it's working and so you want to take it away and that's just kind of along the lines of how texas feels about mental health uh they don't give a [ __ ] about it um they don't really it's one of the least priorities and there's so many yet the governor and the people that are so against it are constantly on us about the homeless population and about our mayor they don't want to do anything to help and they don't want to put invest any money into mental health programs and a good portion of those people out there are drug addicts and have mental health problems and um and it's [ __ ] sad to me it's sad i feel like uh i didn't do the [ __ ] to me as a child that i that i experienced um yet as an adult uh i don't feel that it makes me feel unseen like that's your problem deal with it which is fine i don't mind you for therapy at all i'm not saying i shouldn't but it's not it it took me almost a year a year to get a therapist that's how hard it was having insurance that's why most people don't use it therapists don't take insurance anymore they don't want to pay [ __ ] um and i have i don't know i'm not gonna even mention my insurance here because it's from state whatever um anyway you know what time it is right now don't you what it's time to take a break i'm gonna stop recording this for a second i need a cigarette and uh i'm high as a goddamn monkey up in the top of a tree uh i don't even know what kind of wheat i'm smoking right now so super jack dude you might be a stoner hey y'all doug benson here watch strain on society with paul e hendricks the ambulance oh yeah right while the camera is on your dick and we're back straight you got the nice bowdabra just came out of the ocean so you have beads in your hair dying smell you from here you smell so clean and beautiful look at you it's on a saturday so we're back i don't remember where we left off it doesn't oh i don't even have my god bless his head i uh i don't know where we left off either you can't hear me right now can you hear me now why don't i hear dwayne um so anyway uh back to the sponsor today is gonna be bean pickers this was a sumatra this whole bag has been killed within a couple of days what do you think about it dwayne it's man it's [ __ ] good i like or darn but dark full-bodied coffees are my thing so this is the one that won uh won several international awards i think it was even like ninth in the world for best sumatra typically historically i haven't been a big sumatra fan i like this i like this one um so thanks to bean flickers i'll have their information where you can find them order some coffee a couple times episodes ago i did the goat uh which was like a dark chocolate tobacco if you like dark roast you'd love that one but we uh chocolate too diana took care of that one with a quick time i don't want to put it on diane you know i tell people all the time that i'm not a big chocolate guy like i don't i'm not a big chocolate guy you know but if there's [ __ ] chocolate around you gotta [ __ ] that [ __ ] up yeah me too bro and it's not good because i got diabetes so there ain't gonna find no chocolate in here or well that's not true diane hides chocolate there's one bar in there that's almost all cacao it's so bitter but i started like that now um but occasionally she'll hide around show right around a treat for me and then i'll come sit down after going to the bathroom there'll be a little candy bar there i have a six-year-old man so i look forward a lot to halloween halloween you know and i was kind of disappointed that this year um halloween was looking a little slim this banana punch oh nice because i'm i'm out of that joint you gave me so you've smoked two joints now uh yeah damn i'm still on this blunt bro and why i'm high i smoke a lot of pot bro me too that's all i'm i gotta hurry up i'm smoking this but i am trying not to cough a lot i should stop saying it because i'm throwing it out in the in the universe you are throwing it out in the universe um you know what i do miss that i haven't been doing is is dabbing you you haven't got into dab life huh uh i have dabbed it kills me um but i do have an episode coming up uh with mr samuel bias he's the one that introduced me to dabbing i'm biased so we're gonna do an episode on dabs i also want to get into dabs because my tolerance for flower has gotten so high and i'm spending so much money i need to get something that uh i can use less of and get super high but the last time what's your uptake like how much we do you smoke in a month ounce and a half hours and a half a month yeah yeah i'm about an ounce a month by myself so i was until i started doing the show gotcha now i'm about now i'm smoking more now uh do you think that because you smoke a lot of joints and not bowls and whatnot that you waste a little i have never i don't think in those terms um no i used to only smoke bowls and now usually i smoke a bowl at the end of the night when i have an indica in it because lately i'll roll if i make a cone silicone with an indica i'll wake up the next day and it's like a third of the way smoked and then i got it just sits there and i gotta like set it aside so i make sure i don't smoke it during the day but if i have a bowl like i have one bowl dedicated to just indicates and so if i fill that in the evening in my evenings now because i get up so [ __ ] early my evening starts at like 6. so um well i want to talk about that too with your sleep patterns what's up early morning first time do you go to bed uh last night i don't know i fell asleep on the couch oh i went to bed before dying of the dogs last night because i kept falling asleep in the recliner i probably started falling asleep around 8 30 last night so on on average you're in bed before 10 o'clock around 10 yeah yeah and you wake up regularly at five five between five and five thirty yeah that's my norm several months if i'm asleep before midnight i'm up at three if i go to sleep after midnight i wake up at five it doesn't matter what time i go to i can go to sleep at three i'm gonna wake up at [ __ ] five wow but if i go to bed before midnight i'm up at 3. i i don't i don't feel like i lack sleep it's just uh i've always i like being an early morning person but before that was like 6 30 a.m and that was great and i like to write in the mornings and then i start getting up a little earlier um around 5 5 30 and i'm still okay with that and then now recently like today i got like 4 15. but when i wake up i wake up ready and raring to go like i wake up and i'm up you know what i mean yeah so i don't even consider going back to bed i go to the bathroom i come in i make coffee wash dishes or whatever wait for the coffee to get done then i go sit on my porch i might read just sit there and listen to birds whatever it's just before anything else is happening and that's one of my favorite times and it's one of my times i get to think through my day what content i'm gonna do what part of the book i'm writing um i just like it so it doesn't bother me but what the problem i'm having is say a couple weeks ago i was invited to be on a podcast um about wrestling uh particularly about the movie the wrestler with mickey rourke and then they were gonna talk about top top 10 wrestlers of all time so i would totally love a great movie yeah and i would love to do that and it started at eight um do you have the top ten wrestlers of all time yeah i'm sure i could go deeper that was supposed to be top five they made it top ten because top five was too hard i mean i could i don't have it written out but i would definitely come up with it but the problem was it started at eight so in my world now that's like starting something at 11 00 p.m you know what i mean and i didn't want to be on so i didn't do the podcast because i would have it wasn't like i've done yours but i'm past your bedtime but i'm at home yeah and it's not a big deal i've had to leave go and i just and then do a two-hour podcast i just i felt like i would have gotten agitated and irritated and uh and i don't i don't i don't want to do that you know that's not fair this pipe you gave me is clogged to [ __ ] i could tell when i looked at it that i put it in the i boiled it and i saw there was still a chunk yeah you said clean let me get you another one i got i got a several what i was gonna ask paul folks was actually i forgot what it was i was going to ask him because i might be a little high but not high enough this coffee is amazing and i love the name bean flickers i don't know if all of you out there are picking up on the um the bean flickers well we won't we won't go there oh oh oh oh i don't think i've ever used that how does it work oh i know yeah you feel that right i don't think i've ever used it and then you light this okay you got my dogs going crazy in here all right barker this is barker going crazy she was looking around though actually got more too if you that doesn't work no i'm good i'm gonna go i'm gonna go i got it all right you edit your show right sometimes sometimes i've never done a podcast that i edited yeah this is the first time i've ever done what i edited i mean i edit it it depends like when i did the first one with joe that's where i i learned how to edit on adobe premiere because there were so many uh breakups in the phone phone call um so but now i use windows 10 when i'm editing and it's not it's not nearly as sleek as adobe premiere doesn't have like smooth transitions and all that but i i edit them like me walking around and getting you the bowl i won't edit that out uh that's all part of the story part of the show um if the show keeps going like this like we paused it obviously earlier um so i'll throw a commercial in there um or something i don't know uh but i do i don't necessarily edit out um conversation yeah just edit out if there's a technical glitch or now if they when i was doing the tales from my neighborhood um one of my friends on there i had to edit uh actually austin our friend austin edited it for me because that's why i was having problems with adobe premiere with the sync up uh but i sent it to him he was the only one that asked me to send it to him first and he's a uh well i won't tell which one it was but uh it was just job-based um yeah because i had referred to him as an executive at ford and um and his management at ford but they clearly have defined he's not a ford executive like a rep a representative he's not the one on tv being the spokesperson like he's not on the report um and so that was it he just he did want the language that i used to be uh confused by folks because he has an agreement obviously with them as management um as a representation of them so uh edited that out um for him wow understandable yeah totally i i and um it was funny because i had asked him some stuff but i never asked before which i probably should like do you want me not to bring something up or whatever because i know all these guys since we were little kids so we have a lot of stories that are you know could haunt someone that has a higher up uh position or whatever so and one of the challenges even now is um like i want to have more people of color and women of color and women entrepreneurs and women smokers particularly like um there's some there's some uh uh huis we say in hawaii associations of like um people of color or growers of color that kind of go together and started marijuana businesses so i'm looking forward to having some of that um but the issue is um a lot of people like even if they own their own companies or they're on a board and so they have to ask them first um not the weed related ones but some other friends even though our owners are their own companies or they are people that have wanted to do it uh and yet have jobs that are careers that um because it's texas is the only reason um or wherever they might live and uh they're apprehensive and if they're apprehensive i end the cod that's like nope i don't i don't want to even walk close to that line to get somebody in trouble no um so it's just me i'm gonna have to extend more invitations out um the people i don't have relationships with already um and so building a relationship and all that and i know plenty of interesting people as well um it's it you know it's uh it's fun and i have a list of people i want and until recently like i talked to you a while ago about it but until recently i didn't i wasn't going to do any more interviews until i figured out a way to edit and i couldn't do it through adobe premiere because it was just not it kept well it's all interviews i don't have to edit myself if i'm just doing it you know what i mean whether interviews i gotta you know so now that i have that now i'm doing it i did i have you so you will come on this week you'll come on the following week right or maybe i'll do a special episode um but i have interviews now lined up so it's not being a problem like i haven't lined up through the beginning of december like it's nice not too far along but i just started lining them up again the last couple weeks because i was like okay i can edit this it must be nice to be part of a show that you're actually prepared like more than a day in advance like sometimes we prepare the morning of the show for the show yeah well i mean how many of these do i do with i don't have an interview uh i record a lot of them spontaneously um i'll be honest some of the times i do it is because uh i want to get high and whatever sample i have i haven't done a review yet and i want to smoke it so i forced myself to do one uh i mean not like not fun but i'm like well right i want to smoke this and then and there's been a couple where i ran out of before doing a review on and then i requested i put in a request form and i would get i would get them again but uh it always comes with the side eye well there was a really dude never getting this for reviews and you're smoking it not reviewing it i gotta give you more and i'm like yes i'm sorry i'm sorry there is there was uh not long ago a few weeks back i guess you had invited me over um to hang out by the way yeah and and shoot this [ __ ] and thanks for taking that taking it to where i wanted to go i appreciate it yeah you're welcome man um if you want to take it from there you know no i well i did remember there was a story he told us funny thing is so he came over you were up in houston no no dallas or or somewhere a family vacant yeah yeah yeah so we kind of had a stoner get together uh and diane diane's definitely not a stoner um and duane came over after he got back but he got there a little late so when it started i took my camera downstairs around the pool and i was going to do a review also of a one of the streams i had and do it like standing by the tree and i did a little interview with our friend wilbur and i was just going to kind of do a video of us sitting around talking and getting high because that's when the best stories come out that's true then i'm going to watch how i throw diane under the bus so diane was going to do something i was going to get drinks and i didn't i've done a little interview with wilbur the camera had just been sitting on a tripod she was like well i take that upstairs i was like yeah okay well and as soon as i did then you come over like a a half hour hour later and then he was telling me he's a great story and i was just like staring at dying like god damn it um this is what this is why i brought the camera down there so but it started because i had simply uh i just asked i asked the same question over what what's your favorite string um because i like i like to know that from different people i feel like i used to watch people's shoes and that and create stories about their shoes and now i create stories about people uh regarding what their favorite strain is yeah so what is your favorite strain and that's what led to this conversation that i'm glad you're bringing me back to because i'm obviously this the actually have a pretty good story about my favorite strain um when we we first moved to austin in 2012 from a small town in louisiana and um just looking to get out you know my wife was ready to get out of uh of louisiana small town louisiana whenever when her gynecologist came into her uh her place of business to buy a cell phone she was like [ __ ] we got to go oh yeah you know wow um i run into my shrink at wheatsville all the time but and then he had to clarify because he's like some people get weird and i see him in wheatsville and i'm like hey dr gorapotti i was like i don't give a [ __ ] not like i'm like hey brain fixer i feel like when she realized that every other woman in the store was also his patient it became a little weird um but so a friend of mine had moved out here a couple years before us and i was like hey why don't we go check out austin you know so we came out we liked it we moved here and the weed was great so we're here a couple months i guess and uh that's that's a definite stoner brand by the way when the weed is great is part of your moving decision which i totally agree with but that i totally agree i mean we're considering moving back to arizona right now because they just leave okay we've been considering it too man we have been thinking about like where to go where it can be a light winner and uh so whatever go ahead sorry we we came out and it was a couple of months before my birthday my birthday is on st patty's day so um and it was my 40th birthday and it just so happens that my birthday falls right at the end of south by southwest so my buddy shane oh that's right uh hang out with you on your birthday once my buddy got tickets to a party that was going on at the red eyed fly which used to be a bar out on uh red river tenth a red river yeah and uh it was a party put on by high times um they had done a an austin cannabis cup on the down low damn i wish i would have known yeah and then some folks 2012 i want to say i didn't live here and um so we go over there and like i had never been really out to places in austin yet like just a couple of music clubs to see bands and whatnot and as we're walking down red river to the front doors of the club i can already smell weed so i'm like oh this is gonna be good and my buddy was like hey bring like you know bring some weed with you bring at least an eighth or something you know so i brought a half ounce in three [ __ ] cargo pockets right and the strain that he had at the time was blue dream and it had taken third in the contest the previous night nice so we're there man there's a [ __ ] ton of bands playing uh there is [ __ ] weed to be shared amongst really [ __ ] cool people everywhere you know it's outside venue there's an outdoor stage i mean there's vendors with edibles and hemp products and you know just everybody's got weed so it was like a love fest and i hadn't experienced that kind of thing since i lived in san francisco many many moons ago in another life and we're watching this band play a funk band from dallas called uh the rash the fnas a great name and my wife and i are having an a or f and a e f f e-f-f-i-n-a-y apostrophe fna's nice i like it um creative me and my wife are standing next to each other watching this band play jamming out and this guy kind of like wedges in between us starts dancing man a gentleman of color you know african-american gentleman very very nicely dressed in a uh like an argyle sweater you would loved it you would have loved it i don't try to date him i'll try to date that [ __ ] nice just for a sweater and he's dancing man having a great time and i'm looking at him and i'm like [ __ ] this dude looks familiar i can't why do i feel like i know this guy and there's a dude standing behind him a gentleman standing behind him younger gentleman with a a pair of headphones around his necks beats you know wireless and they had a big p printed on them and i was like that looks familiar too and i look at my wife and i look back at this guy and get my wife's attention i was like i think that i think that's george clinton nice and as i'm saying that i see the guys in the band on stage see him in the crowd dancing and i see the look on their faces where they're like hey man i [ __ ] think that's george clinton so after the after they get done with their set he walks up on stage and i grab my buddy and i'm like yo pack a bowl real quick and i go over to the stairs going up to the stage and as he comes down he looks down at me and i go mr clinton he goes yeah so would you smoke this bowl with me and he's like sure so i sat down i smoked a bowl on my 40th birthday with george clinton boulder that's a great great uh story and a great birthday present god damn it it was a fabulous fabulous birthday present do you wanna know what i did on my 40th birthday what'd you do i went to see uh uh gbh was playing three three shows in honolulu i don't know why they weren't doing three there's no need for a gbh to do three shows but it's three different nights so it was the night before my 40th birthday diana takes hardcore and pumps she didn't want to go so one of her colleagues and a friend of mine laura decided to go with me and it was at the small uh upstairs club and i thought man i haven't seen gbh 20 plus years i love growing up them city baby attacked by rats all that stuff i'm gonna stage dive the night before my 30th birthday or 40th birthday and so i kept going up there and getting close and uh there was a young woman in the pit and she came to the back of the pit a young a native lion and she looked at me and she was like uncle i know you want to get in there i'll hold your stuff now mind you know in hawaii uncle or auntie is a term of respect for your elders uh right and is but i heard it as hey old timer let me hold your [ __ ] because i know you're about to get hurt and but i got your stuff it's gonna happen and get your little old fat ass up in there and so instead my thought process went to you know she's right i do have i got a lot of things in my pockets i had a bowl i had some weed i had some other things i had keys i had all kinds of [ __ ] and i was like right so i walked to the back of the bar where our friend my friend laura was sitting at them standing at the bar because it was so loud in there and that was where the quietest bubble was was all the way in the back of the room and she was like oh this is so loud and i said yeah i agree and so we left and we went to a punk rock karaoke bar uh but that was my fourth birthday i never stayed i didn't stage time uh with the moral of that story and uh but it was true i don't i mean i wasn't afraid i just didn't want to lose it i didn't want it was this it was great i got to smoke with him i got the chit chat with him i got to learn some things about him we got to talk about where we were from cool and he took a photo with me and my friends and i was i was new to twitter back then so i tweeted the photo and i added him in the tweet and then the next morning i got up and i was scrolling through my twitter and he had retweeted it and followed me and i was like like holy [ __ ] it's like george clinton and then [ __ ] yeah like a year later i get a a dm on twitter and it's from him and he was fishing like south louisiana somewhere and was like hey thought about you and sent me a photo of him [ __ ] fishing oh my gosh you guys are like my friends because we were talking about fishing i wish geez that's a great memory that's a great like yeah it's [ __ ] i got super baked with rob van damme uh of wrestling fame at his hotel room after a wrestling bout in cleveland and then i saw him 20 years later not quite 20 years later walking down the boardwalk in waikiki and in my mind we were homies you know what i mean right right you hung out for a couple hours together and i walked up i was like hey rob what's up and he was like sup man he just looked at me and then he kept walking and dianne started laughing at me and she was like oh y'all are tight huh and i'm like [ __ ] you in my head we were we were broke and uh he obviously didn't remember which is fine and i'm sure i don't i mean how many people has he gotten high with uh after wrestling about he the reason we knew it was ecw matches because he was not in high times after all admittedly as a smoker yeah so it was funny um but yeah the cool things about that birthday the cool thing is that he reminds he remembers you and thinks about that's pretty cool do you think he i got to sit no he doesn't remember me now i bet this was years ago oh yeah but i did get to sit on a couch and smoke a joint with bobby black who was the editor of high times at the time and that was [ __ ] dope as [ __ ] yeah that was a good time man i went to um i'm thinking of those kind of good times of um our friends that own the club in dc where i worked and we were friends with them and they were really good friends with the the guy that ran the marijuana policy project lobbying group in dc so they invited us to a party the super nice apartment and watched downtown dc and everybody's dressed up and it's nice and it's all wine and joints everywhere it was so much fun and i have a similar story like when you first moved i first moved here in 2013 and um was going to meet john toll who ended up having a podcast with the comedian and me and him and known each other from cleveland way back he's playing hardcore bands together and um i just moved here so we met some of our friends and went to the brixton that larry lived here and then we went to meet him and he was at the bar what's the bar on dirty six that's like the jamaican bar um right i don't even know 36 bro kind of close to the velveeta room i don't remember the name of it but um they was there and it was um a night where they were the head of marijuana policy project was there speaking and the head of texas normal was there and john and then they hired john to be do a comedy set at the end and he had an interpreter as well right and so we got there and met them and we went in and we went on part of it it's indoors we go out the back and go upstairs there's a big deck up outside and everything went out there people just started handing me joints and i was like oh it's like stuff like that and it's been like that ever since uh yeah you only saw john do a comedy show one night and all the comedians would go to shangri-la after it was a sunday night we went on the back patio and just stood there smoking uh a bunch of comedians and everything and i was like i'm gonna like this i'm gonna like this town like once you've been here a while you get to know the bars that are cool with it and the bars that aren't but they aren't they're not they kick you out they're just like stop doing that well yeah that's what i'm saying even the bars that aren't cool with it they'll be like hey man go do that in the parking lot or go out to the street you know it's like jimmy got called out a little darling one time we were there i think they thought tony was smoking too because we were trying to put a ball up to his mouth but jimmy had it and then uh a weapon mike sanchez the owner walked up or and they were like hey man can you at least go out in the parking lot and i was like you guys i started yelling at him and [ __ ] like i was on his side and they were smoking my bowl guys i told you what the [ __ ] are you doing yeah i feel like you've done that to me too yeah i've done that for a while you did that to me on a patio something i can throw the butt i can throw anyone on the bus i've thrown people under the bus while smoking weed when i still have smoke coming out of my mouth i'm pretty sure that you were smoking and you saw the guy coming to tell you something and handed me the bowl while he was on his way there that's definitely some [ __ ] do it's funny for me it's funny for me too this has been an outstanding uh conversation that we've had i'm glad that you came over for this finally we got to do it even it took a minute to get set up but i think it's all beautiful uh and i you know you know i love you man here you're one of my one of my bffs um even though you absolutely put even though you've drunkenly put your tongue in my mouth before which uh was you know you liked it and uh very lizard-esque uh i had to actually go to the there's you know you might not know about it because you're one of the lizard people but there's a bank on the internet you can go to and take pictures of people and it'll just line it up and search for you so i had to do that like this because he took out a filling um i wanna i wanna just put it out there that the offer is still out for jimmy and i for jimmy to fight alex jones and me to fight tucker carlson live at a venue of their choosing i would love that so much yeah yeah that would be amazing i want to do it before tucker carlson runs for president i don't want people i want people going out thinking about that [ __ ] him you could edit that part out i still want to fight that dude too lazy i'll edit out conversation i mean unless you started like talking about the jews they're getting racist then that would have to be edited out i probably wouldn't run the episode either hey um thanks for inviting me on your show man yeah i love it i love it dude uh i appreciate you guys your show is great as well and uh i mean i want this whole show to be based on cannabis and culture and conversation and this was kind of a perfect example of it if other people find an interesting uh bonus i enjoyed it and uh that's really that's really why i do this it's very therapeutic for me and i miss the conversation i'm super talks i'm super proud of you and the show man because it's it's one of the things that i enjoy all this all the content that you've been putting out since this whole quarantine started like your your church on on sundays and i look forward to all that [ __ ] so keep doing what you're doing bro i don't even know how that started but it's it's funny uh i think you should do the priest you should do the priest outfit every sunday i've thought about it so dude look this past week i looked into what it takes to start a religion um and how to get past so we could include cannabis in it um and so a lot of the checks i mark off but some of the other ones i don't know how it would stand in this time day and age because of the pandemic but you have to actually have a physical uh location where people meet um i don't know if zoom would cut would qualify um but they may have changed that as far as how many churches are not a lot they're not considered essential or are they concerned i don't even i don't know i do go i hope i hold one on my porch we're doing sitting except i stand because it's church uh yeah my house we were gonna go um we're gonna ironically go to uh holly hobby lobby either by the green cloth um to make the collar with because we thought that would be a good way of spending money there to make uh to poke at religion a little bit um and then somebody said you couldn't wilbur or whatever like putting a leaf on it but i don't think i want to do that um but i want to put something like on the middle of it i don't know what yeah i mean trying to stay away from marijuana leaves because that makes branding hard because i won't put anything with a marijuana leaf on my car a sticker or anything like that no way so yeah we've had trouble we've had trouble and i know we've mentioned this but we've had trouble promoting some of our shows you know because of your strength spotlight which part of me is the part of me that there's a little pride in that like not that prevention i don't want to hold you guys back but it's um kind of it's so dumb to me yeah like if we were doing a review on coors light ain't no [ __ ] problem initially it made me angry like i got real angry about it at first and then i smoked and then i felt all right yeah well it was good on top of it now i know not to try to promote any of my podcasts ever right um so now but it's also i was like i'll start making commercials like the fun associates so that'll be fun for me to do um yeah but in there and i want to see it did jimmy try to um boost last week's episode because there was no smoking on last week but there definitely you mentioned it right out the gate yeah i don't know i don't know if he was able to get it boosted because i tried to sabotage it yeah well i wanted to see if it would if it would if it was you can't talk about it or if it was the actual smoking of it so i'm curious to know um because now if i can't talk about it we may we may never know because i'm gonna talk about it every episode just yeah well i mean the last episode not the past one but the one before that when you guys came back from break after this strange spotlight jimmy was smoking a bowl he was super he was super mad about that too oh yeah so anyway oh he was mad at kyle he did this kind of number to get off screen real quick but yes hey man all right man all right it is i gotta end this because i gotta eat something dude i'm starving i'm stunned i have that gourd i kind of got a poop i don't know everything is happening this coffee was dope by the way and i will be completely honest i'm not a sumatra fan and i think the only time i try to think of the coffee bean and tea leaf that i lived in waikiki had it and i just didn't like it or if it was starbucks say the name for me say the name for me one more time sumatra no no no not so much i mean oh coffee bean and tea leaf no the name of that coffee the bean flickers and i'll put a little post up for me yeah it's my hobby uh hawaii uh you know flicking beans so i'm really glad if you guys want to check it out it's uh i liked it actually and i'm not a big sumatra fan it was it had a good flavor it's really good full body glad you liked it too and this banana

would be very surprised to see Wes vote himself in must be dumb to go against Johnny Wes could have the biggest balls that have ever been on the challenge and go against an archrival in elimination the whole world would love to save bananas and Wes Bartlett out two of the greatest people I've ever played the challenge and to see them go head-to-head will be what the dreams are made us do I want to throw myself up against bananas is this really like a thing that I'm gonna do or am I gonna wait and if I wait to go in who do I put up against bananas and why [Music] do any of you want to come down here battle against the legend and earn that red skull you think you have what it takes to take out bananas [Music] I'm going [Applause] oh it's just winning you happening is this really happening this elimination is the end-all be-all they finally start working together on a season and this is the season that you want to go against him in elimination this is crazy this is challenge history in the making the two of them have been waiting for this for years and now they finally have their chance I don't have a red skull I'm not qualified to run this final yet but I get a tree I'm front row to watch history be made it's gonna be a good one people strap in and get ready for the best elimination of the season it just feels right I'm going down to get a red skull but I'm Blaine Tinley aware of how much fun it will be to go to battle with this man [Music] [Applause] you're gonna get what you've been asking for you're welcome America my entire challenged career I've been waiting for the stars to align for you guys to faceoff and now it is here you guys are both the best players to ever play this game now you're facing off win or take off yeah tonight you guys are playing charge to the wall hidden inside of each of these walls are three batteries you guys have to find it begin you're each gonna take a side when I say go you got a smash punch and kick those boxes all along the wall find those batteries so every time you find the battery you bring it back to your station as fast as you can go up in another three batteries is what it's going to take for you to power up that light first one to power up the light wins tonight's elimination round stays in the game and earns the infamous red skull which qualifies you to run my final this is going to be awesome [Applause] both bananas and I played a perfect game up to this point it really does suck to kind of be in a position where we have to go up against each other because there are weaker competitors out there but the name of the game right now is go get that key to the final this is definitely gonna be an iconic matchup regardless of what happens but I'm gonna be coming home I'm ready I'm good to go feels great right now this is the first time our paths have ever crossed in an elimination does not surprise me one bit that he wanted to capitalize on this moment I didn't tell him that I was gonna nominate myself to going yesterday and I think it really kind of took him by surprise personally I would have preferred to see him in a final and suddenly there but I think deep down West doesn't want to see me in a final he knows that if I am in the final he need coming in first so I guess he sees it as he be either beats me here but he gets beat there finally go west you got this with all right bananas you ready yes ready [Music] Johnny Bananas comes in with a kungfu bandit kick and I'm like oh he's gonna break his foot before I even start the most important detail is to be thorough because the last thing you want to do is kick a hole in a box half-assed the search looking for the battery and move past it my strategy is to climb up one side and work my way up and then I'm basically gonna be able to use the leverage from the ladder that I've created to kind of kick my way through the rest of the holes fifteen years nine fifteen years you're doing silo keep going I'm gonna do everything I can to come back with this reg fall it's all gonna come down to who finds the battery first this is more pressure than I've ever dealt with I just be Johnny to get this winter night west constantly throws a jab that I'm obsessed with him and that I'm his fan but I just think that that's his huge Eagle talking and that's exactly why I don't like what's in this game because he's so full of himself he's so cocky and arrogant I just don't do well with people like that no one can seem to find Batteries alright who's going to get the first battery and getting the lead because it is so important right now to give that first battery [Applause] bananas is obviously Commodus first battery as I hear all of the idiots in the house that are friends with him yelling and screaming and happy for him it's okay it's just one battery that's why we play two three Johnny finds his first battery I'm psyched he's on a roll he's ahead of West right now but we're freaking out because it's only a matter of time until West is gonna find his batteries and catch up Johnny this is a historical moment West and bananas they have to be the biggest threats in the game and it's neck-and-neck right now I don't know who's gonna win but this is the matchup we all wanted to see this elimination is called charge the wall there's three batteries hidden within this wall your job is to kick punch do whatever you can to find these batteries in the wall and charge the stage head [Music] when honest UNS managed to find his second battery before west and now i'm starting to panic you need to move weapons no be one more as much as I tried to pace myself this obviously gets my heart going now it's just one more and I'm just praying that the third battery is somewhere on one of these three columns below me however I'm thinking the likelihood of it being here is pretty swimming this chorus chorus chorus [Music] [Applause] all right bananas lids I can't point to a single time in an elimination when this feeling of relief and victory and completion has hit me the way that it does in this moment my victory in this elimination the biggest elimination I've ever been in in my entire life is in my hands I've lost I just lost an elimination two bananas Oh I hope this is funny one day because right now [Music] [Applause] Wes just looked so broken and dejected I'm shocked myself I didn't see this happening it's absolutely devastating to see my mental slash best friend slash homies slash buddy lose tonight's elimination yeah it's devastating I'm really proud of Johnny he deserves a red skull wes is absolutely going to have a hard time living this town the fact that he won the challenge voted himself in against Johnny and loss is something that he's never going to forgive himself for [Music] King do and King wash good I love him hey job this is magical when the challenge is said and done when this is something in my past I think one of the biggest regrets I'm gonna have about the way I played my games every season was never working with Wes never becoming friends with Wes I never thought I'd be saying it but yeah was his uh Wes his is he's a good dude and I don't know what I'll do without him one of us to go after one what does he have to lose I'll say this dude there's not one thing will change about the way I play this game he's teaming up with you I just wish she would've done sooner my friends yeah this mean we're allies yeah does this mean we're more than friends just slightly less than lovers yeah whether I like it or not bananas has been

smoothest cocktail I've ever had in your life let's get started first thing we're gonna do is juice a bunch of citrus this is like a 10 strength green cheese you're not trying to add a bunch of water

cantaloupe have the cap on water sure and we go simple we've got our amazing punch and you know what to be frank like you could just strain this and serve it but we are going to strain it and then we're going to milk wash it and there's some added benefits to that when you add milk to spirits the milk proteins bond with a lot of the tea news and poly phenols the stuff that's bitter to make the alcohol more sweet this leftover pineapple this is why I like to not puree it and blend it up anymore I'm always looking for new and exciting ways to get alcohol to my buddy whoa I mean it's just like a dependable booze snap you can use paper towels tea towel like these are Tito's no matter how fine your rag or your towel what ends up filtering it more than any actual filter paper filter or metal filter or screen is the actual protein is actually occurred so those curds are gonna clog up whatever filter you have and the rest of your cocktail is gonna run through and filter those curds I'm gonna add the punch to the milk and it's gonna get kind of interesting you ready for this so I might pass it through a couple times I need those curds to start just stick to the linen a little bit you can use this same filter the same wrap and just pour this cocktail through it a couple of times and it just comes up clear into every time clear and clear in here it looks like clay or something left it's been sitting a long time all this milk protein this curd and you see how that curd has like a tan pink orange kind of cue to that's pulling out all the tannins and this is one we made yesterday it's been filtering nice and slowly and you can see it's just like nice yellow totally different cocktail at this point see once you made it it's so easy to make another one look I'm making a cocktail

"ZSBzzPvLk6c": "Pina Colada classic Puerto Rican cocktail and as someone with a sweet tooth one of my favorites and we can't talk about the Pina Colada without talking about cream of coconut or specifically Coco Lopez this product was created in 1949 when an innovative way to mix coconut cream with sugar cane was developed and then it was only a few years later that the Pina Colada was invented and it's a bit confusing because there are so many products around coconut there's coconut milk coconut cream creamed coconut but you want cream of coconut here now the blended version on the side of the can is quite tasty but I'm going to show you how to make a delicious shaken version starting with 3/4 of an ounce or 22 mils of our Coco Lopez cream of coconut now of course we need our pineapple juice I strongly prefer fresh pineapple juice here but you can use the store-bought kind we're gonna need 2 ounces or 60 mils into our shaker glass now cream of coconut is very sweet so we're gonna balance it out a bit more with some acid I'm gonna do 1/4 allons or about 7 mils of fresh lime juice all right now finally we need our rum I prefer something with a bit more character to it but not as much funk as say a Jamaican pot still but here I'm gonna use a Hamilton rum from Guyana two ounces or 60 mils all right now there's a bunch of different ways to add ice to your pina colada here I'm gonna shake it with about four cubes for about 15 seconds or so alternatively you could blend this or shake with cracked ice and just free pour it into your glass this method I'm doing here gives you a bit of a cleaner cocktail with less solution but it's a little bit more labor-intensive it's cleaner and that we're gonna now double strain out all of the pulp and small ice chips and I like to use just and chilled rocks glass here but use whatever glassware you have on hand to keep this cool I'm just gonna add some cracked ice to the cocktail so just grab a Louis bag bang up a few Ice Cube's and drop them over the top I probably add about four ice cubes worth of cracked ice here and then we can go ahead and garnish that with some fresh pineapple drop in a handy sippy cylinder and there we go a classic pina colada on the rocks to me this drink is just perfect a lot of pina coladas are just way too sweet this one is perfectly balanced I find that with the blended pina coladas I'm always on the clock to finish it before it dilutes it too much I will say that this recipe is very forgiving but with the right technique and ingredients its next level all right we're not done yet here we're gonna make a pretty wild but delicious variation on the pina colada using a banana liqueur and coffee liqueur this one is called the cafe colada banana and coffee together at last stay with grab a shaker glass and we're gonna start with 3/4 of an ounce or 22 mils of our cream of coconut don't know where that came from but now we need one and a half ounces or 45 mils of fresh pineapple juice quarter ouncer about 7 mils of fresh lime juice half an ounce or 15 mils of fresh orange juice next up the coffee liqueur I like using mr. blacks it's not very sweet so 1/2 ounce of 15 mils in the glass next up our banana liqueur and this is a really nice product from Tempus Fugit spirits another 1/2 ounce or 15 mils and finally our rum and this one does call for it Jamaican rum so I'm gonna use this funky pot still from Hamilton one and a half ounces or 45 minutes before we shake that up grab a glass or mug and fill it 2/3 of the way to the top with crushed ice now we're just gonna dry shake this without ice to mix everything together and we're gonna do this for about 10 to 15 seconds and this drink is actually a relatively modern cocktail and was invented in about 2018 from a guy named Brandon Bramhall at attaboy in Nashville once that's all mixed together free pour it into your glass and top with a little more crushed ice then we're gonna garnish that with a little bit of nutmeg and what you might be noticing now is that this drink is a little bit closer to the pain killer cocktail than the pina colada give this guy a little shade to keep the Sun out of his eyes drop in a sippy cylinder and let's give it a taste the Kafe colada this drink really is something else I wouldn't have thought all these flavors would come through but you really can get the distinct taste of coffee and banana it's nicely balanced the pineapple and cream of coconut definitely give it that tropical feel this drink is a winner give it a try and finally what if the best Pina Colada you've ever had in your life came from curdling milk using citrus we're gonna employ that technique today in a clarified milk punch now some of y'all might have seen my clarified milk punch video we're gonna take the same techniques from that video and apply it to this recipe so we're gonna start by batching all of our ingredients together except for the milk into a large pitcher now here we're gonna make enough for about four servings starting with about three ounces or 90 mils of our fresh strained pineapple juice next we need some fresh lime juice about two ounces or 60 mils and run it through a fine mesh strainer to get rid of all that pulp next we want a little more sweetness just about half an ounce or 15 mils of simple syrup the cream of coconut is gonna be a bit too viscous for this method so we're gonna use coconut water instead pour in four and a half ounces or about 135 mils and this next part is optional but highly recommended we're gonna add some allspice dram now this here is a Jamaican liqueur that has a lot of warming spices in it we're gonna add 2 ounces or 60 mils and for our rum I would highly recommend a nice aged rum here but preferably not something too funky so here I'm gonna go with a plantation 8th year about 8 ounces or 240 mils put that on spin cycle for a few seconds and let's get to the science grab your whole milk and we're gonna pour about 5 ounces or 150 mils into a large bowl there is some debate as to whether or not you should use hot or warm milk for this technique but I find that cold milk works just fine a general rule of thumb is to have a four to one ratio of punch to milk all right now we're gonna pour the punch into the milk and not vice versa so that it doesn't curdle all at once let's cut to the curdle cam here and you can see we're gonna do this very slowly in small amounts already you can see some small curds start to appear as we stir this up as we introduce some acid into the milk okay so what's happening here and why do we care the citrus is coagulating the caffeine proteins in the milk which will cause them to both trap the cloudiness inducing particles in the punch while stripping out astringent polyphenols also the whey proteins will remain in the drink giving it a luscious mouthfeel it's a similar process to making a consomme which is a clear soup that uses egg whites instead of milk to clarify now we need to let it rest to allow it to fully curdle and settle now I only let it rest for about fifteen to thirty minutes but some people prefer to do it over 24 hours all right now it's time to test your patience because we're going to filter this drink through a coffee filter I find that doing it this way really means you only need to take primarily one pass of filtering but it does take a little while the one thing I do recommend is placing a small bowl underneath the filter to collect some of the initial liquid that comes through which will tend to be a little bit cloudy before the nest of milk curdles can form at the bottom of the filter much of the filtering that's gonna be done here is actually through those kernels themselves not just that paper filter so we'll start by pouring a few ounces of the liquid into the filter and you can see it dripping down there at the bottom then we're gonna pick that up notice that it's a little bit cloudy but you can tell it is being clarified already and then we're going to put down the filter and pour in that first batch of liquid back over the top of the filter this step is easy and recommended to get the clearest final product and then you're just going to very slowly pour in the remaining liquid until all of it has filtered through now the filtering process took about three hours from start to finish and it yields about 18 ounces or a little half a liter which is enough for about four cocktails when you're done discard those curds I suppose you could try to make a pina colada cheese out of them but wouldn't really recommend it and then pour that into a large sealable container and you can store this in the fridge for years it will not spoil to serve just simply pour it into a rocks glass I prefer it with ice and if we're gonna use ice you better be using a clear ice cube for this one let's just take a minute and slow this down a bit all right let's try our beautiful clarified pina colada Cheers this is so delicious the first thing you notice is that mouthfeel it is rich and full-bodied the taste is incredibly smooth complex all the harshness seems to be rounded out this might

Today, we're gonna make a clarified milk punch, which dates all the way back to the 1700s and is now having a bit of a resurgence. Here, the milk is used in a really interesting technique called milk washing, where we're actually going to curdle the milk using an acid from lemon juice. Then we're gonna strain out those curds and we'll be left with a very smooth, rich, delicious punch. Now, I know the idea of curdling milk in a cocktail just sounds gross, but stay with me. It's worth it, I promise. We're gonna make a black tea-port-milk punch, and start by taking a large glass bowl and adding 1 cup or 235 mL of whole milk. Then, in a separate glass pitcher we're gonna add 1/3 cup or about 75 mL of fresh lemon juice. Next, we need some brewed black tea. Here I'm using an English breakfast, but use your favorite black tea and we're gonna add 2 cups or about 470 mL into the pitcher. Next, we need some port, which is a rich, fortified wine. Here we're using Ruby port, and we're gonna add 2/3 cups or about 150 mL to the pitcher. Now, for our spirit we're gonna be using something called Batavia Arrack, which is a funky, molasses-based liquor from Indonesia. If you don't have this, feel free to use a light rum. Again, we're gonna add 2/3 cup or 150 mL. Next, we need some sugar; a little over 1/3 cup or 85 grams. Give that a stir to dissolve the sugar, and meanwhile this milk has just been sitting over there in the corner, not really contributing anything to society... So let's get a reaction out of it. Pour about a third of the tea mixture into the milk and give it a slow stir, and pretty soon you'll start to see the milk break into these small curdles. Let's cut to the Curdle Cam and see what's really happening here. The acidity of the lemon juice is causing the casein proteins of the milk to coagulate, And when they do this, they also pick up some of the astringent-tasting tannins of the black teas and other things that generally make the punch cloudy After we strain these out, the whey proteins of the milk will be left behind, which will give the drink a lot of body and richness. Let this rest for at least 30 minutes, although some people even let it rest for up to 24 hours. And here we can see some separation between the curds and the rest of the punch. Alright, let's get these gross curds out of there. So grab a large container and a fine mesh bag. Here, I'm using a nut milk bag, but you can also use something like a cheese cloth. Then you're gonna pour it through the cloth, and it's still gonna be a bit cloudy; here we're just trying to collect the curds into the bottom of the cloth. Pour the strained punch into a pitcher and we're gonna run it through again. Make sure to keep the curds in the bag from the first pass, and carefully pour the punch through the curds to use them as another filter. And then finally, run it once or twice through a coffee filter to just collect any of the last remaining bits of cloudiness Then we're gonna transfer it to a sealable bottle, and just look at how beautiful that punch is. Remember, this was almost black from the tea and the port, and with the tannins stripped away, this almost looks more like a ros\u00e9. Store this in the fridge, and it pretty much will never go bad. When you're ready to serve, grab a rocks glass, throw in a big ol' ice cube... Aaand we're gonna have to slow this down a bit. When serving clarified milk punch, it would be wrong to use any ice besides perfectly-clear ice. I'll put a link in the description on how to make that. You want that cube to basically disappear into the drink. Now, is this necessary? No, but it does look pretty sexy. Alright, I'm getting thirsty. Let's give this a taste. Cheers! ...And wow, the flavor here is unbelievable: The astringency you normally get from tea is completely gone, and you're left with this full-bodied, rich strength that is dangerously smooth.

Check the recipe on Inspired Taste for even\nmore suggestions. After a minute in the blender, the smoothie\nis done and so creamy. Remember I said this recipe was flexible? Here\u2019s three of our favorite things to add. Mango \u2014 it\u2019s delicious, can be added fresh\nor frozen and it makes the smoothie taste tropical. Strawberries work, too \u2014 bananas and strawberries\nwere made for each other. Finally, if you\u2019ve got a big bag of frozen\nberries in the freezer, they are always a good option for adding to smoothies. And that\u2019s it!

this is probably the most requested video everything getting and mainly because a lot of us are still at home doing our home gym Trini if you've ordered a heavy bag it may have been filled but if it didn't became unfilled and traditionally most unfilled bags are filled with like old clothing rags just kind of random stuff you can find around household towels but not a lot of us have old holding laying around at least enough to fill a heavy bag with so this video I'm actually using some insulation I bought from Home Depot I don't know where you guys are located but wherever you're watching this any kind of home insulation you can find at a local hardware store I got some insulation that cost forty five bucks with this gigantic bundle of insulation that I stuff this bag word and then I got a hundred pounds of sand which cost $10 from Home Depot as well I put them in individual ziplock bag and I basically made like a layered cake with this bag so installation and installation sand all the way to the top to give it a more consistent feel oh and I think this will work really well for you guys so without further ado check it out okay guys so I'm going to show you guys everything you're going to need to fill your own heavy bag first starting off this is a J fo brand five foot heavy bag obviously is unfilled bought this on Amazon for 60 bucks it is a synthetic leather heavy bag on the website it says genuine leather but that's definitely synthetic bonded material as the nylon straps at the top with the metal rings and then a zipper closure and it's lined with canvas on the inside so this is where we're gonna be putting the filling the next is going to be what I'm gonna use for killing now traditionally people will use old clothing rags whatnot but not a lot of us have a lot of clothing or old clothing laying around if you do great if you don't like myself it's going to be really hard to fill up an entire head bag with just clothes and even then if you do it it's going to be inconsistent with how it feels when you hit it so I ended up going with this home insulation called pure safeties from Home Depot it costs forty five bucks for this pure safety ar-15 you can find this in the actual the home section or should I say the section where they have all the the plywood and building materials and the actual installation you can see here has kind of a medium to soft density to it so when you actually hit it you can see it has a nice medium density it's not too hard like my nozzle bag where it's a lot firmer so this is going to be really similar to the title a wide low to heavy bag where it's a little softer and you could really sink your shots in I have an old beach towel I'm going to use for the bottom of the heavy bag to line it now then I have a hundred pounds of natural place and each one of these bags is fifty pounds and is five dollars so ten pounds to lose ten bucks of place and then I am gonna be using these freezer bags he's a 38 gallon freezer bag or should I say 1 gallon freezer bags and pretty standard ziplock each holds one gallon about which is about eight and a half pounds but I feel it all the way up to ten pounds and your so you're gonna need about ten of these Ziploc freezer bags I already done two here that you can see and I'm using my scale to weigh it as I fill them up and then lastly after I get done filling each one of these Ziploc bags up I'm gonna use a gorilla tape to tape these off that way they don't leak out when I put him inside so I'm gonna fill all ten of these up and then I'm gonna show you guys the finished product and then start to fill the bag when we're done filling up the sand so check it out so I already filled up these nine Ziploc bags each with 10 pounds of shann and after I showed these up with sand I just use it my gorilla tape to tape over the opening of the ziplock bag that way he's healed it in so I have one more back to go and show you guys how to fill that up all I did was ask in my zip lock bag I had a scale this is the same scale I used to weigh the gloves wish and then three here let's go standard bread cuffs get yourself a drink and all I'm doing is basically just scooping the sand from this back into the ziplock bag so stick the sand out put it into the ziplock bag and then I have soup in there it weighs down the ziplock bag and I'm gonna put it right on top of the scale right here and you can see till the reaches ten pounds so if your time you don't have to rush through this by only thinking about half an hour and I'll try to rush through it my deal with you sooner but can't no need to rush try not to make a mess here anyhow you get that all up there next thing is keys to make sure when you close the lock on top of a ziploc bag that you get the air air out of the bag if there's too much air in there and then the bag can actually burst so let's make sure they get the air out of there close off that top of a good luck bag and just lay down flat and then again I just use some of this gorilla tape to seal off the top just put it over the top of this closure flip it over roll it over and then just tuck it under like so so the ziplock bag looks like that so that's a 10 photo of 10 ziplock bags this is 100 pounds right here I'm gonna go ahead and get the bag set up and then we'll start to fill it up ok guys so I finished tying up all the sandbags I got those all done over here and now I'm ready to fill up this heavy bag in the heavy bag I already put the beach towel at the very bottom and then I just put one bag of sand so I'm gonna actually cut these pieces of installation so you can see it comes in these little sheets of insulation and they're folded in half so you can see like that so I'm going to do is I'm going to get some a knife and just cut this into sections and then drop them into the heavy bag I have nine more sandbags total so it's going to be about 120 to 130 counts when this is all setting them down so I'm gonna get two I'm gonna start cutting filling it up and then you guys can check it out okay guys so I removed my old heavy bag I this G fo bag on one of the nylon straps if you're doing it by yourself it's typically easier to do by hanging this that way you don't have to worry about the bag sagging down as you try to fill it with the insulation so I hung it up on one on one of the straps that way I could just step on my step stool right here and then put the insulation in after you put the insulation in and you put your sandbag in now obviously in between layers you want to use a broomstick just a long stick that way you can pack the inside insulation so everything is nice and even and symmetrical and it feels firm you don't have any weird loose spots or flat spots so I'll DC over some time of using it for the first couple days you're probably to get a little bit of settling but after that it should be good to go so this insulation again comes in these long sheets and I'm usually just a standard you can use a standard utility knife and what I'm doing is basically just cutting this into thirds folding it and then putting it into the actual heavy bag so I'm just gonna cut this and then I'm gonna put on the heavy bag so check it out so it's actually pretty easy to cut you can see my knife is pretty sharp and just slices right through the insulation you can tear it as well you can tear the insulation by hand but that's just a little Messier and it's not as obviously not as even as I cut if you're to use a knife so there you have it I just cut this all I'm gonna do now so I'm just going to fold it and you can see this insulation is pretty pretty easy it's pretty malleable you know you can manipulate it pretty good to get it into the back and then just load in here so you can see how easy it is actually push this material into the heavy bag once you get it in there you really have to worry about it being super even just push it on as far as in as you can with your arm and then from there grab your broomstick and pack it in so it's going to get up here and pack this material again it's really important that you pack it as hard as you can because you don't want any weird soft or flat spots in the bag so again just to make sure that we tacked it as good as we can so it's nice [Music] do you have it now I'm gonna add a sandbag to it so we have the sandbag here I move in this drops in and that sandbag is going to give the bag is awesome weight then I'm going to cut this insulation again there it is so I'm going to cut this last piece of insulation in half fold it and put it in there kind of this it is a little messy with the fiber insulation but nothing too crazy all right so my head and cut that I'm going to go ahead and fold this one again and put it in the bag it's getting pretty tight once it gets higher up you don't really have to use a sticky mark it's actually better to use your hand it's really get in there and push it down on it to really make sure it's nice and flat nice and packed again sandbag put this right in the middle nice and even and then this other piece of insulation again it's going to fold it in half and drop it right in so you can see it's pretty much the same process over and over until you get it all the way fold again just using your hands to really push everything in there nice and compressed and again you're gonna see a little bit of you know box here and there and as you can hit this bag you'll start to see everything even out so don't be alarmed by that if you do see some spots that are kind of bubbling out you know this is one of those things you're doing at home and [Music] time and money doing it that way so put this left bet again so that's pretty much the wash rinse repeat process of stuffing this heavy bag with this insulation and the Ziploc sandbags I'm gonna go ahead and finish up doing this tool it up to the top and I'm gonna show you guys kind of the finished product before I super up and I start to hit it so go finish this up I see you guys here in a second alright guys so I got doesn\u00b4t cleaning up to do but before I do that I'm gonna go ahead and show you everything is full this is gonna be the last of the insulation at the very top you can see kind of firmness as a house and I put all the sandbags inside there to give it a good amount of weight I would assume this is anywhere between 100 to 120 pounds it just kind of depends on how much was really went in there as far as the insulation goes so that's full all full so I'm gonna go ahead and dip it up connect the rest of the nylon straps and start to hit this check it out [Music] [Music] so I just got done hitting this bag as you can see it has kind of a softer to more of a medium consistency as far as hitting it is definitely not as firm as mine as Oh bag there but your shots with this sync in a lot more you get more of a 15 sensation because of that insulation that I used to fill this bag with now I do expect some of this perkiness or some of these uniform minutes to start okay guys so just got done hitting this bag as you can see it has a little bit more of a softer feel to it it's not as fun as that knives Oh a heavy bag that I was using so it's a little easier on the joints you're gonna see a little bit of settling also as you hit this so those are good rule of thumb to keep some of that extra insulation if you have any in your garage or wherever you keep some stuff for storage that way if you do experience a little bit of suddenly you can almost unzip the top of the bag and add some more even things out we have this relatively inexpensive way to fill your heavy bag 45 bucks for a whole roll that installation rather than using you know old clothing or rags that you have to kind of scrounge up and find around your house and and even then you might not have enough to fill this all the way up so really good do that I hope you guys found this video helpful if you guys have any questions comments or any ways to improve this make sure you guys leave it down below as always I'll put the links where I purchased everything for this set up in the description box and I'll see you

supermarket but don't know where it's actually from product of thailand thailand is from thailand i probably will put the chinese thumbnail on because i like how it looks and it's from a chinese supermarket got a glass because you like seeing the color oh my god and I'm glad I did bloody bloody hell that's literally the best color for a drink I've ever seen probably maybe it's actually slightly boulder in the flesh it's like a Hulk green whereas on there it's kind of bit paler and nyanyi that's amazing that is amazing I'm already impressed the fruits on the front a banana pineapple and orange no idea what is oh my god hashtag Walt no idea what it's got in our path from that but let's go for it smells really good oh yeah oh weird carbonation look at this so must go cloudy and then disappear that's really good really interesting quite unlike anything I've had before it's got a real nice sweetness to it and it's got say this with a lot of Sodor's it's got that smooth sweetness that you get from drinks that use pure sugar or sugar cane and I would strongly suggest that this does suggest suspect banana you can definitely taste the other flavors pineapple and orange not so much however it's not just banana in there you can taste something else to it it reminds me a little bit of the banana berry flavor skittles that are in the recent skills was it a tropical version I think pretty good drink it's a little bit too sweet and because of that rich candy banana flavor and the general fruit salad eNOS it makes it a little bit sickly so probably going out very much of it I don't actually drink soda like all that often pretty much 99 percenters I might have war I only really have this for the show this show that you're watching so I won't actually finish

punch is to collect the most cards players collect cards by squeaking the banana when they see exactly five fruits of the same type shown on face-up cards let's set up the game if you're the oldest player you get to be the dealer shuffle the cards and deal them out so that each player has a stack of facedown cards place the squeaky banana in the middle of the table and you're ready to play the player to the left of the dealer flips over the top card of their stack this time the card shows three bananas the next player flips over the top card on her stack two limes and play continues to the left four plums two strawberries three bananas three strawberries we have a winner there are exactly five strawberries on the face-up cards if you're the first player to bop the banana you collect all the face-up cards place them under your stack and start the next round popping the banana when there are more or less than five of the same fruit has consequences sometimes you will think you see five of the same fruit if you squeak the banana when the face-up cards don't show exactly five of the same fruit you must place one facedown card on top of each of your opponent's facedown piles as a penalty towards the end of the game you might run out of cards if this happens you may continue to play without flipping over cards you are only out of the game if another player bops the banana and collects your face out cards if you bop the banana you get to collect all of the face-up cards shuffle the cards put them face down and flip them over when it's your turn when only two players are left the game ends the next time a player bops the banana and collects all the face-up cards if one of the two players box the banana when there aren't exactly five of the same fruit showing the other player collects all of the face-up cards and the game ends the player with the most cards at the end of the game is the winner thanks for watching and happy gaming for more information on fruit punch

punch I don't know what it is that makes me gravitate towards it I have played with this punch more than I've played with any of my punches you can pick it up at your local Hobby Lobby it's by ek success and it's a large punch in my original video I shared a tutorial making these cute hamburgers don't they look realistic in my last video I shared how you can create Subway sandwiches and by the way excuse my fingers they're very inky but aren't these realistic kinda right in this video I'm gonna share how you can create a simple bunch of bananas also a variety of one of my favorite vegetables which happens to be mush ring and I made this card using some of the mushrooms that I created now I'm gonna also share with you I figured it out how to make not a hot dog but this is a Polish dog you could pick these up at Costco in my last video I attempt it to make macaroons now she she she has since picked up this punch and she makes a darn cute macaroon but these are mine that I made in my next video I am going to hopefully share my banana split I would give you a sneak peek but I don't have the ice cream quite the way I like it and I'm gonna also share how you could make now check this out tacos sweet drop 45 I read your comment I'm working on those french fries to get started I'm going to start with the mushrooms very simple these are the pieces that you get basically lay them out and arrange different pieces together this is the top bun piece and this is the meat you can position or angle the top of the mushroom any way you like I've taken the bottom bun piece and use that as the stem and check out my prototypes here look at the squiggly this is the lettuce and I use that as a stem so you just play around and arrange your mushrooms any way you like of course you can color them any color you like I really do like this card I have a mushroom die set but I haven't seen mushrooms used in this do you have colored your mushroom take a white gel pen and create dots you can also add a sentiment really cute right to create the bananas it was just as simple I took one of my alcohol markers colored the bottom bun I actually grabbed a banana from the kitchen for inspiration and then I took a dark brown pin and just colored the tips make us mini bananas as you like and then adhere them together and you have a bunch of bananas and the highlight of this video is my hot dog or my polish dog Casca version that is my family we eat a lot of turkey and chicken so i buy the turkey hot dogs but let me tell you cusco has the best when i want a real hot dog or polish dog i buy cusco and can you see my relish the only thing that's missing our onions and sauerkraut I don't do ketchup but you see the mustard so let's go ahead and get started you need four cut out and I've colored all of my cutouts you need your two meat pieces these will serve as the bun one lettuce which serves as the mustard and then one bottom bun which serves as the meat now I saw the formation of a hot dog when I made my first video I just couldn't figure out how to make it look like a hot dog and I have figured that out start with oh by the way one of your buns take a white gel pen and create your to use this glue by Martha Stewart that I picked up from Tuesday morning I love this this works really good start with your bun that has the dots on it and then add glue to your meat actually I'm going to add it to the back of the bun position your meat under the bun you don't want your meat to be too high and if you notice I didn't round the ends of my hotdog and my last video I mentioned that but you really don't need to if you lower lower your meat down low enough so I think this looks okay now the key to making that look like a hotdog you don't want to line up your buns together take a look at my actual hotdog you can see if you can see this is the bottom or the back of the bun there so you want to raise it up a little higher than your weenie I'm gonna add glue to my weenie take my bun and position it a little higher than the front bun that way you get that that 3d type of look and then take your mustard before you add glue you want to play around with how you're gonna position it you don't want it to be too high you just want the yellow to peak through so play around with it and add glue to the back of your hot dog and I think that looks good now I'm going to add my relish to make my relish I'm using flour soft I'm gonna attempt to add onions as well so I'm gonna use this glue you don't want to add a whole lot and you don't want to cover up your all of your mustard either hopefully this glue works okay and this is how it looks so far now I'm going to add some onions here's my polish dog with relish and onions I think I like how it looks without the onions I don't like that white but nonetheless this is my Polish dog made with the burger if you have this punch or you plan on picking this punch up and you create something outside of a hamburger share your link with me to your creations let's collaborate let's see how many different designs we could come up with well I want to thank you all for watching if you like this video and

watching me in YouTube check out the channel a whole bunch of recipes authentic from the Caribbean sometimes let me play around with some recipes as well you're gonna love the little fusion something too today look what I've got here I've got me a can of Guinness Draught can only mean one thing Guinness punch this yet drink wicked for days ladies Valentine's Day is coming up make this one for that favorite that special guy in your life he's gonna love it and trust me you're gonna love it too crazy a Caribbean pod calm let's do a wicked Guinness punch the ingredients are as follows I've got one cup of milk here you can use whole milk 2% whatever you got in the fridge 1 cup of milk look at my water bottle of Angostura bitters you're going to need a couple of drops of this Angostura bitters over here a pinch of nutmeg and a pinch of cinnamon it's going to give us a lovely little bouquet something cut some ice of a one cup of ice over this side here we've got 1 cup of evaporated milk star of the show Guinness I've got one can of Guinness and it says this is 500 MLS up front the final ingredient we'll be using today sweetened condensed milk here I've got four heaping tablespoons of sweetened condensed milk after you blend this and yes you will need a blender for this after you put this together you can taste it and you want that rich creamy taste with that nice bold taste of the Guinness in the background so you may need to add a little bit more of this condensed milk if you like optional ingredients you can certainly add um a raw egg in here if you want but I don't do raw eggs it's not my thing so I really don't do the right thing you can use some cocoa powder I mean if you can flavor it with additional things like a vanilla or anything else you like but these are the ingredients here we'll be using today just about everything is going to go into the blender so in goes that ice I'm using 2% milk so one cup of that milk I've got that lovely nutmeg and the cinnamon bring out mr. Angostura bitters bambam give him a nice little generous drip drip up in there woo one side the smell Mason in goes that evaporated milk just gonna scrape in all that lovely condensed milk in there now as a kid I used to get in trouble for condensed milk whenever my mum had this in the fridge boy myself and my brother will always lick all the woman condensing trouble for these that's already in the blender so up next now I've got mr. Guinness and we're just going to pour in that lovely penis subside there you can certainly put more ice if you want and looking at the amount of liquid that I've got here I know for sure and just that's just my preference I'm gonna need some more condensed milk but after we blend it up you can taste it and add more condensed milk if you want so all I did was I pretty much blend this until the ice and you can certainly add more ice to this blend it until it's nice and mixed it's incorporated that's what I have here took me about 30 seconds or so in the blender this drink is done couple tips

nine that's generous for canelo alvarez callum smith six foot three again that is up a seven or a six inch or an eight inch height advantage and it is a seven and a half inch reach advantage so they're both 168 they will look vastly different in the ring here tonight feeling out process now in round one canelo was accepting this pace against sergey kovalev in his last fight it'll be interesting to see if he is accepting of that pace in this fight [Applause] body shot thereby callum smith off the combination and i would think sergio callum smith needs to build confidence in this fight right in this round and even just landing a shot okay this guy's a superstar i was just able to touch him he already touched him twice for the body and i think that's he's already getting confidence with that canelo is inching his way in he's real calm he wants to take his time calum knows that that's why he's not committing to that long strong jab that he has but he is committing to those body shots [Applause] jab snaps back to head smith and canelo goes to work with the hook the right hand was blocked let's see if they engage smith for b having such a long reach has a beautiful short right hand that was a good jab by callum smith he was able to land there final minute of round number two most of that first round according to copybox fought at distance nearly the entire round and you would figure that would favor the six foot three fighter in the ring and not the five foot eight fighter two jabs both land from canelo as he starts to get his range and close in able to step out make smith miss with the left and the right good defensive work by canelo alvarez he has excellent head movement jab again in the right hand from canelo [Applause] sergio he's closing the gap now they're basically stepping on each other right now this is what canelo could [Applause] explode hard right hand there you know smith just landed an uppercut that was a nice shot but canelo comes back and he is throwing much harder right now gets counted smith up on the ropes lands the right hand i'll tell you that was beautiful head movement by canelo is in a hard hook you saw colin smith land an uppercut he tries the uppercut again and he tried to land then more shots and canelo just got out of the way and smith was just punching the air you see the scorecard right there from christmas last three rounds going to canelo and you can have it all canelo so far first round was close [Applause] good right hand by canelo comes back to the body with a combination 90 of the fight at distance in the first two rounds and now 32 of the fight in close range canelo is moving forward and he's landing and he's making callum smith miss you wonder if callum smith has the pop to drive canelo back and do some damage sergio it doesn't look like he's got that through six rounds no he has he definitely has the pop he just can't he probably he can't push canelo back this entire fight you only see canelo coming forward kelly smith hasn't imposed his size or his will coming forward i know all canelo will come in look at how he's cutting good quick combination by colin smith but the jab straight up the middle even when he blocked that right hand from canelo it drove him back smith fights back off the ropes [Applause] he was able to drop george groves with a counter right hand he was able to drop him with a catch catching counter left hook both hands are dangerous but he's not letting him go canelo has landed 50 power shots 27 of them to the bottom so he knew with the physical match-up 6-3 and 5-8 he was going to go to the body that was a body shot that would stop liam smith and of course he's going to the body and effectively that shot's blocked but that right hand knows and we've seen this we've seen this with coca liver he didn't throw more punches and see this with jacobs he didn't throw enough punches golovkin lead uppercut by canelo and then right hand you know what sergio canelo just provides such a tight package coming at you and then when you throw a shot if he's able to move or counter it's just so difficult to beat him [Music] [Applause] he gets a little more active throwing his hands power punches so far nearly two to one for canelo 60 [Music] just missed that right hand doubling up on the right hand as well canelo looks comfortable he is walking in he is stalking and looks to walk down smith good right hand there by smith canelo gets a little lazy walking in he gets hit and you're right look he's just not showing respect now he's not taking shots and saying no i'm going to keep walking in terrible right hand those shots blocked but they're popping on each other laying the wood to each other and if they both do that i think we know he's going to win that battle uppercut from canelo brings the head up on smith canelo fighting with no fear smith is very game eats a jab round nine scheduled for the championship 12. it has been mostly canelo alvarez as he fires off and lands a right hand and then a jab back so smith fighting back in that last round and canelo gets under the hook and goes to work uppercut landed as he moves in and some blood now coming from the nose of powersmith that was a hard body shot in the right hand chris maddox giving two rounds so far to callum smith you know a lot of mexicans try to do that chavez used to do that i remember on tony martino used to do that just throw with the punches it looks like it lands but when you see it in slow motion smith is getting beat up he cannot stand there and take those shots blood now pouring from his nose he weighs in he's giving it everything he has and now back up against the ropes toward the corner dangerous territory for smith hard right hand smith is hurt buckled on the ropes that the ropes kept him up but he's able to move off and gain his footing one of the hardest shots of the night he fights back and fires with his own combination champion fighting back with everything he has [Applause] uppercut sergio and it's straight the front of his face [Applause] smith the champion of the world is getting busted up uppercut in the right hand fires back the hook trying to get respect final 30 seconds of the ninth round look at smith go to work and try to drive the middleweight champion back but you see just a little bit of give on callum smith right hand he's hurt smith is hurt uppercut landed that body shot hurts smith quite a bit canelo has 20 seconds looking for just the right shot that could possibly end this fight hard right hand smith is getting beaten down but he hasn't stopped firing back that was a very rough round for the super middleweight champion i think it's because he has the legs he has the freshness we've seen him do a little dance like three rounds ago i've never seen canelo dance either he's feeling light on his feet and he's definitely punching heavy smith was hurt by that shot to the body to the side and then the uppercuts straight up the middle in the jab as well canelo just walking comfortably to callum smith in a hard body shot [Applause] canelo coming forward yet again blood pouring from the nose of callum smith final 15 seconds of this 10th round smith drops his hands low for a moment to suck in some air [Applause] snapping off the jab and he's landing over 50 of his shots as well he's accurate not wasting shots moving his head the total package not that smith isn't trying trying everything he can this is a different animal right hand that hurts smith that got smith on the forehead back with his knees another right hand after the hook smith fights back [Applause] and in the corner of canelo alvarez how about a perfect round sure that would be terrific 12th and final round super middleweight championship of the world canelo alvarez comes out firing he has looked superb and punishing here tonight and canelo has bullied smith the entire fight he will try to go for the knockout he will try to close the show canelo's going for it here you can see hard right hand tried there by smith canelo answered with the right hand approaching the final minute of the 12th round and now callum smith will try to tie up canelo trying to buy a little time and met with booze here in san antonio because smith is looking up at the clock he wants to stand already and that's why the fans are looking at that you can't blame him hard footing right hand again and a body shot from canelo trying to close the show can he finish with a knockout i don't think there's much question if any question on the scorecards i mean [Applause] with the look of a three-division world champion [Applause] 154 160 and he should be the super middleweight champion of the world we have a quick decision let's go to the ring and david diamanti ladies and gentlemen after 12 rounds of action here in san antonio we go to the judge's scorecards steve weisfeld and ramos bosco was about 119 to 109. steve morrow scored this

morning and welcome to my kitchen if it's your first time here watching me on YouTube I think it's below click on subscribe all the latest videos going to be sent to you as soon as they go live and speaking about videos I've got me some carrot here today early in the morning say avoid doing a carrot punch some of you may know it as carrot juice in the Caribbean this is what I rosin you know there's nice drinks here you have when you need a little pick-me-up this carrot punch is wicked you can also put some rum in here I'm not going to do it with any rum today but you can put some rum in there and kick things up for you know the big people so Chris yeah Caribbean pod calm let's make this carrot 1 I've got about three pounds of carrots here and I'm just going to quickly show you we've got two well peel it but I don't like wasting too much of it so I'm going to do it a little bit different we're going to trim it down cut it up into pieces to make it easier for the food processor or if you're using a blender and all you will do is remove the top and the bottom and then we'll get paring knife you all you will do is scrape the skin notice how it's getting the sort of thin skin off there if you peel these you'll be wasting a lot of the carrots so all you would do is like I'm doing here scrape these off I'm pretty much cut it up into smaller pieces so all I did was I went ahead and I'm going to cut my carrots up they've already been scraped washed I'm just cutting up into smaller pieces because I'll be using my food processor to to break this down if you don't have a food processor or a blender and remember it's important that you do cut it up into small pieces because you don't want to burn out the motor in your food processor or blender but if you don't have a food processor or blender do it old-school my dad would just take them use a grater grate it and then extract the juice from it we're going to be doing this in two batches so in here I'm good half the carrots all chopped up as well as three cups of water so you'll need 6 cups of water in total so what I'm going to do now is puree this into until I get like pulp just quickly show you the setup I have here so I have that pureed carrots 6 cups of water that we use in a bowl there and over here I've got my fine mesh strainer with another bowl so what are we going to do we're going to take out scoop fools of these pour it on here squeeze it in here to drain out all that lovely carrot juice so all I'm doing taking a scoop put it in there and really press down because I want to get all that lovely juice out of here really press to get all that juice out and continue doing it here's the thing guys and I remember my dad doing it if you really want to stretch this a bit right here you would put this back into another Bowl put another couple couple cups of water and really squeeze that out I've got all my lovely strained out squeezed out carrot juice in there look at all the trash that's left back I mean I say you can certainly put some more water and then squeeze that out but I'm going to be honest this morning in goes some nutmeg and cinnamon it's going to give that a quick whisk and we may have to strain this a second time only because it will be a little bit gritty because I know I am messy when I'm making this and chances are a little bit of that trash may have gone in there but I'm going to sweeten this up and put it together before we do so but a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg if you got the freshly grated stuff bring it in there and I'm gonna put about a teaspoon well more like a generous tablespoon but for your case a teaspoon of good vanilla if you want to put a little bit of honey in there you can certainly do that this year's semi some vanilla that Taylor brought back for me from when she was in Mexico itay and care and we're down there and one can of sweetened condensed milk and I think this can is 300 milliliters and all you're going to do is mix this really well it may seem like a lot of condensed milk but trust me you will need it you can add more water if you want to thin it up a little bit but this is perfect here all the ingredients that I use today will be in the description of video below so I'm just going to go ahead and mix this up now and then I'll show you what a lovely drink this is there we go I've got a well small glass so far I don't be greedy yet some nice ice cubes in there and what a great way to start the day remember to strain it for the second time you may find back some trash in there but I mean I say if you want it a little bit chunky do your thing Christian but come this is the ultimate carrot punch or as I think in some of the islands other islands they call it carrot juice we've got that nutmeg in there that's cinema and that fresh grated or when our case we pureed that carrots condensed milk boy I used to get in trouble as a kid with my parent well my mom she always had a Conant's milk in the fridge and you know it was like a victim to me I always wanted that condensed milk Krissi actor tiempo.com leave me a comment below remember to subscribe and check out Carribean

actually have an environment quality on high when it shouldn't be you know I was playing around with a couple things in low replay have been having a lot of problems with it as of late that's a little bit better a frame rate as things get under way sorry about that let me just double check it a couple things while this game gets underway but yeah this is going to be a UH essentially a tournament casting a couple of notes about said tournament let me actually turn off shadows here um no person on this team i believe is level 30 and even if they are level 30 i believe there are some restrictions and that there are no rune pages and master pages i believe are limited to 12 points as I believe the lowest player here is a level 12 I'd turn off chat since that will yet little bit in the way but anyway red team is going to be sejuani sona by diana and caitlin now this is actually a very tanky team with Vienna and sejuani Sona is going to be probably acting in the methodology of the support with caitlin a very long range attack damage Carrie let me actually go and sort these out just actually i'm not going to sort them out because things are gonna be a little interesting blue team it's going to be a moo moo on Sean night Lux on the esquire misfortune the quad skater and then at the bottling Quinn ash PGN and sheridan sheridan so this is a very heavy attack damage based a team composition with quinn ash a misfortune all playing the role of ranged attack damage so it's essentially team damage vs team tank the blue team is really going to have to win in the early game if they're going to cement any kind of victory because if the red team is able to slow the game down and get their tanky items going get there late game process going then the blue team is going to be in a world of hurt right now three of the red team sitting in this brush right here probably looking for a movie to try try something muma actually is carrying a teleport and clarity no smite I'm wondering how this is going to go in the jungle I'm not sure what he's playing on doing but right now three probably looking for a steal on red buff Quinn and ash currently pushing that Lane up sona is currently game Elaine now keep in mind guys that this is not a level three games so there's going to be some crazy wacky going on so it's going to be rather interesting read teeps still waiting around now actually losing quite a bit of experience here are probably waiting for a killing movie he cycled to the North jungle going for the walls so this is actually kind of a a wasted effort here by the red team Caitlyn is actually going to cycle around she is gonna get spotted by this war dashing quinta girl retreat and actually collapse in on to Caitlyn she is actually caught out being slowed by the frost shot summer Neil being used sony able to save her with a bit of a heel ash pursuing in Caitlyn just eating a ton of damage still level one has opened orrin's blade however ash with a very similar opening Quinn opening boots pots try get some of the mobility going I actually kind of like this combo of ash and Quinn ash for the slow is to help Quinn kite and deal of damage with those very heavy bursts with the Harrier passive fortune top versus via this actually going to be a really interesting lame fortunate really has to abuse it early is advisable to gain a level advantage she's just going to start punching fortune out like nobody's business fortune kind of playing a little smart staying back we're gonna have to see how this goes out this give me a crazy game to watch sejuani and diana currently taking the mid lane normally there's a solo mid with a jungler inside but looks sexually was trying to go for those wolves she's actually very well overextended needs to be kind of careful here she does have a lot of minions going for air we go get back to your side life so you need that farm I should know so it's going to be Lux and Diana in the mid lane so do I is gonna be in the jungle does cedrone carry smite no she's actually carrying clarity as well honor if there's an unspoken rule to uh not carry smite and that's actually a bit of a problem because the array lizard is actually occurring currently kicking a move as toe cuffs right now so junglers are probably may set behind a little bit in the fact that they're not carrying smite so we're going to see what happens currently sidhwani actually heading to the top lane try to get a gank uh miss fortune does fortune have the sported no she doesn't but some spidey senses telling her get the heck out of there so she's gonna be running back activating those impure shots does get some nice damage onto those two having a bit of lag issues here apologies mid lane is right now just going to be a farm test because pre six Diana can't really do much to looks but the very same time looks can't do much to Diana unless she's really hyper aggressive mainly because Lux has some pretty serious mana problems early on in the game why am I having such lag issues this is a bit of a problem my apologies i'm actually going to set that to very low and this is going to freeze for a minute I apologize while we're doing that we're going to take a sip of my minute maid lemonade actually no not because the game is getting underway there we go I really do have to do this in the lowest amount of a graphical settings possible but this is actually a very interesting Lane in the bot Lane actually kind of like this Caitlin Sona most the damage is gonna have to rely on Caitlin right now the vault going off askme will pick up the kill here she can get one more shot off no she's gonna try to have the tower eats two huge tower shops now she's very low kind of an unneeded flash their tower did stop attacking her so flash down for ash ash flash is down this is why I waiting from his fortune to push this up just a little bit probably waiting for a signal from by but this mini wave is going to push forward so sidhwani has to make the move here and now if she's going to be doing much of anything by gaining a little bit of her ass day acid Ronnie probably missing her chance they're probably had a moment to actually charge in there but nothing done blue team currently pushing this up pretty well quinny another tower shot they do need to be careful of that tower right now the main goal is going to be to get as much CS as possible and then push their way forward take out that tower and then start roaming a blue team actually doing a pretty good job of cementing an early game lead they do have a one kid gold lead at present time I was doing a pretty good job harassing Diana actually the esquire doing a very nice job rocking those illuminations light bind was a little yeah well we need to talk on those life I'd stand and not really react here more if we have a disconnect yeah we have a disconnect the night goes down he reconnects and kind of an unfortunate first blood as right as he reconnects he dies that is very unfortunate actually so currently 120 that does cement a slightly larger gold lead so I currently seen on the top lane fortune has back she picks up a vampiric scepter probably get some initial lifesteal going and we move taking control of the top lane at present I'm probably realizing the jungle was a little too difficult right now he does have a spirit stone which is going to help his a mana regen but currently I believe he is level 3 to vi's 6 so you just have to be very careful while soaking up experience in this top lane so join it currently hate to the mid lane luck seeing the tower shot she is out of mana so she's the one I wants to do anything it's going to be here and now before Lux him back which like she is going to stick around she did open faerie charm a wonder fire charm is really good on Lux I prefer to but they am are very aggressive a spell spammer in lane so 122 fairy charms is seems to be the current meta opening for most mid laners these days Lux ultimate going off actually nail sidhwani she's actually got to be careful the only thing saving is that looks that man a flash going down unfortunately is not able to get the kill this is the time for Diana to go away ignite goes down looks doesn't have enough for a shield she goes down overextending on Lux's part she really needed that man who looks is very man attendant if she is down to her basic attacks there's very little that she can do currently caitlin sona have a neutralized dis lane is currently back to pushing in the center of the lane now that here's the big problem for the blue team in that Ash and Quinn are currently splitting CS whereas Sona actually does carry 14 CS on her right now but caitlin currently 19 actually I'm very surprised actually currently ash and Quinn 2226 CS respectively caitlin just sitting at 20 so it looks like sona is looking to split CS with caitlin very interesting that or it could be a stray hymns of Valley that are picking up the cs but 1615 is a lot for that diana currently pushing the mid turret currently 121 still one king gold lead looks pushing her back with a loose and doing a good job probably those eliminations meanwhile we have a gank up top something Barry going out onto misfortune this is what I'm talking about when x is able to just sit on this fortune wail on her there's very little if she can doing night goes that's a dead misfortune tower is not going to help her there 122 currently gold lead still in the blue team's favor probably from the cs in bot Lane alongside with the first blood Lux has picked up a chalice of harmony and a cages lucky pick very smart openings for the two if I were to see a thing fiendish codex out of her next that would be amazing honestly but diana is going to have to build some form of tank if she wants to do much here mainly because Lux is very long has a lot of damage going for but that's about it she does have some nice utility through binds and slows but if diana even gets a simple wote sorry about that if giant gets a simple negatron cloak a lot of that convenient negated for the early game currently Sona eating ooh both tower shots and uh Quinn Harrier strikes summoner heal I believe that summer hill I'm looking yes Caitlyn carrying healing clarity interestingly enough probably relying on 90 caliber net for escapes but keep in mind during the teamfight page that she will not have flash to reposition she will only have her 90 caliber net misfortune currently pushing back up on to buy and it looks like a movement may come for a gank here unfortunately this ward does spot him so I is going to play a little bit careful now keep in mind these guys aren't quite level 30 oh this is a uh I think this is a competition between two websites so um I think one got challenged to another and they they've all been practicing for this for a while so and again they're not level 30 so they won't have you know optimal runes and masteries for jungling toppling meta things like that so just a fun game for fun and it you know it's kind of relaxing casting something like this where strict meta isn't followed so I remember those days those were good days Caitlyn currently overextending if Quinn can get a vault she doesn't mean you be careful vaulting over these snap traps as the extension will still go down so no being used unfortunately was not enough for Caitlyn to really react sniper old is not enough to take her down oh but that arrow may be enough the stun goes down the night Kellerman it does go out but not fast enough ash is able to pick the kill their meanwhile diana game to kill on Lux rewind and check out what happened there Lux again going for a kill on sidhwani there's the ultimate locking her in place and there's the moonful a Diana Prince Mak barrier goes out but not enough damage moo moo just a little too late to the party so Diane able to get the kill on deluxe two to three still a gold lead for the blue team right now overall I think they're doing a slightly better job of CSE getting that creep score gain their gain as much gold as they can out so blue that is actually very good for the blue team containing the f3 ad carry's they need to farm farm farm well at the same time trying to cement an early game advantage right now that is going fairly well with ash being wanna know unfortunately Lux one and two at present time where is their third ah Ryan misfortune I forgot so these two are low they do need to be careful of that tower quinchu probably recall right now she's still sitting on a longsword does have a site ward just in case she wants to ward up in this river right now good inlets for a jungle gank warding are going to be right here since it covers the main inlet and it covers a dragon approach and also ward in the tribe rush to prevent junglers from coming in through your own jungle and circling around behind you now for the red team it also holds true if you feel like gain award here that is also optimal award here can also be optimal if you want to avoid tower dives because sometimes if you are really far behind junglers will sit here wait until you're pushed up to your turn to come behind you and own you right now there's only sitting in that tribe rush waiting for a gang ashes at the graces of her tower auch schatz right by so joining she's got a charge right in eat at our shop Nibali not too much going on for their she actually went straight Giants belt to get some help she's gonna have a nice help buffer to actually soak up some damage for right now she has very little in the way of resistances aside from her passive frost armor and that only works when she's attacking she's trying to run away from ash not going to happen too much right now pre pushing by unfortunately not putting too much ooh Caitlyn actually at our shop and a vaulted Harrier so she needs to be very careful right now using those piltover peacemakers to push that lane up have the tower eat up some of that CSI movement now coming bandish all signs on Kaitlin no reaction for a squid there's the ultimate locking them in place but there's a counter ultimate from so join they're gonna try folks as much as possible Caitlin seeing out to the side moo moo ooh bullet is blocked by ash all three someone is very low Sun is about the only one clarity being used to try get some desperate mana back hopefully hoping for a ring gauge Quinn and ash do need to be careful ashes out of mana and thanks to that summoner clarity these guys are going to have the manner to initiate if they want to so Quinn does have to be careful three still bot pushing that tower fortune in by currently just kind of avoiding each other right now I'd like to see if I get a little more aggressive but the method here's the thing if I really does have to out damage Caitlin all right now she has a long story crystal probably moving towards a phage for the SLOS I had to look away a bot now there's a yoga elbow go and catch this up here so do I currently pushing forward I believe they attempt at our dive here that just does not work out charging in tara has taken but all those slows teleporting from amumu tower is going to finish that off and here comes a movie does she'll and a bandage toss yes you will grabbing sona someone's gonna try to escape she has no natural escape make systems aside from her e which is i believe the song of celerity she does she have a point in the song of celerity yes she does she's able to get away not much reaction at a stroke win on that very nice blind to stop most the counter-attack by caitlin wall coin is at low health barrier being used probably want to use that actually right in the middle of the engagement to try so comes as much initial damage as possible in bait fights but good engagement now the score is tied up at 323 we are 14 minutes into this game strong has returned to base currently as a still and adorn swing a giant's belt probably want to build some form of tank Diana there's the Negatron cloak alongside the blasting 1 i'm going to guess abyssal scepter right out of her trying to get any magical resist Lux may bring to the table right now lux actually still has chelston cages she has picked up sort shoes though so that negatron cloak is going to be a tiny bit less effective not too much though diana is going to have a bit of an advantage i would say because Lex is very burst heavy she doesn't know how much in the way sustained damage and the Negatron is cloak is absolutely fantastic it's stopping burst damage especially when it comes to one to two installments like Lux she has a life on Chad Lewis and singularity that's it simple at lemonade you know lemonade probably not the best for rehydration during a league game probably get something different for the next game anyway so dry once again waiting for a gank um fortune she is actually pushing now I'm actually kind of surprised to join us backing off on this Oh Quinn actually picking up a roaming kill on mid lane coming up with ash looks like they may give a bottom turret for this but vaulting on the Diana it does cause the light bind miss but there's that ultimate out of ash Dan's going to try to deal as much damage as possible but couldn't able to pick up the kill there a moo moo desperately trying to hold this bought our Quinn and ash should probably either push this mint or or get back down to help a movement it looks like they're actually going to try to push this sidhwani missing the ultimate gain nailed by the lux lays are lots of damage going down under this could be a dive abul situation there's a Harrier marking that is another kill for Quinn very nicely played on that part so join was probably feeling a little foolish for engaging a 1v3 but probably they expect them to dogs that old quite as well as they thought I'm we're actually doing a very good job of holding off these through these two I tried to say three and said too and yeah so these guys going to continue to push up I'll try to get a second turn because they're noticing Caitlin Sona aren't doing much in the way of seeing this story it's staying around twenty-five percent help they're not actively seeking it these guys could still get a second tour they're actually not back off noticing by communion queen ash looks like they're going to head back down is a moo moo's ultimate up yes it is so this could be a fantastic bait situation should they want to go in on to caitlin sona if they can coordinate with shawn knight now this is actually a perfect position because minions are currently there they're currently seeing here comes a moo moo to go walk right on in perfect timing on the ultimate good counter ultimate out of Sona but she is now dead and now it's just a 3v one perfect kill 7 2 3 4 K gold lead for the blue team work at this attack damage to base team working out very well against the male a heavy team out of the red team I actually want to talk about that a little bit right now you have a ash and Quinn who are two very notorious kiting ad carry's ash with her permanent slows via frost shot Quinn is just a beast at hiding with vault able to disengage blinding a soul able to negate a lot of basic attacks alongside tag team which actually concerned the tories movements be increased there's the arrow out of ash if she getting enough there's that permanent slow and such wise frost armor is unable to do much of anything right now to help mitigate some of this damage because she is not attacking however she has negated offs the slow Arctic saw barely getting her out of that you noticed just how well Quinn and ash were able to stick onto sidhwani with the combination of vault and frost shot currently not much to talk about in toppling fortunes still say no vampiric scepter she is level a 12 is sitting on 99 CS not doing too bad in Matt regard by much better in terms of the items picked up Merc trends out of all things I'd much rather see ninja tabhi here honestly mainly because she's going against a heavy harass ranged ad solo top normally you don't see admittedly but Merc treads let's see Merc treads may not be too bad of an idea concerning the team composition how amumu has his AoE stun you can get I the Asha and chanted crystal arrow as well as the misfortune make it rain I suppose analogues findings will be a little bit of mitigated however Lux is really the only source of ability power base damage I'll get back to that in just a moment but here comes a gank on a movie from sidhwani ignite and assault and battery go out misfortune here support with the bullet I'm getting at least some damage on this is one she's gonna have started tagging like crazy here amidst the tower dive she's gonna flush right out fortune may turn this around by is trying to get out of there that vault breaker is able to get her out at least a little bit another kill on to joining she's currently 0 and 3 has picked up wisely picked up a chain vest and this is very smart because the path rearranged a decomposition she's going to eat as much armor as possible may actually take a look into muumuus build here it currently has spur to the ancient golem which is actually actually I take that back i'm thinking the wrong spirit that's actually a notoriously effective tank item for junglers so actually a pretty good choice out of a muumuu if he wants to be a tank so he's not gonna go much in the way the AP department he has I don't think he has anything in the way ap investment yeah 0ap right now so he's going to essentially be going full tank meaning the only ability power base damage is going to be out of Lux which is why I'm a little worried about this a merc tread by out of I yeah there's going to be some reduce CC but is the extra magic resist going to be worth it over the armor and we're only get we're gonna have to wait until the teamfight stage to really find that out Caitlin Sona actively pushing they're actually pretty well overextended here of ashkan linen aissa enchanted crystal arrow Quinn be able to do some work however she is low on mana so she does have to be at least a little bit careful kingly at our shot there here comes a muumuu does grab the minion is he gonna go for this there's the ultimate ash gets the salon diwali and yeah caitlin just eating tons of damage she's gonna go down easily here comes the enchanted crystal our nails sona amumu does have enough for bandage toss there it is loucks haltom it probably expect to sooner to still be moving flash as sona there's a flash out Quinn as well if a movement can land this bandage toss is going to be a kill see if he can lay he may not have enough mana he has the mana he gets the land can't the Harrier marklund yes it does nice power cord to try to save it the coin is able to get the last auto attack and this looks to be a runaway for the blue team actually forget what their name is uh I remember team banana punch because that's punching banana things like that but the blue team doing a very good job right now currently cementing a lead right now 6 k gold lead currently no objectives gained in the barren or dragon but there's another time in another place of that looks was in a bad danger there diana did get the moon fall off unfortunately so joining was not in position to really help in that matter and while things are going a little bit more slowly actually things are not going slowly is here comes diana double moonfall unfortunately not able to get as much damage as she wanted on to lux probably with that moon fall on cooldown nice lease are clear out the mini wave nails but Diana answer oyster joint is low she doesn't need to be careful so all that's going on I'm sip lemonade ah very good now here's the thing Caitlin although she is 0 and 3 she does have 93 CS as opposed the 66 and 65 a coin these two are going to have to work together notoriously well to match Caitlin however keep in mind Quinn is 5 and 0 so a lot of her gold is going to be coming from kills they're currently probably looking for a kill on Diana and still honey they're currently pushed back to tower so probably not the best of time I'd rather see them go bot lean and try to stop this Caitlin and sonam from free farming as they are now right now they have an advantage you want to try to keep that in stop Caitlin sunder from free farming because if caitlin is able to free farm her way back into this game that may spell trouble for this uh blue team right now they're going to have to head up to stop this mid lane push currently for in mid misfortune of I still kind of hanging around top right now the only uh interaction in this Lane has been a fruit ganks sidhwani ultimate coming out what seeing a ton of damage there's the immovable great use of AOE effects Quinn blocks the lux holt and that's a double kill for a mover here comes the power cord out of Sona amumu is low is he going to get out piltover peacemaker does not do enough damage it's going to rerun and watch that fight from the beginning something I want to note that is game-changing is that a moo moo ultimate because they have to be really careful here let's go and wait for this teamfight to get underway right now this is ash and Quinn working at their best there's this Selanne ultimate she charges in get some very nice berth statement on deluxe but amumu just locks all that down and then the burst of AOE damage through blinding assault enchanted crystal arrow and a move his tears Quinn is able to block that shot and a moo moo picks up a double kill moo moo actually dodges the solo with that bandage toss which i think is actually very fantastic because I might have actually gotten a mad alive so great engagement out of the blue team and the red team yep as I said before the blue team is going to have this early game advantage with these uh range pokes in AD carries what the red team needs to do is slow this game down get katelyn nice and fed to the point where she can stay out of range and then whoa sorry about that uh and then just start poking things away they are passing the dragon I wonder if they'll take it no they're gonna head to the bot lane try to push that Lane up once again here comes a teleport out of a muumuu so he's an asst stein me that push very effectively moo moo for uh having a jungle without smite he's actually doing a very good job I'm rather surprised ash and Quinn currently making their way top they want to probably get this a tower up here by is currently pushed back to return thought so not much they can really do in that regard Quinn currently waiting to the tribe rush river is warded so ash has been spotted I'm not sure if Quinn has been spotted however so that's something to know ash currently making our presence known in Lane they may want to know that uh they may want to actually try to push that up Quinn definitely gained spotted now Lux coming in behind Caitlyn laser lands but he'll doesn't against some of that flashing over the minions is she gonna land on the trap yes she does there's a movement Wow amumu just doing so much damage to Caitlyn killing spree for a muumuu top turret has been taken out by the three-man push and the red team is just scrambling trying to figure out what to what to do their bananas are getting kicked in it really hard right now Diana waiting in this river brush blue team chart does get taken out Sona picked up down here out the gonna rewind for that diana currently trying to engage on Quinn very nice vault to get out of that moon fall here comes to join to try to do something does lay in the bowl up barriers go down for both ash and Quinn ash flashing out of the way here comes assault and battery Quinn is shut down fortune now caught in a bad spot ash is gonna have to retreat she is out of mana it's not what she can do to really help misfortune however a vice law and mana I'm not sure she can use a vault breaker and i believe so Johnny had her um Arctic assault going for her meantime however a muumuu in Lux currently pushing this link looks being very smart using her loose and singularity ask out the interior jungle to wait and see if anyone's going to try and come up and stop her so do I currently is cycling this bow would out in ultimate there's not much she'll probably be able to do while MooMoo works on that looks tough spots annoying what those to see Larry get some very nice damage off Nick here comes so now these two are probably in a while back out just in case 15 24 25 minutes in blue team doing a very good job right now they are cementing the early game advantage I'm for guy came up in the shop window that makes me a very sad panda sift that lemonade as things are starting to wind down interesting choice out of Sona actually picking up a Fred's crucible I I know it's called Mikhail's but others one game where I think I called it like Michaels or something something very generic and I decide what if we're going generic may as well go all the way and call it Fred's crucible so uh so no with Fred's crucible as well as ionian boots let's say this is actually going to help a little bit and getting people out of those ash Ultimates if you are smacked by a national to me thats been flying for a little bit i think that's like a three or four second stone it is long so these guys need to be careful and the SONA picking up that Fred's crucible is going to help out a ton and gain add those stunts because it's essentially a quick silver sash Plus he'll that you can use on a target other allied which is very nice right now three pushing the ax bot lane Sona tanked some tower shops the movie is gonna want to get in here and get in here now he is currently using his tears to try clear that out Sonnen actually ulting amumu now probably have been saved for another time Kayla needs some huge damage right is the ash ultimate lands perfect wombo combo kill on to Caitlyn sidhwani and sona are going to have to retreat now meantime though vai and diana are currently pushing this uh this mid lane right now what the blue team needs to do they need to start pushing may have an advantage there are 16 24 they need to start taking some of these in our turrets start pushing towards that nexus so right now that is the first inner turret taken out for the red team as some much-needed global goal that they're going to need if they're going to win this game what's actively pushing out Diana that's actually in the move ultimate used light by jills barely misses Diana Arab seems me by diana has been killed this is my ultimate just to stop a muumuu so things going really well for the blue team but the problem is they need to start pushing I think that's exactly what they plan to do right now actively start pushing that mid lane try to get that inner Tower this is why I currently has to recall Sona and Caitlin are just showing up I believe diana is still dead this is a perfect time try get some damage on to that turret Queen eating them pretty nice char shot now here's the thing is that these guys actually have some pretty decent weight click through Caitlin's piltover peacemaker but they're gonna have to be a little bit careful in cycling this tower because Caitlyn does have some nice poke so what this is essentially going to be on lunch she's going to have to start seating Caitlyn always may light binds and loose singularities as possible just like that very good laser to get Kaitlyn low sona's Camilla healer up but that is precious time that the writ of looting can use try seems this tower and or get some kills lemonade for time laying off in the wing this is actually a really good time for bullet time as currently people are clumped up now this was some inner healing some of the clarity are actually pretty good because you guys are able to gonna going to be able to hope that you stop a lot of this pushed through sheer attrition now Kaitlynn overstaying a little their pain some very nice damage off this Michaels crucible give no Lincoln's metrics aside that gave a bility power for some reason these guys are desperately trying to push this up unfortunately these guys are doing a very good job of stopping the siege and this is where you want to split off someone who is very very powerful and can escape easily someone like Quinn oh no I take that back here comes a movie solo going down there's an immovable locking up everyone this is under tower entirely there's some misfortune bullet time that is oh wow engagement under tower and just not doing what they wanted that was all 54 to exchange let's actually take a look at that because that was an ace when the blue team was so far ahead so you really do need to be careful with a team compositions like this because once they're in the thick of things that's where they're strongest these guys I think needed to poke them down a little bit more but here comes the moon gagement Sona power cord locks out what excuse me I hit the wrong button my apologies you ain't get back and play that half speed telma my apologies i clicked the wrong button anyway here comes a move before he's able to get the old hop the sono goes off and locks up the 280 carries the  from it does not stunned by for long x is able to immediately assault and Barry looks with the help of the tower and this is where these torches locked up for ultimate time fortune is the last one standing she does pick up a double kill but is just not enough damage for her to really clean house notice via has a nice fluffy chunk of health left sone has been constantly healing and this was all under tower so 19 29 now very good engagement out of the red team amumu probably want to think that one through a little bit this may be inhibitor turret for the red team which they desperately need that global gold for we're going to be pushing on right down I just realized that sorta why has the skin I was worrying that look why that looks so different I've never seen a sad whining skin before like honestly so yeah this is probably yeah that's definitely going to be a inhibitor turret and possibly inhibitor depending upon if these guys want to try to stick around and risk it currently for our up so they may just want to take the tower and back the heck out actually they're gonna stick around get nailed by a laser here comes tag team has she vaulted yet no does he the sky strike though these guys do have some nice and gate disengage a move is going to keep chasing though they it is a nice bandage toss but unfortunately excuse me Wow unfortunately team was not there to support him so if amumu really needs to communicate this team a little bit better saying saying things like hey I'm engaging you guys need to follow up almost immediately so they need to be a lot more careful with these engages because a lot of times a movie goes in and there's a very noticeable delay before these guys are going in as well so simply lemonade of all things are winding down alright it's hard to talk with allergies spring is here and I just got out from fencing outdoors so yeah talking is rather difficult but I'm here casting because this game is I believe life yeah it's live anyway in other news i'm going to be working on in ash guide soon and that's going to be coming up probably next week because i want to get one more guide out of the way because i'm running out of champions hmm well moment mmm excuse me Wow allergies yeah i'm running a Champions do guides for some having a bit of trouble figuring out what i'm going to do after that something of the ash guide i'm probably a remake the lux guide started with the lux guide me as well and with the lux guide until I learned some new champions of course but uh that's currently on the list fortunate engaging on sidhwani unfortunately she does have both my aunt said on her tail and this one I'm talking about with Vice sticking power just able to wreak fortune top Tower of or a bottling tower inner tower has been taken I keep thinking that's topped our for some reason but it's not so red team currently three bot gold lead is still firmly in the hands of the blue team it looks like two of them want to try to take this outer term right here as I believe it's the last remaining outer turret standing so they may want to take that try to get that easy 150 gold looks like they're actually a back up away from the minion wave Quinn and ash currently pushing top what these guys need to do is start grouping up as a five again and try start catching people off guard because you notice how split the red team is whereas the red team honestly can do something very similar luck so we actually run smack into Caitlyn here miss is the light buying there's the sonals meant to lock her up flash is not going to be enough as Caitlyn picks up the kill on Lux by flashing out trying to avoid Quinn sewing Kaitlin currently chasing ash out of Lane and blue team once again is still a bit scattered so I think what they need to do is start cleaning out their jungle start picking up these red and blue buffs I believe they actually are see what is the buffs right now moving actually seen on double buff that probably would work better on one of the ad carries but oh I left see what happens with a muumuu and that and the red team currently actually holding a pretty dominating position by actually going straight damage with the exception of the Merc treads has blood their Stern black lever Diana picking up a void staff game passed a law that magic penetration now here's a lot of not yeah I've mixed up my sentences there uh here's the interesting thing blue team actually has very little magic resist so this void snap actually seems a bit premature especially with the blessing one the Negatron bloke I I would have expected a faster of the susceptor it's like Quinn got taken out by three up here when this is the problem is the blue team is starting to wander around a little too isolated right now and what they needed to start grouping up is a five right now three men push at toppling they're probably going to take this outer turret and keep in mind the blue team does have an exposed and Hitler so what they need to do is defend that and just start pushing pushing pushing if they can take the middle lane inhibitor then they will be able to equal out the turrets and in case the red team does start spawning a super minions they can just as easily take out their own inhibitor and equalize it three of the red team currently moving to mid looks like they're actually in a group Group up either for a jungle invade or a lame push and right now this is where team tank is starting to shine in their glory because right now so Johnny Cena sunfire cape chain vest and glacier strategy is 214 armor so she is going to be negating a lot of that damage that the blue team is going to be doing hmm Oh Yellen who they feel those jaw muscles work anyway push onto the exposed inhibitor this is always good probably look for a lock up here does get hit by the lock spine does take some significant damage there but she does have to be a little bit careful Sona using old vauxhall does Neil so no mover Tankian tons of damage right now Caitlin sonar down amumu has gone down so now it's going to be a kite game unfortunately Cydonia liz going to have none of that look at that 214 armor just doing work suwanee cannot be focused right now simply because of that massive armored advantage that she has so currently 241 i believe it was two for two no two-for-one because Quinn was able to escape so that does mean the blue team inhibitor is going to be saved the red team is going to have to retreat lick their wounds by do things like right that right now active menu push on the top lane Diane's going to go and deal with that fortune pushing out the top lane as we speak and I'm going to have some more lemonade because with bouts like these sometimes they do get a little bit short mmm man it's good stuff anyway um so yeah I'm gonna be doing a fencing program for the next six weeks i'm going to try go as much as possible and help teach kids how to fence and it's going to be a lot of fun i love i love fencing i'm a i'm pretty much even if you were to define me it would be first fencer and second league of legends player follow closely by Gilbert's two player and crazy but that's just me so be doing that for about six weeks it's going to be a lot of fun still going to try to get a better upload schedule going right now I haven't upload a lot because I had a bunch of game saved on low recorder but there's a bug right now the terrain that literally all of the terrain saved the river is showing up a pure black so it's very hard to commentate on something like that when you see nothing but black except for the river and it just does not make for a good time so I the the three or four videos i had planned with them games to go with them just kind of went down the drain meanwhile red team grouping up for another push Lux's could add a position they do need to be a little bit careful here right now this is essentially turning into the team fighting a Aram where I try to take this inhibitor get those super minions going Quinn is a little bit exposed here so she does have to be a little bit careful because the saurian gets a guesser locked up that could be a problem fortune bullet I'm actually gain stopping to settle they stop focusing swine here comes the vile to me Lux hitting all three amumu tanking tons of punishment though a movie gain taken out but is Quinn gonna be able to deal enough damage to kick this out there's the double kill can she chase down so no clarity being used hopefully for some of the heels and damage here comes Lux around for the side the light binding connects Quinn birding in does land on the Caitlyn trap but now Sona is slowed and there's that attack speed ash just doing damage infinity edge and phantom dance are very smart out of ash Quinn trying to get as much same as on to Caitlyn wow that Harrier marked is so much damage only sejuani getting out of that alive so fantastic fight by the blue team is essentially sets them back into the game currently at k gold lead right now the heading top lane very smart as they do have minions there to help push going to clear out these purple team mini waves and start pushing down that turret and because this is a three a decomposition they can actually take down towers very effectively this is why are you charging in but turret down inhibitor exposed and there's still 24 seconds on to Caitlyn so these guys might be able to fight it should they want to top inhibitor has been taken out keep in mind this is going to start spawning super minions these crazy suckers with 4100 HP a lot of damage and no care nexus turret for the middle lane is now down Quinn actually in a lot of trouble but ash is able to save her will it be at the cost of Lex's life yes buys assault battery is taken down now keep in mind this is not exposed to inhibitor over here and a destroyed inhibitor on the top lane the only Nexus turret remaining standing is the bottom turret which actually a Mumma is actively pushing now keep in mind that since there has been an inhibitor taken down blue team's minions all of them are going to be inherently stronger notice I believe that reads 805 hit points 26 armor 16 mattresses for the blue team versus only 705 here actually it's only a flat HP increase I thought was an armor increase as well okay but keep in mind that the blue team now has a minion advantage with that exposed to inhibitor so unless the red team actively starts pushing these minions out the minions for the blue team are going to naturally push fortune recalling Sona very smart picking of Ages the Legion trying to balance out her defenses for the team as much as possible ah quin very smart actually getting a last whisper she really needs that too if she wants to dense sejuani at all diana finally finishing her a business after but here's the thing she probably would have been better off going with his on his hourglass because Lux though she is a significant threat she is four five and twelve the main problems for the red team right now Quinn who's 9 30 and nine and ash is five on and 12 so the main premise here is attack damage and right now what Diana really needs is a zhonya's hourglass and she seriously needs that a pushing power that pushing ability that can just help her get right now help her stay alive blue team actually going for a baron red team does not know this sorry I having some framerate issues here I believe it might be because they are going for baron unfortunately misfortune taken out this could mean inhibitor for the for the red team however Baron has been taken whether it's worth it it will entirely depend on how the blue team reacts to this inhibitor being destroyed very nicely easier to catch a lot of people very nice to chant crystal arrow right now they are common datoria via has to flash out trying to get as much damage done on to these turrets but right now that's just not worth it diana and sedge going down very nice power crizotinib unfortunately it's just not enough light by nails both us sona and I on a very nice Amy a deluxe and that is Annie race for the blue team and look at these minions they are actively starting to push out into the blue team Nexus Kate bottom turret has been taken out by these minions alone Caitlin very interesting choice picking up our Roux nuns hurricane you don't see this item too often unfortunately I'm not sure if it's too great on Caitlin but we'll have to see what she intends right now Quinn actively pushing through right now super minions are actually hurting are quite a bit Caitlin noses trying to go for but unfortunately the team shows up and just look at that lifesteal potential with the Oh bloodthirster and Quinn keep in mind that the Harrier proc does also proc bloodthirster so you can get a lot of life back from a of letters hit three inhibitors down for the red team and though they have one on the blue team is not going to matter at all since all three are down that's going to be super minions goal or it's going to take all of the red team just to fight this off I'm currently taking down the last of their turrets is it going to be enough is this game going to go the blue team everything gained dumped onto sejuani holy crap app and there's the Nexus Game one to the blue team very nicely played as a victory for the blue team very well done with that a decomposition I was a little worried since they didn't have some much in the way of pushing power at first but then they got the game together started pushing like no tomorrow and cemented their win great game guys Pitman 254 here hopefully with game to ref see how what time it is sign out take it easy guys you", "4T2XQDdBYZ0": "all right short video I'm showing how to use a hole punch properly to punch properly don't to use a hole punch like this and just randomly put holes and X ain't going to work very well there is an easy way yeah the arms always fall off the useless there is a marker if you look I'm trying to get this to work get some light on it see that I'm getting too close to the camera there you go that little arrow marks the center of a piece of paper when it's putting the elephant there's also a line on the outside but you can't always see that no you got do take the piece paper or lightly fold it so you can make a little nick in the center all right ah so you get like where the center of the pages and you line it up with the little arrow can't see the screen for a while I'm trying to show you you know that's roughly lined up and then I open then you get out and center as easy as that", "OdG1UKz1z1M": "hello welcome today I'm gonna be making you all - in punch and I'm using - in if you can there - in maybe even tried with arrows just for different tastes and here have one pound of that - in or taro root that i peeled and cut up into chunks and this is what it looks like so I got a big piece and I'm just doing half of it because a little goes a long way so once you've filled and washed out your taro root and you cut it up into cubes you're gonna put it into a fire of water when the - in is pork tender strain it and put it into your blender okay so here I have my - inna and the other ingredients you'll need for this I have a tin of nutriment and if you cannot get nutriment you can use it enough chakra Jen and if you cannot get that you can also use a bottle or two of the vanilla and sure I have a ton of evaporated milk you'll need a dash of bitters some honesty the essence and if you can't find honesty essence you can use mixed essence of vanilla essence or extract you'll need some cinnamon powder and conventional to your taste so you can add as much as Litani this as sweet as you want so to your blender you're gonna add in all of your ingredients and I'm gonna add in my 1 tin of carnation milk the nutriment to aniseed essence or as I said you can put vanilla or whatever flavor that you like cinnamon powder a dash of two of bitters and then your condensed milk to taste next cover and blend this until it's very smooth when you have finished you want to taste it and if you want more kindness what can you want it more sweet or you want to adjust anything you can at this point and all you do next is strain this into a glass jar or plastic jar so here you have it doc - in punch taste so yummy you all will not even know you're drinking - inna and I know it may sound wait a couple of you but I've had this already in Trinidad and it was really really yummy so that's why I wanted to make it few all I want you all to tea is this to serve your dash in punch you want to serve it on ice because this would get really thick as it sits the longest sits the thicker it's gonna get so if yours is getting thicker one tip I would suggest is you probably add some whole milk to this or you can add another tin of nutriment or supplement whatever you use do you want to add another tin to thin it out because this will get really really thick as it's pouring here you can see how thick that mixture is so here you have it my dash in punch recipe I hope you guys try this recipe it may sound weird but trust me it's really really delicious you all are gonna

boat, and we set sail and we robbed, and this will sound far-fetched, everyone in the world. (audience laughs) Do you remember that? What a spree that was? Do you remember the great heist? What a spree. (audience laughs) And we got all this swag didn't we? And we took it back to old blighty and we hid it, this is the clever part, we hid it in a museum. (audience laughs) Last place anyone looks. Now it's the modern day, and all them countries we stole stuff from are asking for their stuff back. But don't be worried. We're totally saying a blanket no. (audience laughs) Now, a few of you are sitting there, I can see your angry faces, like \"So what? Finders keepers, shut up.\" And--\n(audience laughs) listen, in your defense,\n\"finders keepers, shut up\" has worked very well for us so far. Gents does and knocked it out of the park \"finders keepers, shut up\". But even you got to admit, right, if someone stole something\noff you as an individual, it was your favorite\nthing and they nicked it, and you knew who had nicked it by the way for a fact, not a hunch,\nyou know who's stolen it. Everybody knows, it's common knowledge. Some people have written books about it. They have definitely nicked it off you. (audience laughs) You go to ask for it back,\nand they just standing there. They're not even running away. And they're twice your\nsize, they ain't scared. They haven't even bothered to hide it. They've done the opposite\nof hiding it actually. They put it in a glass display case. (audience laughs) It's lit from seven different\nangles, real clear what it is. There's no disputing it's the same thing that once belonged to you cause\nthere's a plaque next to it, says exactly what it is\nat the top of the plaque, and then a paragraph underneath about how important it is\nto you and your culture. (audience laughs) You'd be forgiven for\nthinking, \"Mmm I'm pretty sure \"they haven't got a leg to stand on here. (audience laughs) \"Probably gonna take this home today.\" Must have been so confident,\nall them countries when they asked for their stuffs back. Walking up to Britain,\nsaying to their friends, \"Wait in the car, don't even need ya. \"Be back in a jiffy mate. \"Hey man, a while ago,\na lot of your ancestors \"stole loads of stuff from my ancestors. \"Yeah, I'm here to take them home. \"Let's right this wrong, what do you say?\" They must have thought the\nBritish person at the door was gonna go, \"Absolutely\nyou can have them back. \"We stole them after all.\" But instead we went, \"I don't think so. (audience laughs) \"We're still looking at it. (audience laughs and cheers) \"Yeah, just looking at it these days. \"And there's a lot of other\npeople who haven't seen it yet \"we'd quite like to show it to. \"So not right now selfish. (audience laughs) \"Don't sulk about it. \"Look, it's no hard feelings mate. \"Hey, you can look at it, come on in. \"Have a look; have a look. \"Seem familiar? (evil chortle) \"Stand behind the rope!\" (audience laughs) That's why the British Museum\nis so busy all the time. No British people ever go in there, it's full of people from abroad\nlooking at their own stuff. (audience laughs) Just walking the corridors, reminiscing about the good old days.

the mini live event began the season and this is what they were talking about wait the maps changing big time wait the map like just changed within my eyes that is sick that's the last one yeah we should be done right i think we got it wait this looks so sick bro what up it's not enough i can't stop it the foundation is that makes sense he's he's he's getting himself in there and he's wait we're literally seeing a map change happen live this is the new map we saw the leaks what do you want me to do i can't get over there can i yeah i can bro what butter barn's gone oh no it's other i

this is why four name will always be four night really no other games does this man so he overclocked his like connecting bro what is happening and there you go into the battle pass trade which we've already seen isolated wheels and i want to listen this morning there's a primal force that finds the fly that drives us that's kind of cool that goes right into the battle pass trailer and search lara croft dude we're gonna buy the entire battle pass using code pack-a-puncher of course if you guys want to help support me man all one word no spaces means a lot go to the item shop before you buy it we're putting someone's code at least you know even from anyone else uh you know but uh it means a lot dude it helps helps creators a lot and uh this battle pass cool that's raven from teen titans go i used to watch that show as a kid that skin is an amazable force so was asking [Music] let's go that's high bro geez the new vehicles and there's that one we just win is that happening that's cool they had the old map while also showing the new map you know and yeah arena points are resetting in a week but there's the battle pass but featuring neymar jr coming soon um as a crew member i've already locked the battle pass so there we go man um i just locked a bunch of cool skins holy moly well ladies and gentlemen this is off to an insane start let's go ahead and uh probably equipped aiden jones i think the most part i also got the backpack for the four night crew a freestyle for kit bash freestyle for the spark plug freestyle for that freestyle for that very very nice man very very cool so we're in game right now man first off guys you guys know the drill man support here pack a puncher all one word no spaces whatever you want you can do all caps pack the puncher you can do it all lowercase pack a puncher however you want to spell it man all caps all lowercase pack a bunch of works help me out a ton man and i and i really do appreciate it man so very very cool item shop seems the same as all these hunters are still here which is cool because they all kind of uh you know do go along with this new season we definitely need to go in and check out the new map and i do want to get a win on this new map because this looks amazing bro i think this looks so cool man we have the new all the new menus the solos duo's trio squads we definitely gotta get a win with this brand new map this brand new update pro but so far man i'm feeling pretty good about season six as long as they update it throughout the season and have like content throughout i'm excited so without any further ado let's go check out the new map and get a dub all right here we go played a few matches of season six it feels like save the world there's the zero point thing i don't know man i've got mixed opinions right now i'm hoping i think with more time it'll be better but uh i don't know the weapons are are interesting because they're not like normal weapons they're like makeshift shotguns and makeshift smgs you have to like upgrade them and stuff i don't know i'm trying to like it i'm trying to give it a shot i think we just gotta uh you know i don't get used to it more so here i'll drop it in i'd like a bow here like bro there's like a bow like what knock down one knock down two wow this is weird now i get minis after bro i need mats i think he's right here i can't reload this this really has two ammo bro you're kidding me got him nice okay okay bro a normal ar yes we have a normally are we shooting a normal weapon oh dude it's true if i'm here okay normal weapons bro feeling overpowered by normal weapons dude that is actually really good did that just feel really good bro i just where where no no let's go dude wait makeshift after some g blue one okay we're chilling we're chilling oh wait there's animals so please stop spamming all right thank you ruby charlie animals right here they're bores do i shoot them maybe i don't want to shoot them do i i'm sorry i don't know i feel like what the oh i need an animal bones though i need another bone i'm sorry i don't know what to do no i don't want to do that i don't like doing that oh if you'll get your health full wait how much health does it do get his own i could craft this into a purple one right should i sure okay so we have a purple primal rifle which i hope is good it seemed pretty good the blue version so maybe the purple will be good too i don't know man 24 people left dude first game of the new season hopefully get this dub but i'm feeling good about it um i'll take probably a big shield honestly as much with a new season comes great things such as bots wait this gun doesn't have whatever i thought it was this gun's interesting i'll say that what that is what is that guy doing oh i just got gears can i upgrade this i keep dancing instead of doing this can i wear this to a gold scar or no wait i can't what i only have one gear too oh my god bro wait it's about my 10th kill 10 kills on the fortnight now just wiped out tomato town these new guns are really weird i'm just like using my pump because i'm comfortable with it this kid terrible what like what is this kid trying to do around me bro mr predator all right bro nine players left i have everything i need more wood i kind of want that normal smg man but i gotta take the new guns just because i'm you know new gun man you know let's do it let's do it let's craft it craft another weapon boys we're doing our purple makeshift i don't even know we have a primal smg we have a primal rifle both purple rarities i can't upgrade anything else i don't think in my inventory uh i've gotten 11 kills and only have one gear and 12 like whatever that is animal bones mechanical parts i don't know feels like save the world a lot i have zone i want this game dogmatic so we get the vicar out we get the victory glider if we get this dub so i'm gonna try to sweat and make sure i can win big time give me a gold scar purple scar i'm so tempted to use this man but since i'm a man of the content we're gonna leave it behind we're gonna use the new primal rifle where are these other kids at bro how's the map not a lot of map changes looks kind of cool for that angle so here here's the new map by the way now people are going to be asking new map um just you see it seems like it's i'm surprised if that didn't come out like fall or autumn because like the map doesn't look like a spring map you know because it's springtime in the united states and stuff it looks like it's like a fall map because all these leaves are like brown and everything the new area is actually pretty cool you can see them in the trailer and everything i mean i don't know the new map i'm just hoping we get changes throughout the season with this map this is our map the whole season i'm going to be very disappointed i'll say that now but we'll see also i'm pretty sure we have two guys but i think they're just camping in this room they literally are bro who is it like let's go dude that's what you get for camping geez man alright so this new prime lesson is not too bad i want to use this new primal ar dude this gun is wild got him 1v1 for the win man season six with these new weapons i'm gonna be honest bro i got a lot of my kills using these this pump that i've been comfortable with these new guns the primal smg and the primal rifle they're interesting i'm gonna try to get one with them though cause i think you guys have seen wins with pawn before but a win with the primal rifle let's just spam my smg oh my smg's good it's gonna kill him dude this smg's actually really good ready let's go ladies and gentlemen there you go my first ever win in fortnite season six this season is interesting i've never seen this majorly change of a season in fortnite history ever i think this is the biggest change we've ever had in one season to the next even bigger than uh the chapter two season one season where like i brought us the whole new map this just changes fortnite forever just how like you like craft materials build materials everything i don't know how i feel about it right now but i think and i've been saying this forever man i feel like the reason that they're doing this um and the reason that's happening is they're trying the long end goal here is to try to do like a minecraft open world type style of gameplay in fortnite and this is kind of their testing of doing that and uh i think i think that's how it's working man so i don't know feeling a little iffy right now we got to win though are we we should get our new glider as well 13 eliminations don't forget to use good pack a buncher when buying the battle pass it helps out a ton i'm gonna go return to lobby and check out this brand new glider um overall season season six i'm just i'm hoping we get updates throughout the season last season we didn't really get any so and by the way here's the free umbrella i got for winning the game i got the foundational umbrella um this is part of the seven obviously got the seven logo because the seven is a very big part of this um of this fortnite season six uh which is pretty cool as well so i under for your umbrella this is the season six one very very cool right here man and overall though i mean i don't know i think this scene's got a lot of potential it just depends what they do with it like i said season five just didn't really have a lot of gameplay changes throughout the season so i'm hoping we see some cool stuff here and um it's like i said this this season is definitely a big change it's a new season it feels like a new game and um having the having the introduction of these like primal weapons and and the bones and the mechanical parts i'm afraid it's going to drive some players away from four nights um but we'll see we'll just see it we'll see how it goes man it's only day one of season six um but all i can say there is gd's for that that epic victory royale we got our umbrella and uh and yeah man i mean battle pass is pretty cool as well dude i'm really glad agent jones is part of it too um there's gonna be also tons of cool things as well later on in the season like with this battle pass with challenges so stay tuned for the channel uh the season will be ending on june 8th it says just a little fyi so mark your calendars for season seven um yeah i don't know my overall thoughts on the update i think it's cool a lot of new content i love content i love new things it's just uh i am afraid that like the uh the average player might be turned away a little bit from this you know we'll have to see how it was maybe won't be too bad maybe i'm just uh maybe just the first impressions um but uh overall man gigi's forgetting that little victor victory royale umbrella season six on a scale from one to ten i give it a six point five out of ten right now battle pass is really good though battle pass is fantastic um it's just the game plays like we're gonna have to see how it goes we have to see how it goes but overall man season six there you go", "z4XWYEfwwNc": "hey guys welcome back to my channel as you can see i have some
