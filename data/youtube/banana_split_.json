victims in all our favorite horror movies I'm James Agee nice and today we're looking at the banana splits movie which premiered at Comic Con in 2019 the banana splits movie is based on the banana splits adventure hour a hanna-barbera Jam created by Sid and Marty Krofft that originally aired on NBC from 1968 to 1970 not gonna lie I had never heard of this show before this movie came out but Chelsea was familiar with it so what the fuck do I know the show featured the same anthropomorphic furries that are in this feature and they were in a band and they would introduce various segments that mostly consisted of cartoons cool how the fuck did this become a horror movie it may have something to do with five nights at Freddy's and it's perpetually postponed film adaptation I guess originally Warner Brothers was going to make the five nights movie but the rights went to Blum house instead and so Warner Brothers under their subsidiary Blue Ribbon content decided to make a different movie featuring murderous animatronics and they based it on the hanna-barbera show because the banana splits characters were already kind of off-putting I think that a lot of children's television is innately creepy for what it's worth I think the result is a fine slasher the writing's a bit for said times and there's some wonky editing here and there but I appreciate the tone it manages to hit it's cheesy but not saccharine self-aware but not cynical and funny but not mean-spirited plus it's got some crazy good gore so much so that I can't put it on the public version of this episode dan hey the score was composed by Patrick Stump from Fall Out Boy who also did an awesome cover of this earworm of a theme song [Music] and that's not the first time this song was covered by a rock band either in kick-ass there was a version done by the Dickies the band that did the iconic killer Klowns theme if you want to tralala and have a good time with this movie though you're gonna have to buy into it which mostly means accepting that the banana splits characters are completely mechanical animatronics even though they're clearly played by people in suits but come on just go with that cuz then you get to see stuff like this that's totally worth it let's go on and get and meet the splits cuz it's time to get to the kills the movie begins with the TV show opening that introduces us to all the members of the banana split show there's a doofy dog named Fleagle a crazy ape named bingo a lion named drew burr and a cute elephant named snorky am I forgetting anyone and featuring haha shit of course TV guys I would kill the place TV the banana splits show is beloved by kids everywhere like Harley here whose favorite member is snorky he's even got a costume of the trunky bastard for Harley's birthday he and his family are going to a live taping of the show the tickets were bought by Harley's mom Beth much to the disappointment of Harley's dad Mitch who thinks that Harley is too old to be into this kind of thing but I don't know man kids got a unicorn on his cake seems like the right age demo to me joining Harley for his birthday adventure is his half-brother Austin son of Beth but not a Mitch whose best idea for a birthday present is an umbrella without the umbrella part and a girl from Harley school named Zoe called in as a seat warmer when Harley's only real friend got too sick to go babies oh and suddenly our so mature bested by the bunnies once more they arrived at the studio and drive to the back of the lot in a long sequence with a lot of ADR news favorite show really I'm sushi she really loves to show I hope smokey doesn't snow icky shuffle it's so funny she's totally gonna do it he does it every time why is this segment so long we need some other wacky characters also therefore the taping that include data Jorge onething who wants his daughter Parker to be a star and that and papi the type of social media influencers who make me hate it when I'm called a social-media influencer the woman in charge of hurting these crazy cats is the studio's page named Paige who Austin kind of hits on but in a cute awkward way which seems to work I think she's on the same page as their Austin the banana splits roll-up and their little banana buggy and here we run over Harley who like the fucker your survival instincts kid they drive away from their fans and March their mechanical asses into a workshop where their inventor and maintenance man Karl chastises them for almost hitting a kid he gives drooper a painful looking update during which a random programming error turns the code a scary red color but even though inside his heart is breaking and his faux fur may be flaking drooper smile still stays I because the show must go on while that Karl guys the dude who created the banana splits animatronics this Rebecca lady is the person who runs the banana split show that is until network exec Andy tells her that the show was hashtag cancelled what did Fleagle say something racist the show's cancellation is kind of the catalyst for the whole movie but I've got to say and he sounds like he's making it up on the spot when he explains why he's acting a show that apparently still gets good ratings yeah but it's old and stupid and I want to do something cool and edgy so today is your last show the final live show gets started and the crowd is treated to a bunch of wacky hijinx until drooper misses his cue to come on stage which means Stevie the baddest motherfucker around is gonna have to cover for him we have to get trooper out of mr. Walters Heights fence okay haha great work Steven yeah well yeah but hey nobody really likes you Harley how about that one of the show segments is the game straight out of double-dare called sloppy time and it looks like they made an extra sloppy for yours they know how youse kids like I'm sloppy here oh and by the way Carl must be a genius that is some sophisticated AI to be throwing them pies like that obviously in real life the banana splits were played by people in suits and director janeshia Esther Haji decided that instead of actors or even stunt performers she wanted dancers to play the roles to best mimic the movements of an animatronic so shout out to the dudes underneath these clunky a suits teri Saul's bun - blam Corey Clark and Brandon Bray go it takes a lot to perform wearing cumbersome costumes like that those things are so hot I don't know how they're doing it all day they're really like the heroes of this film I think one of the kid competitors takes a plunge into a ball pit and uses a hammer to win the game if that voice sounds familiar it's because all three of the speaking splits characters were voiced by Eric Bauza a Canadian voice actor who's done a ton of work and is currently the voice of Bugs Bunny Daffy Duck Marvin the Martian and other major Looney Tunes those are not easy roles to get and because I love watching voice actors do their thing I just want to commend Bowser on all the voices he does here like how he replicates Allen Melvin southern drawl for drooper for his voice you know it kind of had the droopy kind of voice so we kind of have that Southern drawl very slow and that's what we did does a Ross Perot ish twist on DAWs Butler's voice for bingo and for that he was you know again much more high-pitched again a little bit of that weird southern drawl and doesn't excellent imitation of Paul wind shells Tiger if ik boys for Freegal the amount of power and energy that he brings to this character and then the the floppiness of it all I don't have spin Ani as for snorky he doesn't talk deal with that Paige goes to Stevie's dressing slash janitor where she finds him lounging inside looking like a mcpoyle he's drunk and angry because he's fifth billed on the show and gets no respect they waiting for the puppets they can wait me don't you worry about Stevie they're Paige I mean look at him he's the spitting image of professionalism on his way to the stage Stevie over here's Andy saying that the show has been cancelled and that the animatronics will soon be decommissioned he walks away looking way too happy about his imminent job loss but I guess that's because he's excited that the puppets will soon be no more since after he returns to the stage for the show's big finale he whispers to drooper that his days are numbered drooper spins the wheel of endings which as always lands on rock ow and let me just say I am living for Stevie sweaty drunken dancing montage he also heads up the tralala theme song will fucking burrow itself into your brain [Music] you've been warned the show ends but there's a special backstage tour awaiting some of the guests who had stars on their tickets there weren't any stars on Harley's ticket but Austin is a great older bro and convinced Paige to help him give Harley a birthday surprise so he gets to be the innocent Charlie Bucket of this wonkin adventure Harley Bucket backstage Stevie tells the very regimented banana splits gang that their show has been canceled and since he hated working with all of them why don't they get a taste of this through brain bout to put up with that disrespect though so Stevie becomes our first victim on the cow when drooper sticks a giant lollipop down his throat huh I wonder what flavor that low cherry yeah looks like cherry but try to eat it a little slower next time Stevie during the backstage studio tour Austin tells his mom that Mitch his stepdad broken sucks I mean the guy's not even here with them on his own son's birthday having stepped away to do business stuff on his phone but wait a minute that's not business stuff that's pg-13 sexting between Mitch and his assistant wow man hundreds and you're still getting bra pics why y'all taking that sexting so slow afraid of viruses Austin comes outside and confronts Mitch who leaves his wife and stepson with a very optimistic outlook on the situation this isn't it just Rita he had that's definitely one way of looking at it inside the tour has fallen apart almost as quickly as Beth and Mitch's marriage with Jonathan running off to find a producer to look at Parker page chasing after them and fat and poppy leaving to go explore the rest of the studio you know for the ground that leaves Harley and Zoe to meet the banana splits by themselves but even though drew furs are cool deuter's to them Harley really wants to meet snorky who's nowhere to be found he's too busy outside stalking down cheating husband daddies Jonathan finds Rebecca and believing her to be the producer who can make his dreams come true tells Parker to begin they're rehearsed routine that's not your size stop that is disturbing curb that can tells Jonathan to get the hell out of there because not only is that borderline child abuse there's also no more show for Parker to be a part of but Jonathan won't take no for an answer and goes off to look for someone hire Rob thank you for the opportunity fanon poppy passed by snorky circus and bingos jungle so they can step onto the stage of legals magic shop all of these sets were created by production designer Bobby Cardozo who had a great time making TV show sets that could be shown in their entirety since this movie pulls back the camera and lets us see the whole soundstage he was especially fond of the playing card spirals on Fleagle x' magic stage here which is the perfect place for Thad to strike up a live stream and do the one thing I knew I would never do - Chelsey proposed in front of a live Internet audience but you know what it works for Bobby so great these do are good for each other yes too bad legal is here and he doesn't like people trespassing on his magic stage or live stream in his secret press no Destructo fuck yo foul legal pushes that into a magician's box and locks him inside then forces poppy to assist him as they reenact that kill from leprechaun 3 by sawing the magician's assistant in half with a final push of the saw bad is properly killed which you can tell because he has blood coming out of his mouth I don't think Papi's a fan of the tray but I'm a fan of this movies practical Gore which Warner Brothers exec Peter Girardi who helped put this movie together championed over using CG all of the original property of the business which was all practical so we wanted to keep that practical nature of it we wanted it to kind of be true to that era true to that kind of filming papi tears off legals arm flesh but before he can kill her he's distracted by the sound of children's and Charlie and Zoey are now strolling through the snorky circus legal offers to take them to meet Snooki and even though he's got a scary Terminator arm shit man this kid needs to have some ala thought so let's go Jonathan finds the office of Andy the Network executive and is all ready to deliver his parker pitch but the only one there is friggin drooper who stands up and blows a bunch of fire into Jonathan's right not the best fire effects here but I do think it's pretty hilarious how drooper stands there dancing has this guy's face skin melts off and then bingo kidnaps your daughter not a good start to showbiz dude outside snorky finally decides to openly harass Mitch and chases him through a little ditch thing that the dude obviously should have just jumped out of Mitch runs all the way to the entrance of the lot where he finds the security guard standing in a corpse that's already position cuz that guy's head is no longer a fixed man I always hate the old standing corpse until it's touched things almost as much as I hate the final destination hit and run say we get a character development combo we're in Austin and Beth talked about his late father and how she wants to keep her kids safe after having to watch him die then the two of them meet up with Rebecca and Paige before Jonathan stumbles into the mix all burnt up and yelling about legals and shit so great these characters finally know that there's something amiss with the banana splits now they just have to find out that the splits are collecting kids and putting them in cages Bethan austin looked for Harley in bingos jungle but when Austin gets tied up and Bing goes crazy ape stuff Beth has to turn into hot action star mom so she can save her kid from the furry it's actually surprising how easy it was for Beth to toss bingo aside like that she even D armed the ape in the process she in Austin find papa he's still at the side of her slain fiancee but since Beth can relate to her what was the whole dead husband thing she's able to convince papi to go with them so they can all stay safe in numbers drooper drags bingos body back to the workshop so their banana split daddy Karl can fix that feller up but good luck didn't call to do anything right because he can't even keep the kids from escaping their chain link prison and instead he winds up locked inside the equipment cage himself ah if he's stuck in there he's gonna miss Fleagle show that's about to begin yeah it's time for Jonathan and Rebecca to get sloppy and the splits are gonna make sure it's all captured on camera 2 3 go forces as captives to run the course as drooper stands back there laughing like a killer clown they get to the end of the course but the only prize waiting for jonathan is a prop key that legal jams into his back good word Fleagle just keep unlocking more kills for us like that in fact let's get Rebecca on the count as well as she finishes the course drooper takes a hammer and smashes her fricking head open he's certainly dead Fleagle he's certainly dead the kids finally run into Harley's favorite split the inimitable snorky but careful now Harmon you think it's a good idea to approach the snork stirrer like that but how can you know for sure oh well water my truck you know what yeah looks like that's doing the trick are they doing this turkey shuffle what the fuck it looked like little girl of course they're doing the snorky shuffle having ported the noble snorky the kids take his hand and walk away with him into heaven a place where nothing ever happens the adult survivors go to Karl's workshop where they find the mad scientist still locked in his cave he laughs at them and tells them that the show must go on and sounds like it is cuz now they're hearing some music coming from a basement they discover underneath a hidden door that's Austin and Paige arm themselves and climb down but before Poppi can join them she finds Karl's prototype of hoody 1/5 banana split that he had been in the process of designing poppy takes it upon herself to become the hoody and Wow she learns the way of the banana splits lickety split since she immediately gets herself a kill by swiping at Carl with some razor claws mother's son and Paige make their way underground until Paige slips on some blood and discovers dug her fellow studio Paige dead on the ground with bingos drumsticks in his eyes Paige then looks up further to see that oh what the fuck come on she sees I think 18 more bodies next to dogs all the other employees and adult audience members from the show it's pretty hard to accurately count them given the multiple angles and tangled limbs but I did my due diligence don't expect a gender breakdown though moving on down the tunnel they come up through the floor into a boiler room with a makeshift stage upon which legal is holding court he and drooper terrify their child audience with the dead Stevie on a tricycle as they do some kind of fun sketch where they get to play the Grady sisters now the show while they blow Stevie's body away with a huge ass motherfucking flame Beth makes her way to the captive kids and tries to break them free with her monkey wrench before she can rescue those kids though snorky shows up with even more kids to imprison but since Harley's worked as snorky shuffle magic the pachyderm quietly gives him a key drooper and Fleagle bring out an all-new wheel of endings with Andy the network exec attached to the spokes they spin it and for once it doesn't land on wrong cow instead the outcome is a banana split and if you can guess what that means well you know what you're not even really trying cuz these furry freaks rip Andy off of their sawed trap and banana split him right up by tearing off all of his limbs if it's one thing you've got to give this movie credit for it's the very well-done practical goal thanks to snorky keys and mommy wrenches all the kids are able to break free of their chains Seth instructs Austin to help them get out of there but she's got some more kick-ass mom's stuff to do namely beating these banana splits silly he animatronics eventually gained the upper hand and are all ready to torch Beth to death but that's when Austin returns and puts down Flegal with a crowbar through the head Harley provides Beth some assistance by tossing her as little birthday whomping and she uses that to kill drooper by deploying it through his mouth and no sorry the banana splits aren't going on the cow they're just a bunch of fucking robots and they're not even trying to be human like the androids and aliens so I don't want to hear it just when you think this family's safe bingo bango bongo there's a crazy ape who's come back to block their path thankfully snorky be innocent interferes and the two of them get into an all-out they pretty much give each other to death leaving both of them broken on the ground heartbroken Harley says goodbye to snore to eat right before the elephant goes the way of Topsy we get one of those crime scene wrap-up shots where we see what's become of all the characters Parker tells her mom that she wants to quit acting Zoe and Harley become good friends in Austen's scores the kiss with Paige huh hon look at this mitch is still alive though not for long now that punch from Beth didn't kill him or nothing but after all the emergency vehicles drive away and he's less limping after them Mitch does get killed by another final destination style hit and run damn dude should have just cut your losses and limped away to be with your assistant the movie ends with the reveal of who's driving this cart full of furry corpses yep a deranged look and poppy ready to be the fifth banana split how many people were killed in the resurrection of the banana splits property let's find out and trial a lot of the numbers la la la la la ooh la la from what I could tell there were 27 deaths from the banana splits movie aside from that pile of 18 bodies we had eight male victims and only a single female victim giving us a very unevenly banana split pie chart with the runtime of 90 minutes that left us with a kill on average every three point three three minutes I'll give the golden chainsaw for clueless kill - Andy this movie is all about escalation and his brutal death in the boiler room is the climax of this film's horror dole machete for lamest kill we'll go to Carl since he was partially responsible for all this madness and yet was killed all too mercifully off-screen and that said the banana splits movie came out in 2019 and although it's a little stupid I think it's a fun kind of dumb if you like little kids dealing with evil AI well you're in luck because next week we're finally covering the child's play reboot and I've got some thoughts about it until then I'm James Agee nice this has been the kill cow thanks a lot for watching the kill count for the banana splits movie I want to thank some patrons like Liam Ward toast face Harlan coy Nicholas stirs Oh Ellie wells and Brandon Priester the rest of the year is all one-offs and I'm trying to make the movies that people have really requested which banana split was your favorite I'm with Harley snork he's dope as fuck thanks everyone be good people", "53q9gq5pPEA": "Tra-la-la, tra-la-la-la It\u2019s my birthday, it\u2019s all about me, Celebrate

and chair and today we're making up an all-time classic banana split this is multi flavored colorful simply delicious I know you're gonna love it so let's get started I'm going to get started here by slicing the banana in half but I recommend you use a fairly large banana but it really depends on the size of your plate once you've done that go ahead and set them in the bowl and I usually put them in round side down and just to line them so the edges touch the bowl next what you're going to do is scoop in three flavors of ice cream just in between the bananas and I'm using strawberry vanilla and chocolate but it's entirely up to you you can use your favorite kind of ice cream then go ahead and Adelaide say about a tablespoon of strawberry jam over the strawberry ice cream if you don't have it on hand there's no need to run out and get some you can just simply leave it out next we're going to dribble about a tablespoon of hot chocolate fudge over the chocolate ice cream you can use chocolate syrup if you want but if you want to make this by hand I'll put a link to our recipe below followed by a layer of whipped cream then we're going to go ahead and sprinkle some chopped peanuts over the top this is my own invention I've added some baby marshmallows over the top you don't have to do this but it's a nice touch another drizzle of hot pot is really entirely up to you how much you want to put on this you lastly we're going to top the whipped cream with some cherries one thing you have to remember when making this delicious dessert is you have to work in cooler temperatures and you have to work really fast and there you have it our banana split this is really a special treat you have to make this up head on over to cook and chair comm for this recipe and many more

I\u2019m too busy to care much anyway, Too busy s**ting my assistant every day. Two influencer lovers, doing our jobs, Live-streaming our lives for our follower mobs. Popping the question, will she say yes or laugh? Once the celebration\u2019s over, get cut in half. There\u2019s something important I need to share, This is the last episode that\u2019ll ever air.

Tra-la-la, tra-la-la-la Program my babies to please the fans, And ill mannered producers who get us canned.

This killing spree is no programming malfunction, This is how we file an angry injunction. Spin the Wheel of Endings to decide your fate, Tear off Andy\u2019s limbs, but he don\u2019t appreciate. Hunt the rest down, find fun ways to kill \u2018em, But Snorky betrays us, cause he\u2019s soft for children. TV network\u2019s callin it quits, Cancelling the Banana Splits.

subroutine needs a little tweaking start with you bring home what if bingo had a larger role in the banana splits movie so this might sound crazy but I've always had a lot of speculation that the orange gorilla was the main villain of this movie bingo was the only split who appeared in the thumbnail for the trailer he was the closest split in the home video cover and he was the last of the splits to die not counting snorky since he was just merely a good guy it might sound like a rather dumb idea since Fleagle is the main split and leader of the bunch but look while fleeing who has a lot of screen time lines of dialogue and a couple of scary and funny moments he is in the last of the splits to die he's actually the first of splits to die now I know Flicka reactivates at the end of the film thus proving he didn't die but that pretty much means that the other splits didn't die either this is also a reason why I had Baniyas illegal in my finance at Freddie's movie so it's very clear that bingo is the primary villain of the film which is why I had Freddy in his role for my finite - Freddy's movie but there's only one problem he doesn't appear that often in the film he has the supporting role in the first half of the movie when the splits were just the silly smiling idiots we all know and love then having a minor role in the second half of the movie only doing two things like kidnapping Parker trying to kill Austin only to get his butt kicked by Beth leaving him to be left out throughout most of the third act until he suddenly becomes the main villain in the end having an epic fight with snorky the savior so how can we fix bingos role well let's begin and find out [Music] [Music] so first off in the beginning of the film after Holly wakes Beth up in a snarky costume the to see on the TV Fleagle and bingo doing the riddle time sketch from the original show so they go what orange and the goofy smile a dozen listen all the time a disrespectful banana nope if you can go legal in the audience laughs as usual but bingo looks rather annoyed and disappointed later when Beth is talking to Mitch the next morning about Harley still watching the show Harley is watching a sketch from the show it is the club meeting segment from the original show showing Fleagle bashing his desk with his gavel startling trooper and snorky who both jumped trip and fall down a lot by every bang however bingo isn't he has his hands on his ears trying not to hear the dreaded noise Plato finishes when he fetches his hand with the gavel the meeting of the banana blitz Club will now come to order no Roy though what Cooper snorky and bingo get up in a cartoony and military-like matter flee Oldham pulls out a couple of banana shaped medals out of his desk today if the date well I'll give you bananas dunno the onder Fleagle gets the first medal to jus pert and the second of snorky unfortunately Fleagle doesn't have one for bingo who is confused by the fact that he didn't get one wait ain't there one for me thorry Pig oh but you don't behave like good old Jew brand snorky you disrespect the rules of the banana split club so you don't get one the audience laughed but bingo looks extremely disappointed Fleagle then walks away to grab his gavel and comes back to bingo put the word bingo all pal I got something you could have oh yeah what's that Fleagle wiggled and bangs bingo in the head with his gavel the audience including Harley start to laugh double foodstuffs what Fleagle and trooper laughter butts office bingo starts rolling around the floor in a cartoony matter snorky however feels bad for the gorilla and helps bingo get up when bingo gets back on his feet he brushes snorky who was patting him on the back thanks a lot runt Harley stops laughing looking confused by bingo subtly insulting his favourites plight of the bunch the rest of the film goes on how it normally goes Polly blows out the candle receives the wand from Austin bethe image telling him they're going to tap studios for the live taping of the banana splits and Zoey will ultimately invite it to it during the scene with the security guard Sal when Harley asks him if he likes his job at the studio that made his favorite show Sal tells him a foreshadowing about bingos role well kid I find it interesting working at this old studio but you know sometimes at night when I am the only one here I see the splits wandering around the place and writing to little buggies laughing and singing a one split didn't look like he was having fun really who's that the gorilla bingo all the others have a lot of fun that orange furball looks rather annoyed I sometimes wonder if he doesn't like being the show since he was built built well you see kid the staff used to have actors and costumes back in the 60s but the actors were constantly getting injured on set so the staff decided to use animatronics to save costs later during the scene where the splits almost run over Harley bingo was the one driving the banana buggy not Fleagle when Beth pulls Harley away from the road Harley looks back at snorky normally but snorky actually turns his head to look at Harley and is about to wave at him but Benko holds his shoulder and when snorky turns to him bego shakes his head no and a splits drive-off highly looks confused and Beth gets his attention what the hell were you thinking I'm sorry mom I just wanted to meet the splits especially snorky look Harley you have to be more careful than that Harley has an understanding look then turns and hasn't talked with Zoe did you see that Zoe snorky tried to wave at me but bingo stopped him don't you find out a bit strange nope not really um the supposed to were probably just in a hurry for the recording Harley Harley is rather confused by bingo stomping snorky waving to him then thinking back to the segment he saw bingo insulting snorky and other times were bingo acted like a hothead he starts to wonder if Sal's saying bingo isn't having fun with this job is actually true later in the backstage scene the splits come inside and meet Carl who greets them normally but instead of scolding all of them for almost killing Harley he only blames bingo since he was the one driving the car Oh big ooh naughty ape you almost had a little boy looks like your reflux subroutine needs some tweaking for once bingo gets out a sign reluctantly walks into the Update booth as Carl talks to the others now the rest of you boys get backstage as you know the show must go on Flegal snorky and trooper walk away as Carl begins bingo sup dating let's get you updated now my friend you've had too many hiccups so let's not have any today ok Carl plugs bingo into the updater and leaves just like in the original film the rest of the film goes normally only difference being bingo not arriving on set until the wheel of endings is introduced after Stevie tells the splits about the show's cancellation Ben goes dead looking eye sockets turned burning red and he goes into Stevie's dressing room replacing drew Burr who does it in the original film Stevie's lines are the same and bingo gives the lollipop death in the exact same way Bango then comes out of the dressing room Fleagle drew Prince Newark ER despondent over their show's cancellation what are we gonna do now that the show is cancelled well fellas I heard they're gonna tear us apart in Seles to the theme park division so i don't think we would let that happen the other splits become interested in what bingo said and the story goes on normally as fleagle and duper go on doing their kills later after snorky ran over Mitch this time actually killing him he gets out of the buggy he drove and goes off to get back into the studio but while he's doing dead he hears sinister laughing from an ally and ghost to check it out he peeks behind a wall to see bingo jabbing his drumsticks into Doug the other like how we see in the climax Benko then throws his body into a hatch leading to where that large pile of bodies were laughing again my plan is going very well so far bingo then leaves to continue the gore of the film snarky looks rather confused at what bingo said wondering if he legal and Juber were tricked into doing this murderous rampage eventually he will realize that when Harley asks him to help him Zoe and Parker escape it goes normally but snorky actually Christ before holding Harley's hand the rest of the film goes on normally and yes bingo still gets knocked down when Beth throws him off the bridge and he stays like that until the scene where Beth Austin Paige and papi interrogate Karl and go into the hatch to defeat Fleagle and trooper instead of stopping to see the unfinished hoody costume papi instead here circuit sounds she turns to see bingos corpse twitching after a few moments of intense silence bingos eye-sockets turned burning red and he gets up revealing he was faking his death this entire time nap times over papi becomes scared screaming a couple of times bingo then grabs an axe that was on a table and kills papi with it bingo then turns to Karl and slowly walks to the cell he's in the insane gorilla breaks the log and enters the cell as Karl fearfully tries to back away batter up bingo then slams the axe into Carl's head killing him the rest goes on as usual with the Williams family fighting fleagle and Juber though there's a couple of differences when Austin gets Fleagle attention Fleagle lets go of Beth who then kicks the dog's legs to make him trip and just as Austin's about to stab Fleagle with the crowbar goober grabs him and grows sharp rotten teeth as he worries viciously at Austin Beth however grabs Austin's dropped crowbar and stabs goober in the mouth with it just as he's about to eat Austin's head Fleagle then gets up scratches Beth his back and punches Austin fleegle then starts to choke Beth I done all of this so we can see more of legals Terminator face harley comes and instead of throwing Beth his wand he instead run stuff legal gets his attention and stabs him in the gut with his wand Fleagle starts to twitch and spark with circuits and then drops dead poly then rips the one out of his chest smoke comes out of the large hole in it and the Williams family go off to me up with the others like in the original film of course bingo shows up suddenly but instead of repeating the times almost up line he instead reveals the entire reason why the banana splits became terminators so you have fur done about me haven't you leave me to rot huh well that's exactly what goes on in my life no one talks about me Jimmy nicely or even care about me all this I had to go through with the annoyances that that bossy dog that stupid lion and an annoying elephant so I had another dis No no more willy-nilly silliness thanks to an update I got in the show's cancellation I can now finally get my time to shine tricking my friends into helping me with this trial a horror scheme I wanted to achieve for a long time oh my monster bingo you're darn right too little brat because you jerks was trying to foil my plans especially killing those two idiots who didn't respect me for years I think it's time for me to finally end this nonsense I'm not gonna give you any last words I'm gonna finish you off once and for all Georgie that appears and has an epic fight with bingo it goes normally but there's a couple of differences the fight goes a little longer and the two make the noises the animals they're based on mate [Music] and here's the last difference when bingo rips with his heart instead of simply laughing he says in a sinister evil way elephants never forget and you won't forget this yes selfish pachyderm snork even grabs bingo and instead of cracking his head open under unknown circumstances he twists his neck sparks start sprouting out of fingers head as his mouth start to paint a lot of oil and the dew collapse harley runs to snorky and mourns over his death but he has a little more to say to make him more emotional snorky you saved us he will always be my favorite snorky snorky then takes a hold of Harley's shoulder and and a surprising and sad twist speaks for the first time in 51 years I will always remember you good friend zhurqis then drops and dies as Harley and Beth look over his body with Austin joining Paige and Zoey walked towards bingos body who is twitching and garbling after a few seconds bingo stops and finally dies ending the Menace of the evil gorilla the ending is also the same the cops and ambulance arrived Zoe starts to like Harley and Austin and Paige showed their feelings towards each other but Beth doesn't punch Mitch since he was already dead Harley does ask Beth where he is though but Beth simply says he might already be dead as the Williams family get into their car intense music starts plain as a truck passes by carrying the dead corpses of the banana splits Harley looks out the window and waves goodbye to the splits as the Williams family drive away the tralala son starts plane as was shown a close-up of bingos ugly and the movie ends with his eye sockets glowing burning red as he laughs maniacally one last time yeah and that's what if bingo had a larger role in the banana splits movie some of you may not agree with me but hey people have different opinions but I just wanted to discuss this to you guys cuz I've always had a feeling bingo was the main villain of the movie and I just wanted to fix his role along with other things in the movie that didn't work making it a slightly better movie I would say though that maybe someone could have done it better than me but for now this is the best example of bingo having a larger role also thanks to everyone for the 10,000

and it's scary that's all i gotta say it's scary burn myself so yeah today we're going to be trying the banana split game mode i'll go see in the supermarket come on sinister supermarket let's do it oh my god i'm scared i'm so scared it's actually a really scary like survive the clock against two bananas there's the normal ones it's called escape and now there's banana split as well where there's just two bananas and you've got to try and survive like there's no exit or anything you've literally just gotta survive she's gotta survive five minutes so we're gonna give this a go okay cool i'm not banana i don't want to be the banana like at all you can also do like tasks and things like that still to take down the time which i'm definitely gonna do i mean it might be risky but i don't care i just want to get out of here as quick as possible why do i put myself through it oh yeah and then the last minute the little sort of the ducking holes like they close in so that you can't actually duck either which is very scary in my opinion and i don't like it and i'm just scared run five six four five six four the code is five six four if you're and there's a locker next to it just hide in the locker so it gives you a little bit more of a chance of escaping her two of them how did i get out of that i hate this they're literally just chasing me and nobody else between [Music] six and a half hours later okay i should be good to go if not when i'm stupid just deliver the cake deliver the cake don't think of anything else but delivering the cake both bananas are that way i was just like running nope don't come to me you imbecile got you one is killed [Music] run get out of here right now okay we're only one minute left i'm like slapping myself in the face i'm just like i don't know whether it's worth doing tasks still like so it's still worth delivering cake i'm just gonna do it anyway in case it knocks time off the time i like last second oh my god this is scary i should be okay because i've got um there's nine seconds left and i've got two lives oh and by the way at the very beginning of the video when it just said like you survived like that yes i did it i did it that was a good first round even though actually it's my second round ever playing this mode so i've literally it's been out for i don't know how long but it's been out for a little while now about a week or so but i've only just come to play it because i took a little mini youtube break just from like recording and stuff i've got a couple of videos lined up but i still haven't posted them yet i just had a little youtube break so i was a bit like you know what i just want to chill not that i do much anyway but you know actually i want to try peeled high school uh-huh survive the clock and stupid i like this new voting thing rather than having to like stand and stuff in this new lobby i think this update was really good i might play a couple more banana split i want to be one of the bananas i want to be one of the split bananas come on give me the banana give me the banana fingers crossed fingers crossed fingers crossed fingers crossed no i want to be a nana i want to eat people i just want to be like hello you know you know okay i'm gonna go for this i can go straight for these let's go boom run okay there's one on my butt oh wait no there's not this is not i'm good i'm good i'm good this morning this mode is so much scarier than the um regular mode i mean it's still scary but like this one is just like oh my lord i'm gonna see if there's any more pieces over here okay the code's there by the exit okay i'll remember that but i don't know what the code is so that's not helpful at all i'm glad that you don't need to do exits for this one because the exits thing like it's actually really hard how did i not see that i'm so stupid so the exit bit is actually really hard because like you're just sort of a bit like when like when it gets to a minute left you're just like right okay i've gotta like get up quick accept them with this one you can almost like stay afk i mean as long as bananas don't get you but like you have the option to stay here okay um okay cake good i'll just collect all these coins because i'm saving for some skins i don't know you know why not cut that coins anybody in here runners survive four minutes oh four minutes will we be able to do it yes we will yes at all puzzle massive puzzle over here by the by the nana spawn okay this isn't smart how did i not get caught i was expecting to be like caught within like two seconds it's like slap bang in the middle of the map and like in the middle of a long corridor i don't even have a locker or anything to hide in so i'm so surprised i wasn't caught then i was a bit like i'm gonna get caught oh my god i'm just gonna hide in this locker extra security halfway [Music] i'll do plain tin cabins next just because that's my um that's one of my tasks so oh the code is 662 662 662. i'm on

bananas no okay yeah just just do that [Music] run okay that was risky that was risky that was as risky as flip only 30 seconds only 30 seconds i can do it i can do it yes i'm good at this new mode [Music] i'm gonna look at these new skins this skeleton one is creepy i like how like the halloween ones and like christmas ones and things they still stay like when the event's over because i wasn't expecting that which i i'm happy about because you know i don't have all the coins in the world beacons oh well i didn't even know though i think it is peeled high school which i'm not too bad i'm not too sad about because that was the one i was going to choose in the first place so no come on ugh if i'm not the banana i'll just forfeit oh okay [Music] oh well at least this is my my time to shine

stop get down look who I fire its TVs and they wonderful steamy all of our friends are teeth now the show can go on forever and ever and ever great chopped snorky", "cxI_tgkeRyg": "[Music] [Music]

thank you son my face so where are you coming from can't read the sign so I draw the line then you go invent a song the moment everything is said your words they bring me back again [Music]", "o1R9LcY4Xok": "you guys have no idea how excited I am to satisfy my curiosity with this one because believe it or not when I was a kid I used to watch the banana splits there was a little period during my childhood when I would watch a whole bunch of hanna-barbera shells they would be on during boomerang and I would go and check them out one by one rather it be like The Flintstones The Jetsons Wacky Races Yogi Bear laughs Olympics and all that kind of stuff I used to be into a lot of different hanna-barbera shows of course like I stated a lot of them are really popular but then you would also have some of the smaller hanna-barbera shows that didn't necessarily last long one of which being the banana splits now believe it or not I didn't necessarily care for the cartoons that would air during the banana splits because a lot of them were really the Johnny Quest style action cartoons that hanna-barbera would often make and I didn't necessarily care for those shows but when I was watching the banana splits I would it was mainly for the live-action segments because they were a lot more psychedelic to look at they were a lot more funny than the cartoons that they were presenting and especially you just want to hang out with the goofy characters that they have with bingo Fleagle droopy and snorky because that's kind of like the main selling point of the banana splits you want to hang out with this cartoon band and it was just a lot of fun seeing their crazy shenanigans but I will say though it's not necessarily my favorite of the hanna-barbera shows and not necessarily the most memorable but I do remember a period in my childhood that I would watch through the banana splits and I would have a good time with them fast-forwarding many years later and somehow the banana splits got back into the news and not only would they return for a movie but somehow they decided to turn the banana splits into an r-rated horror slasher film and it was possibly one of the weirdest news that I have heard in recent years but I knew that I wanted to go and check it out and yes I have indeed went and bought the blu-ray I unyk lis went to Walmart and I have spent $20.00 on this thing and it still feels absolutely bizarre to hold it in my hand and even if I hold it even if I know that this exists it still raises so many questions like why do they want to turn the banana splits into a horror movie why do they want to make a banana splits movie after like 50 years since it existed and also why is Warner Brothers and the people handling the hanna-barbera properties okay with this now the good news is that this blu-ray also does come with some bonus features and hopefully through there some of those questions at least can be answered but either way I know that this is gonna be a heck of an experience so I just want to go and try to satisfy my curiosity so with all that said let's just put this on the side and I need to see this for myself so I got the movie in front of me we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna begin this movie in three two one go oh there we are oh yeah there we go now it's beginning okay it's just four Studios presents oh boy Oh drooper oh sorry might have got the name wrong knowing the context of this movie it's like there's a part of me that should be excited that they're all back but knowing how this is gonna be I don't know it's just like oh no what this Stevie I don't remember human people in the banana splits like seriously in the show I don't recall like actual human characters appearing in the show whatsoever are at least in the live-action segments like yeah sure at the end they would always show the banana splits having fun in like some Six Flags area but honestly I don't remember like some guy named Stevie that's also involved with the banana splits I don't know that that feels like a random addition maybe it's for the sake of the movie wait a minute I just realized that's a modern phone like is this not wait a minute is this supposed to be set today is this not supposed to be is this not set in like the late 60s when like the banana splits is on like what wait wait why would why would the banana splits in that same format still beyond today it's what what why I'm really concerned of the fact that like he has to go and like make that sound like when he's like it's like I guess that's foreshadowing for something but really it's just like should it should a candle like that have that wait a minute also they do acknowledge that they do acknowledge it so this is like a 50 year old show how is it still running what kind of parallel universe are we in hey I need that it's work Harley was almost hit by a banana buggy oh oh neglectful parents again who's gonna be the one that shall die who shall be the one that will take care of him let us see come on this is all build-up like I really don't care about any of these characters man cool and edgy no we got to cancel a fifty-year-old show that's apparently been doing so well for them for so many years but you just want to cancel it because like it's stupid like come on man that's like dingo pictures logic right there are you kidding more still a huge hit value a stupid we just gotta establish that already don't worry he's one of the throw aways that when he dies it doesn't matter we just gotta immediately like set that up and just for context this kind of audience participation thing I don't think that ever happens in the freaking banana splits I don't remember some kind of special like double dare kind of segment where they bring kids and like do all this kind of thing but then again I mean like I'm not saying that to like criticize I'm not gonna be like that will actually kind of fan I'm just pointing that out like I'm not gonna fall to it I'm just here like and I'm just talking just to wait until like you know the the fun of this movie begins like how long are we in 20 minutes oh boy we are gonna be here for a while then live with it they don't mention the ratings though like in this world the show's been going on for like 50 years longer than the Simpsons and plenty of others only wait up oh boy oh boy oh boy oh we started we started this always done all on here coming well please don't let it be a fake-out please don't let it be a fake-out please don't let it be a fake-out please don't let it be a fake-out please don't let it be a fake-out come on come on come on all this ain't a fake-out they say in a fake-out oh boy oh boy come on come on who is it gonna be who is come on who's gonna kill this guy who's gonna kill this boy sounds like snarky probably oh yeah like they set up at the beginning so yeah I probably seen turkey up nope what what just happened what's it what well we know it happened but we don't know what happened [Music] you know for a major a banana split fanboy that kid seemed yeah that kid looks bored like she should be having the time of his life this is like a dream come true and you just say [Music] and nobody said serve for Stevie yes it is true nobody cares about Stevie whatever oh here we go ha what what huh okay we see okay I'm surprised you're not like you didn't extend the mouth or anything just like they've done rotted just go right into it well then that's one down at the office are we ready to go if you don't make it out alive from this then you're definitely taking one trip to the freakin Maury Povich Road man we know what's going on up there we go yep the answer is yes we know that he's a douchey stepdad now we just need to wonder which of the following characters is going to take care of that guy the characters in the movie are calling out that they're just a cliche oh my god I never thought I would see this you're just a 19 year old burnout that's all you are there's never been enough there was always Austin and then there was Harley us what a joke mmm I say bingo yeah I think bingo would love you bingo were Flegal I mean like we already got a deaf from drooper well then again bingo already had like the the first like little hint of the death from the producer so or the vice-president or whatever but come on let's see come on who's gonna be the one we can we can actually if we can actually play a game which character is going to kill who all that that that would definitely be a fun game to play with this movie Oh already two setups oh man I can imagine how fun parties can be with this movie people always doing like little guessing games like maybe win prizes or like make some kind of drinking game out of this because like I don't think kids are gonna be watching this for sure I mean like it is a are rated horror movie after all but who's gonna be one who's gonna take care oh I think this is a who is gonna take care of him booze gotta take care of the douchey stepdad Oh are we doing a dry fight oh it's a drive-by why does it make that sound come on that sounds like something that a kid should not have wait come on that's kind of uncomfortable to Santa to hear it's like a kid holding a thing that goes like naw man well you you could keep like foreshadowing that but no no I still say that's not a thing that a kid should have it's more like what I can do for you Parker do the thing what you're gonna do with something else you know she actually does have a point it's like that that's kind of weird it's like from a banana splits movie it's this little part right over here that is disturbing and David yeah out of all the things in the banana splits movie it's this little thing it's like it's weird that there are times that I agree with this movie like the irony of all this like Wow okay I don't care about your marital status or whatever with your engagement is not it's not necessarily gonna matter anyways there we go we're not here to see your marriage we're here to see what I'm gonna do that is an amazing wand but how did you do that but that really does feel like a legit magic trick oh oh oh we start something always start something you want to go into come on check this out check this out this is gonna be cool it's gonna be cool trust me doesn't take that much then oh oh there we go now we're getting to the bloody part but we're not really seeing much this is a little bit underwhelming unless like it has a good payoff to this come on it's a matte it's a magic trick you know what you got to do next and what are we going to do with the girl by the way what's gonna happen with that ah there we go that's how the magic trick works right yes yes Oh what okay I was not expecting that so you burned his face off and you just gotta do a little dance I see yeah come on that's not gonna be enough to kill him you got to do a little more man what oh come on you got to do more than that I mean like Flegal did a bit more like he he cut someone full-on in half oh oh oh okay what what what what whoa whoa hold on a sec hold on a minute what what what happened what what what I'm okay okay I guess that's taken care of but okay okay okay like Wow hey that I got a bit that was a boy oh ah that was a good shot movie I'll give you credit on that did you find them Paige brought me up to speed on the whole situation and I assure you everything is under control oh he's alive okay yeah I know I know there's got to be more to this [Music] what oh okay so also she has to be like the the Sarah Connor mom like okay or like Sarah Connor or Ridley we gotta have the action woman in this okay III I could take it I'm not complaining you know I gotta admit she is a pretty attractive woman so so and she's she's and from where she's showing it's like she's not bad of it oh she's still there oh okay so is anyone gonna take care of her you know put her out of her misery what where where did they go listen to me really really after she just witnessed her like new fiancee split in half you gotta say it's not safe in here really very poor choice of words come on like I know you're a good actress but I believe the writing on that thing come on there are better words to say in this situation then it's not safe in here what what what why why do you have to do that come on he tried to help you but why why did you have to go and do that seriously oh oh here come that boy hiccup that boy come on there's got to be a little more to this like what are we gonna do with this guy we can't leave him bubbly face like for long okay okay okay that is one heck of a key what's the price Oh sniffing a snap Wow Wow holy crap wait we are getting somewhere with this wow dude what it's working really yeah this is you're telling me kid snorky has got to be their Savior out of everything happening here the Savior is snorky is this is this what you're telling me movie snore keys got to be the savior of this they gotta make snorky the Savior I think I think that's what we have to call him from now on unless it like there's some kind of plot to us at the end for now we shall name him snorky the savior with the the kids are safe just as long as they are with snorky the savior what her name is heat oh it's like an oh it's an owl character they've lights what yeah good question what are you doing like what look for you what what are you doing good question wow that's a really weak lock if just like one little hammer swing okay like what well I guess we got one extra kill in the back pocket I guess okay wait what though what was that again this is STV oh thanks for the Oh what what oh I didn't realize the body count was that high okay oh well now well I did next okay well that's a that's a little surprise so is this how we're gonna end this we're gonna end this in like an ultimate Save the Children kind of mission okay I see so it's this kind of movie oh really okay I get it I get it we don't care about Stevie but there is such thing as an overkill dude like too seriously oh he doesn't look that bad I might've got a few scratches but oh holy crap you're still alive he's still alive well what do you know yeah I wonder how he's gonna end that's a better question I'm surprised you've kept him alive for so long so yeah I guess I guess TV really is like the first to go oh here he is here is our boy snorky the savior so are you just gonna let him die or let them do their thing oh oh okay oh I see oh that banana splits ah so is that why they're called the banana splits oh of course of course hissed his magic wand because of course at some point it has to come of course so that's what we have to do that's the point of it so now do you realize that you shouldn't have given him that freaking wand what what you're back what how did you get oh oh snorky snork you're the Saviour come to the rescue is that a lion rocks is that a lion roar really and pull some pipes I'm sure that'll fix the problem Oh uses Onan oh wow No Snooky the savior he died for our sins [Music] snorky oh well I loved you when you were in the first episodes when you look more like cousin it you're still alive what how are you still alive you're still the person who deserve to die the most somehow is still alive how how man like wine on a divorce like what really you couldn't leave him out her what come on man that was unnecessary man he should have been dead it should have been more satisfying that he died or I guess no we got to do that now or something yeah okay we'll do that now okay oh okay okay okay thanks hoot girl okay what oh so she gone psychotic now or most likely I think that's what they're sitting oh that's what they're setting oh no no no no no no no thank you we don't need we don't need any stingers we don't need any more fleet no oh come on oh no oh no thank you no no thanks I don't think I need any more I think we're all we're all fine oh boy huh boy what an adventure what an adventure this was I mean I know that I've left like a lot of like nitpicks and criticisms but let's be honest all of that does not matter here it doesn't matter of the dumb things or the criticisms or like the problems with this movie it knows very well what it is it's absolutely stupid it's just supposed to be your typical slaughter film but with the banana splits and I will say like yeah it's a bad movie it's a stupid movie but it knows what it is and it knows like it's kind of audience you're just here to see the banana splits kill people in a very gory fashion and at least on that front it did deliver what it's supposed to do really I can't hate it I can't fault it and you know why at least like after watching this and owning the blu-ray honestly I feel like you know what it accomplishes its mission it wanted to do what it wants to do it succeeds this movie succeeds in its mission and I think on that front it's worth it you know what that's what it is you want it you want to kill people with the banana splits you did that good job and I can't fault you for that so you know what wasn't worth it wasn't worth it to see like characters that I've enjoyed in my childhood slaughtering people in a very bloody and gory fashion you know what yeah right but what that freaking stare though no no we don't need anymore we don't need a banana splits to we don't need anymore okay if only we can have snorky the savior come back so that he can prevent any sequels from happening like I have a banana splits movie I'm okay with it we don't need anymore [Music] you [Music]", "jcXfPmaiooY": "[Applause] harley what the hell are you thinking mom did you see that i waved at snarky but he didn't wave

like strawberries to make the giant bananas in the banana split I'm baking banana cake that was a lot of banana in one sentence I'm baking banana cake in a large rectangular pan you know it's really not a Yolanda birthday episode without a special prop this is a Jen this is a genuine surprise that's why you know this is how to cake it it could be anything embarrassing something embarrassing or something amazing yeah okay yo take a look pass it to me pass it pass it to me now that my simple syrup is soaked in I'm going to use a circle cutter to cut out a lot of circles from this banana cake that's me having I want a gown that's what I want next then I'll be on my throne with a gown and my scepter so the first thing I'm gonna do is actually make banana cake sandwiches so I laid down a sandwich I bought up another I don't feel like I should say but up while holding a scepter I'm gonna sandwich them together with a layer of Italian or any butter and then I keep building these beautiful circular sandwiches I really wanted to eat but then my cake wouldn't have been complete it's time to lay these sandwiches on their sides and use buttercream as glue between them and I need to use a small serrated knife to help me sort of cut the cake in angles because a banana is not straight definitely has a curve yeah it's like a smile and now I need to chill this big banana sandwich smile really well you must chill this cake sign must chill I don't know whatever I just I just wanted to use like a big word now I need to well split this banana Wow really yeah it was not fun you know what it is I contemplated cutting all the circles in half and then building two halves yeah but then I knew I wouldn't get the exact same curve yeah so then that bothered me but in the end they're split by giant scoops of ice cream so who would have noticed but me but I pursued I will split this banana cake and now I have two banana cakes so I lay them Falls with the flat side down each on their individual boards I have split the bananas oh yeah you're right I have split interrupt me my girl hasn't and once I'm happy with the shape of both halves in my banana do you know what I do people of the how to cake it Kingdom OD and pronto thank you it's time to crumb coat and chill I think it lost a diamond it's not it's not a diamond with crumb coat and she'll each half with Italian meringue buttercream that's the chili Papa dinner once my crown code is chilled I remove my banana halves and ice them one more time with the town meringue buttercream and chill them again chill we must we must chill between every layer of Italian meringue buttercream one must chill ones cake if one wants to move on it's time to cover these banana halves in the perfect banana colored fondant which is like a really light soft yellow roll out my banana colored fondant big enough to cover my whole cake and then I spread a thin layer of his Holly meringue buttercream onto the surface of my sheet of fondant it never does and then I carefully lifted up my banana cake and placed it on top of the fondant where the buttercream is now that my cake is in place perfectly I'm going to carefully lift up the remaining foam and hold it and drape it over the banana does that make sense footage excellent smooth it all around the banana and then trim away the excess around the outside for the sharp area but the more footage you show the less footage there is is this do not place footage over my Ceptor now these bananas need some texture and for this I'm using the turkey skin ater you are yes I am well it's basically shelf liner I've used it on the turkey cake and avocado I press it over the entire surface of each banana half now as you press you might sort of stretch out the fondant and the base of your banana might have a little more excess fondant don't worry take the time to trim it away bananas also have sort of like a line going down the length of them like a seam yeah it is I don't want to hide this scene so I'm going to use a sculpting tool to just help me make those marks in my bananas that's really weird that I'm using because my lifetime is like this is new there's a lot of responsibility for me you can always change over here no oh who is this I like it over there do you like it over here well my banana halves are setting up nicely in the fridge it's time to move on to the ice cream scoop I decide I actually want to trim them just a minute so with the flat side down on each half spear spear did I say this after is just it's taking me to another world it's of an evil game of Thrones game of paint I cut about a quarter inch off the flat side of each half sphere I use a ruler to make a mark and then I just cut the cake while it's upside down and now I'm happy I have six half spheres that are all the same size what is it time for my people surfing if you feel me again you will not be there maybe a lot of you who have already signed up for camp cake which is a live baking event where I bake with you live I take you through all the steps from A to Z and you can ask me anything you want so day one is BBQ treats on day two we are doing a master class with my famous watermelon cake Camp cake is August eleventh and twelfth this summer click here to register or click the link in the description below Jocelyn always co-host can't Kate with me yes she's on camera and she always like helps me bake by Jocelyn no need I don't want you to try this year I just want you to hold myself while my simple syrup is soaking into these cakes I'm gonna take the time to flavor and color my buttercream for the vanilla ice cream scoop I'm simply adding some vanilla bean to the boat to make my chocolate buttercream I am adding some melted dark chocolate to my Italian meringue buttercream just want to melt it but not have it too hot and then stir it into your buttercream until it's chocolatey enough for you be careful not to add too much because you don't want to soften the butter cream for my strawberry buttercream I'm going to add some pink food coloring to give it that strawberry ice cream look and now it's time to fill each one of these ice cream scoop cakes with the appropriate buttercream and then crumb coated in the same now I know this isn't a gown to go with my scepter but it is a really cool tee and it's this month's keep teeth of teeth it says treat yo'self yes see that that was treat yo'self and if your deluxe cake tea club member you also get this month's sprinkle medley which is called one in a melon and you also get one a watermelon drink pool floatie y'all know there's a one and a good once the crown code is chilled on my ice cream scoop cakes it's time to ice them but before I do I need to add a little bit more flavor to two of my butter creams for the chocolate butter cream I'm gonna add some chocolate shavings because I want it to look like it's chocolate chocolate chip and for the strawberry buttercream which is at the moment just pink I fold in some whole berry strawberry jam so you don't want to get a strawberry jelly you want it to be a gem that has like bits of cooked strawberry so we can see that in the buttercream and we're ready to we will ice our cakes and we will use a spatula to help me ice these cakes I used my invention a small square of acetate that I bend in my fingers and I just go round and round it's really perfect when your icing a sphere cake you just turn your lazy susan hold the invention and start from the bottom and go all the way up and smooth you should really share this video as a birthday gift to me yes and I think the world needs to see what a cake scepter looks like I think so I think so I need to paint and recreate the texture of the inside of a banana on the flat surface of both my banana halves the first thing I do is brush the entire flat surface of each banana half with some clear piping gel then I mix a little bit of yellow food coloring into a little bit of piping gel and paint that on right in the center and then I take the black sesame seeds and I carefully place them along that line on either side you don't want to do too many cuz really if you cut open a banana they're not just like laying on the surface some are like buried you know what I mean now I'm really worried about the dish this banana split is in the more I look at it the more I feel like too much of the banana is out of the dish and I'm really worried that once I start to piss my scoops the weight of those cakes will push down the banana it's just cake and the ball will actually cut into them I tried placing my scoop and I just thought to myself this is not good enough for my birthday banana split I need a new banana split Bowl now Cody let's bow let us go Cody got his horse we just went out for a drive hunting we even had Orhan hunting on his end we did it and I found this really nice like oblong it's actually a chips and dip bowl now I'm happy we have another new cake artist on how to kick it step by step and a brand new video her name is Jyoti and she made a gorgeous sugar rush cake so check it out right here or click the link in the description I'm happy with the inside of my bananas and it's time to add my ice cream scoops now I need to add the sort of edges that are on an ice cream scoop for this I'm just using a small spatula like this golden one but more like plain and wooden got actually Cody said to me in this video that he wants to stop filming videos of cakes on food [Laughter] Cody I wish we could have Cody sound effects because he's like yeah it's time to top this banana split with my favorite toppings I have three different sauces you know one of them is caramel yeah girl you know I wouldn't forget you I put you right on my banana my other two sauces are chocolate glaze which is the same glaze I made on my Super Bowl Sunday cake my last birthday so I'm gonna whip up a small batch of that please and then my third sauce is strawberry sauce for this I'm using the same jam that I fold it into my buttercream if your Jam is a little too like thick and gloopy you can stir it in a little bit of clear corn syrup to help it be a little more fun I also have toppings to go with these things I've got some toasted coconut chips some dark chocolate chunks and I'm gonna cut up some fresh strawberries Oh holding

[Applause] [Music] nothing I [Music] bananas bananas - OH", "q_kKeVS0Jl8": "hey guys thank you so much cooking on this video my name is Chris and I just got done watching the banana splits horror movie and if you have not heard about this thing the banana splits was a real TV show back in the day it's a hanna-barbera property where kids and some of you actually out there who watch my stuff actually say you'll watch this as a child and for some reason now they decided to license out the property to the sci-fi channel so they could turn it into a horror movie the premise is that a live taping of the banana splits show the animatronic puppets of the banana splits go haywire and decide to attack the audience leading to a complete nightmare of a situation now this is available to watch right now on digital you can find it on iTunes that's the way I did it woke up this morning don't know if it was a great idea though it really interested me just because this was actually a kid friendly TV show and they decided to turn it into a horror movie and I just had to applaud them for that can you imagine them doing this to the Wiggles the Teletubbies or even Sesame Street I mean it's a fascinating concept that this is happening even more interesting when rumors circulated that this script is the exact same script that they were gonna use for their five nights at Freddy's movie because Warner Brothers was planning to make five nights at Freddy's but for some reason they didn't like their script tossed it and they were like well we got this what can we use it on and if that was even 10% the case I had to see this movie just for a peek of what the five nights at Freddy movie could have looked like and this is definitely one of those movies you need to turn your brain way down I am no stranger to garbage cinema those movies that you know aren't probably great but they're just dumb fine especially in the horror genre because those movies tend to be gory bloody and I can always get a good laugh out of it and with the banana split like it was just really hard to turn my brain so low where I wasn't constantly thinking why are you doing this why are you using robots instead of humans in the cost of wind that'd be cheaper and more practical really everything in this movie is just an excuse to have the puppets come to life go after people also have a cascade of different characters that aren't the best actors in the world I will say the little boy in this movie he did a great job as being such a huge fan of the banana splits and wanting to be there so bad but every other person on there is not the best actor it's definitely TV quality and we get to the actual tax that these puppets do on the people they don't hold back it does take quite a while for them to finally get into action the movie takes a bit of a dragging pace and if I was watching this on TV with commercials in between yo I think I would have turned it off because I do think you're about halfway into the movie until something finally starts going down when you're like alright and when they do yeah it's pretty horrifying there's a little CGI here and there but overall they use prosthetics and that's what really makes it fun even worse is these characters aren't pretty creepy when they get into action you do not want to be caught around them I can't imagine some of the stuff that was shown on here is actually gonna be allowed to be shown on the sci-fi channel when it premieres there in a few months and if I'm being completely honest I think me not being a fan of the banana splits as a kid kind of maybe tutored my total enjoyment of this movie because I feel like they really did try to throw in a little bit of fanservice to those who really were fans of the cold cartoon show because they throw it I think they're original songs they throw in some of their original bits they play off the episodes that they did in the past so with that I think if you were an actual fan of the banana splits back in the day I think you'll get a real kick out of a regular episode being turned into a horror movie because they kind of do that I like that somewhere in the beginning in the movie they just randomly showed you an episode being played out and you're like why the heck am i watching this this was actually entertainment and then they do that same episode with a whole different context and people involved getting pretty badly beaten you're like whoa okay that was a nice setup then but the things that will make you the most mad is just motivations of characters and why certain things happened you don't really get an explanation all that well especially if you're wanting a good reason for why these animatronics just go and attack people you're not gonna get that it kind of just happens if this was really the five nights at Freddy's movie that Warner Brothers was gonna give us we would have rioted but as a test concept of turning an old family friendly cartoon show into a fun little horror movie I had a good time and they definitely tease for a sequel I would probably check it out just like those horrible sharknado movies so with leprechaun origins and now this banana split movie you know what sighs it's kind of on a roll of these cheesy fun horror movies that I'm actually liking I consider these the junk food of a horror movie fan it's not quality but it's enough to get you smiling with a banana splits movie I'm gonna give action to stars like I said it is very far and few in between when you get to the action scenes it's a lot of development for characters you're not all that excited about but is needed for you to care about them when they're in danger later comedy the movie I'm gonna give it two stars a lot of that is due just basically laughing at the actual project and what's going on on screen there's very few laughs on purpose that'll make you giggle but the movie as a whole is just pretty silly and um that'll make you giggle drop in the movie I'm gonna give it two stars I was hoping to give it three just because the premise was so interesting to me but the way it actually plays out and the way it explains its story it was not given a lot of love to har the movie I'm gonna give it three stars just because they do get pretty ballsy and the things they decided to do to some of these characters that might actually frighten you or make you feel bad that you wouldn't want to be in this situation and suspenseful film I'm gonna give it two stars just because the Spence wasn't always that well built it did feel an evil presence from when these things were on screen but you weren't all that scary you kind of wanted them to catch their victims to see what would happen not necessarily to have them get away casual fans like to give this a b- cinephiles I'd give it a C+ and critically I'd give it an F for the bad splits movie I suggest you wait to rent this at home in other words I suggest that you wait for this to premiere on the sci-fi channel for free don't really go spend your money like I did and when you're watching it for free in that type of mood I think you'll get a real kick out of this movie but let me know what you guys think about this did you go ahead and bite the bullet to watch the movie now if you did what did you think about it did you find it fun did you have a good time let me know down below also be sure to LIKE and subscribe follow me on Twitter at 3c film review as always I'm Chris take care", "JDgYGsQkpaY": "hey it's will again and today i'll be\u00a0\nclipping filming and lubing the banana\u00a0\u00a0 split switches in my fianc\u00e9e's nk 65\u00a0\nentry edition which she has in smoke\u00a0\u00a0 but first let's take a listen\u00a0\nto everything together as is all right let's take it apart now now the following issue is something\u00a0\nthat's happened to me a couple times\u00a0\u00a0 and i'll show you why that happens\u00a0\nand what other issue it causes later those two little plastic legs fit tightly\u00a0\ninto two little holes where the switch is\u00a0\u00a0 mounted in the pcb but in our case now where the\u00a0\nswitches are plate mounted we don't need that\u00a0\u00a0 extra stability so much and it actually makes\u00a0\nremoving the switches later a huge pain as you\u00a0\u00a0 saw earlier when the first switch took way too\u00a0\nmuch energy to pull out and it went flying also\u00a0\u00a0 applying all that force to remove your switches\u00a0\ndamages them as you can see on the left one here since i don't plan on pcb\u00a0\nmounting these switches ever\u00a0\u00a0 i decided to just clip them\u00a0\naway with nail clippers then i just start opening up the switches\u00a0\nwith a switch opener that i got from key boss\u00a0\u00a0 and i opted for crytox 205 grade 0 lube this\u00a0\nis actually my first time using a lube station\u00a0\u00a0 and as you can see here it was i\u00a0\ndon't know if i'm doing it wrong\u00a0\u00a0 or it was actually just easier for me to\u00a0\njust grab the switch myself and lube it up\u00a0\u00a0 and you tell me if you think i've\u00a0\nput way too much lube on this in retrospect this is embarrassing because\u00a0\nthat is way too much lube definitely\u00a0\u00a0 and way too much on the springs as well then i just gingerly not so\u00a0\ngingerly drop the film on there\u00a0\u00a0 and that little thicker side i figured\u00a0\nout goes on the the leaflet side now this is what one of them sounds like lubed and now unlubed now the stabilizers on the nk 65 entry\u00a0\u00a0 do come lubed but i decided to\u00a0\nre-lube them and also clip them now instead of band-aid modding i opted for gaffer\u00a0\ntape pretty much just because it's black and to\u00a0\u00a0 see if it works it's pretty much the same as doing\u00a0\nthe band-aid mod except it's just gaffer tape after that i just put everything back together now let's have a listen now they sound way over loop don't you think\u00a0\nand they also just feel mushy and they don't\u00a0\u00a0 come back up as quickly as i would want them\u00a0\nto so it's kind of uncomfortable typing on them\u00a0\u00a0 i think i'm going to have to either\u00a0\nfigure out a way to clean them\u00a0\u00a0 and then re-lube them or maybe i\u00a0\nruined them let me know in the comments", "ceVx6YkJkLA":

for finding a banana split here in speed settings even playing against another Grandmaster no hesitation as we see it's a big blunder not to make the banana split here so we saw it and we acted upon it that's how you play good strong backgammon if anyone hasn't seen this move before we call it the banana split because you split an inner point to hit and you only do it if anything else but the hit leaves your opponent with a winning position so if I had played ten to six you can see here I'm still getting trapped down here I'm getting hit by aces and nines and all of these approximately one quarter of all the numbers that makes the the deuce point in my face so the banana split was actually a very demanding play here and we did manage to find it cool move it's always nice when you see a banana split and you act upon it and you get rewarded with a correct move blunder Buster's calm play among the stars available on browser tablet and smartphone subscribe to see more backgammon videos

good yeah we have fun that's as simple as a big pile of home cooking is still no longer what you to go back to the Bobby Deen whatever no the next dish that we're going to do is just a banana split cake but I have to tell y'all this is one of those recipes that I've always had a lot of calls on because of the controversy of the raw egg in the dish and this dish doesn't get cooked and you know I'm just not afraid of raw eggs as long as they're nice and tight in their shell no cracks and they hadn't expired but for those of you out there that might have an issue with that you can use a pasteurized egg in place of it and then that way you have no worries at all Jamie why don't you start by making a crust I turn to my favorite things graham cracker crumbs and butter mine too it's about four cups of graham cracker crumbs and then two stick of butter and we're going to do a little something different the recipe doesn't call the stick this crust in the oven but I like what he does to the if it makes it turn a hardening form more like a a hard crust so we're just going to press this into our dish and we're going to stick it in the oven so like five to eight minutes and pull it out and let it cool so while you're doing that I'm going to slice the bananas and Bobby you want to go ahead and make the filling side I'm going to start with two sticks of butter and I'm going to go ahead and begin to cream that I'm going to add two eggs beat two eggs into this as well and I'm going to add in a box one one-pound box of powdered sugar all right Chinese son if you want to go ahead and get that in the dish and get it in the oven we're going to put that in a 350 degree oven I said for about five to eight minutes just put to hard enough and Bobby how are you coming over there son perfectly all right Jamie I've got another one in the oven if you would go ahead and get it out please because we want to make sure it's cool we don't want to put this together while it's hot you know Bobby it's funny you never had any cooking experience like Jamie had you really had you you in sales yeah well I got my career trial by fire I really wanted you to join it and you did you quit your salesman's job and you came over and you became the dishwasher I've been working out for you taking me so far and then you were promoted yeah just all the desserts a pastry shell and I got

hard hard work you really put yourself on the line out there you really opened yourself up for shots but if you're good at what you do there's nothing like that immediate gratification that we get from walking out on the floor and people saying oh my goodness you know I just love your food see what looks on their face huh that looks so good buttery Jamie but you know it's not the easiest thing in the world to spread mm-hmm alright so what we're going to do now son just going to spread those bananas all over and then we're going to top our bananas with the canned crushed pineapple that's been very very well drained alright I'm going to top this now you can use a frozen whipped topping but y'all know when I'm making these kind of desserts that I only use one thing and that sweetened fresh cream all right so that was just that simple and now we're just going to top it with a few graham cracker crumbs and an ad from Jamie's crust and that looks yummy mmm and you got dishes yes oh this looks so good can you fix it this month well I think I'm just going through is it good to really I think I'm going to try just a bite I love the pineapple in it I do too the pineapple really makes it to you my darling and to the part you played in to all the desserts that we serve at the lady and son I think I'm the reason for your success here for you Bobby kissing me that's really good

Wolf's Lair reviewing movies speaking of which I got a movie pitch for you guys Captain Caveman but he kills people great idea right well somebody a Warner Brothers seems to think so because that's exactly how we now have a totally necessary banana splits horror movie before I get into that though I just want to give a quick plug to the new pop base app available to download for free on Android and finally iOS in the pot base app you can interact with the virtual me we'll give you thoughts on various topics quiz you on horror show you exclusive picks treat you to some commentary on videos and there's even a few games to play you can also unlock stuff to decorate the wolfy lair and send me questions or suggestions that I can answer in the app the app is still in the early phases so there are a lot of cool features coming soon that I've been discussing with the developer and I'll update pop base with new content on a daily and weekly basis just so you know this video wasn't sponsored by pop base I just want to make sure people are trying it out especially since I'm one of the first channels to be in it back to the banana splits movie though if you are in a [ __ ] boomer or didn't see the reruns on Cartoon Network our boomerang the banana splits was a live-action kids show made by hanna-barbera in the 60s that depicted a band composed of costumed animals designed by the notoriously psychedelic Sid and Marty Krofft the banana splits drove around a theme park and would perform songs skits and other hijinks on a wacky looking soundstage the show was mostly remembered for its catchy theme song which was covered by the Dickies but the series was otherwise short-lived the banana splits were just glorified wraparound segments between cartoons though in syndication a shorter version of the show was put out without the cartoons in just the split segments okay now that you're familiarize with the show you're probably wondering why was this made into a directed video horror movie in the year of our Lord 2019 well I guess Warner Brothers was gonna make a five-night to trace movie for the kids but that switched hands to Blum house simultaneously we have Warner Brothers production company Blue Ribbon content who put out the Daphne and Velma movie and seemed dedicated as sifting through the Warner back catalogue of IPs for potential film opportunities found the banana splits and decided to apply the five nights at Freddy's formula to try to make it relevant I mean in retrospect pretty much any children's entertainment back in the day is extremely creepy by itself especially Sid and Marty Krofft [ __ ] it seems though that the Blue Ribbon you'd see at the start of Looney Tunes is not the seal of quality at once was when you see it at the start of [ __ ] like this movie I'm not gonna lie i watch the banana splits but it's not like I'm a super fan of them or anything I mean sure I do own all their DVDs and albums and assorted merchandise but besides that I could care less about the banana splits honestly still I feel this movie's existence is pretty unfortunate because it is just sort of pissing on the legacy of hanna-barbera for a meager profit before I get into the review I'm gonna say up front that the movie does not make a good case for it using the banana splits instead of some original children's entertainment created for the movie the film makes a lot of changes to the concept of the banana splits and it's written assuming that its viewers know nothing about the original show anyway stuff like this movie has been done before the hanna-barbera properties Adult Swim was built off the backs of once obscure hanna-barbera shows like Space Ghost Birdman in Sealab 2020 but the difference between those classic Adult Swim updates and this banana splits movie is that those shows were clever funny reimagining this banana splits movie is just the banana splits are killers because they look kind of creepy and five nights at Freddy's was successful it's just depressing yeah let's get to the actual review though and see this movie was really worth rudely awakening the banana splits from their eternal slumber before I get to the plot I got a point out that the movie opens with a remake of the banana splits his intro and it's the first sign of this movie's lack of effort the original show's intro had all kinds of wacky stunts and skits with a very energetic vibe to it the 2019 film's version of the intro is this low energy version where the banana splits slowly and carefully move around shot in a very static way if you told me that this film was instead of porn parody the banana splits based on this intro alone I'd be disturbed that it exists in but not surprised based on the quality of this material like it's just immediately depressing that a 60s kids show crude as it was can easily upstage a film made in 2019 like are you not sad about this because I'm more sad than angry to be honest this [ __ ] sucks the half-assed intros only purpose is to establish the actual banana splits in their show because no other part of the movie really sets up the banana splits otherwise and all you really learn about them here is their names flagel the Beagle bingo the ape troupe of the lion and snorky the elephant make no mistake though despite the same names and similar but sincere costumes these banana splits are still very different from the ones here may be familiar with this movie has a bit of an alternate universe take on the banana splits they were created by TAF studios not hanna-barbera their show isn't just wrap around segments for cartoons the banana splits is a standalone series with an actual audience instead of a laugh track complete with Nickelodeon game show like participation segments there's a human character on the show nobody likes named Stevie finally this banana split show hasn't been cancelled yet and as anachronistic as it is has been running for 50 years uninterrupted apparently these are pretty big alterations and make a good case of this movie just using the banana splits named for some vague recognition value but these are the most egregious elephants in the room regarding the splits in this movie which I'm gonna get to soon and no I'm not talking about snarky despite this being the banana splits movie this movie isn't really about them it's about the Williams family the youngest of which Harley is obsessed with the banana splits and has a birthday coming up so his folks have gotten them tickets to a taping of the show their surprise for you we are going to the banana splits Harley's ma bath is a nice loving mother which is contrasted by Harley stepdad Mitch don't like that show is it stupid Beth who was just a total [ __ ] contemptuous towards his entire family hardly was almost hit by a banana buggy she's a bit embarrassing way to die so you know he's gonna survive to the end also joining the birthday celebration is Harley's older brother Austin the 19 year old burn out and Zoe a classmate of Harley's who not only doesn't like the banana splits but doesn't like Harley though she does go to great lengths to try to convince Harley she likes the banana splits and I guess ham which one's your favorite in the cat there isn't a cat she means the trooper the lion now it wouldn't be much of a horror flick without some padding out of the body-count so once it has studios the film sets up a cast of supporting victims attending the show that makes this feel like [ __ ] Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory there's a pushy dad trying to get his daughter noticed by producers of the show I just paid $70 for that blow-up and straightener and then there's an out-of-place adult couple who are supposed to be influencers who want a live stream themselves at the show the home of the banana split since 1969 that's it for the audience characters though making fun of team divas and influencers is as creative as they could get Parker do the thing what you're gonna do stop that is disturbing the rest of the cast is comprised of a producer of the banana splits and a page who is literally named page H that page guess you could say I was born to do this job the drama comes in when the producer is told by the new Vice President of Programming that the banana splits is being canceled despite it supposedly still being a huge hit we're still huge yeah but it's old and stupid I guess that's as deep of a reason any other executive would add for cancelling a show basically the show that the Williams family watches will be the final show ever but they do get special tickets to have a meet-and-greet after hours with the banana splits all fine and good but you're probably wondering where the horror comes in well it's revealed that the banana splits are actually highly sophisticated robots and crude animal costumes invented by a mad Australian scientist someone's reflux subroutine needs a little tweaking anyway you'd think the splits being robots would be this big insidious secret on task studios as part but it isn't everybody knows that the banana splits are robots it's an accepted thing no attempt is made towards giving the banana splits a backstory of any kind why they're robots instead of just guys in costumes is never explained which is so strange given the fact that even though this movie takes place in the present the splits have been around since the 60s I suppose the reason why the writer doesn't explain why this movie is ripping off five nights at Freddy's is either due to the absurdity of a kids show from the 60s employing high-tech robots or more likely a general lack of creativity probably the latter I covered sand sharks recently and even that movie went to great lengths to try to explain how a shark could live in sand so the banana splits movie isn't just a ripoff it's a lazy ripoff the worst kind honestly the banana splits didn't need to be [ __ ] terminators the idea of deranged men and animal suits going on a killing spree is scarier than the unlikely idea of advanced robots being used by a kids show instead of the military honestly in this case why would they make the show about animals when it could just be about robots just be direct so of course the splits turn evil the exact reasoning for their turn to the dark side isn't clear it's a mix of their show being canceled and I guess then bugging out along with a faulty update given to them by their inventor it all feels a bit like that itchy and scratchy land episode of The Simpsons I have to say of course the Manama splits go straight to murdering people splitting up and getting even with those who have wronged them the adults keeping them from their young audience the splits mostly execute their mayhem in an exhibition istic way treating their massacres if they're doing a show and you'd think that there would be some creative kills with that but no not really the influence our dude for instance is cut in half by Fleagle for real in one of those saw and half trick boxes but it's not great since the very nature of the trick is that you don't see the saw going in you do see some guts sliding out but they don't look very good many of the other kills are just whatever like a dad's head getting set on fire or Stevie deepthroating a lollipop there was a lot of potential for this to be a very over-the-top Gore fest seeing as the splits are in a slapstick comedy you'd think they could translate to splat stick horror well but it's just sort of blah and there are a lot of survivors at the end to this movies a little too precious with it's forgettable characters it's disappointing too because Eric Bauza the voice of all the banana splits in this movie does a great job imitating the original voices especially with his drooper impression totally sounding like Paul Winchell's Tigger voice they took it down down but the splits are mostly eerily silent throughout the film the banana splits were really chatty on the original show but barely ever speak in the movie even when interacting with other characters and I guess the makers of the film wanted to maintain some sense of mysterious creepiness but come on they're the banana splits not Michael Myers if these characters are gonna be murderers they should be more like Freddy Krueger or Chucky and the film does give some glimpses of that but it feels like the movie tries it's best to pull that back it's too bad because otherwise the banana splits just come off as identical otama tongs wearing different costumes with little personalities separating them without going into big spoilers the only markedly different split is snorky for certain reasons during the predictable climax of the film the movie makes a lot of concessions for the sake of its villains who are in reality real dudes who have to wear these bulky costumes with limited field of vision and dim lighting so the splits never have to chase their victims or do anything to physically demanding the minutes are also just very inconsistent in what they can manage to do they apparently have this strength to tear somebody limb from limb but their punches aren't lethal and they struggle to strangle a small woman the original banana splits were surprisingly athletic but these killer ones come off as really lethargic murderers not genuine threats because the movie is so cheap and shot so lazily there's not a lot of room for exciting things to happen despite it taking place on a big soundstage the location feels very constrained the banana splits movie is just a very boring horror flick and the film should have been insane and wacky given the premise but it just has a surprising lead our tone the only real standout performers that I can point out are the child actors surprisingly Harley is portrayed as the sweet kid who's a huge fan of these characters that turn into killers before his very eyes you feel bad about the boy being subjected to the events of this movie and it feels like Zoe's actress has fun playing a smartass kid supposed to happen when drooper does it well I don't shoot it Beth the mom is sympathetic but the movie spends quite a bit of time on a traumatic subplot involving the stepdad cheating that really just feels like out of place melodrama and a banana splits horror movie as she defends you and she tells me to give you a chance and the whole time you've been cheating on her also Beth is supposed to be a good mom but she lets her son wander a dark movie studio at night unsupervised like honestly how could I give a [ __ ] about her after that the stark realism that the movie for some reason tries to drive at is soon after contrasted by the mom going in a full-on Ripley badass action lady to try to save her son's you can tell that this lady can kick ass because her shirt was ripped off revealing a more practical tank top oh you get it girl everything from this point on is highly predictable standard horror [ __ ] that I could just spoil but I'll leave you to decide if you want to watch the movie or not overall the banana splits movie is just a cookie cutter horror adaptation of a kids TV show made to capitalize on an unrelated video game series honestly you're more likely to be scared watching an actual episode of the show than this movie I give the banana splits movie as Stevie out of snorky next we're gonna have a hard-r version of The Flintstones where Fred sells crystal meth just imagine the rock puns you can make with that

we made it the pubic hair place that's where we get all of our things to make the giant banana split sundae that you want to make so badly stupid but it's still gonna taste good all right we gotta find a giant banana that's her task a giant banana I've seen if I got cherry tomato technically this would be cheery it's not a cherry tomato I'm in the marshmallows sriracha shrimp fondue caramel pecan cake really I just ate like a giant quesadilla [Music] so the first step in making a giant banana split is to create giant scoops of ice cream let's do it saran wrap right over the top of the bowl and push it down in in it's hardest goodbye back you got blue ball love that ice cream what is that this is like the best day of my life that's like a giant puzzle this was the best rated scoop on Amazon why isn't it working you should just make a poop emoji chocolate ice cream listen once you put the toppings on you're not even gonna notice that it's not a perfect circle okay it's the idea one big scoop is it is a big scoop it also looks like a wrinkly boss I'm not gonna put it on everyone's least favorite but some people's most favorite strawberry so pretty unicorn ice cream guys it's really not about the taste about the look instant mashed potatoes instant gratification that ice cream it doesn't melt just imagine if ice cream like the matrix so let's get started you got eight servings and then you got 18 servings that doesn't make any sense because that's to inform that be 8 and 16 oh is that a typo oh that's just pan size so I got 2 boxes and we need to split it up into three so how to do that 18 divided by 3 that we have 10 cups 3 and the third-most be easy so that's very co cross multiply and you're gonna get your number with all this these 2/3 reach you all right there we go do you just over complicate this and then make it really simple were cups of water one and a half teaspoons of salt Julian says don't add butter I think she's sabotaging me I mean the potatoes it's boiling so we're gonna remove this from the heat pour in our water and cold milk and our potatoes and a little red dye so this is definitely too loose that whole math equation in the beginning just ignore that so I don't really know how to do Brown other than to just add all three colors together you better get brown hungry looks like chocolate ice cream and this is her vanilla I think that this might be the greatest thing you've ever done it is there's a microwave directional ice cream people are gonna be like mmm I didn't realize I liked Matt potatoes and place of ice cream that much it's almost like I'm turning people vegan all my notes all right guys look it looks like ice cream though let's see if it can fool some people give them something that actually tastes good does this look good I feel like a monkey right now you start with the tip here when you peel it off like this right and then you have a handle got a little crack here it's got a little nipple there do you even know what a nipple is yeah that thing's lactating I look at Jules you've been telling me if it doesn't look good all right the same like look good it just looks like bananas are sitting there it's about what it tastes like though right I kind of want to throw one of these on the ground and have someone just fall in my mind this went a lot better oh they are flopping everywhere oh yeah we got this oh I see what you did there ooh I don't like watching you do that with your hands I'm training them cuz I want to work at cold stone I got this little you're still working on your banana let's how you go viral you got to use a lot of fluff strawberry and strawberry yeah we have a giant banana split we need giant sprinkles things need to be proportionate to the size and what you're eating so I'm using these Hershey chocolate bars catch me outside how about that chocolate sprinkles back in the 50s they're called Jimmy's banana split is not a banana split without walnuts the reason you don't do peanuts is too many people have that peanut allergy and it kills them so yeah so the best way to open up a banana is stab your nail into it there's been way too much math in this video by the way oh yeah why don't I just Photoshop a banana it's supposed to be like marshmallow but it looks more like getting kind of messy over here it's real fudge on real ice cream why would not

scoops I hope you're gonna fall along with me you got a marker or something to draw with and some paper if I go too fast you can always pause the video okay first we're gonna start by drawing one of the scoops right in the middle of our paper so we're gonna draw a big rainbow line so we're gonna go up curve around and then come back down so there's our first scoop we're gonna draw the bottom of our ice cream neck so we're going to start over here and we can draw a wiggly line goes from one side over to the other now don't make it look like it's kind of melting then we're gonna draw the second scoop and let's draw another rainbow line but we're gonna draw it behind this one it's going to be overlapping so we're only gonna draw a part of it we're gonna draw another ramble line it comes down and then we could also draw another wiggly line that starts over here and connects to the middle now we're gonna repeat those same steps but over here on the left side so we're gonna start in the same spot right across here we're only gonna draw part of it oh and come down this is a little pointy that's okay we're practicing right now we're gonna draw that little wiggly line that connects from the left side into the center okay we got our three scoops of ice cream except I think we need to draw the faces on them now so we're gonna draw the first one and I'm gonna draw it a certain way but feel free to change it you can draw your funny faces any way you want so I'm gonna draw two circles this is for his eyes right in the middle or her eyes and then we're gonna draw smaller circles inside and this is the light reflecting in her eyes to make her look shiny and friendly then we're gonna color in the big circle but leave the smaller circles white okay now I'm gonna draw her mouth I'm gonna drive straight diagonal line and then we're gonna draw it open so I'm gonna draw a you that comes down and connects back up and then inside let's draw a little tongue and then I'm gonna color in the top now the ice-cream on this side are gonna be kind of snuggling this one in the middle so I'm gonna draw I'm gonna draw their eyes closed and well just so I'll draw two rainbow lines for the eyes and then I'm gonna draw the mouth and this one I'm gonna draw happy and then in this one let's change it I'm gonna open this one's eyes but we can draw it so that it looks like it's kissing this one so we're gonna draw two circles and this circle on the right I'm gonna draw it behind so it's overlapping and I drew a little smaller circle inside of this one so I'm going to add that one to this one also and then let's color in those bigger circles but leave the smaller ones white okay now to make it look like it's kissing this one I'm gonna draw a three and it's just like our emoji that we drew a while back so I'm gonna draw a three it looks like it's puckering up its lips I hope you guys are still with me you're following along I know some of the parts I also fast forward and during those parts you can you can pause the video during that also now let's draw the toppings for each of our ice creams we're going to draw it looking like it's melting so I'm gonna draw these big wavy lines on top of our ice cream so there's one and then we're gonna draw another one melting and dripping down the center then let's do it on the third scoop the one on the right jaw kind of looks like their hair doesn't it okay now I'm gonna add a cherry right in the center and I'm gonna draw it floating but I'll tell you why in just a sec so we're gonna draw a cherry now I'm gonna draw a circle but leave the top open and then we're gonna draw the center of the cherries were to draw a little curve and then we're gonna draw the stem so we're going to draw two lines coming out and their curves so there's one and here's the second one and towards the top I spread it apart so that it's a little wider and then we can connect the top of the cherry now to finish our cherry let's connect these little gaps behind the stem okay our cherry looks like it's floating we need to fix that so let's add some whipped cream and I'm gonna draw a cloud line draw a bumpy lines so that are big and some are small I'm gonna draw this really yummy whipped cream okay the next thing we need to draw is our banana so we're gonna draw a smile line that goes underneath all of our scoops so we're gonna start over here now we're gonna draw and draw a smile line it comes down and then back up now I drew it really smooth and it's okay if your drawings look a little different than mine because the most important thing is to have fun but also to practice and the more you practice drawing your lines the smooth they'll get now we're gonna draw the end of our banana and it's gonna hook around on each side and go behind the scoops one like that and then one on the right side now to make a banana split you have to split the banana right down the middle so let's draw the other side of the banana back here we're just gonna draw a little curve and we'll also draw another curve on this side also now we can call it banana split if you have one banana in your drawing and it's just really a banana with some ice cream on top nothing special about it next we're gonna draw the bowl that this is sitting in and they're called banana split boats and that's because they're the shape of a boat so we're gonna start over here and we're gonna draw another smile line that comes down further background and back up looks like a boat doesn't it now we can draw the base of it so it doesn't Rock so let's draw two lines that come out on each side and then we'll connect these lines with another curve so connect the left over to the right side what do you use to eat one of these banana splits a spoon right we got to have a spoon sticking out of the side so let's draw two lines coming out diagonal and I'm gonna spread them apart towards the end so that it gets wider and then we're gonna connect these two lines with a curve to make it look like the end of a spoon sticking into the ice-cream okay now the very last thing we need to do is add more toppings to our ice-cream I'm gonna add some sprinkles but you guys can add whatever you want you could add nuts you can even add some berries now I'm gonna fast-forward this part but you guys can add whatever you want to your ice cream all right we did it we finished join our banana splits and they look delicious but they're gonna look even more tasty once we color them I'm gonna use the computer that color my drawing but you guys can use anything you want you can use oil pastels colored pencils or you can even paint your drawing I hope you had a lot of fun following along with me and drawing your own banana splits remember it's okay if your drugs look different in fact I hope they do I hope you use your own creativity to change your drawing and we'll see you later art friends goodbye if you really like this art

Taylor. Today, I'm going to show you \nhow to make a banana split. Oh, yeah. I have many\nfond memories growing up, eating banana splits. Banana splits actually are one \nof the most popular desserts here in the United States, \nand they're really easy to make. There's so many different ways \nthat you can prepare them if I can do it. You can do it\nbefore I move on. Make sure to subscribe to my \nchannel and hit that notification bill so you won't \nmiss out and you need my new videos. Let's get started down below in \nthe description box, you find the list of the ingredients. I will say amounts, but the \namount is entirely up to you. There's two things a \nbanana split needs. That's bananas and ice cream. After that, you can put \nwhatever you want. A banana split essentially is a chocolate sundae with bananas. That's kind of simple as that. So began with a banana. And we'll just peel \nthis thing. Make sure your hands \nare clean, of course, and then we want to\ncut this banana down the metal right in half. Hence the name, the split. That's how the banana split \npretty much gets its name as the piece of banana is \nsplit in half. And then you want some \nkind of container. I have this cool little boat \nthat you can get online. If you want, which is\njust a really cool holder, pretty awesome, right, and now \nwe want to put in the ice cream. Now I don't normally\nbuy really expensive ice cream. I'm totally fine eating very, \nyou know, like the store brand ice cream. But do what works for you, \nbuy whatever your favorite ice cream you want to do \nand use that. Like I said, I'm totally fine \nby a name brand, cheap stuff like this Kroger brand. And so I'm going to do a couple \nof different flavors and you can do a lot of different \nflavors if you want three or four, whatever you \nwant to do. I'm just going to do three \nscoops of ice cream and I'm going to do a\nnice big scoop of this. Super dark chocolate. Right there in the middle. Now I will do vanilla. I'll put that right there. Another scoop of vanilla right there. Yeah, this is exciting. This is the type\nof dessert that you like. You skip a couple of meals \nduring the day to save up for it. And then comes the different sources \nthat you can do. Um, Hershey's syrup is \nvery popular, so just use some of that. Caramel sauce is another \npopular sauce, and I'm just going to spoon some of \nthat on their. And then some \nstrawberry sauce. I like the strawberry kind to \ngo on the chocolate, and then my favorite\npart is the whipped cream. All right, so you got some \nwhipped cream on there and then come in here are some nuts you want. So that's on there and maybe we \nwill catch this one off with a Mancino cherry. And there we go. That is one of the ways\nI like to eat a banana split. Like I said, there are so many \ndifferent combinations and varieties of flavors that \nyou can do. Awesome. All right. There we have it. Simple, easy, banana split. Drop a comment down below and \nlet me know some of your favorite toppings that you like \non your banana split. It's really easy to do simple \ningredients if I can do it. You can do it. I'm Matt Taylor. This has been another episode \nof In the Kitchen with Matt. Thank you for joining \nme as always. If you have any questions, \ncomments or requests, put him down below and I'll get back to \nyou as soon as I can. Thumbs up down the corner. Push it. Don't forget to subscribe to my \nchannel and check out my other videos. Take care. Time for me to dive into this. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, \nyeah, yeah. Some of that banana ice cream. Whipped cream and nuts. Mm. Mm hmm.", "oKcV_4-8pso": "[Music] ready ready take it Bonnie what why'd you wake me up for okay then what type of video is of course we still haven't gotten any info about that produced by sci-fi that's sort of related to that what is it called wait a second wasn't that an old band back in the day that uh that was for children produced by the same company who made it ah interesting well let's check out these posers who's trying to steal our fame alright hold on let me get up the good old fast bear computer all right here we go I am slightly interested in this but let's see these posers yes Oh sci-fi wire uh okay trust me you're not gonna like this at all so this features [ __ ] violence and gore and whoa okay I already see the band themself and they're kind of a ripoff banana splits they should have got ticket Freddy's instead yeah okay this tote yeah it's totally us but we're not in the pizzeria I mean I mean those guys are not in the pizzeria they're something oh god yeah this definitely is in a ripoff okay I can tell that's the William after the movie the dude with the mask Tigger yeah well all I have to say is I'm quite interested if we get the chance to possibly watch this from the pizzeria we'll see how these posers try to copy our form yeah but I feel like I don't think those animatronics are possessed I think they're like someone like act into them and they're just designed to just kill them guy like a sister location animatronics so basically terminators I guess you could say that hmm well everyone we hope you enjoyed this video and there is announcement we have to say me and Bonnie will probably be doing this as a series for now on where we react to finesse related content that you guys want us to watch but we also one thing though before people start spam in the comment section for Freddy and Bonnie to react we must have permission from the original content creators to in order to make those reaction videos so if you guys had a fan video you made or something like that or something really good then we'll probably give it a look but anyways if you guys want us to continue Bonnie and Freddy reacts then we will possibly do and subscribe for more content anyways this is Freddy fazbear here hope to see you at Freddy's", "-TFoMYybieo": "hi they're waiting here from draw so cute today I'm going to show you how to draw yummy and fun banana split so let's get started with this drawing when I first start by drawing the cherry on top of our middle ice cream scoop so by right here let's draw a circle to draw a cherry like so and right here let's do a small curve that's where the cherry stem comes out of like that and at the end just darken it a little bit then let's draw our first scoop of ice cream so down here it's curved and meet to the cherry and the other side continue it down like that and let's finish the ice cream off right here by drawing these curved lines go on the other side and now we get filled in with as many curves as you want like that so that's our first ice cream scoop and on top let's drizzle some maybe fudge or caramel what do you like I love fudge let's drizzle some fudge on this ice cream scoop and let's make this one really happy so we're going to give this ice cream scoop some laughing eyes so curved and out same thing with the other side curve down and out let's give a really happy Sun laughs so flip it at an angle and curve down like that all is that cute let's start on and draw our second ice cream scoop so by right here let's draw another scoop curves and the same thing let's draw little curves that come like that and let's drizzle some toppings on top of this ice cream scoop too so just curve like that and let's make this one a little bit different so maybe one regular draw circu tie and one laughing I maybe like a wink like that and this one we can draw circle curved line for a draw so cute eyes two circles for highlights shade it in and lines at the bottom like that and of course let's give a cute smile oh and the other side let's finish our third scoop so a curve comes right here and meets up with a middle scoop and with our curve lines again like that what's your favorite ice cream flavor I love butter be Collin they are more drizzles and two circles fruit some draw so cute eyes both sides like that to highlight shade in the top and lines at the bottom the same thing right here and lines at the bottom like that the Sharpie is kind of too thick for this drawing so I hope you understand what I'm trying to do and a little cute smile like that and let some now that we have the top oh let's not forget maybe some sprinkles of course can't forget some sprinkles and let's see maybe this one has some sprinkles to some Square sprinkles like that and we'll leave this one just as as it is let's draw the banana now of course we can't forget the banana so right here straw curve comes down like this I'm sorry and on the other side curve and let's connect it all the way across like that and now we're going to draw the bowl that it's in so about right here where the banana starts right here draw a curve like that slight curve same thing with the other side slight curve like that and then angle it down for the shape of the bowl curve down and connect it as well like that now right here just follow the line on top just the line here to indicate that it's a bowl oops wasn't perfect but it will do and let's draw base right here for our Bowl there are banana split and of course let me put a little sign here for our banana split because I am celebrating 1000 subscribers thank you so much for everyone that has subscribed and loving my art I am so grateful to everyone here and I'm going to bright thank you thank you for watching and loving all my drawings and of course our Sunday needs a spoon so let's draw a spoon right here and start by curve like that for the top of the spoon and go straight down on both sides and the bottom part make it as even as as far as you can give them some legs like that very simple and maybe one that goes like this because he's so happy and arms are going up because we're celebrating 1000 plus subscribers and

video of our own of my banana split and thanks so much for watching and thank you for subscribing and see you later", "DskK0o_z3ac": "[Music] [Applause] what's up guys bt here and this is the collaboration between c3 equals and the key dot company the banana split switches these were originally called the c3 modules but now the key dot company has been moving more towards a buffet style naming system and i'm not mad at it because it just makes you want to eat every single swish they come out with whether that's tangerine the kiwi swiss the dragon fruit and now the banana split switch now these were manufactured by jwk using the c3 molding so they are not going to be exactly the alpacas but they are using some of the same materials and if you guys don't know jwk is known for making some of the most smoothest linear switches out like the alpacas and the h1 so the pricing for these are actually really really good for 25 switches it is 1625 which comes out to around 65 cents per switch the alpacas are about 55 cents per switch so there's about a 10 cent difference but the alpacas are super hard to get whereas these are in stock for the moment and you guys already know once this video comes out that could change very quickly don't shoot the messenger i'm just telling you guys about these amazing switches and when you look around for some other linears looking at like the gather on black inks or the yellow inks those are 75 cents per switch so you're saving 10 cents per switch still on these switches these are a beautifully colored switch on the bottom for the blueberry it is a nylon housing the strawberry top housing is polycarbonate and the stem is palm so exactly the same as the alpacas the spring is 62 gram and it's gold plated and when you press down on the switch there's none of that crunchiness that you get with some other lower end switches so for the sound test i put it into my think 6.5 v2 and it's surrounded by nk blueberries on a polycarbonate integrated plate and i wanted to see how these compare to the alpacas so i just threw some alpacas in there to do a side-by-side comparison to see if that c3 molding really did make a difference so i put the stock versions of each switch next to a filmed and lubed version of each switch with crotox 205 grade zero lube and tx films so enough talking guys let's drop the sound test right about now oh yeah so one thing that i did notice is that the top housing on the alpacas wiggled a little bit more than on the banana split switches so what i've noticed in the past with a lot of top housing wobble is that you get more springiness so stock the banana split switches were a little bit more higher pitched than the alpacas and i think this is due to not only the molding but also the lube that was put on there it seems like the alpacas are lubed a little bit more than the banana split switch when lubed equally it seems like the banana split switches are a little bit deeper and richer and smoother overall than the all pockets but lubed both of them have that same high pitched sound to them so keep that in mind if you're not a fan of that sound signature that you might want to look elsewhere for like a deeper switch maybe like a gather on black ink or if you want something more thockier get the nk creams so my concluding thoughts on these switches is that they are a high pitched smooth linear right out of the box so if you're somebody that doesn't want to deal with lubing you want something that comes factory lubed it's smooth right out of the gate sounds pretty good then go with the banana split switches now i like that they lightly lubed it and didn't put a lot on there so if you want to put your own lube on there to get it to where you want it to be you can do that as well then throw some films on there i highly recommend films they're like 550 for a pack of 110 it's worth it because it reduces the top housing wobble and it gives you a little bit deeper of a sound signature and for those of you guys out there that are coming from like your grandpa's all cherry mx switches and you're looking for a new linear to try you don't know where to start these 62 gram switches are a great place to start it can really change your opinion on how smooth a switch should really be i haven't stopped using these since i put them in my think 6.5 i'm just loving gaming with these i'm loving typing with these like i said it's a great jack of all trades switch if you don't know where to start and it looks good to boot the banana split switches from the key dock company and the c3 are just simply amazing so if you haven't checked them out already i believe they're still in stock at the moment so don't sleep on these it has been your boy bt don't forget to like share comment and subscribe and i will see in the next video [Music] peace you", "5yqAaejuRn8": "- OH Oh ha bingo", "iCxPoTInuAI": "no i wasn't yes you were no i wasn't yes you were bingo no i

half banana I didn't peel it so take time to I guess two seconds and my four strawberries that is it let's blend now guys this is the blender I used I'm not sure because cathedra is the Hamilton Beach you do not need an expensive blender at all this is a $15 blender on Amazon I'll leave the link down below and it is that simple and it's gonna come out [Music] all right and now that it's done blended without the ice I'm gonna go ahead and add about five to six cubes of ice put it in there way too much too much ice so one two three four five that's the five I guess five six six ice cubes blend it again and we are done now when the blender sounds like it's about to break you're done let me get my phone and show you guys how look how thick and delicious all right guys so here is my shake and check it out oh my god I told you just like ice cream so delicious yes oh my god I cannot wait to taste it now I'm gonna add this is not in the recipe but I'm gonna add a little something-something alright so we just added bananas on top just a little bit and some almonds and we are done guys now these toppings are optional guys so if you're in a weight loss program I don't suggest to add any of these you could do exactly the shape that I showed you guys that is perfectly fine it's not adding that many calories to your to your nutrition but these extra toppings may add so I don't suggest it for a weight loss program but if you wanna be in a weight gain program if you're trying to get lean muscle mass do add a couple of toppings and make your shake delicious now the

[Music] you", "bbRTQOL1SzE": "[Music] welcome back everyone a stronger and lovers listen up because we are back in the kitchen with Ali and about to serve up the most adorable and tasty sweet treat using this season's most popular fruit my most popular fruit all the time pretty much oh my gosh Ali these look so good are they so cute and they're so delicious and that's the thing right now like you said strawberries are still in season there's strawberry festivals all over the country and they're just like so juicy and yummy right now if you go to the farmers market they're all over the place and you've got to you know take them up a level and make them a little bit of a new great Debbie or Li L Z wait to get to go ahead here's the difference I grabbed my fork and knife to cut into but literally I was trying to be a gentleman because I we're gonna start with the banana filling like a banana okay all that's in here is there's some cream cheese and there's some banana we blended it up and then we're just gonna add you make it really easy some pudding this is Lou Manila pudding mix just instant bad boy up and while you're blending I'm gonna head to the freezer okay because what happens is once you mix this up goes into the fridge for a bit for how long 30 minutes in the fridge for 30 minutes just so it firms up a little bit okay when I put it in the fridge I actually put it directly into a ziplock bag what I'm gonna use to put it into my strawberries just to make it really easy you could use a piping bag but as I'm sure many of you know you can use a ziplock bag and just cut off the end which we'll do in just a minute but first over here I have my strawberries how are they oh my I mean they're amazing so good I see you've cored them yes so i cored them out you want to make sure that you get big juicy strawberries okay well there are too small it's gonna be hard to put the filling in and right now because they're so in season you can find big ones at any farmers market any grocery store you're gonna be able to get your nice big plump ones how about this little tip right here little trick to make them stand up I was like how these guys but how'd you balance these out so all we did we just cut off the bottom at the bottom right here and then it's easy to stand them up and then I put these guys in the freezer and the reason I did that is because they're easy to work with and they won't fall apart while you're making them so put them in the freezer so they firm up a little bit also saying about a frozen strawberry or frozen banana is very satisfying more satisfying than just a regular one for some reason treat yeah you could let them thaw if you wanted take them out an hour before your party you could take them out right before it's like a little you can see only we didn't order anything there was no waiting at this party yeah it's gonna make a little mess okay perfect so then all we're gonna do and it's gonna pour right out the filling is easy to come out you just fill up your strawberries with this put too much in there is that okay that's fine yeah I mean you can't really go wrong I mean you don't want to overflowing over the edges but there we go so those up as you can see it's so so easy um you can use a piping bag again if you want but ziplock bag works just the same so after we're done with this we're just right okay well should we do the old dip and the old dip you know I probably should have done that first oh my gosh thank you camera and I'm losing my mind I'm too excited to eat so yeah all this is right here is it some chocolate and some coconut oil Oh curries in the coconut oils in there it's so it the chocolate firms up to the strawberry if you use candy melts you don't even need the coconut oil you just melt the candy melts but because okay dip it in there like you said there's really no wrong we already filled them and you can still do this part after but technically it might be easier to do it the other way yeah so you have your little bottoms like look at that couple I'm gonna do one more this is just fun and because we're gonna need to eat them cream cheese and what else inside of their em cheese milk and banana with some instant pudding mix Wow it's like really delicious so dude you would actually put them in the fridge for a little bit to let the chocolate kind of hard before we kind of do this next part exactly but for the sake of time we're just yeah and while you're doing this I'm gonna get the finished ones out of the fridge and you show how to put all of the fancy topping with us I'll tell you what the chocolate with the peanut butter also adds a sort of like you're eating a Reese's yeah a cop at the same time it's an explosion in your mouth amazing but we're good so right here we have I'm some whipped cream so I have this at a piping bag but if you did it right out of the can that works too just top them with some whipped cream I mean look how simple this is and how quick I actually loved the idea of doing these like my daughter's third birthday's coming up and I'm thinking he's just consumed with the kids yeah for the kids like how much fun would they love these and I feel like this is something that I could do with Molly so she'd feel a part of making something for her birthday yeah then you can top him Harvey you like some sprinkles oh I feel like it's you know their portion so their tiny size you know like individual and that's I mean I hate to say it but I feel it's probably a lot better for you than a lot of the cakes these days absolutely yeah well it's got through it's like really I think we have some over here these are like really really saw because we don't ones might be a little bit less out here do you guys seem like you want more yeah pass them around I'll have one of the ones we just made I don't mind it's a little bit no the first ones are great", "2BC30InbtDk": "[Applause] we are going to this is going to be

"hi everybody this is Jen from cookies cupcakes and cardio comm today we're going to be making banana split cupcakes we're going to start with a banana cupcake recipe for the base and on top we're putting chocolate cherry strawberries pineapple and of course bananas they're delicious let's get going so first we're going to go over the ingredients for the banana cupcakes they're going to take 3/4 of a cup of butter 3 cups of all-purpose flour 3/4 of a cup of buttermilk 1 teaspoon of cinnamon 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of baking soda 3/4 of a teaspoon of baking powder 3/4 of a teaspoon of salt 3 eggs 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla extract 2 cups of mashed bananas and 1 and 1/2 cups of brown sugar so the first thing we're going to do is I've placed my flour into this larger bowl and I'm going to add my cinnamon into it and my baking soda my baking powder and my salt and just taking a small whisk I'm going to whisk it together once it's all combined set it off to the side and we're going to do the second step the next step is to take your mashed bananas add in your butter milk and the vanilla extract and give that a stir and set it aside as well so I have my butter in my stand mixer here I'm just going to cream it for a couple seconds and then I'm going to add my brown sugar to the bowl here and put it back on and do some more cream innings just going to give it a brief scrape here get some of that some of it was stuck on my blade there and now when I turn it back on I'm going to add one egg at a time into the bowl and then I'm just going to let it continue to mix until everything is all incorporated so we're going to put half of our flour mixture into our bowl so approximately and then I'm going to give it a quick stir and then I'm going to put about half of our banana mixture in and stir that up again and I'll repeat that process one more time the rest of the flour take this up helps me out there we go and the rest of the bananas so I'm just going to let this finish mixing and I'm going to I'm just going to make sure everything is up off the bottom of the bowl and I'm going to get my cupcake tin ready to put the batter into so I'm going to use my muffin scoop here it holds about four to six tablespoons of batter and I'm just going to put it into my cupcake liners you ought to have your oven preheated to 350 degrees Fahrenheit which is 170 degrees Celsius they're going to bake for about 20 minutes and when they're baked and cooled I will be back to show you how to make the banana splits so these are the ingredients that we're going to be using to assemble the banana splits so we're going to start off with these previously frozen strawberries you can use fresh but for something like this I prefer the previously frozen because of the liquid that comes from them and it makes the cupcake really moist we're also going to be using crushed pineapple now to put our cupcakes in - I found this paper baking little tray here at our local grocery store but I'm sure you could find it in any craft or or cake store in your local area I'm going to be using bananas maraschino cherries sprinkles vanilla buttercream and chocolate ganache so I've placed the cupcakes into the paper tray and I'm going to take my vanilla buttercream and I have my at Echo 809 tip here but you can use any tip that you want and I'm just going around and building up like that and I'm going to take a little spoonful of my ganache I always find when I'm doing this sort of a step that you just want to do a little bit at a time because it will tend to run quite a bit and don't want it to be too too messy so it's just going to come down here and you can coax it a little bit pushing it like that I'll do a little bit more I think there we go kind of too much right chocolate and banana and buttercream delicious so there we go for the ganache now I'm going to put on just a couple of sprinkles to give it a little color up here and a cherry on top so I'm going to do all three of the ones in our container here and then I'll show you the next step so the last step for assembling our banana splits is to take our bananas and just place them beside the cupcakes into your baking tray here just like that you don't have to go all the way there we go and then I'm going to take a spoonful of pineapple and place it in between those two and some strawberries and place it in between these two just like that this looks absolutely delicious so I'll be right back and I will finish off the video for you so there you go everybody how to make banana split cupcakes grab a couple of spoons find your friends and enjoy this delightful treat so you can find this on lots of different social media sites and we're going to put the links for you in our description box in the video below so find us there say hello and I will see you again next time you", "Jbw06hgJiTM": "(Music) Gemma's Bigger Bolder Baking Banana Split Ice Cream Cake Hi Bold Bakers! With the lovely summer weather,\nthe requests for ice cream cake have been pouring in. So I'm going to take my famous\nNo Machine Ice Cream recipe and pair it with my fabulous Banana Bread and make a Banana\nSplit Ice Cream Cake. So let's get baking! So we're going to start out by making the\nbanana bread. Now a lot of you have asked me for my go-to banana bread recipe and I'm\nexcited to share that with you because it's a really good one. So we're going to start out in a large bowl.\nWe're going to add in our flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cinnamon and then mix really\nwell together. In a separate bowl we're going to mash up\nour bananas with a fork really nice and fine. Feel free to use bananas that are a little\nblack on the outside and overripe because they work really well in banana bread and\nthey have a lovely sweetness to them. Lovely! Our banana is nice and fine and mushed\nup. So to this we're going to add in our egg, vanilla extract and flavorless oil. I'm using\nsunflower oil but you can use vegetable oil, coconut, I just don't advise using olive oil\nbecause it's kind of strong in flavor. And then mix them really well together. Now simply add your wet ingredients into your\ndry and mix together with a spatula until just combined. You want to take care that\nyou do not over mix this cake. I want my ice cream cake to be high rather\nthan wide so I'm going to bake it off in a six inch tin. Now just pour it into your tin.\nSo if you're baking this off just to have a loaf of banana bread you can add in some\nblueberries, which I love to do, some toasted pecans or even fresh cherries. I'm ready to pop my banana bread into the\noven. You want to bake it off at 350F/180C. You'll know when it's done because it's gorgeous golden\nbrown on top and firm in the middle. While your banana bread is baking, you'll\nwant to already have your ice cream ready. Now I made my two ingredient No Machine Ice\nCream and I made vanilla flavor but feel free to use any ice cream and flavor that you like. I'm pretty sure my banana bread is done. The\ntimer just went off and my whole kitchen smells like warm, roasted bananas so let's have a\nlittle look. Check this guy out. It's beautiful golden brown on top. It smells amazing. Nice\nvanilla. A little warm cinnamon. It's nice and firm on top. We're going to set this guy\naside and let it go totally cold and then start to assemble our Banana Split Ice Cream\nCake. Now that our banana bread has gone totally\ncold, it's time to cut it. Now feel free to make your banana bread up to two days in advance\nbecause it will be much easier to work with the longer it sits. With a serrated knife,\nyou just want to make one clean cut through the middle of your banana bread. That is a\nbeautiful banana bread. Nice chunks of banana. That's always a good sign. And this...oh my gosh, it smells amazing! So our next step is to take the bottom layer\nof our cake on the paper and pop it back into the tin you baked it in. So the reason that\nI did this is because we're going to put a lovely thick layer of vanilla ice cream in\non top of this and we're going to pop the lid on top and what this is going to do is\ngive our lovely cake an overall uniformed finish. Now just scoop on some of your no machine\nice cream. You want to make sure that your ice cream is a little bit soft because it\nmakes it much easier to spread. Once you have all of your ice cream in there go along with\na little butter knife and just spread it out so there are no gaps in it. Ok. On with our top layer. Once you have your\nice cream layer in there we're going to put this guy back in the freezer so it can set\nup nice and hard again. When we take it out, we're going to decorate it all over. It's been fifteen minutes and our ice cream\nlayer is frozen in the middle so now we're going to start to decorate this ice cream\ncake just like you would a regular cake but instead of frosting we're going to use ice\ncream. So what I'm going to do now is actually cut\noff the top of this cake to make it nice and flat so we have an even top to decorate on. Ok. Perfect! And remember that any scraps\nleft over belong to the baker, which is me. Mmm. What we're going to do now is cover the entire\ncake in ice cream and we're going to decorate it just like you would a normal cake. Now to get it out of the tin we're going to\nturn it over. And take it out upside down. One reason to do this is because the bottom\nalways makes a really good flat surface to decorate. What you want to do now is do a layer of our\nice cream which is essentially the icing for our cake all over. I have a little turntable that I'm going to\ndecorate my cake on. For this stage you want to make sure that your ice cream is soft but\nnot too soft so it's easy to work with. Now what we want to do is put this cake back in\nthe freezer and let the ice cream get nice and hard. Now that the ice cream on the outside is frozen\nyou can see there are holes and things that we want to fill in so we're going to go with\neven more ice cream all over again. Lay your ice cream on nice and thick and cover up any\nimperfections. So this next part is really fun because you\nstart to see how it becomes a Banana Split Ice Cream Cake and one thing that is going\nto do that is sprinkles. Add sprinkles all around the bottom of your\ncake to make a lovely colorful border. One way to make this ice cream cake extra BIG\n& BOLD is to add extra scoops of ice cream on the top. Do not be shy with this ice cream.\nThen drizzle on layers of rich chocolate sauce, some fresh strawberry sauce and ribbons of\nmy signature salted caramel. You can even add more sprinkles and of course, don't forget\nyour cherry on top. If you're going to make an ice cream cake,\nyou may as well make it BIG & BOLD! Oh my gosh, this is absolutely divine. It's\nthe best of both worlds: Ice Cream & Cake! Mmm. Thank you so much for watching and subscribing\nto my channel. I'll see you back here every Thursday for more Bigger Bolder Baking.", "Lxn2t068iSs": "Guess what we're doing today! We are finally making\nBanana Splits for dogs! Let's get to it! So yeah, today we really are making\nBanana Splits for dogs. This is a pretty easy recipe\nand before we even get started, I just want to remind you guys,\nthis is a treat.  This is not something\nyou should be feeding your dog every day. Moderation is key.  If you don't feel\ncomfortable feeding your dogs\nsome of the ingredients here, contact your vet, substitute the amount for\nsomething you are comfortable for. Get creative and make your own! So if you guys are new to this channel... That is Memphis.\nThis is Oakley.\nThis is Shelby. And my name is Jess. One of the things we do on this channel\nfrom time to time, is make dog treats. There will be links up in the cards and\ndown in the video description below, to a playlist of all the other treats we had done. Let's get started and make\nsome treats. The first thing we are gonna need\nis a mini muffin pan. And some mini muffin cups. What we are gonna do, is line these\nwith some little muffin cups. You want to eat a muffin cup?\nAre they delicious? They really won't be delicious! Once we have that prepared,\nyou are going to need a bowl,\na spoon and some yogurt. As you know, with people's banana splits,\nthere are three (3) types of ice cream. Vanilla, strawberry and chocolate.\nDogs cannot have chocolate,\nbut we'll get to that in a minute. Basically what we are doing right now,\nis making our dog friendly\nice cream for the dogs. And we are using yogurt. For the first flavor or dog friendly ice cream,\nwe're just gonna using plain yogurt. That will simulate our vanilla ice cream. Basically, we're going through and\nfill these muffin cups about half way... With yogurt. Want to try some? Oooo!  Is yogurt!\nMmmmm... Want to try some? Mmmm... How about you Shelby? We know, Shelby loves yogurt,\ncause is the dip that goes on everything. Come here Shelby. Want some? Mmm...  Delicious! Alright! Don't worry!  This is dog yogurt only. We have our cups filled with what\nwould be our vanilla yogurt. Now, we are going to take a bowl and\nwe're gonna put some yogurt on it. Probably about a cup's worth...\nI would say... Now, we are going to create our\nstrawberry ice cream. We're going to do this, by taking\nsome fresh cut up strawberries. You can take some of these and smash\nthem with a fork and it will help\nget the juice out of it. Or, you can stir them real good,\nlike smashing with your spoon\nas you stir them, Cause that will give them the nice\npink color that we are looking for. So we're gonna drop a couple of\nstrawberries in here. Start stirring and smashing...\nOakley, want some? (laughter) I'll be right back!\nI'll go and wash my hand! You can see, it's already starting\nto turn pink. Excuse me ma'am!\nAre you coming to steal the ingredients? Memphis is like,\n\"I really like strawberries!  Can I?\" OK... Would you like a strawberry?\nOh my!  OK, now everybody gets a\nstrawberry. Would you like a strawberry?\nOh my! Shelby...  I know better... Here...  Oh!\nWatch me make a mess. There you go.  You guys\ngot strawberry too. Stirred it all up and smash some strawberries in it, Like I said, if you really want, you can \nsmash them with a fork first, that\ndoes tend to help, You are going to get some nice\npink looking dog ice cream. And now, repeat the process.\nTake this and scoop it out. Then, fill these about half way. Now, the strawberry is ready. Memphis? Oh strawberry is good stuff! Oh my! How about you? Oh my!  Strawberry good stuff! I know, Shelby will love this! It's all your favorite things in one. She has to sniff it first... (laughter) Now, is time for the next flavor.\nChocolate!  But, dogs can't have chocolate. So, we are using our favorite!\nCaaaarob powder! Carob Powder! One more time...\nCarob Powder! NOT CHOCOLATE!\nCAROB!\nNOT CHOCOLATE! This is safe for dogs! Also vegan too. We are going to put some more yogurt\nin this dish. Then, we're going to take the...\nCaaarob powder... See?  Looks like that!\nSmells like dirt... Is not...\nbut smells like dirt to me. You guys like dirt?  Apparently... I'll put some Amazon affiliate links\ndown below, for like, where you can get\nthe carob powder, trays and other stuff I'm using. I'm going to put a little\nbit of that in here. We're going to stir it all up, probably\na tablespoon. Now, we got the carob yogurt. Then, repeat the last step.\nWe're going to take and fill these... With carob yogurt... You first? Oh! We're making a mess! We're making a mess...\nYou next? You got it, on your nose. Down on your nose! How about you Shelby? I'm not bending down there Diva!\nYou gotta come up here! Careful, we don't drip it out\non Oakley's head. Good stuff?\n(laughter) Now, comes the super hard part... Waiting... We now need, to take this entire tray...\nAnd stick it in the freezer... While we're waiting for those to freeze,\nyou can probably prep all the rest of\nyour ingredients. You are going to need some more\ncut up strawberries, some cut up pineapples and some smashed unsalted peanuts. You don't need a lot.\nI made too many, but make sure\nthey're unsalted. Now, we're going to wait for that\nto freeze, but with camera magic\nwill be back like that. Once your ice cream is frozen... Is time to prepare your bananas. For those of you that are going to ask...\nYes.  Dogs can have bananas. Again, as a treat.  Not something\nyou want to give them all the time. I'm not going to do the whole banana.\nI'm actually going to cut these\nabout in half. I'll probably cut both ends of these, since...\nVery curved bananas... You can prepare these in an actual\nbanana split dish, or just in a little dish. You can do these anyway you want.\nYou can cut them up and make them\nlook really cute. Or you can try to make them look like an actual\nbanana split, which is what we're going\nto try to do. Would you like a piece of banana? How did I know? Shelby, would you like a piece\nof banana?  Piece of banana? That's what I thought... How about you?\nPiece of banana? Oakley's like,\n\"Oh!\" Whoa...  Did you see that? Oakley?  You don't want banana? No?  No nana's for Oakley either? Will see, if we can fix this... How about now? Now you have a banana? She spit it out... How about now? She spit it out too! Well we'll see who eats these bananas! We have cut our banana in half and now\nwe're gonna go grab our ice cream. Alright!  We got our three (3) little\ndoggy friendly ice creams that we made. This is why we put them in the muffin tins. We pull them right out of there. Set them right up...\nActually, white in the middle. Set them right on, in here... It starting to look like a banana split. But, we can't be done just yet! You have to decorate it up\na little bit. Now, we're going to pretty it up.\nWe're gonna take a couple of pieces of pineapple. Put them on top of the white ice cream. We're gonna take a couple of pieces\nof strawberry and put them on the\nstrawberry ice cream. I'm not gonna put anything on the carob. We're gonna take just a little bit\nof 'Ready Whip'\nand put it in the middle here. Kind of separating the two...\nOops! How about you come back out there? Like I said, just a little bit. We're take just a little bit of these\npeanuts... Sprinkle them on... Again, these are just unsalted peanuts. Put them on the top there... This is entirely optional,\nyou can take just a little bit of sprinkles\nif you want. Sprinkle them on as well,\njust for some added color. And then... Since we can't put any, like, sauce on top of it,\nI'm taking just a little bit of the carob powder\nand sprinkling it on the banana. Then, all over the entire thing. Just to give that little bit of extra pretty look. Again, this is just pretty much all just for looks. We're almost done, but it would'nt\nbe a complete banana split without... One little cherry on top!\n(laughter) There we have it.  Now, I have to make\ntwo (2) more of these for the dogs. That is our banana split for dogs! It's so cute!  It's so cute! Now, they get to try them. Alright! There you go Memphis! Oh!  She's a little bit slower than I thought\nshe was gonna be... Oh!  It's because she can't scarf it! Oh scarf that banana! Whew!  It's so windy out here today! This is the one we just made.\nIt's got the dog ice cream we made, it\ngot a little bit soft. So it's a little bit easier for her to eat. What you think?\nIs it delicious? Oh!  You found that piece? Is that the best banana split\nyou ever had? Alright! Let's let the other girls to try one. I really thought, Memphis was going to\nscarf it down.  I'm glad she didn't eat it\nas fast, as I thought she was going to. Alright!  Shelby next. She did not want anything to do\nwith the banana. So let's see what she thinks. Is it better when is all together? She's like,\n\"I don't know...  There's banana on the side?\" \"I don't know how I feel about that...\" Mmmm... Oh!  Oh!  Oh...  There she goes! Now, you're not gonna eat it?\nI'll bet she doesn't eat the banana. (laughter) Shelby's like,\n\"I would like this ice cream and this fruit...\" Shelby's like,\n\"The whip creams...\" Shelby's like,\n\"But, no thanks on the banana!\" Yeah?  That's exactly what you're saying huh? Oh!  She's going for it? Is she gonna eat the banana? Maybe? Oh!  There goes the cherry! Shelby's like,\n\"Phew!  Don't like cherries!\" (laughter) I knew, you did not like cherries.\nI had a feeling, you're going to spit\nthe thing out... I only gave you a half of one. Uh!  That was good though?\nThat was pretty good, huh? Last, but not least...\nMiss Oakley! Let's see if she'll eat the banana. Oakley's like,\n\"Phew!  I don't want this cherry!\" Oakley's like,\n\"I want the rest of this stuff!\" (laughter) You are gonna do exactly what Shelby did? Oh can't...  She don't like the banana either? Oakley's like,\n\"I don't like the banana...\" Oakley's like,\n\"but I will take this frozen stuff.\" Don't worry about extra frozen stuff. Frozen stuff is the best! Frozen stuff number two (2)... Oh!  So good! Are you gonna go for frozen stuff number three (3)? You do like strawberries... Oh!  It's so good! Will she eat the banana or the cherry? Wow! Oh!  Oh!  Nope!  Nope! Oh...  Maybe...  She ate the cherry. Will she eat the banana? Oakley says...\n\"No thanks on the banana!\" Well, there we have it! Now, we know what they think of\nDIY Banana Splits. These two (2) are like,\n\"Next time leave out the banana!\" Memphis is like,\n\"Don't worry!  I will eat everybody else's banana!\" Don't worry guys!  I didn't really\nlet her eat everybody else's banana. Again, moderation is key. They don't need a ton of banana. Apparently, these two (2) didn't\nneed any of it. Or the cherry... You ate the cherry.\n(laughter) Alright you guys!\nThat's all we have for today's video.

and I'm so excited I'm so excited to be able to share with you all this recipe today I'm going to show you all how to make banana split dessert you didn't call it banana split dessert you can call it banana split cake I call it pure deliciousness listen here this recipe does not require a lot of ingredients we're gonna have some fun in this kitchen and listen here it's gonna taste so good here's what you'll need to make teenie young style banana split dessert you all never had this before baby you got to make you some okay everyone here are the lovely ingredients that you're gonna need I have a stick of melted butter I just melted the butter in the microwave we have fresh bananas as well as what are these cold guys graham crackers graham crackers you're gonna need mixed nuts if you wanted to use just walnuts or peanuts you can you can use whatever kinda nut that you would like to do these nuts I was able to find in the section at Walmart where you find the ice cream toppings okay you're gonna need some milk and some Hershey's syrup you can't have a banana split without sprinkles you're gonna need some well drained you can see that I've drained these crushed pineapples you're gonna need 8 ounces of cream cheese vanilla pudding you're gonna need some marcinho cherries as well as fresh strawberries we have two 8 ounces of Cool Whip and then we have powdered sugar in this recipe if you didn't want to use powder sugar you can use granulated sugar as well so I have a 9 by 12 here alright I'm just gonna set that aside I hope that you all are having an amazing day today I hope that you all are having a great work week as well the weekend is almost here first thing that I want to do is you want to drop up your graham crackers if you don't have a mixer like this then you can feel free to take these and put them in a ziploc bag and kind of bang them up against the counter or bang on with the rolling pan to get them to fine pieces okay I'm just gonna pulsate this because we're gonna use the graham crackers to make a beautiful crust for this dessert now if those of you that love vanilla wafers like I do use vanilla wafers you can try to use vanilla wafers if you're not a fan of the graham crackers or even you could use the chocolate sandwich cookies you don't want to use the white part you know but just use the chocolate part and it would be make for an amazing crust okay so I'm going to pulsate a little bit at a time okay just like this until it looks like sand [Music] okay so now that we have our beautifully crushed up graham crackers I'm just going to pour them into a bowl and I'm going to crush up even more graham crackers crushing up my second sleeve of graham cracker now we're going to crush up our third sleeve of graham crackers okay so now what you want to do is you want to take your melted butter and you're gonna pour it right into your graham crackers okay and your graham crackers are gonna somewhat look like wet sand okay and that's what you want it to look like that's gonna help for the graham crackers to stick together and make for a beautiful crust and it will work this way for sandwich cookies and vanilla wafers as well okay see how that butter gets nice and well mixed in and it kind of looks like wet sand okay so now what we're gonna do make sure your hands are impeccably clean we're going to take our 9 by 12 dish we want to pour and if you have any big chunks of your cookies or your wafers whatever you decide to use don't worry about it it's okay okay don't make that a stress no stress in your kitchens so let's take your crust and we just want to pack it down nice and tight and then we're gonna put it into the refrigerator so I can set up and get nice and cold none of this recipe goes into the oven nothing has to be cooked okay okay and I feel like I want to go in with my hand alright cuz I want to really pack it in there and get it nice and tight okay just like so beautiful and it smells so good if you honestly if you all want it to make a crust out of pretzels and sugar you can I made a pretzel salad recipe which is a dessert and a lot of you were wowed by that dessert feel free to check that well pretzel desert or pretzel what was it called oh my goodness I can't think of the video but if I think of it any time during this video I'll tell you what the name of the video is called I think it's called pretzel desert maybe it has to jello in it and a fruit okay so now that everything is nice and packed in get this into the refrigerator so it can get nice and set next I'll show you the next step next we have 8 ounces of cream cheese and you can see I put two capfuls of vanilla and then I'm going to grab three cups of powdered sugar I'm going to use my handheld mixer I'm gonna mix up the cream cheese the vanilla three cups of powdered sugar make sure that your cream cheese is nice and room temperature okay so now that we have the cream cheese powder sugar and vanilla well incorporated it kind of looks like icing you want to take your vanilla pudding instant vanilla pudding pour it right into the bowl just like so and we want to start off with one cup of milk I don't want this mixture to be really thin even though your pudding calls for two cups of milk let's just start off with one and if we need a little bit more then we'll put a little bit more in as we go this is one cup we want a nice thick mixture so go in the middle of our dessert I'm gonna mix this I'll be right back now we want to allow everything to get nice and set up together you all know how pudding will set up okay so it'll get much thicker it'll combine with the cream cheese the powdered sugar and the vanilla that we put in here and it's gonna make an amazing feeling for our dessert fully and I tell you one thing it smells so good so we're not going to pour this into our dessert until it starts to thicken up okay it doesn't have to thicken up all the way but it will thicken up at least 60% okay I'm just scraping the bottle making and making sure I don't have any cream cheese stuck to the bottom you want everything to be well incorporated beautiful oh yeah look at that so while our filling thickens up make sure your strawberries are washed okay I'm gonna cut this part off and here's the thing about the strawberries you can chop them up into little pieces if you like like I'm gonna do or you can just slice them okay I'm gonna do little pieces like that because I don't want a huge slice of strawberry in my dessert but if you'd like to do yours this way by all means you can all right so I want to cut enough so that we can spread them on the top of our filling that we just made along with the well-drained crushed pineapples make sure that you drain those crushed pineapples very very well it's a must because if you don't drain it well it can mess your whole dessert up okay because you don't want to have that extra pineapple juice in your dessert all right beautiful these strawberries are amazing they are so beautiful and nice and sweet I can't stop eating them they're so beautiful my goodness mmm I'm just gonna put these strawberries into my bowl here this is the bowl that I had the butter in but that butters not going to hurt my strawberries right put them in there just like so continue to cut these strawberries until you get the desired amount if you're a person that says oh gee I can't eat strawberries we'll use something else so you can just use pineapples if you don't like pineapples you use what kind of fruit that you would like to put on your banana split think of the ingredients that you like to have on your banana split when you make one or you order one these are all of the ingredients that I like I have to have the sprinkles you know you have to have that Hershey's syrup you have to have Moschino cherries right absolutely if you're that person that loves caramel then you better go out and get you some or make you some this is a dessert that your whole family will love the adults the kids everyone that tries this are going to go crazy after trying it they're gonna love it beautiful I think I have just enough strawberries I don't want too much that's enough this right here we can snack on that okay everyone our beautiful crust is set our filling is nice and set now we're gonna take that beautiful filling and what I did was I set the filling in the refrigerator so it could thicken up a bit okay you want to pour that filling right into your pan just like so this is so delicious guys like I've tasted it five times I can't I couldn't keep my spoon out of it it's so delicious and then you just want to spread it evenly all over your beautiful crust try your best to get it nice and even okay beautiful now we're going to take and we're going to slice our bananas put your bananas on here put your fruits on here and let's have some fun time for the bananas I have two bananas peeled you can align them you know nice and neat if you like or you can just slice them on skit you some on there this is one dessert where I don't line everything up perfectly because it doesn't matter it's okay with this one you're not gonna be able to see the bananas you know once we get this dessert done but you do want to make sure you evenly distribute them all over the dessert so everyone can get a piece of banana in each bite okay and some of your fruit might stick down into the sauce and guess what it's okay don't worry about that two bananas should do you for the middle of this filling beautiful look at that it smells so good it almost reminds you of banana pudding if you all haven't seen my banana pudding video check it out cuz you're gonna need that video and recipe for these holidays coming up okay so we have bananas and then make sure like I said you drain the pineapples and you just want to take little bits of pineapple at a time and just put it on top just like so making sure that you don't get any liquid if you have to read rain your pineapples then read RINO okay we don't want the water from the pineapple beautiful these are all the toppings that I like to have when I think of a banana split remember I said put what toppings you like to have on yours as well whoo look at this you could even take some waffle cone and you could crush the waffle cone up and use that as you know crunchy bits on the top you better believe you can and it would be delicious whoo-wee that right there that's enough pineapples for me and we can snack on that right there a little later so now next your beautiful strawberries get them on top baby don't be afraid to just load it on pal on what you love this recipe right here is a winner for sure you all are going to thank me later when you make this for your holiday and all of your family members go crazy over this you're going to say Gina thank you and I want to say you're very welcome I'm so silly guy but I tell you one thing I am having the time of my life in this kitchen sharing all of my recipes with you all really I am so now what I'm gonna do is I want to take my Cool Whip this Cool Whip has been out of there out of the freezer for a while so it can fall out a little bit we want to smear this on top and you're not going to need to cold whips the only way you will need to cool webs as if you use a larger baking pan okay other than that one should do yet let's just see before I speak a little too soon we might need one and a half if it doesn't smear out for me we'll use a half of the other one let's just see but you don't want to too much cold whip all right this is smearing out just beautifully some of it is actually still a little frozen and that's going to prevent it from spreading as it should I'm gonna continue to smear this beautiful Cool Whip on and I'll be right back okay everyone so I was very very gentle with the coal whip as the cool whip warmed up a little bit I was able to spread it a lot better so one 8-ounce coal whip that did the trick so now here's what we're going to do next I'm just wiping my hands off next we're going to go ahead and take some of this beautiful Hershey's chocolate and you want to drizzle it drizzle it in whatever motion you would like to okay all over your banana split dessert girl you are something else in that kitchen baby you hear me oh look at that beautiful some of you might say later chocolate on Gina come on now okay we'll put a little bit moral if you're that person that wants caramel or strawberry syrup then you put you someone make this your recipe put what you like on yours now I'm going to go in you cannot have a banana split at least Gina yahoos banana split without some type of salted nut I love salted nuts on my banana split we're gonna put some mixed nuts all over this beauty dessert oh yeah now a lot of you when I use nuts some of you say my husband is allergic to peanuts or nuts well don't use it okay that's up all right something you can't use don't use it and your recipe will still be amazing you better believe it we'll go in with maraschino cherries sometimes you can find the Mersey no cherries give them a nice shake like this because they have a lot of juice on them some of you might be able to find the Moschino cherries that have the stem if you can find those that would be beautiful on this dessert but if you can't no worries okay shake them much as you can and then you distribute them how you like this right here is Gina young style banana split dessert banana split cake whatever you want to call it I call it pure goodness you better make you some you all never had this before baby you better make yourself mmm are you are gonna miss out you have to let this sit there's no way around it you have to let this set before you eat into it otherwise it won't set up you know you want it to set up nice and tall like a lasagna would okay we have a couple errands we're going to do so this will go on the refrigerator while we run errands and when we come back our dessert will be ready we're gonna slice down into it and give it a try I'm gonna let you all know what this tastes like meanwhile I'm gonna go ahead and

where have they split to to find out webtoon into the next episode of the banana splits [Applause] la la banana banana form bananas", "_G_pKPLc0ec": "[Music] welcome to slash forward in this episode we're gonna watch a reenactment of what went on backstage every night at Showbiz Pizza with the 2018 film the banana splits movie let's get to it we open on the opening sequence of the banana splits show a popular program centered around a group of anthropomorphic animals it's all about music fun and detailing their reckless exploits this transitions into a dark hole where Beth is resting after a long evening of Mommy blogging she's disturbed by Harley excited about celebrating his birthday the next day she puts him to bed before busting her older son Austin for breaking curfew the next morning we find Harley's birthday surprise will be tickets to attend a live taping of the banana splits something stepdad Mitch's just thrilled about they enjoy some cake and wildly age-inappropriate gifting before revealing the surprise they pick up Zoe on the way a last-minute stand-in for Duncan Hartley's only friend who called in sick brutal at the check-in line Harley almost gets hit by the wack pack but he's confident snore he would never harm him yeah but he doesn't know that since this is a closed set cellphones are collected and Austin takes the opportunity to plant a seed with the show's Paige Paige backstage we get some additional plot details discovering that the mascots are actually super advanced otamatone x' under the care of a greasy madman we also find that the show's executive producer was just promoted to VP his first act will be to cancel the long-running profitable show because it doesn't match his vision that sounds accurate we see that Droopys update causes him to go red with the prime directive that the show must go on and it does as on stage the audience has served all of their deepest desires pain sacrifice perseverance and ultimately conformity as the show ends in its normal way with only the illusion of chance and opportunity the audience departs while a few lucky members get to stay behind for a backstage meet injury Mitch takes this opportunity to handle some business with work accomplished a solely through texting which is fishing in the greenroom Stevie who previously overheard about the impending cancellation gives a cynical toast this causes droopy to go red enabling his update which then prompts him to invite Stevie to lick it like a lollipop since he's a robot he doesn't get the reference nor have a sufficient grasp of human anatomy to make it work properly meanwhile our winners are getting their photo ops stage dad Jonathan is looking for a chance to introduce his daughter to a producer when Paige explains that she's unable to help him with that he runs off on his own causing her to follow in the rest of the group to break up while the kids awkwardly stare at the splits outside Beth catches up with Mitch and discovers his work texting is of the sexy variety and he officially frees up his evening before storming off to make sensual arrangements inside Harley and Zoey's snoop around in the prop room before going on a quest to find store he meanwhile Jonathan presents Parker who quickly demonstrates her middling talents Rebecca explains the show's been canceled so they quickly pivot toward a new opportunity while this is going on that no a fad will do fad and pop yard [ __ ] around on some old sets they get their live stream going again the fad streams his marriage proposal to their audience they're then congratulated by Fleagle who enforces these strict no phones policy before volunteering fad for a brutal magic trick that poppy just sort of watches it takes a bit of effort but the payoff is worth it I think Bravo he's then distracted by the sounds of children and agrees to take them to snorky outside mitch has caught in some headlights and chooses to run straight down the channel in a gimpy manner he eventually makes it to the security booth only to find the premises insecure and is struck in the process jonathan barges into the green room looking for Andy the VP but gets lit up like a match instead while droopy hip thrusts in his face back on set the adult survivors meet up and just to make sure they're on the same page Jonathan pops in causing them to wonder about the fate of the children we find that Fleagle has led them to the workshop where the animals appear to be keeping their child collection while in the process of looking for the kids Beth and Austin manage is severely injured bingo they then convinced poppy that her fiancee is not coming back and she'd be safer with them Karl acknowledges that he's losing control but his affection toward his creations is too strong to allow him to act against them however in his despair at the condition of his precious bingo he drops his keys allowing the kids to trade places with him Paige has discovered that outside communication is impossible while Rebecca and John are put through their paces Rebecca thinks she's come out on top but there are no winners in this game meanwhile the kids finally find snorky and are led off the survivors come together and confront Karl in the workshop but his maniacal laugh confirms he's properly lost it upon hearing music in the distance they descend toward the source of the sound poppy lags behind his choosing instead to join Karl in crazy time population 1 they find the kids locked up at the never-ending show which they seem to be mostly enjoying except for when Stevie comes on because no one likes Stevie as they work to free the kids and improved wheel of endings is revealed free of the confines of the original show formula utilize a wheel with real options demonstrated when it lands on banana split something none of them has ever experienced before and it turns out it's more of a quartering than a split while this is going on Harley uses his keys to free the children while Beth hangs back to lay a distraction and manages to take out fleagle and drooper with some help snorky then helps them with bingo for some reason in the two robots rip each other to shreds they then received medical treatment in the parking lot when emergency personnel show up and they conclude their respective character arcs Wiener boy turns out not to be so strange after all Austin proves himself sufficiently virtuous to get a date Beth stops playing it safe and demands a divorce and Mitch gets smeared across the asphalt as poppy rides into the night completely ignorant of how much work in maintenance her new robot army will require and that was five nights with the banana splits show the movie if you enjoyed the video I'd love for you

we can transition into the truck position now from the truck we have a lot of variations the one we're going to do today is the banana split okay so so I'm gonna start from engaging the back now it's very important to keep in mind that it's best to start this one I already have a hook in probably I'm going from the back I'm trying to rope it he's a very large opponent I can't get it down so now let's just move with this eight here I am going to face behind my opponent and bring my wake over I as I face my I face this way two hands engage each foot and I sit down at my point stays here I do have a submission here okay now if most likely he's gonna roll it because it is painful I'm going to catch the hooking leg like so into eight what's called a lockdown now my target now is going to be this leg here it's very important guys that when I grab the leg I do not expose my L because there is an arm right there so it's very dangerous to make sure the elbow is not between the legs I'm going to engage the leg I can do a so I've seen some grips here this this fear appear the gable grip or hug in the lasik really get choked as long as the elbows not exposed like so that's just that's the most important thing now let's go for the submission here just do a basic gable grip I'm going to stretch the legs on this direction as I pull with my body this leg in the opposite direction here okay let's do it again I have a hooker trying to take the back it's not working I turn around and hook two hands engage his foot and I call back and I roll my opponent and I catch the leg the same time I melee engages like here gable grip and I'm going to stretch and pull and that is your truck position into what's called a banana split", "ObuOiOFAD5g": "hey guys welcome back to my channel it's me amanda and you guys are on amazon so guys today i will be showing you guys how to make bananas plate first you need crushed merry biscuits so you can put it as the baseline then you have to mix the cream and the condensed milk to put it on the second layering then you need a little merry biscuits like these on the third layer and the final layering will be of like a sliced banana so now i will be putting the crushed merry biscuits on the first layer now i will get a spoon and like layer it like that in it so there is more space for the condensed milk cream bananas and the other very biscuit and guys if you haven't subscribed to my channel subscribe to my channel and like this video if you want more of these videos and if you want me to start how to make cds so right now i will put the

it a little bit of milk so like it will be like more not a lot of so it wouldn't be that sweet [Music] look how the color change from white to yellow around like a few seconds [Music] okay look guys not smooth but because of the condensate condensate is a little bit hard so like it makes things like it's very sweet but it's really hard with the help of cream and the milk now it's very like snoopy and not that hard to mix so now i will put the cream and the condensed milk you have to be very careful because there is no spreading in this one you can spread it oh my god outside so now guys we

into the castle ground", "pMtnLKyTIrc": "we're working together they work to pass the grilled banana split by the cross all right so instead of the usual graham crackers since we're doing ice cream I'm using waffle cones crush them up I'm gonna add some salted butter melted if you don't have any salted butter you can do use unsalted and add a pinch it just helps balance out all the sweetness that we've got going on and so they'll just ground cones yeah just ground up cones you can do it in a ziploc bag or you can just put it in your food processor and then right into a pie dish Jacques what I like to do when I'm making any kind of crumb crust is use the back of a metal measuring cup to just press it all down and best part about those pie crust is there you don't have to heat up the oven as GZ knows I love a no bake dessert well I have an oven yeah why exactly I mean you can just put it in the freezer and I got one down here yeah it's like walking into those ice cream parlors and smelling them make the waffle cones right the batter is the best oi so the hot fudge goes right in and I'm just gonna spread it out so we have a nice layer between our ice cream and our pie crust GZ while I spread this out you get started on the next what's next what is next the grilled banana grill okay first of all start with bananas this one out gonna tell you these bananas that aren't perfectly ripe a little like a day or two away because if it's too ripe it'll really get uhm yeah yeah yeah mushy okay so we're gonna give a nice smoke flavor at this what we're gonna do is we're gonna take the edges off and we're just gonna cut it this way an equator is he equated thinking like that and we're gonna rub we're gonna brush this with a little whole butter that's melted all right and don't just be generous because as you can see we're having a sundae it doesn't really matter now what's the point of this Jeffrey I kind of know but I'm a beautiful smoky spin on that trust me you're gonna taste so fantastic some brown sugar mmm it's almost like Bananas Foster yep that's right where's the room where's it rum rum okay and onto a very hot grill wow this is that sizzle they're gonna caramelize them cook them just a bit and you will see so we have some over here all right Thank You kid we have some here that I've done and that's what it looks like can you see that we're gonna take the peel off hmm I'll eat that right taste that it's interesting that's that great caramelized flavor to it little kiss of the grill do you guys know when the banana split was invented the turkey rice cracked so jerk era like the fifties no actually 1904 that was soda jerk a pharmacist in Pennsylvania who was 23 years old and guess how much it sold for when it first came out 20 cents Oh two cents 10 cents he's putting this on the pie crust comb crust with the chocolate sauce sauce hot fudge on there why something for the pie bro huh good and I'm just gonna kind of press it down so that it's six ends of the fudge I'll accept that all right are you ready you got that [Music] honey I don't know what you got up your sleeve now GZ if you don't find going into the freezer and brochure tray that looks like it's got tons of scoops on it oh I'm just gonna go in this is the Neapolitan so I'm going in going all the way across I'm getting all the flavors at once no big deal but you see beforehand already got each of the individual flavors out theory uh-oh good offset or of the back of the spoon if you don't have an offset the back of a spoon also works so this is basically obviously a little bit of vanilla a little bit chocolate little sausage yeah yeah you know softening ice cream is the hardest thing to do but the most rewarding thing to do yeah all right so look you're gonna go around the edges there and then is there a spatula or maybe I can use my little offset nevermind I got this and start placing this a quick work it's gonna put this right back into use cute the freezer just go around thanks cheesy go around the edge here and I'm spacing them because I'm just gonna go in and do a lot more stuff yes I mean this thing is gonna break the cutting board by the time we're done with that this has gotta weigh nine pounds already it's a lot of stuff then just come in with a little bit of whipped cream Oh sinner oh yes make a little I wondered what was gonna go on and this is already starting to remind me of like in the freezer of the ice cream joints you know you go in there you get like the pre-made ice cream pies yes everything Sonny isn't going back in the freezer right back into the freezer and then there should be one in there that looks just like it that's one down my way guys I got the the final steps here to give it a little more color and of course take our time look at this my turn to take this pie over the top of course with some chocolate sauce that we're gonna drizzle that's gonna take about three to six hours to like really firm up especially with the whipped cream so don't check it oh now this is not even chocolate sauce this is hot fudge that we just kind of warmed up over in Reverse oh and of course the maraschino cherries and those candied walnuts look how glistening and pretty those are we're just gonna kind of do it I like that we're getting a hot on the bottom and the top but nobody knows the hot fudge on the bottom is prized and then we got one in there but let me see I think I can finish it here turbo I'm like a soda jerk as we speak and then some sprinkles around the perimeter and of course last but not least cherry on the cherry on top [Applause] what nobody knows is that there is a layer of fudge if you thought cutting the first piece of a pie was difficult kind of frozen by you let me get another one that's better pass one down here Jeff you got it oh that that bottom layer Oh beautiful oh he did it [Applause] you know I love all this place was like you go to the ice cream parlor they let you get your own scoops and then you put on your own topping but this is just like a really cool ice cream cone in a pie form", "sl3pFU7DmyU": "Yesterday I announced\nI will be doing this show for

"[Music] the Arabian Nights oh wow you guys were serious and released this okay the banana splits was a hanna-barbera TV show from the 60s that's so old and obscure that even the Powerpuff Girls never referenced them I think their only claim to fame is having a cover of their theme song featured in the movie kick-ass god I love Matthew Vaughn movies the banana split to a some sort of goofy variety show of people in costumes running around and with some animation segments I think that's what it was about so naturally in 2019 WB and the sci-fi channel rebooted this into a horror movie for some reason because the banana Swan show is about to ring look it's a hanna-barbera property did anyone ask for their action shows to be turned into a talk show courtroom comedy or whatever the hell Sealab 2021 was Quinn's gonna be busy with that hooker for a while what hooker stuff like this challenges the notion why reboot something if you're gonna make it so different let me ask you if you could reboot something into a completely different genre what would it be I'd want rocket power with more harsh reality to it that's all I'll say for now so here's the 2019 banana splits horror movie on the sci-fi channel yeah that's a good sign you have another surprise for you we are going to the banana splits this takes place in some unrealistic universe where people under 60 give a [ __ ] about the banana splits and are still making new episodes a family takes their kids to a live recording of the show only for them to be locked inside after hours it turns out the banana splits are alive except you think they're alive because they're humans and costumes but they're actually robots which makes the fact that they're alive scary hmm yeah this robotic premise sounds very familiar but we'll talk about that later this looks like some TV grade crap that was shot on digital cameras but I honestly had a great time as this movie went on it just kept getting more and more insane like no joke it partially became the origin story for a vigilante hero as you'd expect from a slasher movie you get one-dimensional jerks that are just asking to die but they certainly are interesting like these two wannabe youtubers yeah I'm not giving up my phone then you can't come in that it's fine wait dad that's her dad oh my god dad babe we are gonna meet the splits Oh his name is bad okay yeah I was confused watching this sure the side characters are basically cartoons but there are some endearing moments that had me liking the main cast near the end I someone had an emotional attachment to someone I did not expect it didn't hit as hard as I feel it could have but it really felt like they were trying it's not a great horror movie but with how low the bar is for the genre the banana splits is a lot better than some of the crap that's pumped into theatres like there is no cheap jump scares that I can remember good thing too you wouldn't want the original banana splits fandom to have a heart attack in their retirement homes I enjoyed how straight this premise was played it wasn't overly meta or winking of the camera also some thought went into the production at least everyone's wardrobe was yellow and orange to match the creatures the camerawork was standard but a few shots felt like the director actually had a vision I personally enjoyed how claustrophobic this short ball pit sequence felt it made me want to check out what else the cast and crew have done the writers seem to be a duo who've worked together on RL Stine's the haunting hour and Randy Cunningham cunning face while the director works second unit on Syfy's channel zero whatever a second unit director does I think they just picked photos of buildings or whatever I'm curious what they'll do next I hope they'll have better resources next time because the acting can get pretty bad even the kids are better actors than some of the adults here hey the big issue to me is these evil robots do not feel heavy or mechanical it's pretty cheap I know it's a TV movie but that saw clearly it's just some tin foil but possibly the most repulsive thing about the movie is the title logo oh hang on I'm a graphic designer I can fix this ah that's better much easier on the eyes despite all that it has some brutal a skills this is gonna be a movie I'm gonna recommend to people but let's get into some conspiracies when this reboot was announced a lot of comparisons were made to the game five nights at Freddy's a PC game where you monitor security cameras in a chuck-e-cheese type place you keep the evil animatronics in check or else they'll yell at you for doing a bad job I think that's what it's about I apologize for not understanding I don't play sheeted games I play good games like Cocteau Jojen back-alley brutal on OG xbox in 2015 WB announced they'll be turning that into a movie with Monster House director Gil Keenan a love Monster House and the animatronics he posted about look pretty menacing but due to creative differences Warner Brothers and his directors lost the rights instead Blum House Studios got a hold of them and hired director Chris Columbus you'll know him as the writer of gremlins 1 & 2 while also directing home alone 1 & 2 and Harry Potter 1 & 2 damn is he also making the next half-life game the movie has been stuck in development hell as the last update was from 2018 the game's creator Scott Cawthon finished a script that the director and producers liked but Scott decided he wasn't satisfied and wanted to start all over I just throw that [ __ ] to the trash [ __ ] it Tippy's de Blum house is still working on that damn movie while WB no longer has any rights to it but a they can still make a similar movie with the banana splits so is this a knockoff or an unused five-night script rebranded like some people are theorizing well given Syfy's track record i'm guessing it's just a knockoff I'm so excited to talk to you guys how did this project get greenlight you know you know what this is one of those weird ones that every so often you know this like they come to you they say hey we want to do this banana splits horror movie and we said we get it a hundred percent they go great go cuz we got to go we got to make it now and that's the most exciting way to make any kind of movie is you know you know have to think too much about it you just go for it writing process it was crazy like just bang didn't know it was fast and you know we knew that they were gearing up they were really excited about this idea [Music] the banana splits is a low-budget slasher movie that feels like genuine effort was put into it it's not great but it gets pretty freakin crazy this becomes Syfy's next sharknado with a line of sequels I'd be so up for that I just really want your brother's birthday to be perfect we're gonna have so much fun don't know we'll be back in a jiffy they tuned for more of the bananas twist brought to you by Kellogg to get more nourishment flavor we interrupt this program for a news update with legal just go to the music the banana splits on boomerang from the Cartoon Network it's all coming back to you [Music]", "9Dr5t_fIiyM": "hello and welcome to my kitchen at home and to another DIY coach mo video and today I'm gonna make a really tasty cupcake this is gonna be a banana-split cupcake now if you've ever been to our shop you'll know that we do these occasionally but actually I am mixing it up a little bit and it's not gonna be quite the same as it is in the shot the shot one has a banana caramel inside and I'll put a link to a recipe that you do want to use that this is going to be kind more straightforward banana split recipe starting with as a banana sponge of course so I have in my freezer about 30-40 black bananas I'll show you a little oh they're really really disgusting this is what they look like when they've been out of the freezer for a little while and they are kind of minging even though they look really really gross and black and slug-like and they make the tastiest banana flavor because they had time for the sugar too and I don't know what happens for the sugar the sugar can do that thing in the case they make it super banana II I'm going to use a really fresh under ripe banana you don't get that like punchy banana flavor that you do when you use a brown or a black one so that is why I keep gross bananas in my freezer so perfect excuse to bake some cakes so I'm going to start with an my butter I've got 125 grams of butter stuff already I'm gonna whack that in the freezer it's not very that it's a mixer I also about 140 grams of self-raising flour which i've already sifted i'm going to put that in along a long way a hundred grams of caster sugar and to give it a bit more gonna be caramelized flavor I'm going to put 15 grams of dogs or brown sugar in there as well and half a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda as well thank you now comes the banana bit so I'm going to get my grace like bananas and a fork and just mash them all up until it's all kind of broken up and it's kind of sloppy liquid like a messy I mean you know you guys know what banana looks like magicka you can describe it to you it already smells really banana it smells like banana milkshake and once you're satisfied whack that in with the rest of the ingredients and then crack in two large free-range eggs I get that going on a low speed to start with and then increase the speed to medium and then just beat that for about a minute once is that a couple of minutes sichting with all the baton stuff in it then he took just a tablespoon of milk and if you want to put vanilla extract in at this point you can I find that it kind of detracts from the banana flavor and it feels not evening very white bananas unlike many them you might find it's between your honor we went for the Milky aqua speed up again new medium and beat it another 30 seconds and that is ready so paddle off with all my butter lovely and combined I'm going to now just pop it into my cupcake cases I've already got my tin lined up per usual with 12 cupcake cases and I'm just going to distribute that evenly among all 12 holes and all my bacteria I'm just now going to take these at 170 degrees C for 20 to 20 minutes and I kicked her out the oven and they're cooling down and meanwhile I'm going to get on with making summer buttercream and I'm actually going to use Swiss meringue buttercream for this just because it goes so lovely and pale and silky and I think it'll look really nice because obviously with banana split like the real thing you'd get whipped cream on it so I want to make it like look kind of like whipped cream I guess and also it's just a really tasty recipe and I like making it as well because quite often I run out of icing sugar in the house but I've always got sugar and eggs and butter always I'm a baker and I think sugar this is one of those things I'm like oh god has run out so it's really good to pin to kind of fall upon my Swiss meringue buttercream recipe in those times and that is what I'm doing today not that I have run out obviously complete professional but I'm going to make my system iron buttercream and to start with I've got a heat proof Bowl here and that's got my sugar in it and I'm also going to add the whites of two large free-range eggs and what I'm going to do with those is put them on to you a fan Marie which is a pan of simmering water and then using my West I'm just gonna stir it until all the grains have dissolve now that all my sugar is dissolve I'm going to just transfer it into my big stand mixer and I've got the balloon whisk attachment I also made sure that I cleaned all of this equipment anything that was going to have egg white in it I cleaned it all with vinegar just beforehand so that it to make sure it beat that nothing white so now I'm going to whisk this on a high speed for about ten or fifteen minutes until the bone is completely cool and it should have whipped up quite considerably by that point [Music] but my egg-white are lovely and fluffy and stiff so now it's time to add the butter and I have 200 grams of SuperDuper soft butter this butter needs to be very very soft if you don't want your egg whites to work too hard to incorporate it so it needs to be really squishy so make sure you leave it somewhere warm in advance room temperature is different for everyone depending on what your rooms like so just make sure it's like totally spreadable like you can imagine spreading it on the most delicate bread and it not having any trouble at all so I've got 200 grams I'm going to add this a little piece at a time while the mix is still going [Music] my box is in and it is gone really silky now what I didn't show you because I didn't have the camera on at this point it's that actually my bowl had a little bit of residual heat which I hadn't felt and so what happened was my butter and what my buttercream just started getting really loose and this happens from time to time a lot of people ask me about this and on the comments box in my Swiss meringue buttercream video and basically you can do one of two things you can either put your bowl in the fridge to cool down obviously but actually what quite often work is unless you're really in a hot climate and it's just to whack the speed up to absolute max and for some reason then it just kind of comes together after a couple of minutes so don't despair if you put all your butter in and it's gone really super sloppy just whack the speed up the have patience all put your bowl in fridge for just a few minutes bring it back whip it up and it should come around very quickly my buttercream is ready I'm just going to flavor it with a bit of vanilla extract I'm only going to put in quarter of a teaspoon and then I'm going to give that a good mix and then I'll be ready and that's odd so I'm gonna clear the decks put this into a piping bag or ready to decorate my cakes there's still a tiny bit warm so but a few things I can get on with and then I'll be back to decorate so it is time guys I'm gonna build these banana split cupcakes and they're gonna kind of resemble banana split sort of let's say are we go so I've got my lovely sponges I forgot my Swiss mocha buttercream in a piping bag and I've got a closed star nozzle in now because I want this to be really really Ripley and whippy and have lots of nice ledges for and other things to fit on because I've got some melted chocolate and some colorful sprinkles and then the piercer remove the stalls which is the classic cocktail cherry now these things are fluorescent pink for some reason not quite sure how that happens in nature but we'll you know we'll get over it and they are you know while they're kind of a little bit dubious in terms of the naturalness of them they are really tasty and they're really classic on a sort of 18th banana split so I'm just gonna put my buttercream on give it a drizzle give it a sprinkle top it with a cherry [Music] and there they are delicious little banana split almost forgot what they were called but nothing split cupcakes banana sponge with vanilla Swiss meringue buttercream a drizzle of chocolate and a very chintzy cocktail cherry on the top and these looks so so sweet now if you want to fill them with banana caramel like we do in the shop then you can click on the link down below I'll put the link to the recipe for my banana caramel down there and all you can fill it with whipped cream that's also good there's lots of things you can do with this you could even member called strawberry jam through it you know some bananas that such will be ice cream on them so there's a lots and lots of things you can do but obviously these are my version today based on what I had in my cupboards frankly and I hope you enjoyed this recipe and I hope you give it a go please give it the thumbs up and comment below if you've made it and please hashtag cupcake Gemma if you take a picture of your work on Instagram so that I can check it out and if you haven't checked out my merch please go and do that get yourself something

be a problem hey how's the banana split is it good i haven't tried it yet oh it's so good it's delicious i don't think even chica couldn't make desserts like this we're we're finally going to have customers we could help you brandon freddy what's going on we need to get out of here we need to get out of here grab all the stuff [Music] illegal what happened oh nothing nothing happened don't you

out of your sight uh freddy freddy freddy are you back back hey freddie it's me it's me take it easy freddy what what happened i think that thing is evil his eyes started glowing red and he he just started walking towards me menacingly and ran away screaming i did see him come out of your room looking a little weird i um i don't know what to do but he seems so nice and he makes a killer banana split so just because he seems nice doesn't mean he is nice oh you're right and you know what freddy if you're uncomfortable with him being here i'll kick him out thinks that should have been the what we did earlier but yeah no don't worry freddie i i'm i'm a good person i care about my friends hey fleegle oh hey buddy i was just about to come in here and say hello how you doing how are you doing yeah so uh we gotta talk uh here we'll do it in private so no one else can overhear oh wow what a snazzy room oh this is yeah oh that must be a sicko though he's got some yeah uh fleegle listen uh i don't think everyone here is comfortable with you being here are we not are we not jiving guys here how about this how about i i have a personality adjuster in the back of my head if i'm being a little bit too much all you have to do is uh grab a pipe wrench and whack me on the back of the head adjust my personality right the way you like it buddy okay here you just that's all you gotta do that seems that seems a little excessive uh gold hard though uh okay uh so just if you hit too hard the things could get out of hand okay i'm telling you just just a little medium medium hardness to me medium okay got it uh here we go oh hey how do you feel buddy you feel adjusted oh wow i feel so much better thank you so much mike i appreciate it all that stupid personality has been taking me over for so long you finally let me out all the way oh mike you've done did it now legal i think this is i can't wait to banana split you in half get over it this might be a bad time to say you're fired yeah you're kind of creepy and this actually made it way worse and i think you should leave and you should never come back again but all i ever wanted was a pizzeria to make banana split sport well i'm sure there's places down the street you could go to you don't have to be here necessarily do you okay well on my way out do you mind if i give you one last parting gift oh you know what sure fleegle it's for the best what do you what do you got okay well i i i just wanted to say good riddance what are you doing what's wrong with you watch out boy what mike you okay yeah he he he tried to hurt me what's wrong with him i told you he was bad i'm sorry well this is why we shouldn't replace each other mike you're right also we should probably take down all those flyers we put out around town and the other town and i don't want any other crazies coming by yeah oh man he was he's really scary also you're really scary why'd you start wearing that again that's i don't like it you're kind of freaking me out i know it's your battle mode or whatever but it's very defense okay you know what that makes sense you know what i'm gonna do what i should have did earlier i'm gonna lock the front door we don't have to worry about any fleegles any anything else weird coming in there we go door is locked and everything is a-okay all right well i guess we start fixing that ball pit huh [Music] so you", "QxOcihIIggk": "Oh coming up he's got to soften him up taking his back throw a couple of hooks in right here here's one Wow he's go kiss all you my gopher but at his split I haven't seen a bit out of split since college wrestling Danny Holmes he's sensing it he's looking he looks concerned though Mike knocking get it it doesn't matter it's a banana split wow he's not gonna pin it with a banana split that's it that's it he caught him in it people have been on the split baby but what happened did he tap yes he did he tap running he tapped I've never seen anybody tapping bananas why", "_6KzxxI1IeY": "what is going on guys it is benicar291 here and today for you guys i will be building another custom mechanical keyboard so this keyboard is a tofu so it is more on a budget side for customs even though is considered budget for customs that still means it costs a lot of money it's an e-white tofu with banana split which are jwk linears but they have a little bit of a different mold those are lubed with 205 grid zero and filmed with tx keyboards film so yeah let's get right on into the build all right guys so here it is here we have the keycaps um keyboard switches uh this is like the plate pcb and then we got the stabs right here i'm actually going to set the keycaps aside we will see those towards the end of the build but let's open up this box so obviously it's a tofu from kbdfan uh let's open it up we went with a polycarbonate plate so very flexible and bendy uh so be a nice soft typing experience and then in here uh here is the pcb uh we went with a dz60 pcb right here it's a very simple pcb with a little bit of rgb underglow as you guys can see um yeah it's a very simple plain uh pcb we'll be doing some soldering of course and yeah the dz60 from kvd fans set this aside and then we have like bump-ons and screws and stuff nothing really too interesting right here and then the most important part that you guys have been waiting for it is the keyboard itself here it is an eat white tofu so normal tofu is 88 uh e e-white adds an extra 20 just for the coding and stuff but i have to say it looks really nice um it's gonna sound the same as any other tofu though uh i might add some foam in here like some of this packaging foam that we have right here nice little budget way if you want to add fun to your tofu you can just use the phone that comes packaged with but yeah let's get straight on into the build all right yeah so now we are on the above head cam as you guys can see um and i'm actually going to be doing the first step as tuning these stabs that we have here this is not going to be a full tutorial but i will go through the process a little bit but yeah this won't be a full tutorial but the first thing we're going to do is we're going to open all these tabs so these are just gmk style we are going to lube and clip these uh so pretty common once i get all of these taken apart i will show you guys what the lubing looks like and what the clipping looks like just give you guys a little taste of it i'm not going to go through all of it just because it takes a long time all right guys so i separated it out into the wires the sliders are stem and then the housings and what we're going to do is we're going to clip first so you're going to take your stem here and you can see these little fang things that kind of poke out at the end there and all we're going to do is clip them out so we're going to clip this one that books out and then this one that pokes out um and then that's all for clipping uh you just do it to all of the stems or sliders whatever you want to call them so yeah i'm going gonna do one and i will show you guys the looping process all right guys so all of it has been clipped as you guys can see here the scraps and then all of these are nice and flush and flat uh now we're gonna be lubing it so all i'm gonna do is take a brush and this the housing of the slab um i have some 205 grid zero over here we're going to get a nice amount on your brush and then you're just going to want to wipe inside the housing and then you're going to want to loop your housing you can do one or the other since it is technically the same area being contacted but i just like to do a little layer on both instead of doing a lot so just like that that's actually a lot for the slider take a little bit off and then you're going to want to find the side with two holes right there and then that goes into the front of the stack repeat that process for all of them and then we will come back when it's time to loop the wires so i finished looping up the sliders and housings and now we're going to move on to the wire so for the wire i'm just going to take my brush again get a generous amount of 205 on it and just put it on there so you just want to spread it out evenly make sure you have enough on there because this is where most of the rattle comes from uh so we're just going to put a nice amount on there and then we're going to put it into the housing you're just going to put it into the housing into the front let that focus just like this make sure it is in the bottom hole of the slider and then you can just clip it in just like that and then that is one side done and then you repeat for the other side and do that for all the stabs that you will use all right guys so here it is i actually didn't record the testing process of the steps or soldering just because it takes a long time but here it is all soldered in it's all good all working i tested it out um and i did test the pcb before soldering i just did it off camera uh make sure you always test your pcb it's always a good thing to do now i actually need to change the layout because in a qmk what's actually happening is these ones are actually arrow keys so i need to fix that um i'll do that and then i will come back all right guys so this is the finished product um it's a little bit of rgb on the globe we can turn that off of course uh but it looks really good i definitely like the ninja style keycaps almost side print obviously um i think it looks really good there are some inconsistencies for example that w is very thick but i mean it sounds really good so we're gonna give you a sound test right now all right so hopefully you guys enjoyed that sound test honestly it sounds pretty good and like i said this is a tofu build so it's a pretty beginner entry level build but at the same time it's still really expensive and i have been wanting to do like a sub 150 700 custom keyboard build let me know if you guys would want to see something like that in the comments down below i feel like it would be pretty cool to do a really budget friendly you know like ducky one two mini price custom keyboard but yeah hopefully you guys enjoyed that video i actually already shipped out that keyboard you gotta get those fast turnaround times you guys already know but yeah that keyboard is already shipped out so i don't have it with me anymore but yeah hopefully you guys enjoyed this video if you did comment down below some other video ideas comment what i can add to my setup for real to my dream gaming setup and all that good stuff make sure you guys like the video make sure you sub hopefully you guys are all having a great day stay safe peace", "_RP-JIeaT-Y": "[Applause] [Music] foreign it's my birthday

AARON SANCHEZ: Yes.\nThis is not on my wish list. Let me tell you,\nanything for the kids. [laughter]", "nBgQ7utEWyo": "hey everybody welcome back to the sugar geeks show I'm Liz Merrick today we are making a banana split cake so good I'm using my chocolate vanilla and banana cake recipe to make this baby and we're adding some delicious toppings like maraschino cherries a ganache drip sprinkles it's gonna be amazing so let's go ahead and get started it was really fun researching what goes into a banana split because there actually is a certain type of ingredients that go into a traditional banana split so you've got a course your bananas one scoop of vanilla ice cream one scoop of chocolate and one scoop of strawberry and then it's chopped with either a chocolate fudge or a ganache sprinkled with some chopped peanuts and maraschino cherries so how do you take those traditional ingredients and make it into a cake well first we start it off with a delicious and moist chocolate cake our vanilla cake and instead of using fresh bananas we're using my banana cake recipe which tastes like fresh bananas seriously is so amazing and instead of using fresh strawberries I went ahead and filled my cake with strawberry buttercream made with strawberry puree it tastes delicious and just kind of like ice cream and then I frost through the whole thing and my easy buttercream which acts sort of as the whipped cream or ice cream you could use stabilized whipped cream if you wanted to that recipes on my website but I'm using easy buttercream because it's a little bit more stable I have my chocolate 5 ounces of chocolate and 5 ounces of hot cream combined together ready to go you can do a 2 to 1 ratio or I have actually slightly more cream than a normal 2 to 1 ratio actually have 7 ounces of chocolate and 5 ounces of cream which is way too much for what we're using but that's just what I used and then after you get this smooth and creamy you want to let it cool down to until it feels almost room-temperature again otherwise it's gonna be too runny when it gets on to your cake so I'm just gonna mix this up get it smooth and then let it sit while my ganache is cooling down I'm gonna go ahead and put a layer of butter cream around the base help seal it to the board and it also covers up that little cardboard and then I'm just gonna use my finger to just wipe away the excess little trick and then you want to make sure that your cake is nice and cold before you do your drip it helps keep the drips from going too far down the cake and set that ganache really quickly so I'm gonna put this in the fridge so our cake is chilled and I'm gonna go ahead and put some sprinkles around the base of this guy and I'm gonna be using some fancy sprinkles just some rainbow jimmies it's kind of like the classic sundae you know ice cream sundae to style I'm gonna put some parchment paper inside a baking sheet or a pan or something to kind of keep the sprinkles from going everywhere pour these into a little Bowl and I'm gonna take my cake and hold it in my left hand and then take my right hand and just kind of push them up against the bottom like that and get them to stick and the excess falls back into the bowl or all over your parchment it's kind of the excess you can put your sprinkles back in the bottle okay so now we can do our drip and our chocolate ganache has cooled down quite a bit it's it's a you know got this kind of like thick paint consistency which is pretty much what we want and it's really important to pay attention to the consistency of your ganache before you do the drip and that's kind of like the thing that people struggle with the most if your ganache is too thick or too cold you end up having drips that look kind of like wax or like thick paint and they're not very pretty they don't blend together they don't go over the edges very smoothly and if it's too thin or watery they'll just drip all the way down the sides of your cake they look almost transparent because they're too thin and so you know we don't want we don't want to have that happen either so like your ganache drip you know the actual consistency of it is really important too so this is a chocolate ganache made with cream and chocolate and you can also use something called water ganache which is on my website should the geek show calm and that is using something like candy melts like wafers or something and combining it with water instead of cream and it creates a really great drip and it's not is you know in my opinion it's not as finicky as ganache so it's kind of like my foolproof one but we're learning how to make a real ganache drip this time around so this is what you do if you have chocolate on hand I'm gonna place my ganache into a piping bag I always use a piping bag or you could use like a squeeze bottle to get your drips really perfect otherwise if you try to use a spoon you're gonna have too much chocolate going over the edge and it's gonna look really messy and I can feel this ganache it's you know very very slightly warm still but mostly cooled down if yours ends up getting too cold you can just pop it in the microwave for 10-15 seconds until it's liquid again but not warm I'm going to trim off the tip not too big and I'm gonna do a test drip to see if this is gonna set up the way that I want it to my cake has been chilling in the fridge so it's nice and cold I'm just gonna come down and see where that stops if it's too loose it's gonna drip all the way down if it's too thick it's not going to drip at all so you want it to stop basically where it has stopped and that's a good sign that our ganache is at the right temperature and it's ready to pipe so you always want to do your test strip because it's easy to clean up one drip and you know warm it up or cool it down or thin out your ganache but it's really hard to clean off the ganache of an entire cake and then when you're making your drip what I like to do is alternate with a big squeeze and then a small squeeze big squeeze small squeeze and that makes a more uniform looking drip so we have like a big ski squeeze and then come over and do a small one and then a big one it's okay if you don't do absolutely perfect but to me this is like that perfect sundae chocolate sundae banana split look beautiful see the drips are alternating some of them are longer some of them are shorter they because the cake is chilled it stops them from dripping before they get all the way down to the bottom and that's basically a perfect ganache a drip now if you wanted to you can fill the inside with chocolate so I just come around with my piping bag just to fill in that Center there some people just drip on the outside edge totally okay and then you can just take a spoon or a little spatula and just kind of fill in any little holes but it should just kind of run straight together so your leftover ganache if you have any you can just put this in a small container and keep it in the refrigerator and rewarm it as you need it for other drips or things you can freeze it if you want to but it lasts for a very long time so it's kind of nice to always have some ganache on hand for every time you need to do at your kitchen so now moving on to the second part of our design I'm going to be putting some little swirls of buttercream on top of the cake and this is kind of mimicking the look of like whipped cream that you would have on top of a banana split so I'm using a star tip and I'm just going to put a nice healthy dollop of whipped cream a swirl right here towards the edge nice big swirl then I have some chopped peanuts one of the traditional things that goes on top of a banana split I'm just gonna put that kind of around the edge obviously you can totally leave this off especially if you're allergic to peanuts a couple more sprinkles put around that top edge you can't have too many sprinkles ever and then to top it all off I'm gonna put some maraschino cherries in here maraschino cherries is like a canned cherry that's I think it's like an American thing but it's totally like a quintessential topping for any banana split so I like to get the ones that have the stems on them wipe off blot the excess juice especially in whipped cream the juice can kind of like make it watery and stained looking if you want to just kind of dry off that little cherry and then you stick that right in the little dollop it it looks so cute it's like so adorable I can't even deal okay our banana split drip cake is complete if that is not an iconic looking drip cake I do not know what is I love how the chocolate drip looks on top of the buttercream with a little maraschino cherries and the sprinkle it's adorable absolutely adorable hopefully you guys have enjoyed learning how to make a chocolate ganache drip cake

it's birthday time well mike willy's wonderland let us down a rabbit hole of a very small and very specific sub-genre of films yes which is movies that are ripping off the success and popularity of the video game five nights at freddy's right which in turn is a reference to showbiz pizza well tucked in between there's the 2008 documentary the rock rockifier explosion yes which we have conveniently have a dvd copy of right here there it is this documentary came out yeah like you said 2008 uh let's look at the timeline okay i'm i i don't know anything about five nights at freddy's i watched the video game trailer for it on youtube because you told me what it was but i think all this i did a little timeline and i think all this started with this yeah this uh of course it started with this documentary's about weirdos who like to purchase the leftover um showbiz pizza bear band members and restore them yeah maybe for people that don't even know what the [ __ ] that is just a little back story it was a pizza and game place for children in the 80s showbiz pizza place with over 60 electronic games pizza bake fresh every day and the stage show extravaganza on three stages uh spun off into chuck e cheese which chugga chu's bought them out chucky cheese bought them out uh did chuck e cheese go out of business last year i think they went bankrupt last year don't know i wouldn't doubt it due to the pandemic yeah i'm surprised they were still around yeah showbiz pizza place uh i don't know where it was all located certainly the midwest yeah i think down south a little i went there i had birthday parties there as a little kid maybe birthday party yeah um as as seen in the famous rich evans photo although i probably have childhood birthday photos from there but my mother didn't put a shirt on me that said [ __ ] the birthday boy um uh she knows proper comma usage um but yeah you you would there would be a big table there's the party room right there's the game room yes and then there's the party room and the party room would have three to twelve large tables and at the head of the table was a king's chair and that's where you would sit if you were the birthday boy or girl right and you would get a little crown i think and um although your friends would come and there would be tape presents in the middle of the table and you go play games you run back and forth eat pizza and then of course the highlight was when billy bob the bear and his band would perform the rockefeller explosion yes and it would happen i don't know every 15 minutes or something and then and you know even as a kid you thought it was kind of strange and not magical that was like five no i thought it was i thought the animatronics were neat i didn't know go to showbiz i went to chuck e cheese um but it was just fun to watch these robots but i didn't think they were like i didn't believe them as being real i don't know if any kid did maybe two and under okay i think once you hit three that's when the magic wears off when you realize there's something horribly wrong then then you want to ignore the band and just go play in the ball pits yeah and you know it's more like a background thing it wasn't like the kids all ran up to the stage and danced and stuff it was just sort of like a cute thing that happened in the background so um i i wouldn't want to judge any grown adults love of their childhood or billy bob the singing bear but to each his own yes but before before this documentary i don't know if it was that widely known to people other than people that were nostalgic for it when they were a small child but there weren't a lot of people talking about showbiz pizza or the rock of fire explosion band right this documentary came out and then a couple years later unrelated we introduced the world to the infamous dick the birthday boy picture mike discovered this old photo from rich's birthday and so we as a present we have painstakingly uh recreated this lovely shirt that he's wearing and we're gonna give it to him as a birthday slash halloween episode gift did you like steal my old family photographs is there like an album of mine in your possession this is creepy which i discovered in a pile of trash in 2001 or two okay uh and it was rich was throwing out family photos a lot of people know the story yeah but he was throwing out family photos and there's just piles of polaroids from his childhood i was throwing in the trash so i grabbed them and i saved them and one of them was the dick the birthday boy photo now famous that's that's uh gone on to be more popular than us there are people that have no idea that this is even connected to us and probably think our episode from 2013 is a reference to this but no it did not exist on the internet before this right because this is actually rich evans that's actually not a lie yes it is a real true picture of rich evans as dick the birthday boy and it has been featured on awkward family photos cursed images uh famously the ellen show yes okay i'm sorry but i cannot take my eyes off the birthday boy before ellen was canceled back before ellen got cancelled and julia roberts back before she got cancelled she said um i i worked at showbiz pizza and um so people think that that's her in the costume yeah some intern at ellen just googled showbiz pizza bear it's the first image that shows up so they just used it and it's fine now people think that the lore is that julia roberts is next to rich evans in this photo it's not true that's not julia roberts right julia roberts i think grew up in the south yeah like georgia georgia yeah so uh odds that she lived up in the chicagoland area for a brief moment of time while working at shoba's pizza then moved back down are highly improbable yes you know who is in that costume though meg ryan [Laughter] flash forward one year later to 2014 uh five nights at freddy's the video game is made and there begins a tangled tale of rights and movies and everything else because it becomes kind of messy after that and two films emerged from the muck one being willie's wonderland and one being the banana splits movie which has its own history because banana splits was a hanna-barbera cartoon in like the 60s no not a cartoon it was a live action it was live action that introduced cartoons the only thing i i like that's i don't even know anything about it other than the theme song like everybody knows that yeah um it sort of i mean it predates us oh yeah by a long shot it was 19 it ran from 68 to 70. it was brief they were they were people in costumes that ran around they drove the little car all that kind of stuff yeah and um and and then it was like interspersed with cartoons okay the costumes were made by sid and marty croft creators of puppets and i think they did hr puff and stuff and you know that that was their thing those weird psychedelic uh guy in costume shows that was like a late 60s to late 70s kind of thing jimmy what happened to you why are you walking that way [Music] but with banana splits uh that was like a property that some studio owned wasn't doing anything with because what do you do with them so then someone says oh hey this five nights at freddy's thing is popular let's let's we have this property let's just make a horror movie based on this old property because it's kind of like the fried knights of freddy's right it's it's a very bizarre history there there was a mention also that there was a comic book crossover with the the um the banana splits gang and the suicide squad i mean there's this like sort of bizarre history with with these characters and i think at one point it it passed hands from hannah barbera to warner brothers and then i think that's who put out the movie right yeah and then they're the ones and who said sure let's do this and we'll make it really cheap we'll make it really cheap but also the script for this banana splits movie is supposedly purportedly taken from a rejected script for the freddie five nights at freddy's uh movie okay which is why they're robots ah i mean on the tv show they were just things right you know like living creatures living creatures that but but they they're robots in this i assume they just did that because they wanted to make it closer to five nights at freddy's which is its own movie that's been in development hell for years supposedly it's coming out shooting this year coming out in like another year or two which is well after the popularity of the video game has wore off can we also briefly mention there's a five minute short on hulu called the hug it's far better than either of these two features or better one it gets to the point real quick it doesn't take up a lot of your time but well so aesthetically it's much better yeah it's that's well we'll start talking about these movies now willie's wonderland is [ __ ] awful the band splits movie is not as awful and then the hug the five minute short using that premise of evil animatronic kids show mascots is the one that nails that the best right they shot it in what looks like probably a real chuck e cheese or if it's a set it's a damn good set but they have the different areas all set up and it looks it looks uh like a believable location which is already a notch above willy's wonderland which is just like a square set where you have the dining area and there's a ball pit right next to it in the same room and it doesn't feel like a believable place at all and that's the entire premise of your movie yeah if you want to watch uh willie's wonderland just watch the hug because it has the exact same storyline there's a there's a nasty little kid in the hug who gets what he deserves because gosh darn it he cheated at skee-ball so he's a little bastard he's throwing he's put he's climbed on the skee-ball machine and he's throwing the balls in the top slot and he's getting all the tickets and he it's his birthday god damn it he wants to see and he so he steals the guy the janitor's keys or the manager or whatever and the manager knows the secret yeah he says don't go behind the curtain the the bear or whatever it is taking a break right and the kid sneaks back there and he gets what he deserves and he knows the secret of the bear which is it is the bear costume he looks exactly like billy bob yeah it's just a facade for like a monster or a demon underneath and it eats the child great got it it's perfect for a five-minute short yes it did just what it needed to do and then the cost of monster looks good the yeah uh it was designed by stupid buddy studios oh you did some research well i looked in the credits the credits were rolling i was watching the credits and i recognized stupid buddy and i'm like why is that familiar that they do the uh stop motion and stuff for um the seth green show what is it no yeah so i think they do like effects and props and uh makeup and whatnot so it's effective like the way the the the fake face kind of falls off when there's the demon face underneath yeah it's perfect for what this is yeah so i don't know why that was made it said it was part of hulu ween short films and it was it like a like a hey we want to direct the five nights at freddy's yeah here's our thing we made you know it was one of those kind of things who knows when they did the uh didn't they do like a test version of the deadpool they did a scene from deadpool and that's what ended up getting made into the movie right yeah yeah you're right you're right about that jay i don't know we're going to kind of talk about both films yes we'll compare them yeah willie's wonderland is closer to the concept of five nights at freddy's which is you have to survive overnight in this freddy's place uh with these evil mascots yes and that's the premise of willy's wonderland nicolas cage is playing kind of like the man with no name he's passing through town he's got a western vibe he doesn't talk through the whole movie uh and the local townspeople his tires go out on his car they say stay overnight in willie's wonderland clean the place up and we'll fix your car for free so he has to stay overnight with these evil animatronic characters who he very easily defeats in one scene after the other that is very repetitive and [ __ ] boring and and visually disgusting yeah and and not in a good way no you want your twisted showbiz pizza place to look great grungy and gross and disgusting but this is ugly in a low budgety kind of way yeah well like i said the room there's like a side room that they call the game room even though it doesn't have hardly any games in it right but the main room is there's the stage which isn't a stage it's just one side of the room and then there's the tables where people sit to eat and then the ball pit is right there yeah and it's just like they just slap things together like hey we gotta have a ball pit that's right there and the puppets they look evil from the beginning you need that and that's one thing i'll say about the banana splits movie is you need that contrast of cutesy colorful kids characters that then do evil things right yeah there's that there's that one part i think where oh no that was the hug he grabs the he he once he starts hugging the little kid and then the eyes roll back and they're blank white oh yeah come back and they're like bloodshot disgusting and it takes its time to build that up yeah in in uh willie's wonderland nicholas cage is cleaning the bathroom and then the big like ape character is just behind him and he just immediately starts fighting him without any reaction to what's happening i mean i guess they're going for that man with no name stoic silent character but in the context of this movie it doesn't work clint eastwood talked okay you can get away with not talking but i was thinking especially after that first that bathroom fight is like you need like a bruce campbell in this role i was reminded a lot of the evil dead movies that's clearly like an influence [Music] but you need someone who is maybe like thinks of himself as a badass or like a braggart but then is a complete buffoon in reality yeah you you need some sort of change in emotion or at least some sort of reaction to how bizarre what's happening is and nicolas cage he beats up that monster very easily and then this goes right back to cleaning which i think is supposed to be [Music] [Music] funny [Music] it gives you nothing to latch on to in the movie well it's it's possibly one of the worst scripts i've seen turned into a movie yeah it's it's indescribably bad like uncreative very uncreative um and like you said with the nicholas cage character you need he either he's he's driving around he he wants a sports car this is nicholas cage's writer or requests for for being in the movie right sure i don't want to say any lines i don't want to learn [ __ ] dialogue for this [ __ ] yes exactly and it says nicholas cage had i i read some facts he was like a producer on the movie that's that's where you get will you get money later yeah if you just throw your name on it as a producer um that's [ __ ] he didn't do a single thing um but he he it said nicholas cage always wanted to star in a in a no dialogue horror film or you know it's like no no this isn't it and that's a lie he just didn't want to memorize lines and he said give me a sports car drive around and make me look awesome make me look awesome um give me the best hair dye around the best plugs and use that that computer to make my face look less old and and oh and he also wanted to excessively drink beer [Music] which that's not beer mike it's soda it's an energy drink i thought there was going to be a payoff to that here's here's the he's constantly drinking after the whole movie i was like that's going to lead to something an epic piss no no here's here's here's the logic here's the logic and the script for that jeff okay right right one there's two two points of logic to have him constantly drinking energy drinks at timed intervals one no human on earth would agree to clean a nasty old building yeah all night long without sleep right sure most people sleep that's true okay so there's one why we're talking about nicolas i'm talking about his character not him personally um unless he's a robot or you know an alien or something he needs to sleep no one's going to say yeah okay well i'm going to work for a couple hours but you know once it gets dark i'm just gonna go to sleep and i'll meet you in the morning i'm not cleaning every square inch of this nasty warehouse to fix my [ __ ] flat tire right most people are reasonable and they need to sleep two he defeats these robots which which have no or creatures demons what they're possessed whatever they're possessed by the spirits of dead serial killers that opened the restaurant originally yes yes and worship satan in worship satan uh so they're possessed right and but they have no ability to kill you but they've had that ability to kill other people for years yeah yeah the town is all in on it and they give this thing out of towners as sacrifices so nicholas cage seemingly a regular man you know he's not he's not super buff he's not a mma fighter we don't introduce him as that or as a special forces green beret i just got back from [ __ ] afghanistan and i'm looking to whoop some he's just a guy a man with no name clint eastwood character and he defeats these things very easily whacking them with a broom handle and that is because he's amped up on energy drinks that's the reason the energy drinks are there oh god see i thought it was going to turn out that he has some sort of history with these things or connection to him where like he was prepared to fight them and that's why the other people they've killed is because they're caught off guard they're just staying overnight in this place oh my god they came to life and they get killed immediately but he kills them with absolutely no issues and no problems so i thought it was going to turn out that he secretly went there for the purpose of killing them maybe he has a long history of killing demons he just killed his daughter back in the day something anything anything that's part of the problem they kicked him out sure yeah but oh yeah personal vendetta you're expecting way too much i was expecting a story the entirety behind it is wouldn't it be cool if nicolas cage killed showbiz pizza bear and that's what they pitched their movie on yeah so they pitched it to him they said you're gonna be like the drifter that comes through town who's badass and you don't have to say a single line of dialogue that's going to be our gimmick too because cage doesn't speak a single kind of dialogue in the whole movie well wow that's some kind of [ __ ] achievement really no it's not it makes your movie much worse yeah because like you said if he if he was a braggart or had some kind of history like like he was a ex-soldier ex-marine or something like that and then he gets in there and he fights the first billy bob right and and maybe there's some teens in there with him and he's like don't worry i got this and he gets his ass kicked and he gets knocked down a peg like eventually at some point during the movie you know your third act drop when things go bad for your protagonist and they have to work their way out of a problem that occurs in a movie not in this movie but he just beats up one after the other i was shocked at the ending i thought because he finally gets there's like the main character willie and so like we get to the final confrontation with him and i was like okay they're gonna do something special for this fight right and then nicolas cage just beats him with a stick [Music] and then it's over i was stunned at the the laziness of everything involved with the story of the movie right right it was shocking it was shockingly bad the the vagus resemblance of anything screenplay wise is the girl has a backstory of her parents being killed and the the old lady cop rescuing her as a baby or a child or whatever and then so her sole mission in life is to on a nightly basis try to burn down willie's willie's wonderland or whatever how long has she been trying to do this you tried it once and got caught yeah uh how often how hard is it to like gasoline on fire is this after you know 15 years or 10 years is this your first time trying to do it or did you try it the night before have you ever tried to inform anyone outside of the town that this is happening like basic things yeah uh people are missing their last stop was in your town contact the fbi you know yeah but i don't know they say the town has no internet or whatever [ __ ] whatever whatever [ __ ] excuse they can come up with to get away with being as lazy as possible right so so she she wants to try again to burn down the place so she invites five or six of her friends no i'm not it's the truth yeah you are very lucky well maybe you should have a girl mark one of which has a crush on her the boy but he just dies and then everyone just dies it doesn't matter then there's like the the um i don't i'm sure it was a tongue-in-cheek kind of thing where the two teens go off to have sex where it's like a trope yeah and then in the party room in the party room but even though they already know that the monsters are killing people in there it'd be one thing if they weren't away jay it's funny you gotta present it as funny though but it's like the the most pathetic excuse for a sex scene and the most pathetic sex scene everything about it's terrible it's just like they're just like dry humping on the ground and supposing they're having sex just don't even do it do something different do something creative i don't know if this movie was just atrocious i'm sorry and visually it was disgusting the color grading on it everything's just like greenish blue and disgusting looking and like i said you need that contrast with the creatures with the the puppets which was one of the things that was kind of amusing about the banana splits movie which is not a movie i would really recommend but in comparison to willie's wonderland it's a masterpiece oh yeah um but the creatures constantly feel like kids show characters in that and the setup in that is that they're they're robots they're animatronic and their their programming gets [ __ ] up on the last day that they're filming the show ever the show's being canceled and so they start killing people but they're doing it in like over the top violent ways that's kind of fun to watch oh yeah it's kind of disturbing and weird and disgusting i mean oh my god all the different little avenues of the script yeah are just there's actual characters in the script i know there's a family they have a step dad who's a [ __ ] there's the girl that's there with her dad who wants to try and introduce their daughter to to the producers of the show he's like a showbiz parent you have characters you have the the vlogging couple that want to vlog the whole thing the family dynamic is they actually tried like the mother the father died a while ago and so the last 10 years she's been with this other guy remarried he's a dick the little boy you know he's like an [ __ ] to the little boy and the boy has an older brother they're not they're half brothers um and so he's like taking him under his wing you know and then you find out the husband's cheating the spoiler um nobody cares but then you got the the multiple characters that there's a producer lady with the glasses there's paige who's the audience page who kind of has a romance with the older brother i mean there's so much going on it's the most basic of story writing of screenplays but but for that movie it's fine and it's something as opposed to willie's wonderland yeah willie and they set up because they they go there for a taping of the show and they have like almost like a double dare esque obstacle course and it's like ah fun obstacle course you run through slime and all this stuff and then that comes back in the third act where it's like the horror version of that obstacle course it pays off [Music] it's a competent script for what it is yeah and and yeah oh after watching willy's wonderland [ __ ] anything else but um for for what it was trying to do and it made use of all the different like all the characters weren't just evil there's one of the banana splits gang who is good yeah and so there's a little twist there there's just more things going on more to do more set pieces they go to different locations and it takes it seriously enough where it works as camp three chairs for rebecca hip hip hooray like they know it's not serious but they're they're presenting it as serious and it's kind of amusing when you get to the third act and they have like all those children enslaved right and they're making and watch the horror version of the show like that was funny [Music] and the mom has an arc she kind of becomes a badass right there's fun her shirt gets caught for a second and so it just flies off and so she's got the captain picard tank top which turns into that mode yeah they didn't shy away from uh doing good gore effects like the first kill the one of the banana splits grabs like a big lollipop oh yeah i thought oh for sure he's gonna stab him in the ear or the eye with the sharp end of the lollipop but hey hey they're one step ahead of me he sticks the wide end of the lollipop in his mouth and it lodges in its throat in the guy's throat yeah and it's like blood is coming up everywhere and then the the part where the vlogger gets sawed in half and of course all the intestines fall out and it's goofy looking it's not realistic looking um but the deaths are weird like the guy and they're all different yeah the the like the stage dad the uh oh yeah he he gets sprayed in the face with like aerosol and he gets burns all over his face but he still lives and the character's like dancing around him while his head's on fire at first it looked bad but then they had a real appliance that was on yeah there was a composite shot that wasn't great but um so for the rest of the movie that guy's face is horribly burnt and then he's forced to do the the um while his face is burnt and i he once he fell in the goo like the slime like nickelodeon slime could kind of go and i just wanted him to go oh it burns like just like just to make it just more horrific so i laughed quite a bit during um the banana splits movie it gets a gold medal when compared to willie's wonderland which may have been the worst thing i've ever seen yeah yeah and all the the action in willy's wonderland talking about like the pacing of things like so much shaky cam like constant cutting [Music] everything about it is so visually ugly from the color grading to the editing to the lighting of the movie to the cheap ass set your whole movie takes place on that one set make it a good set it's good advice oh what are you looking around for oh i just thought i heard a noise in the back oh my god that whole wall is shaking jesus that doesn't seem right i don't know yeah that's weird it is an old building that's true [Music] and i was confused about nicholas cage between he goes back and forth he kills a creature and then he goes back to cleaning and then he goes into the kitchen where there is for some reason a pinball machine like why is that not in the game room why is he playing this pinball machine in the kitchen and why is he playing it at all again i thought that was a setup for something where there was some reason he was playing it he went to willie's wonderland as a kid and he never defeated it and so now he's back to defeat the machine or something beat his high score he just goes back there and plays it for no reason oh jay it's like you've seen a movie before i mean why have these things in the movie other than you got to fill 90 minutes because nicolas cage beating up these mascots isn't enough uh material for your feature well it was an official willys wonderland pinball machine right why was it in the kitchen i don't know why i was in the kitchen why were there no games in the game room because cause here's why i have answers to all these questions one they knew a guy who custom made pinball machines he custom makes them and so i could make one for you oh cool okay here it is oh wow it's neat where are we going to put it in the game room well we don't have any other games it would be weird if it was just by itself in the game room well maybe it's in the kitchen maybe the like the the the dishwashers use it when they're on their break and we got to use it because i knew a guy who made custom pinball machines okay how about nick cage plays it every now and then in the movie just so we could show close-ups of it yeah because we got a real willy's wonderland okay why don't we fill the game room with tons of games because a third of our budget went to nicholas cage that's why i'd say over half of their budget went to nicolas cage then and and it's really expensive to rent and leave these games here and they want insurance on them because they might get damaged during the production and that's when someone steps in and says but this is the concept for your whole movie sad to say i i'm baffled by the i think it's 60 rotten tomatoes oh my god and then a 78 audience wow they're like a wild ride from start to fit and i'm just like see i hate i hate movies like this where they're like they're trying to sell it as like a new kind of cult movie it's so crazy nicholas cage he's like a human meme and you put him in your movie and you don't have to do any more work than that where people are already sold on the movie they already know they're going to like it based on that and no matter how [ __ ] terrible it is they're just like but it's so crazy because nicholas cage beats up puppets it's like no you have to put some level of creativity into your movie and you know we all have our our guilty pleasures you know i enjoy stupid things here and there but uh i i can just smell smell the lazy and i can i can just feel the the grime all over my body after watching that and and as soon as it started this is how cynical i am i see the car driving yeah our own ultimate movie if you if i drive around in a [ __ ] sports car because i'm nicholas cage i don't drive in anything but a [ __ ] sports car blah blah blah i was in that movie drive angry uh i'll only be in a movie if i would never ever have to take sunglasses off during a [ __ ] sports car and i'm [ __ ] passing a leather jacket [Laughter] so here comes the sports car yeah and i'm i'm counting the seconds of screen time not nicholas cage not nicholas cage man steps out boots hit the ground not in nicolas cage not trunk opens uh shot ends right before resisting not necklace hands reach in grab energy drink not nicolas cage not next mouth we panned up too much we got to bring him in yeah cut bring him out of the trailer he's strong he's strong he's passed out he just has to stand there and not fall down okay fine he's done for the day when i make things even worse this is one of those like uh early access movies that they do now since theaters aren't open to trick you were they charged twenty dollars do not pay money for this do not get fooled ignore the ratings and the reviews trust us it's not wacky and crazy it's one of the worst most boring things i've seen i almost didn't finish it and that's saying a lot for me i watched so much trash the death scenes in um the banana splits movie were far far better yeah each one's different and creative uh the story goes in different areas you know takes some different turns here and there all around much better movies characters grow and change yeah although if you're somebody who grew up in like the early 70s and has like fond memories of the banana splits gang you're probably really confused so bizarre yeah such a bizarre backstory to that movie like this wacky kids show that all the different like incarnations of it yeah but it makes sense that if it was a temporary or an early draft of a script for five nights at freddy's that it makes sense yeah speaking of the robots that's something that neither movie gets right they never feel like animatronic creatures they just feel like guys in suits they do a little bit better in uh banana splits movie occasionally they kind of move like robots yeah yeah they have that walk and they add some sound effects but they're yeah you could tell but willie's wonderland i mean the one there's like the the fairy ballerina one where she just has a head on and then her body is just like human hands they didn't even [ __ ] try right there's a lady running around with that i forgot about that yeah after oh and that whole ending the fairy princess jumps on top of the car blows it up somehow yeah [Music] and it's just like this terrible terrible effect it looks like suburban sasquatch and that's my go-to comparison for lazy plug-in effects [Music] that's the draw of low-budget movies like you look at like old roger corman movies and stuff made in the like when we watch a best of the worst movie when they blow up a car and they really blow it up it's always exciting and it's fun because you say oh they blew up a car and it's always in the middle of the desert yeah or a field which adds to the amusement and this they're in an empty parking lot right yeah buy buy a 600 car get a pyrotechnics guy i guess you got to get a permit and you got to pay money and blah blah blah blah but that's that's the movie these are things you put in a movie to make them interesting this this movie rides the line between movie and scam yeah although a mild recommendation for the banana splits movie even though it's a couple years old now yeah i think it came out last year or the year before but if you're looking for this type of movie that's the go-to one that's yeah if you have to choose yeah until the five nights at freddy's movie comes out if that ever happens it should make a showbiz pizza place horror themed movie an official one yeah who wants the rights to show his pizza anymore uh well uh marshmallow calls chuck e cheese bought them so they must own them i don't know i don't know how that works they won't make a if chuck e cheese is still around i think they went bankrupt though but if they are still around they won't make a chucky cheese horror movie but revive billy bob make a horror film here here's here's here's the big big big money jay oh chucky cheese versus billy bob [Laughter] like freddie versus jason oh that's where the real money is it's true i love it let's do it okay start making some phone calls hello nicholas cage do you like money", "PmNFb6hoPn4": "[Music] child it's my birthday it's all about me celebrate with my friend and my family the tickets in a fade show on tv the best present ever can't wait to see is it just me or does our son seem homo momma kids", "NssaMeyiST0": "use your to get down to hammertown hey trooper middles here i wonder how the show is gonna end does this make me the later now you're late for

for dropping by today we'll be checking out the c3 macho or some call it the banana split switches which are looped and flew some brief feedback on the switches in stock form they were rather smooth as they came lightly looped from the factory as for the sound signature they were rather high pitched especially on the upstroke some did mention that this is caused by its thin upper housing there was very little case wobble even in stock form for this video i have used the version 2 tx films which are 0.01 to 5 millimeter thick i have looped mine with crytox 205 grade 0 and gpl 106 for the stock sprint quick take after lubing the switches are a lot creamier and there is visibly less high pitch noise on the upstroke would definitely recommend lubing the switches if you have them without wasting too much time let's get on with the typing test [Applause] you", "GNYZqyL3EtI": "Hello. I'm Karime Lopez,\nchef at Gucci Osteria, Florence. And today we're going to show you\nwhat we love to cook for us. Welcome. Hello, everyone. So, today\nwe're going to show you a recipe that reminds me a lot of my childhood. And we have one of our members\nof the Gucci Osteria team that is from Spain, so I want to introduce you\nto Paula Requena. She's going to show us\nhow to do churros. BANANA SPLIT CHURROS EGGS - FLOUR CINNAMON - VANILLA - BANANA Okay. Tell us, what are we\ngoing to do today for the churros? What do we do first? First, we're going to make\nthe churro dough, which would be \"impasto\" in Italian. And then we'll make a ganache\nand then we'll make a banana cream. Okay. So for the dough you use flour... Yes, flour... First,\nwe're going to boil the milk, water... -Okay.\n-Milk... cream, water. -So this is...\n-Milk and cream. Milk and cream. -Now water.\n-This is water. Then we add salt and sugar. -Everything together? Okay.\n-Everything together. And the butter. -Everything together.\n-Yes. And, lastly, we'll add, for flavour - it's not required,\nyou can add another flavour - the vanilla. Okay. In this case we're going to use\nhalf a vanilla pod, just the seeds. There we go. We bring this up to a boil\nand we'll be set. Once it's boiled, we'll add the flour\nwith the heat turned off. Okay. And, lastly, the eggs. -Okay, we'll do that next.\n-Exactly. Okay, so this is boiling. Yes, once it's boiled,\nwe turn off the heat. -And we add the flour.\n-Okay. Everything now, if you want. Super. Until the flour is integrated. Once it's integrated,\nwe'll turn on the heat a little longer in order to get rid\nof the taste of raw flour. Okay. Like that. A little more and it's ready. -Like this, right?\n-Yes. It's an easy dough to make and it's a great excuse\nto get together with friends or family. And do you fill them? Because in Mexico\nwe fill them with all sorts of things. Yes. Mostly we don't,\nbut sometimes we do fill them. With chocolate or white chocolate,\nwith pistachio. -So, we've got our dough here.\n-Yes. -And now we'll add the eggs.\n-Exactly. One by one. -One by one. Okay.\n-Yes. -Hand me a little egg.\n-Yes. -So, like this it's fine?\n-It's fine like that. Now we'll leave it covered\nto rest in the refrigerator for an hour or hour and a half\nto cool and thicken. And then we can fry it. CHOCOLATE GANACHE -Now we're going to make...\n-A chocolate ganache. The one we always have\nwhen we eat churros, but adapted. -Usually, we have hot chocolate...\n-In Spain, you have it with hot chocolate. At our staff meal,\nwe have chocolate ganache. -So we have to heat up the cream.\n-I'll turn it on. We heat up the cream\nand then we add the glucose, which, if you don't have glucose at home,\nyou can use butter without a problem. -Butter. The same quantity?\n-The same quantity, yes. Okay. So, I'll add in the glucose. Exactly.\nHeat it just enough to melt the chocolate. You don't need to boil it. Okay. I'll put the chocolate in here. Okay. Super. So, I think it's pretty hot. -So, before it boils...\n-Add it in here. -And I'll add it in here.\n-Exactly. -The chocolate needs to melt.\n-Okay. -Little by little, right?\n-Yes. A bit here over the chocolate so it melts. Super. Okay. This, once we've mixed it... -Can I?\n-Yes. -Of course.\n-I'm so excited to make your ganache. We leave it to rest for about three hours. So it thickens. And that's it. Done. We put the film against the chocolate,\nbecause if not it forms a crust. And that's it. Even warm it's delicious,\nyou can dunk the churro and it's great. - You could use it hot...\n- Yes, or cold. - Or cold.\n- Exactly. Depending on how\nyou want to decorate it. If you want... If you want to dunk -\nlike we said before - or fill or cover, - it's ideal.\n- I love it! - Yes.\n- Okay. - Delicious.\n- Perfect, right? - Yes.\n- It's perfect like this. BANANA CREAM Well, you know\nthat I really love banana splits. - Yes.\n- With churros. It's a bit extreme. So, you created this recipe\nto mix banana splits and churros. -Yes.\n-So we're going to do the banana part. -Exactly.\n-So we can complete our recipe. -Exactly.\n-So, what we're going to do, we're going to use muscovado sugar. You can use brown, white,\nwhatever type you want. But I like this one more,\nbecause you get notes of liquorice. A little bit of water to dilute it,\na flavouring. I'm using cinnamon, but it could be\ncardamom, nutmeg, whatever you want. -Cinnamon, cinnamon.\n-Cinnamon. And a little bit of butter, just a little. So we're going to start with the sugar.\nThen we add the bananas, -the flavouring.\n-The bananas are cut. Exactly. The bananas in pieces. Then, if we see it's a little thick,\nwe can add some water. Because bananas like to absorb\nall the water, and it can go quite thick. If you want, start with the sugar, and meanwhile I'll peel the bananas. -Yay.\n-Okay. -So... exactly.\n-You cut the banana and add the sugar in. Super. So that it starts melting\nand forming a caramel. Yes. Then you can add the butter,\nthe cinnamon. We'll break the cinnamon\nso that we can get that aroma. Okay. -I'll wait before putting in the butter.\n-Yes. Okay. -Let it melt a little and we'll add the...\n-Butter. -Yes.\n-Okay. And at the same time,\nI'm going to give you the bananas, so that it... mmm! I love the smell of butter and sugar. I love anything with butter. What a joy. -And I add in the cinnamon, right?\n-Yes. -Yes, so it takes on the flavour.\n-Okay. Super. -And we add the bananas.\n-Okay. Delicious. -So they're just cooked, right?\n-Yes, just for a little. If we see that the caramel\nis really hard or something, then we add the water.\nBut if not, then we'll add it later. -You can smell...\n-Great. -The cinnamon, the sugar...\n-It's softened, suft... oops, suftened. -\"Suftened.\"\n-\"Suftened.\" -Okay. This is done, then?\n-Ready. It's done. If you don't like...\nI like for it to have this consistency, but if you don't like it,\nthen you can blend it, or... I like it like this, with banana pieces. -Exactly.\n-Okay. MAKE THE CHURROS So, we have the churro dough\nin the pastry bag. And now you're going to shape them. - How?\n-Yes. This time we're going to do sticks,\nthis length. -Like eclairs?\n-Yes. But we can make them any shape\nwe want, a bow, a circle, the typical thing where one person\npipes and the other cuts. I put this tip on\nbecause I like them grooved. -But it can be smooth. Yes.\n-A little star. So, we pipe it.\nThe dough needs to be cold. That's very important,\nor else it won't pipe. You leave it to rest until it's cold,\nlike an hour. -Yes, it needs to be very cold.\n-Let's see. -Okay.\n-Yes. So, the thickness can be as you like, but we're not going to make it very thick. We pipe and break. I'll let you do it in a second\nso you can try. Okay. That's the form that I would like. But it can be thicker. -Longer.\n-Yes, or longer. -Yes, let's see how it looks longer.\n-Do a longer one. -Super long, isn't it.\n-Yes, like that. Okay, I'll keep going. Let's see a thicker one. Fat and long. You could also do it in the shape\nof a choux, like little churro balls. Yes. Make a few and we can eat them soon. Okay. Oh, that one... -That one looks good, right?\n-With a little ice cream, delicious. Oh, it had some air. -Like that.\n-Okay. We can do any shape we want.\nThat's the fun part. Now, the million-dollar question. Do we freeze this or chill it\nor what do we do? Ideally, we would freeze it\nso that it keeps its shape. If we didn't care about the shape,\nwe could do the same thing, like this. Because you could also have the dough\nand pipe it directly into the fryer. And the other cuts it,\nwhich is the traditional way. But, to conserve the dough shape,\nit would be better to freeze it. Okay, perfect.\nSo now we're going to freeze these. -Exactly.\n-Perfect. FRYING THE CHURROS PLATE THE CHURROS Right. We've got everything\nto make our banana split churros. Exactly. -The banana. I can, can't I?\n-Yes. We pipe it along the bottom,\nso that it stays in place. Yes. Yes. -Then I place my churro...\n-On top. Super. And then... -A little bit of chocolate.\n-Yes. -Delicious.\n-I'm drooling. And then, you made these hazelnuts, right? Yes. All I did was toast them\nso that they'd shed the skin. And then I painted the skin a little.\nI added a little bit of magic. We'll place them here. For anyone that has more of a sweet tooth,\ninstead of making this ganache, -they could do it with Nutella, right?\n-Exactly. And, to complete the circle for my sweet tooth... some ice cream, right? Exactly. We can add a little ice cream. What flavour? Well, to make a banana split, vanilla. Oh, delicious. Yes. -Vanilla ice cream.\n-It goes with the flavouring. Yours is so pretty. I love it. Paula. The time has come.\nI can't wait any longer. -Okay.\n-I'm going to eat it. -Let's try it together, okay?\n-Okay. Let's go. -I'm going to tear off a piece.\n-Yeah. That way... no spoon or anything.\nYou didn't give me a spoon. No, if anything... I'm dying. Amazing. Delicious. -Thank you, Paula.\n-Thank you.

[Applause] [Music] [Music] you", "qGCaQeUdEtI": "[Music] hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and this episode of Laura in the kitchen I'm gonna share with you how to make the most delicious aa banana split dessert it's like I'm no big kind of tastes like a cheesecake it is delicious and you're gonna love it and I'm bringing you this now because I feel like we need like one or two more non apple non fall non pumpkin desserts this may be the last one before that side I'm starting to get really impatient with myself but I wanted to share it with you because it's great any time of year super super fun for everyone to eat and it's just a favorite let me want you through the list of ingredients I've got powdered sugar heavy cream this is some instant vanilla pudding mix you need milk for that you'll need some cream cheese some bananas you're gonna need some crushed pineapple that you drain really well butter graham crackers a little bit of hot fudge sauce maraschino cherries whatever your heart desires to top it with let's get going on making the crust these are my homemade graham crackers we love these I mean it's just they're so delicious they're better than anything you can buy at the store what I'm doing right now is I'm gonna put them in there I need about a couple of cups of crushed graham cracker crumbs so I'm just gonna add that in there and then pulse it until you know it's pulverized basically and then we'll measure out a couple cups all right I measure this out it's about two cups I'm gonna add in some melted unsalted butter and I'm just gonna pulse that until it's the blue mixture resembles like wet sand you're just gonna add this mixture to the bottom of a 9 by 13 inch pan that you've sprayed with just a little tiny bit of nonstick spray I ended up adding a couple more cookies so in total you want about two and a quarter cups of graham cracker crumbs if you buy them already crushed not too many because I don't like a real thick crust otherwise it's just too much base and not enough on top you know okay I'm going to go ahead and go pop this into the freezer for about 15 minutes or so or until however long it takes for me to make the filling alright let's work on the feeling I'm gonna start right here this is some not a whole box but this is some instant vanilla pudding mix okay I'm gonna use a little help from the store here a little bit of milk you're gonna just give that a stir as you normally would and now what you gonna do is you're gonna let this just set aside set aside let it thicken don't do anything to it we're gonna move our with our heavy cream so that we can whip it I'm gonna just take my handy dandy handheld electric whisk and I'm just gonna whisk this until it forms stiff peaks beautiful just gonna do this real quick put them back on you don't have to do that but you know ya know okay now we're gonna switch gears bowl wait ah powdered sugar and the cream cheese you wanna make sure that your cream cheese is soft every temperature I'm gonna come in here and we're gonna just cream this together it's gonna look really thick at first but it'll it'll work out that's good enough now you're gonna come in here look how thick this has gotten see that that's what you want that is what you want I'm gonna add that right in all right crust is ready this mixture is perfect and ready and so delish you're gonna do a layer of it just spread that right in there nice and even as even as you can manage of course now it's gonna look like the mixture is not a thick enough of a layer but you got to keep in mind this is extremely extremely extremely rich but it does have quite a few layers on there so this is gonna be perfect we have that my bananas I'm gonna do about three it's a pretty big bananas but you can do three or four I really want to make sure that I've got plenty of bananas covering the surface and then I want to talk to you about what I have here I've got some crushed pineapple okay you want to drain it but it's not enough that you drain it you want to make sure that you really take a spatula and push down on it you want to get rid of as much of that liquid as possible so I've done that and I'm just gonna continue to do my bananas and then we'll keep layering okay now I'm gonna take my drained crushed pineapple don't leave this out you have no idea how good this isn't here mmm I just do it with my hands cause it's really hard to spread and because it's not chunks and it's just it's crushed it makes it just it's just easier to do it okay it just is and it's gonna be so good and you're gonna love it you're gonna love it now you go on with your fresh whipped cream and you're gonna just do your best to even this out on top just do your best to kind of even it out take some store-bought fudge sauce I don't do this in any particular water I kind of just drizzle you might need to pop this into the microwave a little bit just to soften it but you don't want to leave it in there for too long because if your hot fudge sauce is hot it's gonna melt your your heavy cream I don't do this in any particular order I literally just take my spoon and go down you can do this like them with a piping bag if you want to make it look perfect but who's got time for that and I can guarantee you no one will care serve extra on the side and then I do love this part I feel like you need to have maraschino cherries with the stems because you know that's just how I roll or without it doesn't matter all over the top all right this is gonna go into the fridge 4 to 6 hours overnight is better whatever tickles your fancy it'll be delicious and so worth the wait if you've got some nuts like a pecan walnut anything that you want chop them up real fine toast them set them aside because when we go to serve it we're gonna sprinkle it on the top for a little crunch perfect I'm just gonna lose like loosely cover this with some parchment paper I don't want anything to touch it otherwise it's gonna just be a mess when I try to remove it and I put it on its own shelf in the fridge all right it's been about 6 hours you know the first ones always a cook's treat because it's always a pain to get out of slice especially from a square pan but look how beautiful that holds together right gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous I'm just gonna go for it cuz I can't take it anymore that's like when Ana pudding meets banana split meets the pineapple then they get married and then out comes out this beautiful gorgeous thing that tastes like a million buckaroos I got nothing else to say it's a first I know about a loss for words Larry I think it should not comment about the recipe in the mouth that goes oh I'll see you next time make this this weekend you'll love it [Music]",

the c3 equals and the key company's new linear switch is called the banana split switches you shout out to the key company for sending out these banana split switches for testing and i actually like them quite a bit i will probably buy some more while they're still in stock i don't know we'll see if i need any more for another board or so but i should probably not impulse buy more switches than i need right so these switches are manufactured by jwk but the housings are designed by c3 equals so the housings the molds everything is brand new nothing is recolored from previous jwk switches these switches are made from a yellow palm stem as well as a pink and purple top and bottom housing made from polycarbonate and nylon and these switches are also lightly lubed from the factory as well i don't know exactly what kind of lube it is but you are able to loop over it if you think that there's not enough lube but i think that the amount that they apply is actually pretty generous it's not too too much where the switch feels like it's over lube it's actually quite the opposite it's just enough so that it glides a little bit better and it also resonates better as well the sound profile is a lot more high pitched than something that's made from abs or palm so i actually like that quite a bit because it gives it a little bit more of a clacking sound rather than a thaky deeper sounding switch i like these a lot because it's a really lazy-ish relaxed very smooth stock switch like the 67 gram spring is a perfect weight the spring is actually gold as well so you do have good aesthetics inside and out like these are one of the best looking switches i can confidently say that are available on the market today and if you're interested in a really good linear switch that you don't have to do anything to that you can just drop into a board whether it be hot swap or solder you will not be disappointed with your purchase like these are some of the best switches to come out all year there are 16 25 for a pack of 25 switches and so the pricing is very reasonable as well it's a lot cheaper than zeal switches and the performance i do have to say is very similar the switch wobble there is a little bit of wobble but it's nothing that would uh mess you up during typing or gaming so it's nothing to worry about but yeah i would definitely recommend these to someone that's looking for a new keyboard switch that's going to be different than something you've probably heard on the market if i had to relate it to anything i would say that it's somewhat similar to a gateron yellow but like better in every way and the pitch is just perfect you guys will hear the sound test at the end of the video but that's going to be it for this video if you guys enjoy be sure to drop a like and subscribe if you are new to the channel i'm going to leave you guys with the build as well as a pretty long sound test at the end i'll see ya [Music] so [Music] sweet like poison you know you make me reckless [Music] my religion i have a million reasons to leave you but i have a billion reasons to keep you uh you [Music] bye", "mo8rlqjjfWM": "good afternoon my name is Fatima Szabo frozen I'm

love triangle film I have seen in a while I fell in love with the characters and especially April her quick wit and her ability to show the dynamic of the we're still friends breakup really spoke to me we're lucky enough to have been kosoul key at the with us today so I'd like to invite him up to say a few words oh thank you that was what an awesome intro Toronto this is the best I grew up across that border in New York and was like a sad kid listening to much music and you know looking over here with binoculars and crying I love Toronto and I love Canada this has really been such a great festival thank you to the next wave staff or programming yes this is so so cool and I'm really happy to be here and showing you this movie and this theater is really special to me I usually add ELP and I shot a lot with guys in the last time I was here was for TIF five or six years ago and I got to premiere a keyhole and I think this theater and it was awesome and so it's really really special to be back in this building and thank you to the staff here and the TIFF lightbox and it's so cool that you as the city have this as a resource I'm really pleasantly jealous that this is in your world so yeah we made this movie it's hopefully a lot of fun we had a good time making it I don't want to say too much about it but we just tried to make something funny that had some good ideas behind it on the way I think maybe people should learn how to grow up sometimes so enjoy it and we'll see you afterwards I believe Hanna is going to be skyping in so Hanna Marx who I'm a huge fan of and hopefully you will be in about three minutes it will be skyping in to talk to us she's a producer she's the star and she's the co-writer of the film and she's amazing so we'll be back to talk to you afterwards and thank you yeah hi my name is high Kuhn not sure if you introduce yourselves I guess we're just doing this like introducing each other thing anyways um I'm here to introduce we have the director of the film and kosoul key with us and thank you oh my god this is awesome thank you first staying around for Q&A hopefully we're entertaining and is supposed to be skyping in so I'm not sure if that's happening or how that's happening but we can keep moving with her and um and if she comes in great and if not we'll keep moving ahead okay perfect so to start off I have a question for you so I found this hilarious I mean this is my second time watching it and I was dying I don't know if you guys could hear my laughs I'm so sorry I was very obnoxious but I just wanted to ask a question about how this it was had this like perfect duality between like humor but also deep meaningful themes such as like love and friendship and I just wanted to know how you explode those themes throughout the film yeah thank you that's um that's a good question yeah I mean we you know I they Hannah sent the script over and I mean I loved the sense of humor it's really kind of outlandish and it starts kind of mean and then gets somewhere really sweet and a lot of coming-of-age films that I that really resonate with me like Superbad does that really well where you're watching it you're like this is a gross comedy and by the end it's actually really tender and sweet and you kind of just shows a different approach to coming-of-age film and so like I I liked that about the script and then it was really when we were on set it was really just like let's make this as fun as possible to watch but kind of there's a bit of an agenda underneath all of the humor and that's that's what I was really that's what resonated with me when I read the script and when we were trying to make it and I yeah I just wanted to be able to make something that people could enjoy but also have something to think about especially in dealing with the way women interact with each other at that age and kind of become aware and start to probably aura ties friendships and things like that yeah definitely just bouncing off that question could you talk about like maybe like the importance and the themes of like platonic relationships that you tackle in this film yeah I mean it's it's tricky I you know I I grew up on a different era of kind of teen films if you want to make it as genre so I can kind of came up on John Hughes and stuff in the 80s and 90s and female friendships weren't explored super super well there was sort of usually there's like a mentor figure and then someone that kind of learns from them but I never I never really could find a film where two young women were complicated and messy oh wait we have to look there for her to see yes this is awesome oh all right yeah no we're working on audio maybe check and see if your mute your microphone might be muted hi hello hi thank you so much for coming where are you guys you won you won the cute game what oh that's awesome it's just like the movie but real thank you thanks Liana alright so I think we're gonna proceed to audience questions if anyone in the audience member has any we do audience questions can I just point something out Darren can you stand up our DOP Darren Moran is here and so people have questions about cinematography he and I will be hanging out in the lobby afterwards we're happy to talk to everybody we're really excited you're here so if there are cinematography questions Darren Canfield those perfect alright yeah we have mic runners it's even easier with those glasses are the dream team that those are awesome those are new your question yeah I was just wondering did you make a cameo in the film as the lyft driver that's an actor named Steve little and if you guys ever watched he's pounded down he's on that show and I've just done a lot of movies with him over the years and we had this lyft driver sequence and Steve came out and we improvised them much longer scene like Hanna can probably talk about this there was a lot more improv in the film but then as we started to find the most succinct version of the narrative things got trimmed down so Steve had a slightly larger part and kind of went a little more angry at the kids for making out in the backseat and he was extra awkward he was one of those lyft drivers that's like super helpful with way too much water and like candy that you shouldn't be eating anyway and we had him kind of dig in he's really fun but I wish I was Steve Steve way cooler than I will ever be yeah thank you do you have any other questions yes right there hi this is a question to Hannah and the director how much of the story was based on a true story because I just found that acting to be so authentic it's so well directed it's just so well executed in general high school and I used as my first writing exercise really - this thing's not fictionalized over the years yeah this is just to piggyback on that right before you chimed in there was a question about some of the other like you know obviously this is a comedy and it has some drama elements but there was a question about some of the other themes you were trying to explore maybe about just being a young woman and and friendships and things like that if there's anything you want to add complicated and imperfect because I think you know women sometimes getting lost that women I think a lot of times people are trying to portray women that's so beautiful and very truthful thank you for that thank you yeah was my question but please settle up you like to swim do you have any more questions 303 can you put hands up I right here in the middle oh yeah there we go well thank you for being proactive with the microphone first of all amazing movie was very good thank you I wanted to ask because I know that Hannah you like executive produced and wrote it sorry and you directed so how did that kind of work on set of like yeah yeah I think we got really lucky in that you were I mean obviously you're always on set you're in almost every scene but not only were you there as a performer who had intimate knowledge of your source material but um I think it was it was really helpful for you and I - you were there as a writer I mean there was things that we had to revisit or when we were you know we were working under a pretty strict budget so we had to rewrite things Andry conceived things and I mean there was times where I think as a storyteller I probably would have been lost without some of your insight as far as the dramatic beats and filling in some of the gaps when we had to or when parts of the story were you know just needed a little help you were there so it was pretty symbiotic I think and yeah as Hannah said like we met many years ago so we kind of had just had a good friendship going into it that's right yeah I was shooting two different projects one at cast and the other a cast Steve little so I guess it all kind of came full circle we can thank mr. Redford for that do we have any other questions I think in the third row yes yes hi this is kind of adding on to the last question so Hannah I love you and Dirk Gently you're fantastic in that it's a great great show that's also thank you any more questions do we have any well we got one here maybe after his if anybody has any fur Liana she's here too in electrical spirit I'll relay this Anna so the question was is for Hanna and it's what were some of your better memories of making the film and the sort of second question was see if I get this right it was sort of about your working relationship with me versus a project something like Dirk Gently which is just just a different beast altogether is that it yeah best memory onset I'm not just saying that she's here because Leona has been one of my best friends since I was 11 and she was nine and now I'm 25 and she's 24 are you trade her yet yes so that was a really beautiful thing when you know it was a dream come true we had been wanting to do this together forever and we just had so much fun and it made the whole experience much much more comfortable because we had each other so I had fun every single day I mean it was really all of my friends on set like you know the girl that plays Sally like the Molly Sally duo I've known her for the kajillion years one of my best friends christina was onset photographer and you know Ben and I have known each other for six years now so every moment was really a blast for me because it was like a you know how often do you get to make a movie with all your friends it really came through that chemistry was insane like it really was extraordinarily real on knowing you for that long Hannah how come I never do you have a samurai sword in your room because Dirk Gently you have a different director every single week which is you know how TV works and that's really really fun but it's just a completely different experience than making the movie I mean I really think the samurai sword completes the composition of the background but it's an aesthetic it's a vibe frame that well [Music] so messy anyway it's just filled with samurai swords all over the floor yeah I think we have one last question for the audience can I had a tiny one after our last question it'll be super fast after right there with the hoodie in the back yes you you are the chosen one I was just wondering if there was a specific inspiration or purpose as to why at the end of the movie nick was kind of like or Dylan was kind of like just um like not cut out but like just kind of discarded and then it ended up just being about the friendship was there a specific purpose or inspiration for that to cut him out because we don't know like who he ends up with who he ends up with anybody if he keeps in contact etc Hannah do you want to tackle that from a writer perspective friendship so it was really always going to end this way and hopefully you know you can still group her Dylan's character and hope he has a great life without the whole movie being about him yeah and in the storytelling we tried to just you kind of set up a little pitfall at the beginning where you think it's gonna be this one thing and hopefully by the end when it's not the thing you thought it was you get to reflect back on what those kind of movies where the girl chases the guy and that's the happy ending what what that really might leave someone if you see a narrative where people prioritize friendship and loving each other over I'm over just getting the guy you know life lessons right there I have one tiny question is for Liana and for Hanna you guys just have a lot of fans here and I think everybody's wondering what comes next for you what are you guys working on and what can we look for you swipe left on Liana after all this time wait did that work yeah actually flossing you can make up something for [Music] how about - Hannah what can we look for and in the spirit of this festival which is all for people 25 and under you're the youngest director ever to be hired by a studio to make a movie like that correct round of applause to put you on the spot pretty amazing nice going lady I think that's the end of tonight's Q&A thank you so much and thank you Toronto and thank you TIFF next way for having us this is so awesome it's Darren and I'll be hanging out outside if people have questions about stuff we're so happy to talk to you about all of it thank you thank you for coming tonight goodnight", "3A5t443Yn9U": "you wanna buy my corned beef sandwich you know like my sandwich is my music I don't think that's how friends work maybe we shouldn't be anymore we should have been friends [Music] food afterwards Thank You April Heather salmon not hungry mom she's allowed to be depressed thank you no one as good as Nikhil ever love her again because Sarah girl come from anyway she's like moved here so I'm just showing her around and you've got before I show her the Chinese Theatre she should see next penis hi you're April uh-huh do you wanna go do a shot why are you being so nice to me I want a reason to give you a black eye what about what he grabbed your boob like a tightly sealed dick as a Quidditch stick he hasn't done that with me I think we should make some rules you're gonna tell him you were rat Benjamin wouldn't know what happens to rats they get shaped in their sleep they get their carbon monoxide detectors disabled yeah you guys are perfect for each other you know that [Music] think about you all the time [Music] even suited very little personal growth for you rebounding with it's just like mr.

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "yDEbj70Q2SA": "hi guys and welcome to another technical Tuesday I got Matt Adams with me to help answer two questions for today this week I got asked how to set up the twister okay and the twister is of course a fancy technique the spawn manipulation technique it's you know it's cool but it's flashy it's hard to pull off all the time so I'm going to talk about not only the twister but also things that happen in that position okay and we're going to call that position that double hook let's see what I'm talking about here okay so now I'm my partner's a turtle position and I have one hook in all right this is a good book this is a normal hook with my leg is just inside what I'm going to do is I'm going to apply the double okay what about foot actually is going to be over the top of his ankle so this is a very common mistake when people start training and they're trying to take it back it feels really secure to store your double hook in but realistically when I go to try through a second hooking it doesn't lead you let's listen up space right so in the Virginia I wish some people don't double them take that foot off don't double milk I mean leaving it here is going to allow me to take it back much easier okay that's go apply but let's go for some stuff with a double hook because there is some good to it we're going to go ahead and start off with just the twister okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to start to lock my arms around his waist or around the playing excusing as I lost the leg I'm going to push with my second egg I need to power my legs to really pull him over that that lead shoulder push first push and get it to roll to his back okay from here right away my mama's gonna release they hit shoot my other side a bit harder I don't really care how I drop if she did but she was there for two Jake she's in a real planted mints down he's not going to like the track so now it's a little bit of time to sort of arch going to win by head inside if they're still gripped it's okay and a cute perky twin my head inside and now he's my whole body is ripped a trick notice I'm going to keep the grip of my second hand as I work my shoulder all the way through so I can wrap his head underneath now I'm just going to come to hints to the grip around the neck I'm gonna start to pull his head in as I put my hips up okay tons of personal spies super uncomfortable when I'm doing it I have to make sure that his foot doesn't escape down okay I don't want to lose that double hook I want to keep this double hook also what I can do especially the guys very slowly is I can apply a triangle and now making sure that his foot doesn't go past my foot if it goes underneath it's not good he's going to start to I'm gonna start to lose my leverage he's going to flatten out and I'm going to lose the position right so I'm going to stay here straight leg keep my foot flexed so with that foot I can move its going to stay strapped okay again two hands and hips up pull in the hand pulling him in to make it go twister one more time cocaine double hook in grab in that length harsh Vardhan drug drive drive text up forearm so moving my head inside break the grip click his head watch my hands in a back arch just to pull him in and give them a spinal manipulation for the town alright let's look at some other stuff in this position though it's hardly necessary to get that hand sometimes so what I'm going to do now is I can apply some discomfort to help kind of draw it out so I'm going to go the same way and go hands around the leg I'm going to punch drive drive drive drive drive and now I'm going to be here say his hands like here I can't find it I'm going to come high up to the knee okay not down on the thigh high up to the knee from max leverage and I'm going to just start to pull put my hips up okay doing the banana switch now against the tough guy you're not really going to top people like this necessarily although you can it is possible open those hips tear the muscle whatever make it super uncomfortable but more likely you're going to show my hands off he's getting destructed we're she to give me an opportunity to get my hand back kids inside swim lock and go for that submission okay we have two options from there let's go for one more something else that I can do from this double hook this one's very safe very old school in a good go to okay so I'm here again on the bathroom my double loop in place this time I going to face his hips and I'm going to put both hands over and just grab both ankles at first this could be my best leverage to help turn the ladle in a Turner on here do now is they enjoy I'm going to pull these ankles in and I'm going to create this role as soon as I create the rope I'm going to go two hands on this foot pull put my hips up create a slicer causing that knee toe explode right look at what detail when I got the flip my inside arm again what this is to be on the outside of into put what can happen is this on the inside of the foot and partner reaches up and grabs my arm he grabs my wrist my arms actually an armbar position and although he doesn't have that much position secure I'm kind of tie myself up here which can put my elbow in danger in legitimate danger okay so I'm going to make sure every time I go to grab that foot I'm going to grab both hands on the opposite side of this foot anyways it's always better to grab high on the coast it's as if we're going for a toehold or Americana my foot okay again two hands here hips up pull that leg down throughout all these transitions you guys I always have the option to to just start to look for my back and actually undo that double hook okay so I'm here time cop\u00e1n is split test or Twitter I always have the option is stand my legs let's add a double cow all of that okay guys that's different technical Tuesday thanks so much for watching please like share subscribe and
