{"2ESuGJL96-8": "how're we doing everybody well we got a special treat for you went to sleeve o today and picked up and liras great pie and I've got 3/8 of this I'm going to press individually so we can see what the consistency is when you press these out into rosin they were all purchased on the same day they were packed on the same day according to the stickers this is an indica dominant hybrid and it is ringing in at twenty one point two seven percent THC big shout-out to Celilo over in Squirrel Hill so we're gonna press these one at a time now this is the first one and we see if I get this moved over just a little bit better so you can see it these have been rehydrating with spinach leaf okay spinach Leafs right there and we're gonna okay so take out the spinach leaf and here are the rehydrated buds and they are definitely ready to press okay or some more spinach leaf on the bottom and I'll even rehydrate it all that people kind of stick in there okay every last bit of this so this is press number one okay so here's a good look give you a nice nice look at it here it's got some purple got some purple looking sugar leaf in there he's got some really really nice-looking trichomes you can see them glistening and if you look at the overall stickiness here okay I mean it just sticks to your fingers it is moist they're trimming job could be a bit better take a look at this okay Tremayne is less than stellar but I think we're gonna get a really really good result so we're gonna get ourselves a mug Smasher 3 point 5 gram bag for our 8 and we've got the press warming up to 200 degrees this is right where we want it to be get our bag here okay we're gonna turn it inside out we're going to do this bottle textile with an inverted bag I prefer it it's a personal preference thing it works either way you don't have to do it this way but I find it a bit better for my uses to invert the bag unless it's giving me a problem that [ __ ] sometimes does ok here we go so turn that thing inside out and one or two of the corners usually is already kind of inverted so you can get it set up bottle textile and for those of you who are new bottle textile is a way to load this bag so that it comes down more or less in a circle on its own footprint okay so and get the bag set up like this the reason I turn the bags inside out is because this rib right along here if it's inside the bag it's hard to load the flour in there so I just started turning them inside out and it's worked very well for me thus far so here we go we got this thing pretty much set up for our flour load this thing up we're gonna get this in here while this stuff is so moist this spinach leaf really works it works in six hours that's how long we had this stuff in there six hours and it is super super sticky not at all like the Cheetos puff dryness that we saw when we opened it initially on getting it back from the dispensary so we're going to pack this down into the bottom it's best we can get all the rest of these little stragglers in there all of its medicine okay so we're gonna kind of try to form this bottom real flat so it comes down really easy in its footprint a little bit of finger hash going on here from from that now got the bag here we've got the plant material in here it's packed down as evenly as we can get it we're gonna cut it off right about here and we're gonna fall down well first of all let me get these little hairs that these little whiskers of thread that are on the inside of the bag normally now they're on the outside so I tried to trim them off that way we don't have to worry about any contamination fold in the corners well in these corners and now we have very compact slug ready to be pressed this is an 8 I'm gonna set this right under here to kind of station keep it well we get our paper together piece paper we're going to do a directional fold it's going to keep things neat inside the press now give us a really really good result now we're gonna trim this down a bit turn this side off just like that save this for checking our yield which we will be doing after this press and each one of these three presses are going to be separate videos so I'm going to press them all consecutively one right after the other and each one will be a separate video so you can see what each yield is and the consistency of the results so got our paper here we're going to get this fold it in like so take this side and now we've got a nice place to put that puck and we're gonna start extracting so I've got this I'm gonna move the camera up and try to recenter this so I can get a good shot of this for you get that lit up right there now I'm gonna put the paper in here got it right about there I'm going to now let's get everything in real close but you can see what I see now here's a bird's-eye view of what's going on now I will be adjusting the lighting giving you the best view possible so just please bear with me and take our puck and place it inside the press now I need to check make sure we fouled is closed and we're gonna start applying pressure until we reach our first stage of heat soak which will be when I'm not getting free fall from my weighted handle on here open this up as much as you can you never do know you think I'm sorry when it comes to your bra due to sloppy work with your paper but I am definitely not the most experienced lotta guys on YouTube ever hears about this stuff okay we're already seeing some activity going on here you see all the bubbling happening that's that's some good good good sign I did that's a real good sign we got that thing just I do see almost immediately once once we go through that first heats up I'm just gonna pin that right there until it starts to gush let's keep coming down until it gives us another indication that it's ready to slow down for a minute - and there we go that's our next rest along the way see if I get the light in there a little bit better for you let's try to get this there we go there you can see it see all that bubble so much activity I mean rehydration is absolutely the key to getting good yields from your pressing the housing make no mistake if you bring it home right from the dispensary the way it is you are never going to get an acceptable yield you just won't none of the dispensary re I mean none of the grower processors at all are putting out flour that's proper moisture content for pressing rosin now all that it took my god this thing is just introducing like crazy pressure still still right on where it needs to be it's self-regulating nicely it might it very well might you see how beautiful that looks on camera you can you can see a lot of that activity going on look at all that beautiful medicine being made here how cool is this you can take dispensary flour you can bring it home you can apply some heat and pressure to that and you can get some of the most amazing medicine from it just amazing continued pressure is still exactly where it needs to be still producing quite a bit of rosin here the color is just absolutely beautiful - it's not dark it's not getting that way it's it's looking super super nice that is you're bringing out the best out of this plan yeah it is gonna be excellent no idea what kind of a yield we're gonna get this is the first time I have pressed this particular strain but we're all gonna find out together I wanted to let everybody know also that if you're in the Pittsburgh area there's gonna be a lot of 4/20 events going on I haven't thus far been successful in attaching myself to one to do any pressing so if you don't hear an announcement to the contrary I am going to be having a press party for patients only only people with cards and dispensary flour but you come here and we will get some of this from your dispensary flower you need to rehydrate it for six hours with spinach leaf in order for it to be ready to be pressed you cannot bring me leaf that you just bought at the dispensary and expect to get these kind of results from it I promise you it will not happen okay so if you're not doing anything else on 4/20 and you're near Pittsburgh come to Penn Hills hit me up a messenger hit me up on Facebook and let's have a good time on 4/20 we don't need a bunch of vendors we don't need a bunch of money I just need to bring yourself bring some dispensary flour that you've rehydrated ahead of time we got some good conversation I've got some cards against humanity' we'll have some good grub it's gonna be a good time so if you just keep looking I mean this thing is still just popping bubbles and flowin like I can't believe right now this is amazing I'm giving it a little more aggression on the pressure just to see if we're at the end now you see that didn't really produce a lot right there I think just about ready to pull this because I'm not seeing a lot more bubbling happening here step yeah there we go that last little bit and that pressure still holding just study like it should but what I'm looking for is that color still looking really good but right on the corner right hand side here I'm starting to see a little bit of that like that indicator okay so let's see if there's any more bubbles happening see how much flow we're gonna get it still still coming a little bit just give it another round of pressure you learn something new with every single strain it's just it's wonderful to see what this plan is showing us here I just gave it one last push I think we're just about done take this off I'm gonna get ready to see what our magnets okay I'm ready for this all right so we're gonna bring this down with a cold plate readjust my lighting here so you can see what's going on and readjust my focus back out again there we go and we're gonna readjust so that you see what I see now I can show you right here there was no blowout okay that's not contamination that's that color change see that indicator right there were darkened a little bit in that circle right around the edge we pulled it just at the right time okay where I was seeing that was on the one side on this side over here I was catching a glimpse of that little bit of darkening going on and that's what prompted me to pull it see no blow out came down perfectly textbook press on this so we're going to give this a quick cool down on the cold plate here I'm gonna get too aggressive pulling it down one just gonna do it gently let's set up real nice and stained get up here like us bad just right at that tear it just came through a little bit I don't think it got the yeah I got the plate what right there on the corner I have to clean that up before the next press alright take my weapon of choice here picked one of these up at Glasgow Wow up in Monroeville and shout out to them and let's see what this is gonna do for us you're gonna pick up real nice and play there we go okay so let's see what we're doing here yeah let's start the pickup and it got a little sappy at one part that's okay as it cools it's gonna set up even more look at that lay that out Oh thing about this is you just gotta be patient I know it looks wonderful it's definitely gonna smoke wonderful but get too aggressive trying to gather it up then you end up ripping your paper and wasting your materials so you take your time you just run this on here a nice easy pressure that's somebody the other day it's the friends of mine that called me Bob rosin because I sound like Bob Ross what I'm talking about this process it truly does make me feel very peaceful and focused when I'm able to focus on making my medicine you get kind of Zen with it you know but I tell you the truth this is truly the one thing that I've done since I was in the army so we're talking 28 years that it's give", "SNRp2I1W-Eg": "hey what's up YouTube urban grower here so we're you know gonna start reposting this is gonna be a video series on this particular crop right here it's a the

"[Music] yo what up youtube welcome back smoking with small town you know the rules kids bounce on up out of here and if you're new to the channel click that [ __ ] down below and subscribe today i got a weed review it's coming to you by canna bay i have not tried them yet before i got this at a whole new dispensary in santa cruz california the dispensary is called santa cruz naturals and this strain is the great pie number four and it is coming to you at a 25 on the thc look at that bad boy and a .06 on the cbd it does have a like a light grape smell maybe not too bad not too much but how you get a great pie number four is they crossed grape pie with chem dog number four so maybe that's what i'm smelling more of like a kim dog smell i do have a bong load already packed and this i did get this i want to say i forgot the exact price but it was in between 30 and 40 dollars for the eight it wasn't any more than 40 bucks for the eighth so a decent price [Music] so cheers everybody let's get a bong load in the grape pie number four by kanna bay cheers [Music] that's a big hit oh it's kind of refreshing though the exhale [Music] maybe a little fruity almost minty even maybe that's the kim dog a little minty yeah shout out to santa cruz naturals the uh the dispensary that i went to if you buy three grams of anything you get a gram for a dollar which is super cheap so if you get three grams of wax your third gram is only a dollar or a penny or some [ __ ] i don't know it's [ __ ] there was a super stupid cheap price an awesome deal the first time you go you get ten percent off or ten dollars off whatever it is so that's always a plus two because that was my first time there so and this was grown it says here in the back cultivated in moss landing california i've actually been there to the beach says california's best cannabis 100 hand trimmed i'm not going to say it's california's best cannabis because i've smoked a lot and i've been a lot higher off the first hit but so far it's not bad i'm not like super disappointed or anything off the first hit i would it's like a middle of the range you know top shelf from a dispensary that i smoke you know like most the weeds that i smoke we do have some fancy dancy today there we go a little fancy for everybody huh get a little glass in a little gig of glass i really like the flavor it's a really good one and you know how we do on this channel two for the review who remembers this because this is the age-old question i'm still want to know guilty or not guilty this is the original [ __ ] newspaper from it says right here in the corner 1995 the fresno beat october 3rd is he guilty or is he not guilty that is the question people [Music] okay let's get another bong load in my grandma used to keep all these uh back in the day she has all the newspaper clippings from like elvis presley's death and uh princess dye michael jackson the oj trial anything that was like important she had the original newspaper clippings for and since my grandma passed away rest in peace i kept all that [ __ ] okay cheers oh chip second one felt better than the first one the first one was like so this week you need to sometimes you only need one this one you need to sit on him for a minute before i give you guys the official review but i look down here to my right and i found the answer to the question he's not guilty [Music] that i don't want to open it up because i don't want to mess and mess them up you know because they're [ __ ] very old so not guilty extra extra read all about it and this was oh yeah the same paper october 3rd guilty or not guilty not guilty crazy ass paper to have it's part of history okay start calculating it up price uh it's not bad at all under forty dollars for the eighth it is an indoor weed it's not harsh it doesn't have my throat all [ __ ] up it didn't have the uh outdoor grassy taste the taste was more of like a kim dog with a little bit of a little fruity kim dog with a little fruity i guess so that's where that grape comes in uh the high the high is not like extraordinary i'm not all baked out of my mind but it did do its job i am stoned so considering everything i got to be honest with the people i can't pump this [ __ ] up because it came from a different dispensary or give it a shitty review but i'm gonna have to be honest it's only it's a 7.1 you know because it got me loaded and the taste was good and it's not harsh it is an indoor weed but it's not like i can't give it the eights i can't even give it the high sevens it's a seven one it got the job done for what it is so i'm not highly disappointed i just would i buy it again probably not in the near future but everybody's into different strains that's what i'm here for to review them for you so for the grape pie number four by cana bay i'm gonna have to give it the seven one which it's you know it's higher than a six so that's something to say cheers everybody oh hello baby wine chuck okay well that'll do it 7-1 for the grape pie by cana bay hope you guys enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town", "Lu-2PoSmPpk": "what is going on YouTube family this is pressing peat the press and puffin coming at you with another one so it's gonna be a little different today anybody who follows me on Instagram noticed that I had an issue or even saw my video with the grass roots Bubba diagonal live sauce or live butter it's live butter it was more of a sugar so I instagrammed him I posted about it they emailed me grassroots / and asked me to send them my address oh they gave me a choice I could a drive two and a half hours back to the dispensary I bought it from and return it or be keep the product which I don't mind I enjoyed the product and they would send me some stuff so I chose option B obviously I'm not driving two and a half hours for one one half gram of product just not [ __ ] happen so I got my box from grassroots sent me a little bit of stuff so we're gonna crack into her and see what they sent me and then I'm gonna do a review so get my handy-dandy stabby pokey stick here right in Nice so when I emailed them and I want to email anybody now I finish it with stay safe and be well be well primarily being the point and this is a shipping label they sent me and right there stay safe and be well hahaha it spreads see love spreads the the good good vibes good things spread so oh a bag good looking at grassroots I appreciate the hook-up I got a grassroots shirt and it's in my size and no they didn't ask my size they just got lucky Oh Oh yep I'll be wearing at my next review and the grassroots dab Matt oh yeah can always use another dead man cactus I only have two I have a big one from Doug Smasher and now this one so and they're both black and white which is awesome sweet so shout out the grassroots for the love and the hook-up I appreciate it that's awesome it's a nice quality t-shirt yeah next-level apparel never heard of them but it's nice soft but good quality I like the color the dark grey and I I wanted a grass root shirt yeah deeply that's what's up yeah okay so let's get into it we are reviewing shatter prism by Alera this is grape pie great pie shatter I did the homework on this one folks it is grape stomper crossed with cherry pies indica heavy dominant hybrid so according to the packaging in the you know molera they're basic basic basic with their packaging THC a seventy eight point six eight one CBD a zero terpenes B mark one point 106 human point four six three little all point four four nine car point three to eight this point three oh nine limonene point one five eight be pining 0.079 terminal 18 point oh seven eight PI nine point oh five six that's all she wrote folks now I picked this up on April 4th this is April 9th actually it's the 10th now and this was packaged on the 13th so not the freshest not the least fresh so you see it's still sealed at the nice little sticker there we're gonna change that real fast when we bust her open now these are those childproof containers I keep talking about the one that defeated me when I first got into the program it took my wife and I both to figure this damn thing out and even then we couldn't I finally got it so you have to push in on the two ends while pressing down on this tab and then you can pull the tray out like so that easy but it took I don't know why it took us a bit to figure it out now of course this is trim run it's usually what happens with the layer that's what you get that's the envelope break you're open it's dark you know I expect that with Alera it's not the darkest stuff I've ever seen with them actually actually this is better looking I'm surprised usually it's a weird green a weird green color but this is actually it not a bad color it's a nice amber it's a it's actually nice-looking shatter I'm surprised that's actually some of the better-looking stuff I've ever seen from Alera and I don't mind they're shatter it's a little expensive for my opinion for what it is but I [ __ ] with a shatter or sometimes when it comes around we have a nice big old fat chunk here we're gonna stick that bad boy they go i dabs stick that in there another little piece top it off now I almost forgot actually I did forget I broke that off and I wait I didn't weigh it so we're gonna weigh it without what I just put it in the Deb and we'll see exactly what we got here okay you folks saw me load up my two big chunks into my Jeep and connect so I've got two nice chunks in there the chamber is pretty full in fact I'll pull it out here so you can see so you can see that chamber is full chatter okay and I just weighed what was left 1.05 so it's probably you know pretty sight of this little over 0.1 I would say it actually 1.07 1.07 so I'm gonna say that that's probably 0.4 0.5 maybe so yeah with over not only was a better looking than normal but it was over which I like to see so shout out cool air for that at least let's crack into it and see how she tastes now like I said it's grape pie or grape stomper and cherry pie grape stomp or cherry pie so supposed to have you know sweet flavors to it but it's also supposed to be a little spicy from what I read we'll see alright cheers folks hmm Wow not too shabby okay mm-hmm I tasted it you got a little bit that grape little bit that cherry it does have that little bit of a nutty spicy exhale like I said that's actually an accurate description that they had yeah sweet and a little spicy I like it grape pie all day long yeah definitely a favorite for me as far as the lair goes time for a haircut again oh that's good stuff it's right where I wanted to be this morning having a rough day at bad night last night not having a good day this morning this whole corona virus things got my [ __ ] [ __ ] up my schedules off because of work being messed up so it messes with my sleep schedule messes with my routine and I don't know how many of you watching suffer from PTSD and anxiety but one of the things that keeps me functioning well is a routine it's not a lot of unexpected you know a general routine I mean I can have your usual daily stuff of things that get thrown at you but my whole world being thrown into turmoil like this is not good it's got me just freaking out for no reason ever I'm gonna have some reasons but I'm taking I'm freaking out to the extreme and I know it's to the extreme I just can't stop it - even though I'm aware of it I can't stop it from happening I just have to kind of try to roll with it and get past it it's kind of like back in the days when I used to you know trip I used to just have to tell myself look this is temporary it's only the trip it's just it's gonna go away so I have to tell I have to try to keep telling myself is this what I'm trying right now is you know medicating Aniki it's only temporary it's gonna change it's gonna go back to normal or you know obviously it's not gonna go back to the way everything used to be because nothing ever does but I just it is what it is so this is what I needed today because this is starting to calm me down it's making me feel a little better physically as well as mentally it's calming very calming I will say that I was pretty I was pretty anxious to worked up at the beginning of this I put on a happy face but I was pretty pretty upset when I started the video so it was nice to get a care package and to have some medicine so it's little things like that to brighten my day little things like that but it's huge to me oh yeah definitely like great pie that's one I'll buy again I don't care what you think about the company now that you just stand myself but there are some things I will buy I'll buy their flour because the press as well I won't vape it I think it's trash for that but it presses well makes good wax so I will buy it for that they're shattered once in a while if it's if it's great pie I'm getting it redheaded stranger I'm getting it um otherwise we'll see but those two all day just because I mean they're expensive for what they are but I like them so it is what it is I gotta be honest you know people can hate everyone you can jump on the bandwagon I hate to I hit on them too because they do have some garbage I'm not gonna lie but the same one oh this is good stuff this is actually the best chatter I've seen from mallero quality and effects it looks fantastic compared to the other stuff it's like this weird green color at least this had a good proper amber I mean it wasn't as clear as I'd like but it was a good proper amber color not that weird green [ __ ] also shut up - mama an ex-con John my business partner and best friend who makes these awesome rise & grind shirts hit him up they are awesome they are comfortable get him in long sleeve get him in short sleeve it don't matter I'll get it in a hoodie man I mean it's not that time of year but uh I wear hoodies all year-round so that's just me I know we're not doing the cannabis festivals but all the products will be available online through us just hit us up we can make that happen hopefully I'll have some prototypes here to show you personally I'm ice to channel otherwise check out ex-con John he's got him up there and some recent videos to show you what we got also like I said Prizm great pie by Alera it's a wind folks overpriced boy win I like it it's good stuff I'm not disappointed at all I actually kind of wish I bought a second one just because this one is pretty good its heady a little unfocused but its heady which is really needed right now is to kind of clear my head or at least clear of the bad stuff so if you are not a subscriber hit that button below we hit 200 thank you all that is freaking amazing I mean it's nothing in the grand scheme of things I'm a little nobody but 200 to me that's freakin unbelievable I never expected to have you know 200 subscribers and that's that's awesome guys

YouTube channel we hit 420 on the YouTube channel and I'll do something crazy maybe I'll give away a piece of glass or you know something we'll think of something the closer we get to 420 we'll brainstorm it but if we can hit 420 this year dude yeah I'll do something I'll do something silly I'll give away something cool just because to me that's that's crazy numbers everyone else look oh and

goes yeah you got another rip in there she's already smoking from this boom I need to go here let's get it set up routes redder zebra like when you get to you this is usually more and more like it gets better damn bro you know using Santa Cruz grab your bike but one day I will do this just by a bro my favorite writer so y'all you're smells I don't even know like what cross like mix middle bread but I'm gonna search that up right now we do that cuz you know we're using my girl's phone so which means that my phone is free go right here and search it up real face on Leafly because that's a good thing you know what is Mendel breath so we can be specific with you guys you know I'm not trying to rate the tip right now strange to lay this one window breath string right here so Amanda Brett 19% of THC we're doing this official now 19% of THC is supposed to give like to make you calm so must be Endicott so minnow breath is an interesting mix of OG Kush breath oh gee cush bread whatever that is yeah that's what this is that's all this she says like right here it says a bunch of other stuff but let you know but it's OG Kush breath and mentos montage that's what it is the two buds that make this this OG Kush breath and mando montage this is on leafy yeah I know simply saying that you don't know is that fire in it for after work you know it's a heavy high powerful body high you know even for me leave this fire reviews everybody likes it top three yep it's mental break even the comments right here it's the the OG key B times the window montage I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right but you know I'm not American [ __ ] it by a middle breath 19 percent THC that's an indica and yeah bro let's get let's roll up now we know what will be smoking which crosses they are red some bayberry don't know what crosses they're so in yeah bruh I gotta drop that video of the real rose and the fake rose for kids like you know at least for me that's an interesting video because I like to know what I'm smoking by LinkedIn the like because I like to smoke roll papers especially like real roll paper and I don't forget she so if I'm smoking think I would like to know at least somebody you know I would like somebody to tell me if I'm smoking on the freakiest shits or not so that video is coming out soon I still got that fake bake in their room I still got it over there and I got a bunch of real ones in you but like you're gonna see the difference oh yes this train is super key for your original like is leaving a lot of Keef right here but like the butt is not drying meaning like when you grind it up it doesn't turn into Keef he just has a lot of trichomes but like this thing you're like you can see that it grinds up nice it does it doesn't turn into like you know dust like I hate weed like that I hate me there's been like dry it out too much then when you break that [ __ ] up you just turns into [ __ ] does this come over in the we do you fam you already she's right too much I am NOT saying like if I get it on smokey real because I've had it personally like you [ __ ] choose I will not get there and I can always choose you just imagine if it's a full game from a dispensary or something like you get with you kisses here you can't even see the plant imagine you get like you buy something from a dispensary over here and you can't see it we're gonna Massachusetts is that some thing only when you get home so the only time I got that [ __ ] dry was from a dispenser and I was like damn Brock paid 60 bills for this [ __ ] and Superdrug 60 I'm gonna do that video to grow that dispensary video like the space reverb versus plug but with this thing like that the spacer is not as fugly you gotta wait outside and [ __ ] [ __ ] that like I want to do a video that I'm going you know show you guys the [ __ ] thing is nicer like today we're gonna use a filter let's see if it fits if you fits in there nice if it doesn't not even gonna force but everybody's coming out to family we got a bunch of videos coming out they're gonna be dope as hell got some more belongs to wait just this Korona [ __ ] pace and the weather get better because I don't really care about this Corona [ __ ] is just the weather here is [ __ ] break and like nobody got time to go outside in this cold nobody nobody like it's trash I'm gonna have to cook this and didn't fit all of it so we're gonna cut this [ __ ] off boom you already know we got dick rolled up maybe I'm a rule all of them up yeah I'm gonna roll all of them up already so well that's the mando right here this aside right there hopefully I don't mix them up all right so now we got the gray pipe this one broke smells super nice I like this I like this smell like it doesn't smell like super gassy but smells fruity like you can smell the grape in there like you know you can smell their little grape in there and the nut structure like to me I don't know like this kind of looks like a sativa but I don't quote me on there cuz you see these nothing like they're hella wrong you're like I don't know kind of looks like mr. t but I mean we're like I'm not sure I'm gonna go over there she knows yeah so these are the notes okay see they're purple in there I don't know why the [ __ ] doesn't focus like that when the camera is nice BFM y'all can see this completely frost out it's like dead it's dance but it's like [ __ ] y'all see like the build quality of the nug like you mentioned let me get one of them those ones look you see kind of looks like a sativa no but damn literally you see the frost on that one oh [ __ ] one fell on the floor see you then [ __ ] it but yeah if MLC oh this one is great pile I see everything right here can we gonna start doing this for the stream reviews we're gonna make it official let's see this see it's a sativa he got 14% of THC not a lot of people know it's a hybrid in cyber yeah it's a hybrid right here it's a hybrid so like you got 14% of THC so it's not as strongly that thought it was cuz like when I smoke this one will look kind of like it doesn't give you a like but it gives you a high just like they like it makes you talk peace it's nice it's nice so yeah this one's just a TV gray pipe comes from the genetics there's a cross of cherry pie in grape stomper then cherry pies fire rubber that [ __ ] is too little well cherry pies fire family already and then grape stomp I've never tried it I never tried this train but if it made this train it must be pretty good because they smoke super nice ish y'all gonna see the ACE that's the only thing that [ __ ] me over ah but yeah the phone I can't ever see this [ __ ] stops recording so I so let's roll one of these two day great pie so it's [ __ ] grape stomper in cherry pie cherry pie op hey cherry pies is very good very dense tree is very nice house ready yeah it's nice the race number I have not tried I've tried the great a stuff like that haven't done a video on it because my before I started a youtube I have video something like on histogram and [ __ ] for sure oh just got to go look for sure I got something that's nailed it make thumbs from this hand there's like what we're using that raw organic I prefer the raw classics but like the only classics I got his King side in the right here Umbra sheet or you smoking a king size right here for King sizes to the face with like right now I'm nothing like I wouldn't have a good time but this wrapper is still like gone rogue Hawaii's founding from Portugal if y'all see them around I'll let you borrow this one but this one mean like this one you went rolling up it already formed the cylinders and I don't understand like how did this got 14% of THC like what the [ __ ] is this [ __ ] gives me like leaves me high but is it hey but you can see the next structure like it's different than the [ __ ] then demand over the middle is just too short take note that she's gonna [ __ ] hit you in the head some fellow here already got two rolled up right now you already have the great I rolled up you know all of them are looking pretty like to the same size okay suicide right yeah yeah I see that come on this demand oh that's the key makes them well I got a flavor you you could tell definitely like if you smoke like Lupita especially like the mimosa brother Moses like when you open up the bank of the mimosa like you know it's mimosa I'm just gonna change up this music gonna put some uni in you want is that Portuguese stuff bro like if you're like the vibes like you respond like on the comments ask for music like we're minute y'all listening to in your vibe but I can tell you every name of the music because this is a Portuguese stuff bro so now I student almost we were talking about that I'm also like to do with the most the more song looks it does not look as appealing as the other ones but on smell beats all of them family got the most orangey smell like daintiest fruitiest smell to it Berlin it's so good and when you smoke it like it tastes you're like yeah you smoke it leaves your mouth feel it's all I ever like so tasty like so far my most aspiring I want activity with an Iceman TV is another only like more dilemma for the got some beats to bro alright alright my wrench I'd been looks at this and look as appealing as the other ones but right when you smoke this you smell this like if you smell this lake is so gassy the the strain like is so dance is so nice it grinds up super perfect smokes even better the ash y'all gonna see I'm not gonna talk about it you already know it suppose you but [ __ ] you boom just a mimosa let's get it somos right here let's see what the cross is my most a two leaf so most of the hybrid two with that 20% of THC good but those are that gays you know it's energizing so you already know like there's more on that sativa side is it is a hybrid but it's more than that sativa side who knew right cuz it looks like a [ __ ] indica rate buggy mimosa so it's herbal piney and citrus this when you get Snell the citrus more row I you just smell like oranges bro is fine young so it's a cross of Clementine in purple punch breath part of the bunch is fire I know what most of us cross with purple poncho so it's Clementine crossed with purple plunge I thought it was changing I thought that this [ __ ] had a little touch of tangi on it oh so it's Clementine and purple punch both with those strings I never tried Clementine I've tried purple punch a bunch of times purple punches on my favorite strangely there's no kind of room under great PyCon is a little smell just a little hint of a vertical punch just a little paint run okay bye yeah you already know so most of there's a mix of what Clementine and purple punch you already know it's a hybrid more on the sativa side cuz it's it's it like it's a lot of like energetic I shall see that Barlow right there yeah she was a changing mix it's Clementine well still fire still Friday if you ask me purple punch a [ __ ] 21 time bro like what you know in this that's why is they have fruity fruity smell good like both of those strangers gotta clean this one and I gotta get a [ __ ] move ring through this and everything fam the smell it's just crazy like it's so strong so you can smell this all day basically if you like oranges like this that's what it smells like bro I like an orange peel I know kid Sheena dropped it right there because it's getting harder to take out of the paper to take out from the tray because the trees didn't feel W maybe this is gonna be like the [ __ ] what's it called the thumbnail okay this is looking nice like every strain in every joint right here - all right so I'm gonna try a different thing let me try to drop it like this this already on the touch like you feel so nice to smell a little like you know put this on a meat like as a little seasoning you're gonna think like that they won't think you salt me or something bro you gonna be like oh you put a little extra touch on the lasers suddenly like something light so we got so you got to wait filters cerebral - without filters to be like 2v2 just to make it equal but then the smoke all the same my effing let me know how you guys doing in the comments let me know what you guys did for 4/20 ah like ya'll commented on my last video to becoming on this one then we gotta let me know no I got you hope you see that video didn't I got and now I didn't even recorded that part like I rolled up like a for grammar three filters on them up or they she was true if you go my histogram you yo can still see it cuz it's AMA how it I don't think you know I think was about merging okay see I always I think what it wasn't all for them but it's still highlights on Instagram so go beep - April low-key dishes my histogram is right there yeah sure right there yes sir yeah you don't forget to subscribe to the channel alright you're watching the video with your photo ligature there subscribe anything if you don't have an account I don't know if you can see this so if you can well just make that account is have Fred we're gonna start getting notifications ah I don't think so good playing you to just say no bye yay we are here well so that one's rolled up damn this one I rolled it tight as [ __ ] I mimosa because this one it is a little bit dry to know kid I was about to grab a lighter and push this down because I used the better for my king sizes but is not in this world I've never seen this I've seen it like looks weirder like but it's nice because it likes the bowls and look on the ball perfectly you don't burn yourself and the joints too sometimes but isn't for me it works better for the mom because you don't burn Yolo I handle so you can see that we got some extra filter so if you sounds Greek sounds a [ __ ] Greek this one is pretty good like it's no super like breath I don't know like it smells Greek yogurt ooh me burn okay but you smell super dude got some touches of purple well smells like a little Greek yogurt okay so let's see what this is let's see the mixture of this so [ __ ] doesn't show any does not have shows only MIPS now we have to stick in the W believe me you got a update you [ __ ] bro I know I mean II thought could be so that shit's a hybrid we're on wheatmadge now we're on wheat maize now so all right all right all right so ii thought goons it's a hybrid it's a cross between Mandarin cookies which we already had in here in cooling OG never tried that never try them and then never try this year but mandarine cook you know I've tried that [ __ ] bro that [ __ ] was like go and I got it on the strain review go feed [ __ ] those people a [ __ ] this is so gas and like smoke Supergirl never tried the cooking cookies ma'am I did not know that this [ __ ] was for again mandarine cookies time enough and now that I reminded myself like it kind of smells like that man the ring dude he's okay buddy God they ain't a big Greek yogurt family you got a Greek yogurt on it okay yo so yeah all right it's a [ __ ] it's a hybrid like I said more on the OG side I don't know how this is a hybrid cos I didn't know cookie was a [ __ ] hell I didn't know cookies was a teeth with cuz like oh jeez not sativa so like the other extraneous who and og og cannot be sativa so the only explanation is that man during cookies is a sativa which I don't think so level let's go to be real fish we see the [ __ ] series what the [ __ ] how many cookies in a row all right ready show the show all right show - oh yeah they sing it's a hybrid - and it's more than 34 side so will I see like on the only free saying there's a cut from the cookie mandarine sunset in the memory cookies it's not saying that it's [ __ ] from the cooler hoji so I don't know which one is right Leafly we we Mabel get your face right I don't know which one is right but I'm gonna go that the right one is the hybrid so both of them are hybrids both of them say that it's hybrid so this high it is Mandarin cookies so that's what I'm going for a nice tight cookie bro that's their fire so let's go we won't roll that [ __ ] up I did not know that bro but now that they say it kind of smells like their mandarine cuz I had that go chamber interview outer lash that weed was beautiful beautifully y'all go and check that I think that was my first string of you was with that string in another one in

gonna mosey or let's go with the memos just town which is amazing - mimosas I feel like our head mimosa before I just never did a stream of you because I was smoking before no camping when you exhale family like dogs y'all roll this you help you see like you rolled up pretty nicely you see that roll paper the edge already like you know the etched compared to the other ones like saw some other ones like the middle bread for me the edge was the best one on there one the other ones kind of laid me down on the edge but they're not harsh bro that's the thing like this amazing but in case you usually means they like that is hard you know and it's not enjoyable to smoke imagine if it's breakage and it goes out like a [ __ ] always gotta be lighted that's some [ __ ] that's like oh there's like a citizen blade itching like you still gotta relight it every time I read we'd like day bro Grape Ape I faked Grape Ape like that bro I don't know like if you're a great ape and it was good but mine was not a good family did not burn right oh it's harsh as [ __ ] super dark ish like it was another bad let me know if you ever try this [ __ ] bro this videos gonna be long okay that was probably like already because he ran out of storage on there so then my [ __ ] ran out of storage now I got if I said better in my bed then I better eat [ __ ] stories every night his face like on the [ __ ] on the recording day so I had to switch to this one cuz I don't got a camera but you gotta do what you gotta do to you either came on this one I didn't show you the edge but the edge you already like it's these kind of salt and paper and more than a paper side okay all right it was a little bit hard from that one I'm not gonna lie give a little a little think like a little I don't know what the [ __ ] to silly give a little something on the throw the flavor brothers that's the thing like your mouth just waters because it's just so flavorful and I imagine like if this was grown right like imagine if it was like completely why - it will be over it'll be over but because it's not you know we gotta be fair with you my motion okay yeah the night so far still growers fold because [ __ ] they try to rush the plane and this is what happens don't rush the plane let it grow bro you growing so let it grow bro don't rush you saw the middle rate the men do we didn't rush it the [ __ ] move trying to make a Facebook is not worth it make good smoke is worth it cuz then you'll smoke it too and then you go me like their bro they were the like that was worth to it the extra week or flesh the extra time or whatever the [ __ ] y'all do the gig why - do it bro cuz they're for us smokers givers like imagine not like it doesn't give us nothing but like you know when you smoke it's not gonna be hard

day", "-2P1EqQN2m0": "hey everyone santa cruz weedman here coming to you again from santa cruz california um today i'm bringing you my 21st cannabis review and excited to be able to share a new product with you from a company that i haven't tried before and haven't heard of until i picked this up at um kind people's which is my local dispensary so yeah let's go ahead and get into it um this is uh cana bay is the company cana bay coastal cannabis premium indoor flower it's an eighth so 3.5 grams it's uh 50 before tax of kind people's two locations in santa cruz that's where i got it and then uh we'll be smoking out of this bowl today this is an ice spoon silicone pipe so pretty rad we'll talk a little bit more about this but this is also available at kind people's for 25 before tax so i already um have been using this flour for about a day so i can give you a really good idea of the aromas flavors and effects and benefits as well so i put the flour the remaining flour in the mason jar as you can see right there um the buds are really fluffy um they're dense they they smell really nice they're nice and light and there's really uh nice colors of like purple and orange so let me uh i'll grab a bud here i can show you not sure well you can make that out but um yeah it's a really really beautiful buds uh for this one and um the strain is grape pie number four there it is it's uh coming in at 24.66 thc so certainly high testing as far as flour goes um it's an indica dominant uh hybrid strain and it's a cross between grape pie and chem 4 uh and yeah um so let's go ahead and talk a little bit about uh the bowl before we start smoking on it and get a little more into the aromas and flavors and effects so this is called an iced spoon silicone pipe it's silicone so it's bendable it comes with this little tool a little poker in the back so super compact has everything you need really easy to use you can take this back part off and then you can store flour um i mean it's it's pretty small so you know not much maybe a little bit of flour some key for some wax in there but definitely a cool design and then something really interesting i recently saw on their uh ice the company instagram page is uh so you can take this plastic part of the plastic bowl out and they have a replacement that turns this into a dab rig which is totally awesome i mean you can just switch it back so definitely a really cool product and a really cool company so i encourage you to check them out ice i'm going to put the link to the company site in the description of this video so yeah definitely go check them out um i've already ground some of this grape pie number four with my santa cruz shredder here and yes we'll pack a bowl and start talking about some of the flavors on this so like i mentioned that the aromas are really nice it has a great smell to it it's kind of this uh grape uh which you know obviously isn't the name the the grape pie number four it has this grape citrus a little bit of orange um kind of smell to it yeah um and uh a little bit of that like lavender kind of flowery smell also um but overall really really nice all right cheers everyone yeah so good smoke nice and smooth it has great flavors very very similar to the aromas uh the the flavors um are that of that kind of citrusy and and grape and i'm also noticing um this kind of like almost like a pie crust type of flavor yeah a little bit of pie crust a little bit of this like campfire timber um maybe a little bit of cinnamon a little bit of pine too um pretty pretty uh you know um it definitely has a variety of flavors this this strain and same with the aromas too but it's so it's blended so well makes you want to keep hitting it to try to figure out kind of what's going on with those flavors but that's what i would say for it for the flavors um a pie crust kind of wood pine timber a little bit of grape um but really really nice the aromas and flavors are are both both great so let's talk about the terpenes a little bit um there's a lot of terpenes in this one so if you go to the cana bay um the company site you're gonna see they put all their products up there lab results um all the pertinent information which is really cool kudos to kanabe it's very similar to what raw garden does but um i didn't want to uh kind of um take up this video with all the the whole extensive list of terpenes i'm just going to name the the major ones that make up the the grape pie number four so we have our myrsine most common terpene found in cannabis that's responsible for your clove and herbal and earthy flavors and aromas known for couch lock effect in the indica strains and then promotes a feeling of calmness you have your limonene which is citrus and known for helping with stress and anxiety relief your karyofeline which is your pepper and spice flavors and that's known to have anti-inflammatory benefits your pinene which is your pine aromas and flavors exactly what it sounds like and that's used for pain inflammation and then anxiety and stress as well and then finally your linalool which is a floral kind of lavender aroma which is what i mentioned you kind of get a little bit in the aromas and that is known for promoting calming effects and most widely used for stress relief so uh there's even more than that like i mentioned definitely a major list of terpenes and you can certainly feel it in the effects and can taste it and smell when it comes to the flavors and aromas but overall really really really good strain yeah so we'll go ahead and use the poker that stores easily in the back of this ice spoon silicone pipe here um to ash out the first bowl we'll pack a second one as we kind of get more into the effects [Music] of this grape gotta make sure i'm getting it right here great pie number four yes yeah so super easy like i mentioned you have the poker that just you just pop it right in and out of the back like that um just stays so really really easy they did a great job ice did a great job designing these products and they have a lot more on their sites like i mentioned in the description to this video go ahead and check out the ice website and just you know take a gander at all the products they offer it really is you know some some really really cool innovative stuff for sure alrighty so um like i mentioned before uh and with all these reviews i i use the product for about a day so i can give you a really good idea of what the effects are because sometimes it takes a little while for these effects to set in and for the benefits to really hit you um so for this one the effects are definitely uh relaxation uplifting feeling uh definitely um there's there's a modest kind of euphoria that intensifies with each hit also and from this too i notice a nice feeling of kind of uh increased happiness and creativity as well um indica dominant hybrid but um it's definitely good for you know it totally relaxes me calms me down good for just mellowing out but at the same time it has that sativa side of it that enhances your your feelings of happiness kind of uplifts you a little bit and it helps with creativity as well so definitely a good variety good array of different effects with this stream and then as far as the benefits go i'd say this is really good for stress anxiety um pain excuse me depression and then maybe insomnia as well just because it has certainly those kind of indica traits with just mellowing you out and uh this uh strain in particular too it's it's one of those interesting ones where when you kind of first start using it you're going to feel more uplifted but as you keep using it as it hits you harder and harder as it kind of sets in um it'll definitely kind of induce more of those sleepy calming relaxation indica effects so it's a little bit of a of a ride a roller coaster ride with the grape pie number four but i'm certainly a fan of it i really like it a lot yeah but definitely uh uh you know super good strain and um it's local they cultivate moss landing only an hour south of santa cruz so i always find that super interesting and and nice about um these these different companies so i'm giving this great pie number for a 9.5 out of 10 uh cannabe great pie number four once again we use the ice spoon silicone pipe mason jar courtesy of kind peoples um you can pick this up at kind people's this a 3.5 grams for 50 before tax both kind people's locations and this ice silicone pipe for 25 or 19.99 on their site so go ahead and click on the link in the description of this video we've got our santa cruz shredder please go check out santacruzweedman.com i'm gonna put the link to my site in the description as well and i will post the write up and

there's gonna be a few of these coming up as I'm stocking up right now you know I'm trying to get ahead of the curve and not running out so there's some new stuff coming down the pike anyway with that said here is what we are here for today Alera grape pie flower now everybody knows I'm not the hugest fan of Alera but I will also be honest and say that lately they have been stepping up their game this is a small buds quarter I've never gotten a chance to pick one up and I've never seen him by Alera I got God it's thought what the hell it was $90 for a quarter about yeah not normally something I'd pick up but I wanted some great pie so I thought what the hell small buds they don't bother me so oh it's very fresh very fresh indeed we're looking at like what the 18th or 19th of February this was packaged February 12th we all know Alerus packaging is extremely basic their labels are really basic THC a twenty two point two one three CBD a zero that's all it says it's an indica that's what I like I did some homework it's a cross between grape stopper and cherry pie sounds good so let's uh here we go cracking tour and see what we got here No very nice oh definitely grapey definitely grapey so I don't know if you can see I don't know the lights really [ __ ] but it's a nice full jar you keep some of these buds out here tons of little popcorn butts tons of them maybe that's what it's supposed to be small buds but I mean these are these are really nice they're purple there's actual purple and you know I've seen a lot of stuff where it's odds and the Purple's coming and there's none but this is actually purple you know it's dry typical of Alera but it's much better quality than you know their old stuff this is they're stepping their game up even these small buds they're really nice they're well trimmed they smell fantastic if the taste and the effects are half as good as they look and smell I'll be happy very very happy so with that said let's tear into it see how it is got a little bit of a headache getting ready for bed so hopefully this helps with both unwinding and getting rid of my headache love that smell skunky funky and if I can smell the grape hopefully I can taste the grape because I've heard nothing but good things about this grape pie from other people but other people are not me and you know I like to judge things for myself I do take advice from other people but sometimes with a grain of salt just because I have you know different my body reacts differently in certain things I have an extremely high metabolism generally speaking I process things really fast and just the way it is cheers folks mmm little sweet fruity but earthy taste the cherry interesting very interesting there's the grape yeah Jason Jimmy Jason I like it I like it kind of a floral after note yeah but taste is good yeah it does taste good smells good it tastes good it's smooth there's no real throat burn which is pretty damned awesome well and we'll say this you can definitely taste the grape yeah the nugs are nice and frosty no hints there's none of that mold crap that we were talking about before yeah these look good they're not all STEMI and yeah there's a little bit of sugar leaf in there and this a little bit of Keef stuck to the sides of the plastic cuz you know how that goes to these plastic jars particularly the Alera ones though I don't know what it is but oh well I knew what I was getting into and I bought it so no complaints here I'm actually pleased I'm glad I bought a quarter of this I ordered the press today nug Smasher Mini 2 so that's coming within the next week hopefully and I'm gonna save some of this rehydrate it and press it see what I get for results I'm not expecting a lot because it's dry tool era but what the hell right I'll give it a shot that's kind of why I bought the small bud quarter was ooh I can you know vape half and press half so right off the bat I'm already I haven't even had that much really not even halfway through this and I'm already eight minutes in and kind of feeling the effects kind unfocused I'm heady a bit rambley and relaxed man I like that flavor not bad Alera not bad this is one of your better ones right here grape pie grape stopper cherry pie not a bad cross guys quality is improving still want to see moisture packs or something but definitely not as dry as before it's not powder it's not crumbling to dust it's um workable material yeah I'm gonna call this one a win guys all day long definitely a good indica for the evening I I don't even want to finish my video I think kind of want it that's horrible this is the first time that's really happened right just like I have a bucket oh yeah watch TV but I'm gonna keep going cuz that's what I'm here for um anyway guys like I said I got the press coming I'm gonna start practicing with that learning it's I get it guys there's all kinds of presses out there all kinds of price ranges I don't want to hear it guys I don't want to talk crap I did research I picked the one I picked for a reason it's a starter press it's portable lifetime warranty and I can trade it in when I am want to upgrade these are things I took into account guys I understand I can only press so much I get that I I'm not intending to right now at any point to press more than three and a half grams at this time later on I'll do one that's you know 14 grams or whatever but right now three and a half plenty so guys before you even get into all that I appreciate it I just don't want to hear it I got what I got and that's what I've got there's no going back now I'm learning well from this this is the one I wanted to start with after doing my research on different brands the other thing is I didn't want to wait six months lead time I wanted one now so I can use it now so that's the way it is guys so be looking for that I'm not gonna unbox it on camera and press I'm going to do that and learn my first time on my own because it's gonna take time we have to read the manual I don't have hours to sit here on camera it's just not going to happen I'm gonna read the manual it's just how I am I'm gonna go through and we're going to do this and then I'll go come up be like hey guys look I got this was my first result it's in the notebook now let's press for you guys so it is what it is Cheers oh yeah yeah definitely I'm a fan of this grape I it took me in a whole different direction that's not going planning on going anything stick to take the whole tangent on the press but it's important because it is coming up and it's gonna become part of the channels so yeah I'm hoping to bring it with me to cannafest maybe press some hemp CBD flower there you know that kind of thing but all right guys this stuff is fantastic it's Alera so it's crazy but great pie all day long it's outstanding for for a Lera its outstanding the effects are what I wanted they came on faster than I expected they're a little stronger than I expected which is a good thing I mean I'm I can see it I'm lit which is not easy for me to do them on flower but you know this is good Alera is improving guys don't count them out yet I mean we all talk [ __ ] but we got to give credit where it's due guys they're trying and they are making strides in the right direction so I'm gonna call that right there guys [Applause] Alera grape pie it's a win $90 for a small bud quarter or $50 for a regular eighth normally I wouldn't go for it being a Lera bud grape pie I'm gonna get it every time guys and if you are not a subscriber please hit that button below if

flavor it's like a realistic grape flavor good thing I'm sitting on my bed so like I passed the [ __ ] out it's got like that tiny bit of like grape flavor to it it's not very strong it's got more of the earthy flavors to it all right and [ __ ] high I'm getting some hints that still taste like a baked like a pastry sugary kind of taste you at Tunes I'm like pastry like a Danish or something like if it tastes like a great Danish like one that got thrown in some grass you know like a tease like I don't yeah thank you guys for watching this sorry I decided I was too impatient I'm not sorry about

know we'll smoke it and talk about it I obviously got this stuff from bubble modes this is from a whole plant fresh frozen run I gave him this cut of the cookies and cream that I you know pop the seeds from a while back and I gave him a cut and he decided to wash it and it came out amazing I cannot talk about enough how much this stuff is fire super surprised this is a fee no I hadn't washed before so I mean I thought it was just I thought it was just a strain that would look good in the bag I didn't think it was this washable I mean I have a different fee know that I was washing and sifting I don't know which one is better I think the one I have still is better for sift but I might have to give that one another try obviously it was I mean everything whole plant fresh frozen means that it was chopped down and went straight in the freezer even the top coalos we're not just talking about trim and then larf this is like top rock-hard colas going in there too I did a similar run with the pineapple Express where I I mean I washed everything about it and it's drying right now I'll probably smoke some on the show with the later date because is like the first time that I did it and it came out absolutely phenomenal I'm gonna check it that out it's amazing or what oh my god look at that and again I mean the camera it's it looks phenomenal on camera but the camera still isn't doing it justice like it is it's like white white this this light kind of makes it look a little yellowish I mean when you pour this stuff out it is stark white super impressive pretty stable he was worried that it was still a little wet so we'll give that a shot and see if it is if it is it's not a big deal I was kind of impatient anyway I said he'd been drying it for like Oh ten days or so and he still wasn't sure if it was dry which was crazy I know his room is spot on so I mean it's in the mid 30s as far as humidity which should be drying hash out in definitely seven days but this strain just might be that greasy I have a couple of people that were asking me if it's worth it to wash whole plant I mean it's kinda not like BHO where you're gonna get a higher yield because it's Bud like it's pretty much gonna be about the same yield you would have got off a tram which is discouraging but I feel like the hash is better mean you're gonna get the same amount of total weight and resin but I think there's gonna be more heads in the bags that more heads in the bags that are good so there's gonna be more 90 more 70 less 25 yeah and even I mean my experience with whole plant I mean this isn't a hundred percent of the time but it seems like even the 190 and the 160 seem to be extremely better than then they would have been just off of trim mainly because you know the 160 and 190 bag are on and you let you guys take a peek at that I know you guys like the hash for him hmm good clear one before yeah really nice glistening juice the 160 and the 190 are like you know they're for bigger particulates realistically but when you watch whole plant it seems like there's more mature heads on there so there might be some big bulbous turkey heads that end up landing in there and I've seen some 190 melt like five six star same thing with 160 which is is rare if you're washing hash and trim I think I think whenever I do trim runs it seems like that 190 is a little green and the 160 is maybe a little bit lighter but same kind of texture when it comes to the the hash kind of gritty and you know fiber risk I mean you could already see this stuff I mean it is like see-through so yeah when people ask me hey am I gonna get a better yield with with nugs I generally just tell them no because you're not really you might get more six-star but not very much more it'll definitely beter beer and now that rosin is in the game it really is more no prevalent because if you take all that lower grade hash that you normally wouldn't smoke and you just rosin it up and it turns into six star or better I guess some people claim some people like to call it seven star or I've even heard somebody call their resin ten star which is kind of silly no again didn't really have too much terribly to talk about today I was going to put up another video instead but I hadn't done any of these cache reviews in a while and I got gifted this stuff I got some other stuff too I gotta ask him what the names are for it I he called it something but didn't write it on the thing so god the smell is just so cookies-and-cream if you guys have ever had the strain it's really like super cleaner a little bit of cookies in there but just heavy with with like a cleanness and if you've ever had any of exotic genetics crosses that Starfighter that starfighters creaminess definitely carries on you gotta go nailed it all right pack them a little bit extra on there probably would have taken this a two hits normally but I don't want to get it's the first thing in the morning I want to get a nice juicy one for yours so again thank you bubble modes really appreciate these type of gift this guy makes awesome hash I can't really say that enough one of the most humble guys I've ever met and he really started off just not knowing much at all about you know extracts and just cannabis in general and he's gone from like zero to a hundred in and just you know over a year and I'm just super super impressed with the product that he is churning out yeah look out for this guy dude this guy is killing the hash man for sure I always loved to see new products coming out of his corner they're definitely worth the time to check out the quick smoke on I think that's pretty much all I wanted to talk about if you guys have any questions or comments feel free to leave them down below I do not mind answering them I'll try to keep it positive though there's been a couple trolls hanging around you know basically just saying my hash is garbage which is kind of silly to me but everybody's entitled to their own opinion but to those people I really don't know why you stick around and watch my videos I I know I have to be long-winded and just unpleasant to watch if you're not enjoying the content so I would just maybe not watch the video if you don't like it just the suggestion though by all means come and spend 20 minutes to hate let's just take another look at this stuff I mean I wish I could shine a light through it for you guys it's super duper clear exciting alright cookies-and-cream whole plant fresh frozen Cheers oh man super Turkey Wow such a Perla just to even be sampling that but do you believe that this is the 90 you obviously the makers stash a lot of people don't get to try this bag and definitely that's where all the good stuff lives such a creamy flavor if you haven't had a chance to just try some of exotics genetics you know cookies and cream Kimbo Kush and I know he has a new dessert menu coming out for his seed line but the cookies & creme Kimbo coach are just so flavorful I know that he's been winning cups with that also look at the screen here is that not an insane melt I mean ah just straight juice but I definitely would call that six-star and I wouldn't enjoy getting more of that I would smoke that every day it's absolutely a pleasure mmm Lim cleanliness to start the morning I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll catch you next time", "HRhYgCOtrz0": "so i'm gonna be making a tincture today uh using everclear and some of the pucks i have left over from pressing yeah and don't worry guys uh nylon doesn't dissolve in you know alcohol unless you're adding extreme heat so i'll add a few more and then i think uh we're ready to add the everclear that's why i didn't play basketball all right so now i'm going to add the everclear and pretty much fill it up to the top so yeah guys like i said earlier uh you don't have to worry the nylon's not gonna dissolve in the alcohol so yeah uh i'm sure i'm still gonna get a few comments even though i've said it twice now but [Music] all right so got it to pretty much where i want it and uh just put the lid on just going to make sure the lid's uh nice and tight so you can take a quick look i'll let this jar sit for a week until i touch it again [Music] so after the week i'll take it out and see if it's ready to use or if i want to use heat to expedite the process so yeah that's how i go about making my tinctures take it easy guys", "AORyULfIRe0": "yo yo yo what's good youtube welcome to another live stream i'm going to raise you up just a bit sweet so gopro updated and um my new wi-fi router is in we're showing signal strength here for the stream decent it didn't show that before so now that's pretty good to see anyways let me go ahead and share the link out to instagram and we're going to go ahead and get started uh all right cool well glad we got that up and running let me go ahead and uh get this stream up on my computer oh you're right let's see i'm sure you guys want to see some of this stuff that i have here before we even get started right let me show you what we got going on first of all we weighed everything out earlier we uh pulled it out of the freeze dryer fresh this morning fat fat nineteen point four percent yield killed it one thousand one hundred and thirty grams of nug went in 220 grams of full spectrum hash came out as well as 19 grams of 25 and 160 micron so this is our test press that we use for edibles and then we'll go ahead and press out the rest of these full spectrum pucks i loaded them by hand into the bags and then after putting them in the bags i pressed them down in a rosin evolution pre-press to make sure that they stayed nice and tight and they are evenly distributed went up from uh the small little four ounce jars and uh upgraded to the six ounce jars i got tired of filling those little small ones to the brim and i said it's time to upgrade baby so we got the jar all weighed out we'll be able to weigh this when we're done tonight and see what our final yield was on this run now i'm a big fan of doing my presses a little bit warmer than what most people would i'm using my stool for you guys today so i'm gonna do this but um yeah you guys that watch me often know i will press anywhere from 200 to 225 depending on the cultivar depending on the hash um not all hash comes out the same um for example we talked about trichome density before right we talked about just because it looks like a lot of hash it may not be a lot of hash because um the oil inside may not be full you know what i'm saying the trichome may just be partially full in that case it's fluffy hash where it looks like a lot but it doesn't weigh a lot that's why this 25 micron and this 160 micron it looks like a large puck but it only weighs 19 grams compared to this puck which is smaller in comparison by about a centimeter right and it's not as fat but it weighs more probably about five to six grams more and that's because this is the full spectrum 45 through the 159 which contains higher density trichomes that are full of milk oil compared to the 25 and 160. so just a little throw that in there for you interior genetics what's going on asteroid farms if you guys aren't following asteroid farms on instagram go follow so old homie of mine platinum grove colorado who used to have a really pimp-ass girl room the nasa lab right um one of the inspirations for me initially stepping up my garden well now it's his turn to come back and he just got a brand new house with a nice ass basement and guess what it's time for a brand new build out so we're gonna help each other out take some ideas off of each other and i'm basically gonna have him record the whole thing and um show you guys how he does his build out you know and he'll give you guys pointers along the way and uh you know show you how to build a grow room so by the time you know he's done with that uh build out i'll be done uploading my video on how when i built out my grow room and uh his will be pretty much part two of a series that i'm going to be doing where it's going to be either build-outs brand new or remodels or upgrades and you guys will be able to pay for each episode um individually and absorb all the information that went into that whole build or remodel so it was actually his idea and we're gonna do his build out as episode two so it's gonna be awesome it's gonna have amazing information in there and it's gonna be great for you guys because instead of just seeing my room all the time and you're like oh that's great but not everybody has your room like yours or not everybody has a layout like yours you'll get to see different layouts different places different um climates right you're gonna get to see it all and you're gonna get to see the different thought process that goes into building these so it's gonna be really cool but anyways go check out his instagram because he's already started posting updates on it and it's not often that you get to jump on board and watch it build out brand new from the start most of the time you hop in and it's like uh the person's halfway done they've already done a bunch of [ __ ] you kind of like feel like the new guy you know what i'm saying in a crowd of old guys that been around for a long time now's your chance to get in on the bottom floor be one of those old guys he's been there forever by the time he gets done finishing you could be like i was there when you were still drawing the blueprints yo whippersnapper some of this blue icy and then i'm going to glove up the press is set to 175. we're going to do a low temp press on our test bag it's not going to be a clear indication of how the full spectrum is going to respond but it's going to give me a good enough idea to know whether or not 175 is going to provide the flow i'm looking for or if i'm going to need to go up to my 204 temperature 202 maybe i will put a link up right now i'm not sure that you guys can do it that's what's up jinder mah what's up dude i haven't seen you in forever holy moly so yeah check out asteroid farms what's going on viper what's up slug upstate what's going on we're just giving everybody a minute to trickle on in taking dabs we're enjoying life i haven't even taken a dab with you guys yet have i ah let's take a dab i'm gonna go in on some of this blue icy first oh let's get in there who wants to get in those guts with me we've got 31 left on this battery oh let's get in there the gopro doesn't focus well close up so you guys are gonna take what you get and be happy all right first time catching a live stream viper you caught a very good live stream for your first live stream this whole live stream i've already prepped all my parchment i prepped all my bags normally i'm not this prepped normally i still have full parchment and [ __ ] i wiped down the plates i'm ready to go baby it's waiting on you guys i mean what do you think we're about to press a half pound of hash a half pound cheers at 413 on the email okay ah that blue icy i swear on the exhale it tastes just like a blue icy it is so crazy every time it never fails what's up easy labs green ranger nashville how you doing freshly pressed what's up annie oh gee what's up hidden creek we got the whole [ __ ] family here i think i'm gonna do a live stream prank and start a live stream pressing hash with the hair straightener so we can get a million people asking oh no what happened did the press break fantastic so huh all righty all righty all righty let's swap out the battery you already know we got it we gotta swap out the battery we don't want it to die it'll be another short live stream i had to find it i couldn't forget i couldn't remember where the [ __ ] i put it down now i can't remember which batteries are charged now let's see lucky number nothing they'd be lying sometimes you got to pull them out and pop them back in they're not lying tonight [ __ ] [ __ ] well one of you's got to be higher than 25 [ __ ] percent let's find out i i don't feel comfortable knowing i've got 25 percent left on the battery i just took a fat ass dab and i'm about to start pressing i'm gonna get excited forget and this is gonna die by the way if the stream does go down unexpectedly please stay tuned because i will bring it right back up this is a non-stop party tonight that battery was at 100 you [ __ ] lying ass charger all right all right so for those of you that are new here i do a [ __ ] ton in a very small space so this is where i'm going to be collecting at when i'm all done here okay we're gonna move some [ __ ] out of the way shout out to roz and inc i want you guys to look at something real close here custom product for who that is who has bags like that who has bags like that do you want to know why he carries these two and a half by four and a half bags hey cuz of me baby who wants some bags i know some of you press and some of you need some bags all right anyways we've got parchment laid out we've got our bags ready to go okay and here you guys are going to go you're going to go right here look at that just for you how's that view yeah you could just chill set you down now is a good time if you got to use the restroom you got to go grab a drink you know what i'm saying whatever you got to do go handle that let me figure out this lighting i don't want it to be too bright for you guys oh [ __ ] that's too bright all right i feel good about this you guys are ordering from rosin inc make sure you guys use my coupon codes they're on my site solventlessbnb.com let's get ready get up there get up there just a little love from my homie right there you know all right remember you guys we're gonna be doing the 160 micron and the 25 micron mixed together as a test press before we move on to the full spectrum presses here we have the uh [ __ ] puck come on turn on screen doesn't recognize my gloves oh well anyways i hope that you guys were able to see that now this uh this is just some uh edibles mix of some uh the last strain that i pressed out which is the grape cosby little dark but it is [ __ ] chirpy and delicious and it will do amazing for edibles because the flavor that it will add is not too over the top but it's definitely like you notice it notice it so we're going to drip this into that edibles jar this is probably not going to flow crazy this is a test press a low temp test press at 175 all right i honestly feel like i should go up a little so so so so oh that looks like it's gonna be good well i think i found the temperature i'm gonna try for the first full spectrum maybe it'll flow a little bit more i'll take it for edibles siezer um don't worry that was just a plate on top of the press jumping around my cold plate up there good extraction well the flow was okay wasn't quite what i want it's kind of a weird flow so all right well not quite what i'm looking for believe it or not 185 that's gonna give me that awkward drip i'm gonna hold pull my audience to see what you guys think the temperature is that i'm gonna go with i already know what i'm going with i'm gonna go with uh my usual all right well we're gonna go ahead and do the first full uh spec press now all the same size that one was at 175. small bag we'll do this one first oh jesus 224 no too high 202 202 202 that's that's where i'm feeling 202 today i can feel it in my huevos rancheros pressing some cool spectrum once cash baby all right the room temperature is 74 degrees i do not believe in running a cold room during the pressing stage now bear with me you guys this is going to be a tad bit awkward as i have to deal with not only the um press this new jar which is larger and doesn't sit on the edge so i have to hold it like this in fact i don't even know what your viewpoint is now does that make sense right there where it's at for you guys i mean all right here we go we're at 191.1 191.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 six that's how slow my press heats up i love it i don't care what anybody says it doesn't overshoot temperatures during pressing because it sleeps it heats up slowly it doesn't like jump up all crazy because it has some overpowered 150 to 200 watt heaters it just has two 100 watt heaters nicely spaced out let's take a dab again next time tomorrow it sounds delicious this [ __ ] is like caramel taffy uh oh uh oh ah excuse me i felt like my nose was gonna run all over camera i didn't want that oh yeah what's up mommy my [ __ ] that'll do good that'll do oh that gets the job done i'll tell you what how you guys feeling about this prize we're at 199.7 199.7.8.9 200. 201 i'm not there and dad just [ __ ] knock me on my ass about let's get ready to remove look at that still plenty of paper towel left to clean bangers with throw that away save that puffing my man it's a good night when my boy puffin comes to visit you're pressing yourself right now huh hell yeah get it dog we are warmed up to 202 degrees let's go this is gonna be a second test press slightly lower than my normal but for some reason i'm feeling this temperature why i saw gonza say 204 and i'm like yeah yeah that's my normal i feel it but then all of a sudden my balls rumbled and spoke to me from deep within and they said no 202 now they're all right [ __ ] it the balls haven't lied yet oh what would you look at that there already me gusta come here come to daddy a little [ __ ] go what i say i knew it i felt it i felt it in my huevos rancheros oh yeah let's get messy somebody's got to make a meme out of the next big bag that squirts all over this jar so i'm feeling good about that that's a fish grab that and we're gonna move this over here i'll turn you right now 202 my [ __ ] i want to know did i get it all did i oh man that was a beautiful extraction 202 good job balls sometimes it's in your brains sometimes it's in your balls tonight it was in my balls oh check your insta i just saw you let me see let's let's see what am i checking your story i don't know maybe i jumped in at the wrong part of that conversation oh elevated uh nah there wasn't a lot on the parchment there was barely anything in here really maybe like two to three grams that was a small piece of uh that was small and that was 19 grams in there and uh [ __ ] dude not a lot left in there it's all over the [ __ ] sides of this jar is where it's at you guys want to see a big squirt huh all right let's get it gotta get off this cyber dream stuff though um all right let's get it big old fatty this one feels like a 27-30-ish somewhere in there all right let's go i don't want to listen to trap sorry i gotta get i gotta get the right music on first this is bothering me put on some good old tj hotto all right let's go i'm gonna fold this one down the center i just pinch it crease it down the center diagonal the other diagonals and that gives you kind of like a good flow right there already and then you just pinch the sides together and it's like let me check my battery here 85 percent go dude i'm all smoking one squeeze okay shout out to my man mysticalgo my official artist on sbnb records back down oh yep bomb extraction on that one let's go cross mountain ranges split cells of tomorrow it flowed so well there's like not even that much on the paper let us go yes uh let's keep this party [ __ ] going good over here peace i think i put some information in the description maybe i didn't add that i guess but 25 micron double bag from rosin inc for the uh for the bags my bad y'all i tried to put some information in there and i left out that one yo if you guys can't catch the live streams sign up for my patreon i upload them there so come to daddy um is i'm the master of my own fate i determine my own yield i grew the flowers this is the source of the single i am my own god excuse you uh is that's why i keep the ends of these parchment pieces wrap them over the parchment paper i wish i could slow this down listen listen did you [ __ ] catch it though my man [ __ ] threw it in putting him on game yo understand he let y'all know i'm putting y'all on game for free i'm gonna i'm gonna take it back one time is it too loud uh um let's go ladies and gentlemen it's time to flow i'm gonna bring you guys back some i feel like i'm not bad hold on you guys don't really need that flashlight i don't think anyways let me take it off and passed wrench squad hold it down here's a pro tip on really fat pucks make sure you leave a little extra space behind the puck so that you don't get a blowout but i can mute it that's fine didn't need that light but i'm not liking how that's lining up on the [ __ ] plates i'm gonna move it over just a tad real quick like uh is i go go go go go real big extraction what is it [ __ ] this one's really done i'm calling it now it's gonna be a dumper is nobody [ __ ] with you you know what as a kid i actually did like origami and [ __ ] you know what was better than origami paper [ __ ] planes god damn it paper planes with a [ __ ] i could fold all types of paper planes you guys when i was a kid not now you know why i can't do it now because i lost the book i didn't look that [ __ ] up read that [ __ ] in the book you know what i mean books are cool as [ __ ] you can learn how to make paper airplanes and [ __ ] who would have thought mm-hmm starting to get good at this [ __ ] so um okay well brown is foreign i until you quit this next one's gonna squirt like a [ __ ] so um okay i have that camera ready i'm gonna record this one on my phone i'm not sure how i'ma do it watch me money money all the time hey money please no worries it's only 200 degrees touch it with your [ __ ] hands that sense sorry i'm trying to align this a little bit differently here safety reasons there it is my press has a ram that can adjust positions so um it's a little bit different than most the ram isn't stationary which means that it can come out of alignment sometimes if i move it or whatever but it's all we're helping to make good taking care of your summer projects is a breeze bam summer savings on all your favorite brands make things even easier so freshen up the deck and fire up the grill summer's here and it's as close as your home yard get more done let's get it i've used this prosper [ __ ] ever you're biking like five years now i just let go of the [ __ ] bar my bad you guys the camera is on a very unsteady amount kinda i don't have the tripod leg spread out very well all right is to the place whoa the puck slit in the plates when i was adjusting it apparently almost popped out of the front no blow out though but i gotta pull it out real quick and readjust it i'm so glad that didn't blow out but somehow that slipped out that's a trip i'm so happy that i didn't blow out that's crazy what the [ __ ] i've never had that happened that's a trip that's a trip son experience saved for real he wouldn't would he he [ __ ] would let's go back on the plates you go you son of a [ __ ] that was a trippy trip trippy trip trip this thing is about i was like why is it not going like it should be leaking way more and then all of a sudden the handle slipped and i was like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] what happened put that back on the plate for a second up a let that so hmm who's your daddy who's your daddy what a safe uh is before oh yeah good extraction i'll take it oh yeah let's power through it two more to go parchment gets added to the jar everything i want everything together mixed together equal even steven the stuff that sticks to the parchment might be different terpenes might be different different [ __ ] you know you don't want to leave it out shop from the comfort of your home at sprint.com that's not a lot of work bro i know i'm saying it's already time to upgrade the jar again i just got this damn jar i'm upset it's not fun i thought for sure it was going to be good enough we knew get a bigger drawer uh bertha it's time to go squirtle what the [ __ ] it did it again something's going on here is it sliding something's happening here there's no blowout but it's sliding off pressure's not being applied evenly to the plates somehow or they're too tight or i pre-packed them at an angle never had this happen okay i know what i'm about to do fix this i'm going to have to increase the pressure even slower every problem there is a solution hmm leaned on him to apply pressure for the pre-press by doing it evenly i had to have been time to upgrade and put my bigger plates on i guess for these bigger presses right inside there i hope you guys are watching this if you guys aren't [ __ ] paying attention i don't know what you're doing right now when i mess up that's when you guys need to pay attention because i don't mess up very often not to sound cocky whatsoever but i don't so if i make a mistake that's resulting in some type of mess up it would benefit everybody around me to pay attention and realize what i'm doing wrong so i got my light that's fine before i make sure i got the jar underneath there i didn't think it was going to squirt like that still this parchment is heavy from the [ __ ] first part of the press but it's still flowing good that's all that matters and no blowout fan dumb strong on the top setting don't you get a damn hum my curl is my rocker maybe i choose you and i don't even have i don't even have um i have a couple theories for what it is lots of adjusts right now it's increasing pressure too fast and also i have the press at a a pretty good angle right now leaning towards the front and i think that the hash is melting and making the puck inside uneven and then it blows out the front like that so i think i'm just going to go ahead oops just hit the table i'm going to go ahead and flatten out the press a little bit more risky with this puck anymore how would i do on the save [ __ ] crazy giving her incredible so okay my battery at 34 okay um check the alignment of the plates one more me come on gloves don't stupid i know it's not that cold in here but then mm-hmm little 74 degrees in here oh missiles contemplating life changes foreign foreign let me grab some parchment hold on i got an idea not so much as an idea that i just want to do something for this press just insurance actually all okay searching for savings on descriptions is so complex it's like getting a documentary unfortunately you just savings period not all patients eligible savings so um me yes i haven't even hit one ton of pressure you guys think i'm kidding look so just hit two and a half oh figured it out right pressure was increasing too fast and the angle probably didn't know so so well aren't you guys glad i got the internet connections really good attraction well wow please so um batteries are charged let's get a battery swap in before we do anything else we'll go from there sound good oh think so okay all right so good job bertha good job baby we're gonna take a dab and then after this dab i'm going to um go ahead and collect what's on the parchment and get it added to the jar while it's still warm man that's heavy that's heavy i mean yield wise i'm thinking it's got to be it's got to be upwards of 80 it has to be you know there's it is no [ __ ] way it's not it's a little harsh didn't it that's okay i'll turn it down i knew there was a little [ __ ] nap thingy in here a little [ __ ] flew right on me else we know there's never a good time to run out of fresh luckily our delivery and free pickup excuse me so whether it's a few extra guns from the back all right i mean you can't help it i got lights on in here when i come in through the garage little [ __ ] just came in with me i guess oh boy oh what are we taking a dab off i mean this is the 160 and 25. this [ __ ] is looking better than some people's like 90s come on man this is my throwaway edibles what's your calling air force reserve af reserve dot com all righty i got the drugs already got a little bit of runs on here i'm gonna grab some more though on the outside of one of these parchments but i smeared i know there's like a bunch on the outside i could take so i don't have to dip into the jar or anything i'm i'm weird right now you're like call that fresh press man i wish i'll give you a melt so like wood that's runs wow wow

everybody jpeg here checking in respect my region.com here today to do a quick taste test dab review featuring washington state's knott's cannabis we'll be reviewing their lemon og this is some hash rosin i'm pretty excited to check it out i haven't had washington product in quite some time and so to be able to get my hands on some of this i'm pumped check out the packaging here we go and this is actually a brand new product hitting the market in washington we've got it hitting forbidden cannabis retailers throughout washington state and i've got some test results here to share with you guys let me go ahead and show you a little bit of the the rosin that we have here and then i know we got to stir it up so i did a little bit of warming action before we before we got going in here and so let me go ahead and get a nice whip going oh wow the smell on this is insane we're coming in hot at 2.4 total terpenes let me go ahead and scoop as much as this as i can on to the nice beautiful here we go lemon og some really really nice hashtags and check that out there we go and thc 65.88 total cannabinoids seven point i'm sorry 77.72 so in terms of uh in terms of rosin is it the most potent on the market no but lemon og is known to be more of a mild og you get these light citrusy notes this herbal flavor and of course the classic pine that og kush brings to the table so for this one here on the scent you definitely get that sweet pine and you get citrus notes as well there's even this sweet and sour and so i'm excited i'm excited we're going to do the one today i'm going to do two dabs so let me get a nice chunk of it here and then i'm gonna do dabs two ways we're gonna do a low temp dab how i normally dab a cold start and then we're gonna uh we're gonna clean that up and then i'm gonna do an opposite you know regular size or a regular dab where we heat it up first and then we count it down so here we go taste test review not cannabis i hope you guys are ready man wasn't just what a time to be alive man canada is from multiple states this is an exciting this is an exciting time here we go so again i'm a cold starter here we go all right there we go there we go oh wow that flavor is incredible sweet piney herbal you even get a little spicy the terps on this are actually surprisingly pronounced meaning they're right on the front as soon as you inhale it you get terpenes when you blow it out you get a different flavor profile it goes from inhale sweet and piney exhale this sour not necessarily gassy almost easily wow absolutely delicious in terms of a taste i've got to give this taste test this is somewhere close to that 9 9.25 range you know it's not like all strains or all you know flour cultivars that are out there or whatever you know they don't all have to be tens i think for what lemon og is the potential for that strain is roughly somewhere between a nine and a 9.5 on that taste test that scale out of 10. can it really be a 10 i don't know but for me i think this dab this this this particular version of this hash rosin absolutely delicious and so i really would recommend you guys try that out now we're going to do a regular dab where we heat it up and then we count it down and then we load the dab in on this other method this will give us a score out of 100 we base it on 10 categories we're based on 10 categories it includes presentation appeal it includes all kinds of things so we're going to get this just nice and heated up and clean burn it off real quick see if there's any residual oil looks like there was just a little bit just give it one moment here and see this is the reality for so many smokers like i'm although i do dab daily and i certainly enjoy rosin just as much as the canosaures i just don't invest heavily into super nice glass i know that it definitely affects the impact and impacts the flavor but the reality is is this is going to cool off and hit it and i personally will not notice a big difference between it and excuse me for being as ignorant as that may sound but i love dabs and i love dabbing the way i dab so here we go this is gonna cool off i'm gonna go ahead and revisit the the view on this look at this right here this beautiful hash rosin all right i know i'm definitely not gonna dab all that so i'm gonna stick to a nice healthy size right here we're gonna wait a little bit longer i don't want to burn it too much all right all right here we go good time for you guys to like follow and subscribe below check out knott's cannabis on instagram check out respect my region here on youtube be sure to subscribe go follow us on instagram we're just about ready i wanted you guys to get a fair perspective two dabs we're gonna be good to go i hope you guys are ready five four three two and one here we

good everybody jp here checking in respect my region.com back with episode two of a west coast youtube review featuring calya extracts rosin uh today's product we're gonna be reviewing the ice water extract it's a sun cake rosin your boy justin is back so we're gonna dive right in one dab each we'll talk about it two dabs four out of ten saying yeah yeah let's do it all right let's dive into at least some of the percentages real quick 68.5 on the thc 77.08 percent on the thca cbd 0.32 and cannabinoids total 77.08 so in terms of rosin is it the most potent rosin we've ever dabbed no it's not but no but sun cake right i have a feeling this is going to be cakey earthy piney maybe a little spicy hopefully yes yes and this is the i know the exact cross this is sunset sherbert crossed with ice cream cake something so right off the bat it's like an indica dominant height not a wedding cake okay cool you know and i feel i feel i feel this is gonna provide like a real nice that's some good color y'all hi that's my producer got that like snotty hash color right for sure this this definitely has a better color than the other one yeah right this just gives that look of like wow this is six star a grade what is the what's the um you check that out i mean i'll give you a little you know just so you can see it it doesn't say the uh the use the 70 or whatever yeah it should if this sticker might have uh oh it says it on the lid so you to 120 [Music] all right i'm excited man again i believe i've dabbed italia with you a couple times maybe two or three times at this point i i can't sit here and honestly say that i can name one strain or remember one and so at this point you know i'd really like to give these ones a fair shot and the attention that they deserve because i think you know calgary does get recommended as one of the best rosin brands in the state of california yeah when i go places so they definitely have the most exclusive drops uh it's something that's hard to acquire like it was hard to acquire that sweet and sour as well as this sun cake because uh it just sells out very quickly in the shops so now make sure you line it up this time there you go you see you see saw the first time it was showing you a lower number but once you get in the middle diameter of the banger gave you a proper reading all righty turf timer no octave no technology errors on this go we are doing it the right way all right also this is a highly educated quartz banger both of them are the same same thickness same everything so yeah this is the way the dad works on instagram italiax.com i like it i like it fresh frozen it says nothing but fresh frozen they're uh you know tell you that's why they call it it's ice water extract because it's coming from fresh frozen interesting interesting get your dad ready oh no [Music] you take dabs at whatever temperature you take that which is traditionally hot in my experience so we both have these turf timers set we both have these two timers set for 500 degrees okay once it hits 500 like to kind of let it sit till like 480 470 and then go in for the dab what is that that's usually how you get the nicest milk this is sun cake sunset sherbet times ice cream cake you dropped a video thank you sir you're gonna go no it's too hot still all right see i'm saying you take harder grabs harder sometimes when it's a little bit bigger you might you got to go like 20 degrees a little you know that's a nice milk i've been dabbing rosin since you were in diapers that's a nice melt yo look at that oh let me tell you it is delicious that [ __ ] is loud yo i do that [ __ ] [ __ ] smack me in the face oh wow mine still says 490 484 479 475 all right so in terms of the flavor that i'm getting sweet sweet pineness sweet sweet gassy earth and in terms of like the kind of high that i'm experiencing it's it's both energetic and relaxing in terms of the body height right it really does wash over your body and i had you saw me crack my back earlier before this episode oh my goodness wow this is wow took away all the aches that i had because i literally just had so much pain a second ago i had to roll on my back wow gone yo wow what do you think hit me with more than one word on this okay this is this is you know this is more than terpy this is like where you're like you're like trying to figure out like what is that is that vanilla frosting is that is that like a cookie you know but um ice cream cake and sunset sugar you said yeah that's delicious so super super i like the chirping profile if if this was a girl this would be my type um and i definitely go for this one over the sweet and sour because the sweet and sour was you know i think by the name is kind of like hybrid sweet and sour i like sweet this is some cake this is the crust it's it's a different kind of high at the end of the day this is ice cream cake gassy pine sweet gassiness i mean makes you want to go back for more like that we have a second dab to review it out of 10. well my i went like super low in my [ __ ] oh so you still have a second down today all right well [ __ ] okay pass me that torch really yeah you had to see that was the last little bit yeah and that tastes like i'm telling you i get that i get the really nice vanilla ice cream i still have the taste of it all right college yeah i still even need a vanilla ice cream on that side is this the first dab where you don't actually need a second dab or almost like sun cake they should have called this your angel was that angel cake they should have called this [ __ ] like heaven cake vanilla [ __ ] clouds it is sweet tiny gassy the nose on it is wonderful like as soon as you start like that's the word nutmeg i was like what smells that word that's that's not the side of this wow it's literally loud that's what i'm saying it hit when you smell it you're you're like your eyes squint yeah it's impressive i have a score of mine out of ten the second dab is not going to do it you know aside from human error [ __ ] it up so for me my score out of 10 is going to be 9.5 that would that's my score no no you told me what what genetics this is but it needs to say it on there yes and then i need the terpene information on there and that's the last two points for me the last half point point two five each i got you this is a problem that's a perfect product i would i want to dock them for the branding instead but repeatedly over and over people recommend kalyan as one of the best and so am i always at this point it doesn't matter the bartenders don't care that it looks like this they still think it's one of the best so i'm not going to take anything for that right 9.5 for me where you at i'm at 9.5 as well i'm at 9.5 as well i think uh wonderful i think yeah like really you hit it on the t with exactly what you said that if call it if you just provide that little bit of information so it would have been a 10 out of 10. like that yeah this is great you know and the packaging is not even that bright or like poppy but you know once you dip into it i mean you know what you're going to have a box like a cool acid wash box version of this but let's be real let's be real but it has to shout out to colleen because they the collabs they do are actually where they go crazy with the packaging this is actually a collab that's sweet and sour right that's the vesuvio gardens uh yeah yeah that's dope well big thank you guys you know calio you guys do a big shout out appreciate you guys checking in coming in hot at a 9.5 from both of us definitely go check out the sun cake rosin sweet and sour on the previous episode we'll see you guys in the next west coast video review respect my region justin curious love y'all peace", "PX3c1o3bvW8": "yo yo yo what's good you guys welcome to a live stream we're gonna go ahead and do uh the rest of the presses from yesterday that i didn't finish it up got uh six bucks here we're gonna go ahead and start pressing these um i'm thinking at 200. yesterday we did a range of temperatures the lower temperatures were not cutting it so we're going to go back to our our higher tip that i like to do that 202 we're gonna go ahead and uh we'll see how that does got some more parchment so i got the uh pucks properly wrapped up now and prepped in the appropriate size parchment sleeves so we should be able to get a decent flow and we'll just have to see what we get and we'll adjust the temperature as needed i don't imagine we'll be going down below 190 so excuse me one minute while i go ahead and finish straightening some [ __ ] up it is [ __ ] chilly chilly really really really [ __ ] is cold in the [ __ ] whoa i honestly i'm about to put on my [ __ ] key hold on yeah burr yeah we bout to take a dab right now hell yeah seeking something i'm glad to hear that man that's dope get your press on so here's the jar that we started last night this stuff was super turpy so we got all these crazy dark terps in here and we've got this lighter area and we're going to go ahead and we're going to mix all of it together today trim run gelato cake and white runs it's a little darker but oh my god i am in love with the taste already the taste on it is like a mint chocolate chip coffee it's bananas not the flavor but just it's crazy i haven't done any like stirring whipping i haven't done anything to it since last night i'm curious to see what it's going to do over the next couple days oh man and it melts so clean like you wouldn't even believe with how dark it is how

you're saying but i gotta find out i gotta find out he said okay goodbye [Music] [Music] the power what pleasure strength i'm sorry is that being is that being culturally insensitive am i being stereotypical am i stereotyping i'm sorry let's get this press started i'm banked already [Music] um [Music] excuse me excuse me hold on the tripod get you guys set up and then um we'll go from there [Music] hey [Music] dabbing gloves big force the team oh the team sounds like he's trying to say like uh the team is strong like big up to the team [Music] am i am i right we just started working at amazon working overnights that means you're packing [ __ ] women's dildo orders and [ __ ] huh doing all the freaky [ __ ] overnight i got you on that [ __ ] [ __ ] it's okay boy what else could they use the overnight [ __ ] for at amazon that's gotta be it that's gotta be so [Music] [Music] [Music] my man said he's part of the ginyu force that's what he said until we figure out what he's saying we're just gonna assume that he's saying he's part of the ginyu force [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign oh this one gets loud oh so good return puck feels uh pretty well emptied and got off the plates pretty quick and was the same color or lighter than yesterday a slightly better return feels like so i dropped the temperature a little bit but not much because this stuff does just come out darker because in the terps [Music] so i still want to keep the flow high [Music] myself [Music] uh wow i'm allowed to give you guys information soon but i can't give you information on pricing yet i was told i have to wait until science led makes the official announcement and gets them on their site and then by then they'll have like um shipping times and you'll be able to pre-order and [ __ ] they don't want to put out the information too soon so they told me to wait trust me i'm i'm so ready to tell you guys [Music] you know [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm at uh 190 right now it's just looking off because the lighting is [ __ ] and this is a trim run bro here maybe this will help you guys with the color issue i know it's hard to tell but you'll see you'll see get this in the jar and then we're going to go ahead and start the next puck that was a good temperature and we're gonna run it at that time yeah i don't really have a good spot you guys where you're not gonna be in the [ __ ] way i'll try and move you over a little bit i think my laptop could be [ __ ] maybe let me see food grade month okay you guys if you say so you know what determines whether it's food grade or not how clean it melts when i show you how clean it melts you're gonna be like oh okay yeah that's not food grade the trichomes that come off of trim is usually going to be more mature because it's exposed to more direct light than the rest of the trichomes that are covered in the plant matter right so when you process trim it's going to come out slightly more amber too all right and then if you're dealing with a strain that's really really terpy and depending on what those terpenes are can also make it darker right so never judge judge it by the color alone and be quick to say oh that's food grade or that's not good like it's really really hard to judge it based off of color alone especially fresh off the press so oh yeah definitely people judge with their eyes first for sure you eat with your eyes first you judge off of appearance first but again this is fresh off the plates and you got to give me a couple days and work my magic on it telling you guys i'm telling you huh i want to mention just my lighting is [ __ ] probably back you guys the [ __ ] up huh um the plan is going to be to whip this all up and heat mat it and then burp it at um at a certain point [Music] so good extraction on that one too this is going to turn out just like the los altos did it's gonna turn into that like jam with chunks in it and i'm gonna love it we'll love every minute of it there's not good light over here where's the best light for me let's go in here oh no [ __ ] that room goes crazy let's try right here man the light [ __ ] right now there we go how's that color looking it looks like [ __ ] when you look at it from the top because the camera can't perceive the light the same way but it's just terpius [ __ ] so and you would think oh the lower temperature you go the lighter it'll be no because it just takes too long to get off the plates and we already tried 200 that was too hot then 190 is is the sweet spot it's the best it's gonna get for uh for this i mean i can go like 155 160 and press like five grams at a time maybe get a different result but i'm not pressing five [ __ ] grams at a time that's not what's gonna happen today i wonder if it would help so this is gonna get real silly if i don't put you guys down soon oh this is between 16 to 22 grams in every one of these bags how did you already know right my man saw the board behind me and added it up already my press is feminine thank you her name is bertha so yes she is feminine it's not the craziest smell actually because i'm not running it too hot but it's like a minty coffee lag oh there's some fat ass chunks in this hmm two more oh my goodness we always gotta get one or two huh you know actually i think that you've been on this channel being done before you are the weakest link bye [Music] [Music] i don't know yet my yield on this run yet because we're in the middle of doing it right now i'm not trying to be a smart ass but open your eyes [Music] how old is the material it was a couple weeks old when it was given to me about two weeks old i want to say sat in the freezer for a couple weeks i don't know if uh what the yield has been i haven't really been weighing anything yet so i'll just wait and see i'll wait and find out at the end and i get a veggie burger with uh grilled onions no tomato with fries with uh spread i mean i put my own beyond meat burger patty on it when i get home still enjoy in and out but do it the vegan way yeah buddy but also whoever did mention edibles for food grade i am going to turn a good portion of my cut into edibles or at least caps really potent caps rosin gaps no i didn't do anything today i'm working working working working working and uh somebody else says one more and then collection and then we're going to stir it all up and get it going on the heat map i'm gonna heat mat it at least overnight i'll show you guys i have no secrets no secrets whatsoever i don't time anything i don't look at the gauge anything if i don't know who you are on the gram or if you don't follow or like somebody i know doesn't follow you then i don't accept you you got to tell me what your name is so that i can go and accept you and maybe maybe if i've seen your name around here enough i'll accept it otherwise you gotta know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody so yeah there i'm gonna start doing a lot more live sessions that are gonna be more interactive i'm gonna set up uh a streaming session in the new hash set so it'll be a good stable connection and we'll be able to have some proper lighting in there our windows uh vented sunlight and we'll be able to have some real good sessions okay so so yo i watched this uh hugh hefner docu-series with my wife and it was actually pretty interesting i didn't know that he was so involved in social issues it was really interesting to see that and how he went against the grain with racism and segregation and he would invite um all these black stars to come onto his show right and he had aretha franklin and um brain farting on the other person and but he had like a bunch of different up and coming artists and he wasn't afraid to have them come and perform at his club because he didn't care he didn't see color he just saw talent and he wanted to make it known what his company stood for and didn't stand for and so he interviewed like he did really really in-depth interviews with a lot of celebrities and at one point he did an in-depth interview with malcolm x and malcolm x was you know saying his typical stuff very radical extremist stuff and mind you majority of the readers of playboy back at this time are white and he published it against the advice of all the other people that were working for and he published it unedited and well not unedited like they edited it but they didn't like edit his answers or change his wording they left it all exactly how he said it you know um and i'm like yo that that's [ __ ] ballsy and he got a lot of support for it actually afterwards and a lot of readers wrote in and said that was awesome thanks for sharing that interview blah blah blah so yeah man that was that was really interesting to watch that and obviously to watch his back and forth with struggling to be um you know married and father and all these different things that he just couldn't [ __ ] do living in the [ __ ] mansion i think any normal man would succumb to that [ __ ] after a while especially after being away from your wife the man was surrounded by titties and ass 24 7. like i think he had so much titties and ass i would get tired of it i would be like [ __ ] put some clothes on like it's not even exciting anymore to see your titties they're just always out like put some clothes on surprise me i want to come around the corner and just be like ah titties surprise it's been three days then i'm gonna be like oh titties but if i see titties every time i walk around the [ __ ] house i'm titties like what like it's like looking at an elbow it's just not gonna matter anymore you know just doesn't [ __ ] matter anymore i don't know how that man stayed excited by i guess maybe there was just so many different kinds of titties i don't know i think i would get over it titty climbing wall bro you know how much i just pictured that [ __ ] on my head like a rock climbing wall but instead of rocks his titties yo oh my god you are creative you are creative that is funny he says my friend has a thing for elbows i mean i'm a classic i'm a classy man i i like exposed shoulders if my wife ever has like a shirt that is like has one of those wide neck collars and you know her shoulder starts to show a little bit i'm like oh that's classy sexy i'm an old man i guess but hey can we get a quick vote while i take this dab a quick vote side boob is 2003 but it's okay quick vote he said yes yo kristoff i wish i knew what you were saying somebody tell me what he's saying titty sprinkles by morgan you know desensitized from titties and ass yeah man i'm telling you bro why you think he needed them pills bro he didn't excite him no more he couldn't do it all right here's my poll thongs or booty shorts drop it in the chat right now that's all i want to know thongs or booty shorts this is going to tell me everything i need to know about every last one of you from here on out i'm deciding your face as a friend or a foe choose wisely how [ __ ] would you guess cheers man cheers i'm going to show you guys how [ __ ] clear

your day night whatever the hell you're watching this hope it's going great for you we've got a little video here I haven't really done many of these but a lot of other cannabis content creators do these videos and I think a lot of people enjoy it we've got some strain reviews coming up today and of course we're starting with the hottest hash on the alerting rec market happy cabbage farms so happy cabbage farms they came into camp in probably about four months ago I don't know exactly when they came on to the Oregon rec market but at the time it was a pretty Minzy era in the Oregon rec market here in Benton there was just a lot of the companies have really slipped towards the end of the summer and a lot of their stuff really wasn't tasting as good as it was towards the beginning of the summer then comes heavy cabbage farms with hash robison and we don't see hot rods in a lot in the rec market because it's such an expensive and kind of niche product there's not very many people that are searching to pay a lot of money for hash rasam but when you [ __ ] try this hash frozen you're just sucked right on back in guys it is ridiculous this stuff I will tell you I have tried tons of hot rods and a lot of the times I'm going to say that's my favorite hat rosin because I don't get to try it very often happy cabbage now has been around for about four months and they are a group in our circle it's just been around I've gotten to dab it a lot and I've gotten to dab a lot of other hash rosin because I don't have to pay for it other people have it and I will tell you guys there's a couple strands that I have not liked from them but these four right here that I have are so titties I would stick my face between all of them and motorboat myself to death this is hands-down the best half rosin I have ever smoked and it's on the wreck more kit if you are over 21 you can buy this you don't have to [ __ ] buy it black market you don't have to pay the $120 for black market six star hash rosin it gets it cannot expensive for a while there guys so to see a company coming out with stuff that's between sixty and seventy five dollars and medic maybe even cheaper than that that's super impressive and just such a breath of refreshing air so this guy I've got open right here first thing when I open it this is the purple starburst og six star like just what in there is just a bad thing to say let's take a look at what we going got going on in this jar alrighty here we have the purple starburst og 6 star you guys can see it's nice and flaky there's no real huge clumps partly because I dabbed a lot of them partly because it is 6 star and it is just gorgeous look at that color sorry for the shaking I'm filming on my phone they check that out just absolutely gorgeous I am completely enthralled with the look of this rosin I'm enthralled with the look as well as the smell a second you open up this up you get hit in the face with the real ocean groan oh gee smell and it's been a long time since we've gotten that we're getting more chem more gassy oh geez out here this is real ocean groan oh gee and then on the end of it is like this almost faint hint of like purple lavender not in a floral way at all but in a very very gassy way like I can't even begin to explain this we're gonna go ahead and take it yeah we got two rigs out today we first we're gonna start out with the prophecy glass and get a little function shot and I'll shop for you guys we don't have the cleanest rigs or bangers today just kind of caught me on an off cleaning day but maybe we should still be able to see that function right we're gonna start off with the purple starburst it guys this stuff is absolutely amazing I cannot tell you how much I recommend going and trying just the strain right here all of happy cabbage farm is fantastic this strain right here hands down my favorite let's go ahead and get her heat it up and get into some freakin turf skies I am excitement for this video you can not believe how hard it is to have four jars of happy cabbage sitting in a drawer knowing you can't smoke it because you have to come with it it's literally heartbreaking I also want to give them a huge shout out for sponsoring the 420 of it at the Pacific Circle that was absolutely amazing they set up a tab bar anybody that came by could have their stuff a company that produces this high a product of this high quality of product just allow anybody to come up and smoke it no no [ __ ] questions asked is just amazing huge shout out to them for that call that good set a timer for 45 seconds alright we're gonna go ahead get in here and scoop ourselves out a nice flaky dab of this gorgeous six star here we go guys first dab of the half cab farms Cheers [Music] oh good lordy that is so delicious straight to the head immediately my whole head warm fuzzy dice feels delicious but you just know media we have strongest it because it hits you momentarily after you take it down man is a good video to be filming guys yeah I also got to say this is mind-bending how good that flavor is and how much flavor there is usually with a lot of even really good tasting dabs only a small percentage of flavor this there is a large percentage of flavor in that [ __ ] strain it is amazing how much you get out of it I love it for our first thing to have in the morning like if you got one dab to set your whole day straight that's it right there that purple starburst og alright move on to the next string I believe this one was a collab width Oh pull on a stick and throw it into my house I rip the [ __ ] alright I threw the Box away in the heavy collab on it [ __ ] oh no without gaps in garden Gadsden Gardens okay this one is a collab with Gadsden garden and this is Tropicana punch now this one has a much much different look to it let me give you guys an initial smell test it was like pomegranate and man what is that that is a good [ __ ] smell right there it was like pomegranate and fish I'm not like just weed but the actual cush like when you're exhaling a cush strain it smells like that oh man that's delicious now this one has a much different look to it way more waxy was this one what was this one called no just Tropicana punch hash rosin not six-star not their batter or their jam just hash shots but still absolutely delicious looking kind of looks like peanut butter and this was not what I do what it looked like when they gave it to me when it was cold it was much much more pretty and hadn't like waxed up into this solid state yet still [ __ ] beautiful we're gonna switch it up we've got the DBE 503 slimeball rig all ready to go over here a dab of this junk ambush I believe this is the one that gave me a job on the night of 4/20 and I was just absolutely mind blown by how good the flavor of it was so much rudiness to it but still keeping a really nice base in the OG gas cushy that kind of a chem that kind of a taste so I'm keeping it sweet waste in there but still having some food on top I'm a big fan of fruity strains but when I have to smoke all day every day it's not my favorite I really really want the Kim gasps og scum push stuff like that all right that's all set a timer 45 seconds that's not that's not the right dance isn't it there was a dude I'm just gonna stop him all right if vijaya tease this one's a lot easier to load up I'm just gonna take this a nice big chunk here boom I am gonna be so blitzed by the end of this guy's four dabs of hatch rosin and that I haven't gotten into this yet but I'm sure you guys read the title we're taking out Widowmaker at the end but yeah let's do it [ __ ] drop the dead Cheers [Music] [Music] get right with that safe before really really fruity but it keeps its [ __ ] feet planted firmly in a nice little og tastes good very clean - I mean like of course there's no solvents in it but a lot of other people's half-frozen I get a a wheezing in my lungs and that's usually the reason I stay away from hats Rossum as you guys can hear [Music] there is some coffee but there's no wheeze and that is what I love about this stuff it just seems so clean so pure you're tasting exactly what this amazing weed was meant to taste like guys we're going nips out go the [ __ ] nips out Jesus Christ two tabs of hash rosin in we've got the purple starburst and oh wait no the Tropicana punch and the purple starburst yeah okay yes yes boom so we've got punch breath up next this is their jam and this one unfortunately has slowly disintegrated in a series of very unfortunate dabs that were completely unavoidable but I think a little bit left so we have something for this video right here I'm gonna zoom the camera in so you guys can see it's really really clear and very very light in color but it is so ganbei good I can't even begin to tell you guys how many Terps they've got packed into that gorgeous little [ __ ] doing GM glove there when you get in this one it immediately has like a purple smell I use that to describe a lot away I don't know what the purple smell is I don't know what I'm describing there I'm sure there's some people out there that are gonna be like yeah and there's some people are gonna be like what the [ __ ] he's that high already but it does it smells purple purple with a hint of fruit punch on the end that's exactly what I'm getting clenched breath and it's really really cool how true their flavors are guys like you can't even begin to tell you how many other hot rods and strings like taste we're like this one's strong in and you taste it that's great it's amazing how many people just they'll name their strains anything just because that's what's hype that's what's selling right now these guys they've just got some fire a sweet in fire ass hash on the way out switching it back up again to the prophecy glass for our punch breath dab here I'm gonna go ahead and heat this up man guys given that Widowmaker at the end it's gonna be so brutal I have already baked like a cupcake my gourd is gone stone to the bone I just [ __ ] rent I think you guys a good idea of how ripped I am I've taken two gaps and I already am starving I don't feel like I need a turf map two naps like I thank you I'm taking seven gram damage guys this we just took like maybe point one maybe and I'm already ready for a turf down at the end of this I'm going to pass out right here after I've ordered new greens call it good BAM wham Shazam set timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla alright let's go ahead scrape ourselves out some of this leaving just enough left to put into our Widowmaker jab guys we got we got some crazy stuff going with a maker jab this punch breath was definitely one of my favorites it was a lighter high than the six star starburst og but had just about the same percentage of flavor it's fan-fucking-tastic really allowed me to go about my day if I was smoking it in the morning before say a meeting or something it would be really good for that not if you were gonna go out and want a dad that was gonna last you three to four hours that would be the purple starburst six star that stuff is just [ __ ] tits it is so strong BAM Thank You Carla let's take this damn choose people it's tons tons and tons of flavor [Music] [Music] now we got the sweats going big time holy Jebus how is it is hot in here oh my god keeping you close holy [ __ ] this was a good fight hey promised the Widowmaker again oh [ __ ] turf sweats aren't [ __ ] real oh my god whoa next up we got some margarita punch six star don't let the nips cool off for a second here wow that overheated a needle is in the red Oh rubbie oh my god I completely forgot we have water over here not sponsored by but shout out the can event for carrying the happy cabbage four guys are in Central Oregon looking for a place to pick this stuff up get a man got it they got so many different strains oh yes we got one left guys we've got the margarita place six star same with the starburst og let's go ahead and take peak here in this jar very very flaky but it is all stuck together none of it is gonna fall out I don't believe ya all stuck in there when I first got it was flaky like if you sneezed it would go everywhere like a pile of blow it was pretty [ __ ] flaky oh man oh man this one probably actually I'm gonna have to take my my vote back for the smell this one has better smell than the purple starburst dojin form starburst oh gee I do believe tastes better but god damn margarita punch they're definitely a hint of that tropic punch in there but there is a kick what is that kick gasps that is straight gasp oh man yeah once you get past that punch just gassy oh that is good it doesn't have the og smell of the purple starburst I mean it is just Tropicana punch instead of deep purple starburst OG um but it does have a massive undertone of some gassy flavors go ahead keep the slime ball ring up last one and probably take a little two-minute walk around the house and then we're gonna dive into that way a but nothing's more currently done I am so big guy so I can feel my hind legs coming down [ __ ] just set a timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla thank you very much I can feel my eyelids coming down like heavy hard it is I'm gonna be in for a real long afternoon here we got a photo we got the Gus glass show circle tonight [ __ ] I'm gonna be licking windows all night long guys so yeah super flaky super super potent smell let's get some [ __ ] taste in here oh yes oh yes wants to scrape it all off the bottom it is super flaky again yep all right we got a margarita punch six star and hash browns and over here I bring a ball right up in clothes for you guys kitchens function off the first initial hit oh my god I need a new cord after this video it's not even baked out of it it's just oh [ __ ] cheers everyone a lot more gas when you smoke it less of the push flavor than the go wow they're really not my favorite in terms of flavor definitely not bad whatsoever it's still delicious I'm probably ranked this number three the Tropicana punch probably be my least favorite out of the four but honestly I would buy all four strains again thanks they say that they're that good all scraped up on a piece of paper see if we can get it um damn er and then we will take a lap mop it off a bit and take this [ __ ] Widowmaker all those cobbles alright we got our four grams right here I have completely forgotten which one goes to which cap so that will be interesting we're just going to go ahead and see if we can take this damper here and get some of each of these on here it's not going to be a monster dabbe but I mean big enough for some fun boom there's our starting scoop of the punch breath now this is this is the margarita punch now this is gonna be a little difficult this stuff is so flaky I'm not quite sure we might have to get like a spoon for this so I'm gonna just take some of this and yeah there's no way it's gonna stick on there take that off and then last but not least we need the what what was this I forget [ __ ] I think I've lost more oil in here than I got out definitely alright well there's that there's what I've got and there's also some on this damper too this stuff has all different consistencies let me see if I can't like splurge some of this long as dabber just smush it all together that's kind of working I'd say that's working pretty damn good alright let's look at our dab here guys oh [ __ ] yeah oh Jesus alright alright let's let's get her going oh my god this is gonna be fun I literally didn't move any of this because I was terrified that the dab would fall off the dabber I think we are very lucky and fortunate that we got all that hash onto a bro without any of it falling off I didn't I think that was going to happen as this on a monster Widowmaker but like I was saying before guys - dabs in I was pretty [ __ ] toasted we're at a point now where I am just I'm good at I could be good for today for smuggling I am [ __ ] why are we doing this because you got your [ __ ] awesome but I love each

[Applause] [Music] hey guys it's cliff with peer pressure here thanks for tuning in to are solving this review series we've got Roz and Ryan from olio here today we're gonna be checking out his papaya punch number four let's get to it [Music] the papaya punch number four from olio is a cross between purple punch and papaya both heavily indica dominant strains the purple punch was giving me hints of grape candy and a sweet blueberry muffin fresh out of the oven while the papaya was was on the sweet candy side of things papaya candy maybe a little hint of mango in there and it's very surprising that it was an indica dominant strain because most of the effects I was getting were what you would attribute to a sativa dominant strain and I was getting a very energetic productive and uplifting high I tribute this to the high concentration of limonene found in the string and the limonene is really what was giving me that mood elevation in euphoria the second most concentrated terpene present and this strain was Lin Ahlul and I tribute that to the relaxation and stress relief that I was getting from this hey guys it's clip peer-pressure here welcome to the solvent ice review series this is episode number two we've got rosin ryan here with olio and we're gonna be reviewing the papaya punch number four this is our jam product this is been heat cured this is pretty much the most separated of all our consistencies as far as THC a and terpene content within the rosin and we believe it's probably the most shelf-stable even if you don't put it in the fridge or anything like that it keeps flavor for a long time and it's honestly my favorite consistency that I'm smoking right now so you can leave this out and it doesn't it doesn't you know decrease in terpene value it won't dry up which some people do like but this here let me show you here sure so what's this little dab tool here so every gram of ours has kind of comes with a personal dabber it's just a little extra thing we do just select emergency dabber in case of situations for sure very nice nice touch so what can you tell me about the the strain here so this is our papaya punch number four this is we have a few different fee knows we always Fino test a few different seeds that we get it's like the most exotic fruity and most punchy almost phyno it's got an exotic note it's um it's got a little bit of that artificial grape in it from the purple punch it's probably one of my favorite strains at the moment and this is from pony seeds papaya times purple punch very nice yep this is perfect for during the day I'll run some errands after dabbing some of this stuff it's very relaxing but its clear-headed yes it's a hybrid like most things are nowadays and for me personally I know it's different for everybody but I could dab some of this and still get a lot of stuff done during the day I don't feel too body locked or anything like that I still I'm ready to go you know do my stuff for the day so got that clarity stay exactly exactly and it's so flavorful that I almost don't expect to relax feeling I'm expecting some type of anxiety yes achieve a high but it's honestly perfect mellow high for the middle of the day definitely so how do you typically go about finding a good hash string it is many different steps so first of all to grow which ones grow nice we can't get any males obviously we take out the males whatever females are left it really is dependent on how well they grow their yield in the garden then once we wash them it's gonna be based on water hash yields it's gonna be the thing that plays the most role and if we keep it or not if it does yield well a nice hash and it presses well usually we'll keep it it all depends on flavors yields we all come together smoked them we all you know put in our opinions of you know which one do you think is a little bit tastier versus if the yield if it's really worth it sometimes we'll take a tastier one even if it yields a little bit lower just because it's got that little extra that we know people will will enjoy it so for sure so what do you thoughts on fresh frozen verse washing dried and cured flour so you can wash cured I've seen it done stuff 99% of our stuff is fresh frozen almost almost all we have our own in-house garden everything is harvested fresh frozen washed within usually one to two weeks so we try to wash it as quickly as possible really keeps that terpene profile just like it was when you were smelling the plant so when you're going around you got your fingers on the nose I want that to be what the rosin tastes like yeah I went down I really do think fresh frozen you know produces that a little bit better of a quality in the end for sure yeah so yeah you talked about doing BHO extraction in the past and you know when BHO first came out people were always looking for a light golden color but it seems now that things are kind of moving more towards an almost white color and I've even heard of people pulling their plants early to even get that color do you have any comment on like that is a huge trend right now in the in the grow world as people know you can pull your plants a little bit early but you're gonna sacrifice what I believe is a little bit taste and your potency the effects from you pulling early I believe are gonna be felt people really go for that visual yeah so when people see white hash they really they get excited yeah I think people really need to try the hash more side-by-sides sometimes a darker hash will blow the lighter hash out of the water with taste with potency affect how it makes you feel so I really think people should try stuff before you know everybody eats with their eyes so to speak but but uh you really gotta get smoking yeah so what can you tell us about the terpene profiles some of the flavors that you're getting up the papaya punch number four so this number four is probably our most like exotic fruity vino of this papaya punch it's mostly papaya notes it's that exotic fruit in there and it's got a little bit of artificial grape in there from that purple punch that's definitely that's it in there I think it's probably the most well balanced of our papaya punch he knows as far as flavor goes and that consistency is honestly my favorite I like when I see large chunks and they're swimming in Terps so definitely that Jam was just it's something else that is beautiful I seriously could smell it earlier just sitting back here when it was sitting over there so I liked what you did with it for sure well what about terpenes in general their medicinal benefits I mean how do you think that plays a role into the medicinal benefits the high and whether you classify it as an indica sativa I think everybody you know takes terpenes in a little bit differently obviously some of the ones like limonene stuff like that are just known to generally give people a little bit more uplifting effects like that but as far as terpenes go it's really about finding a flavor that you enjoy in an effect that doesn't hinder your day really yeah if you smoked something that you really like but it's giving you anxiety obviously that might not be the strain for you you should find something you know with similar profiles that don't actually have that same terpene you know within the plant so if you like something fruity but you're getting horrible anxiety from lemon let's maybe try like a citrus yeah or another a strawberry banana or something like that where you know hey this tastes really good but it's not gonna cause me to freak out yeah strawberry banana is one of my favorites - it's super relaxing probably the heaviest indica of the fruity stuff that I've tried so I know a lot of people that love it definitely definitely so one thing I love about following you on instagram is that you're just always dropping knowledge helping push the community further for those of you who aren't following him on Instagram he's at a troz and Ryan check him out lots of great content out there so I feel like the first time I ever heard the term rosin jam it was from following you on Instagram can you comment did did you coin that phrase is there anything there it was kind of more of the people speaking we did a little survey and stuff we just wanted a different our selves a little bit um there was a huge craze going on at the time of people putting rosin in jars and this whole new tech that's going on and I really wanted to create a name that people think Jam they think olio but honestly it's kind of taken off we've noticed other people you know using the rosin Jam name and we really don't seem to mind we've had people in Spain posting rosin jam so I think there's a really awesome to see and it's just it's just our version of rosin sauce or you know just a just a new just a new consistency we're just trying to cone so definitely yeah consistency is everything when I'm looking for a product if typically I lean more towards the jams you know if I see something that's a little more buttery that's just not usually my flavor lots of people like the butter does it is all of reference a lot of people love the butter just for ease of dabbing people like to just dig in some people grab it with their hands and just drop a bomb right in there and just its ease of dabbing it's a preference some people don't want the rosin heat it up some people want it straight off the press and put in the fridge so we like to offer a product for everybody yeah if you want your Ross and put in the fridge we have classic coins um if you want butter we have butter if you want your stuff lightly heated we have a batter and if you want a true separation and you want your rasam to look like BHO a live resin consistency and you don't want to leave it in the fridge then the jam is for you no down so I've got a bunch of homies they nerd out on temperatures as far as pressing goes dabbing goes do you have like a perfect temperature range usually fall in when it comes to pressing and dabbing yes I do if you know if something is pretty melty I use usually stick around 180 degrees that's a nice low temp of times and stuff really vary between how much you put in the bag and what you're squishing and all that but I like 180 degrees it just really is like a nice golden you know point for me for sure yeah so what about the your actual rig or the nail have you ever played around with temperatures I have and stuff it's been a while I'm usually just a time kind of guy kind of figure out what my new nail you know Davin is I'll heat it up and kind of do a test or at 45 seconds you know on minute 30 kind of see what my nails I like a low time dab it uh I'm gonna be dabbing I like a little bit extra on the bottom I'll leave a little puddle sometimes I don't mind you're sure we'll be sure to keep it on the blue setting oh yeah yeah so when you typically take a dab how long does it take for you to feel the effects usually I'm and this is just me I usually feel the effects pretty instantly honestly me too I uh I'll take a dab of this stuff and be ready to go yeah you know it's it's pretty instant behind the eyes yeah yep do you get that with other extracts or do you think rosin high gloss hooker I think rosin in general and solvent listen general I feel throughout my body a little bit more I noticed when I dabbed BHO it's it's more of a head high uhm BHO always you know it feels a little more floaty to me uh rosin solvent list is always a little bit more body I feel a little bit more relaxation from it instantly definite so tell me a little bit about the the bubble hash side of things how are you guys washing what's the trick to getting this so it all starts in the grow so most of our stuff is it's very well taken care of throughout all of its life the veg has to be very clean the early flowering stages at the environment is a huge factor so that's all before the wash is really the plant when we take when we're harvesting no no trimmers even touch the nose they're all hold it you know by the stem cut off the nose and take little golf ball sized pieces really trying to not disrupt any trike formation that we've you know work so hard to grow so washing we use our all RO water it's all hand washed pretty much as gentle as you can wash bud they do it multiple times will wash four or five times just to ensure that all the heads are taken off it's done in a cold room it's all ROI sorrow water it's as clean as can be in there so yeah that's how you make clean Rossum's clean hash and a clean girl so you mentioned washing by hand why do you prefer that over say and automate it where I can just hit the button and it's just uh really control over you know your whole process you can stir as gently as you want you can have a machine that stirs pretty gently but just having that control that hand on it and really seeing how much you're taking off each plant and stuff like that it's that extra care that really goes into it that really just makes it that much better for sure well let's let's get to it yes you want to about here guess we'll switch on over to the blue temp there it's the lowest temperature we've got I've got a little new little guide tool too they do come in handy [Music] man that's just what I was looking for you can definitely get that sweep of pile on the front and then on the backend you've got that like earthy grape soda candy like it was it's definitely what I'm looking for I'm glad you enjoyed it man yeah I always um I always enjoy papaya but that uh that little extra little grape really adds something to it it's got like a little almost a spiciness almost to it it's just really good for sure so what are you feeling like effects wise right now what do you think I I love the relaxed feeling I get from this the clear-headedness good vibe to some music right now to there so I just love the effects just great for chilling yeah you know I've got a real calm my body's real relaxed but in my brain I've got that little tingle to it but it's still real clear yep perfect biking it's quick behind the eyes and stuff quick acting I still feel like I could you know get up and go do some stuff right now so it's perfect and it is some strong stuff dum papaya punch generally tests around 80% for us so I mean that's a pretty high THC content so sure yep the rest of it's pretty much chirps we've been getting regularly 20% turps with the jam it's probably a 5 to 8 percent increase over just having it out you know just fresh press so wow it's quite a significant difference yeah so if somebody was looking to get some of this sweet papaya grape soda candy where could they find that so yeah you can find our product pretty much all over Colorado it's in recreational and medical shops dispensaries we have a flagship dispo it's higher grade they offer recreational and medical at two different locations you're probably gonna have our your best bet you know finding some jam there but we also you know post drops all over our Instagram page at dabble leo 7:10 you can give us a follow I also have my personal page at Ross and Ryan so I usually post the flavors as soon as I make them people get a little anxious and always ask me where it's at it's gonna be about a week or two before testing and all the packaging gets ready usually about a week and usually the olio page is where you can find all the information the drops what you know pretty much where everything's going that you're looking for thanks for stopping by man really enjoy the papaya punch number four it's definitely gonna be one of my goat cheese for this summer for anybody out there is not following them on Instagram be sure to check out at Roz and Ryan always dropping knowledge about solving this extraction trying to push the industry forward and dab olio 710 that's where we got the papaya punch number four from highly recommend it I really appreciate you guys having me I always love talking hash and thanks again so much come down so after sitting on the high for a while you know I really found it interesting that I was getting a lot of sativa dominant effects or what you would think would be sativa dominant effects because they're both in economists trains that we're working with here you know we've got the papaya on one side we've got the purple punch on the other like I said both indica dominant so you would expect a sedative effect but what I found was something really uplifting and that's why I think it's the perfect Brosnan for summertime vacation because it was relaxing mentally but still energetic got a little euphoria from that so an all-around great summertime high and perfect for like I said any vacation any trip to the beach or the lake definitely be my go-to and thanks for tuning in guys be sure to like and subscribe below follow us on our IG Facebook at go peer pressure thanks for tuning in [Music]", "a6BMDjoAf_0":

seven ten and I've tried their hash rasen but I have not tried their what their Weed Man so I'm very very excited to get into this but for before we get into this man I have to give a big shout-out to today's sponsor man gothic comm where they sell bracelets pendants and rings super sick ass rings man well you can go buy some for your friends girlfriend whatever the case is man and you could use my own personal code savvy G to get a discount percentage of well I'll put everything down in the description below man go show them some support because a support of today's video guys alright honestly we're like I said I was ready to be smoking on both of these guys they both cost me around this one right here was $80 this one right here with $70 so a total of 150 it is a pretty hefty price to paint but you know if you want to smoke it you got to pay the price so we're gonna save this for the second part of the video we're gonna roll up a nice joint with that but first since I do have my rig right here MJ Arsenal and my torch all the goodies right here I think the only thing we can do is take it out all right so I'm already have been dabbing it so I'm bushed shut you guys in there it might be missing some so this right here guys is what I have currently right now and it's honestly some of the turkeys like 710 miles has to be some of the turkeys but I mean wax that I have ever smelled man like the the Terps in this thing is just so amazing and I kid you not man stabbing on Psalm endless like wax is just so freakin good man thinking about doing is heating this up for 30 about 30 to 35 seconds and then waiting about 45 seconds to 50 seconds I feel like that gives it the best the taste and it's not very harsh smoke yet you get very very milky clouds so let's go ahead and torch this thing up boys cheers i heated it up to 35 seconds I'm gonna go ahead and let it go till 45 just because I had you have the window open man and I'm gonna go ahead and meanwhile though let's go ahead and choose a nice little chunky one just to start things off boys because honestly I have I've only dabbed it once today and I feel like man this one's gonna catch me because I'm telling you the hatch frozen is so smooth that you only really feel it when it starts building up in your chest man so we're about during your second day and still got another ten and yeah let me know

super high and I just remember that we also have to smoke another joint so I'm probably gonna step aside from the dabbing and we're gonna go ahead and crack this open man this oh gee Kb your see you guys see how fresh it is man I have not opened it brand new look well you can see the seal right there man this is gonna be the first time guys that I have ever seen this flower in person and I'm kind of excited already it's like a little glimpse right there so let me go ahead and pop this sucker out oh dude oh now just follow my computer oh dude it's as beautiful as the oh oh my goodness dude yo I know my camera is not gonna you know pick up every single watch I'm gonna have to use my phone for this guy's but this but right here you guys know the phone camera picks up every single trichome everything that's why we use the phone and look look at this guy's just look at this you guys are gonna be in all all right so this is the og KB right here look at this dude the beautiful orange hairs I'm talking about look at the trichomes look at the purple little stems think you know oh my gosh the curation on this dude is just so phenomenal I haven't even smelt it what does it smell like I have never saw anything like this smells like me but it's just a different type of legal officer dude this is like literally one of the most aya peeling pieces of bud that I have ever seen and now it's just a fact so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna roll this up I don't know how much help I roll it up but dude this thing is just so phenomenal looking I don't even know if I want to break it apart but I just want to just put this in a casing and just put it in a corner of my room do you never touch it so this thing looks so phenomenal I'm gonna like I said I'm a roll up a joint and I'll see you guys in a little bit right here we got the joint right here man it's honestly I rolled there I've been getting so much better at rolling these freaking joints so all we got to do now man is pretty much just burn off the paperboys and basically here you go here you have it your perfect little or joint now I want to say there's like 1.5 in here man but does it really matter though because I just want to know how good this is man I want to know if it's worth the money because this this 8 was more expensive than a cookie so he hasn't gonna be the first one to find out boys choose only through the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal statement choose wood hmm after that personation I did get a little bit of some a little bit of paper tape so [Music] whoo it's actually pretty freakin smooth man so far so far I do i I did roll these in some raw hemp papers organic hemp so there might be another reason why but honestly so far it's burning a really really smooth I am getting a lot of earthiness from this plant itself and it's giving off a little bit of a sweet tone but honestly it tastes very very very good like it's something like I know we did we'd look I know we do sweet guys but you can tell the difference from something that is properly cultivated to some [ __ ] that you know that that is make that is being made in mass amounts and things like that like these guys they take so much pride because it's small batch all the time they never they never overdo the batches man because they want to make sure that every single planet that they grow is growing to a hundred percent perfection on their own terms you know but so far man I haven't I'll any clips of this this it's burning very very smooth like I'm telling you let me give you guys a little close-up of pilots burning right I rolled it really really good it's burning even all the way through you got the little tip right there if you ask them to see that and it's an enjoyable smoke man it's currently 10 o'clock in the morning and usually whenever this is the first time I'm smoking also unusually whenever I smoke first my eye like I started coffee or [ __ ] to him whenever it's the first work of a bit but this is smooth like I was saying and it tastes very piney earthy but it's enjoyable as heck I don't taste any really fruitiness flavors of it no I taste a little bit of sweetness but it's not overpowering this thing is chiefing though it's obviously getting me super super baby I ended up waiting a little bit after taking the dabs and then just I mean I rolled out the joint while I was high a [ __ ] and then I roll I waited a little bit more that way I could get the full effects because I didn't want to go from being a super stone because that was a super fat that that I just took I don't want to go from being super stoned to you know getting even more stunning I even being able to differentiate the type of high that I'm getting in the flavor because my mouth was dry as heck I kid you not that dad got me so tight but I was brick and faded for it for a minute I'm not gonna lie I have not been that faded in such a long time and it's such a good feeling now and then they finished chugging milk for sure all boys that looks like we're at had a lighter fluid on our centers [Music] this thing is McEnroe I hope you guys like the new location I mean I'm just in my garage and I hope you guys not like the current location man I was gonna do it in my car but I was like man for a special day like this my mind let's just do it somewhere where you know you guys can see all the smoke around me not the same setting give you guys some a little something different I just in used to Macanese well I'm about to finish this whole joint to the face but not on camera because that would literally turn my videos so freakin long all right guys so my review for this ogk be it's about its max I'm high right now like super faded and it's such a different height such a soothing high but usually with wheat it's either I don't get high or I get like you know too high to the point where I don't even enjoy the high because my head's hurting but this right here yeah but this one right here is honestly just hitting like every single aspect bro like I'm sure I know I know for a fact after I'm done with this I'm probably I'm probably gonna have a better good morning you know I'm already have me good morning gonna go better and EMA like like I would say though I would definitely would not mind dropping another 150 hundred 60 on some 17 laps again like because there I'm telling you they're rosin smack nice it was just the perfect gap the turf through there the taste is there that I was there everything about it was so good and I feel like usually I don't get that feeling with other concentrates you know with other flower so yeah man I would definitely purchase this again time though I do want to try the Persie rosin you know want to try I'm not even sure what kind of strain this was it was like an indica or sativa guessing it's either hinder guard hybrid so next time I want to try just a straight-up indica and see how much that smacks me because I feel like if this give this is smack at me right now I can only imagine what a straight up in meter with you so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and hand out the video here because I'm high as a hack right now I just want to enjoy the rest of this man hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video and you know and if you did go ahead and leave a like comment and most importantly hit your boat with that subscribe button and reach so let's try to get 400 K subs I mean 40 K subs boys that's the next call right and you guys are gonna help me do that guys so I hope you guys have a blessed day and we're out",

pot review Alera you got the mixed in with the Vegas triangle era pretty bow", "mTsoEEmz7Rk": "hey guys today we're gonna talk to you about rosin not only are we gonna tell you what rosin is but we're gonna show you how to do it the right way so throw away those hair straighteners and let's get right into it rosin is a concentrate extracted from the cannabis plant using nothing more than heat and pressure the result a translucent sappy and sometimes shattered like product that is potent and flavorful enough to rival any of your favourite BHO products but what is the difference between rosin and other concentrates out there one word of solvents most concentrate extraction methods require the use of a solvent such as butane propane for co2 rosin however does not but how does the simplicity of heat and pressure transform cannabis into such an overwhelmingly great product the accumulation of trichomes trichomes are those small shiny bubbles that appear on marijuana believe it or not those microscopic bulbs actually contain most of the cannabis plants cannabinoids which provide most of the sense flavours and effects but can anyone easily make rosin themselves yes yes you can and will tell you how before you get started you will need a couple things a nug Smasher fresh flower micron extraction bags parchment paper and a dab tool grab everything you need aside from the canvas of course in a bundle at knucks master comm so now you're good to go let's jump straight into one very important factor starting product you may ask which nuts master gives the best results well the answer is all of them you get back what you put in it's as simple as that fire in fire out that is the number one most popular saying in the world of rosin because your extract will only be as good as your starting product if you put garbage into your oven at home it's not going to taste very good now how about a pizza it's gonna be the best thing you've ever tasted same goes for rosin if you put extremely potent trichome coated flowers into a nut Smasher mini well you're gonna get back some amazing rosin if you want high-quality results you need high quality products for tons of information

mini there's really the unit was designed to do two different size smashes um it's really designed for travel personal use trade shows um to go and set up heat up quick and uh then extract either a gram nug or three quarters to a gram nug in a piece of parchment paper with no [Music] bag that's one of the presses that it's made to do which we have here in the back some dosey dough and then in the front we have some chronic kush it's also made to do a three and a half gram smash in a three and a half gram bag like this bottle loaded bottle textile um we advocate that extraction method so all of our surface area to pressure calculations on all of our units have been done assuming that you load the bags bottle textile like i said the mini was made for two two different smashes a single nug smash and a piece of parchment with no bag or a three and a half gram bag smash loaded bottle textile now both of these different uh ways of extraction the different weight of extraction are going to require the same pressure because at the end you're going to get the overall same surface area on the extracted material so if you're up to a one gram nug with no bag it's probably gonna be a little bigger so it'll be a little less pressure that you're applying you know um if you go closer towards three quarter of a gram nug with no bag uh it's going to be uh more pressure on that surface area because it's going to be smaller so you'll learn that as you get a unit and you start to extract you'll see the different different results in and out from the different product and whatnot especially if you're on the growing side so we're waiting for this oil to melt over here we thought it'd be a great time to read off some of your youtube comments on the latest videos believe it or not we actually read all of your comments so let's try to keep it positive um latest video was the bubble hash let's see what you guys are saying so connor 4k hey what do you guys do with the already pressed flower as you can see this is exactly what we do we like to make potent thc oil with it and it actually comes out really clean and really high quality don't recommend smoking it i would personally do the oil 10 times out of 10 with the pucks let's see what else we've got here shady 580 cop watch nug smasher is by far the best on the market you'll get your money's worth and then some my small one is paid for itself many times over i really need to get a bigger and bigger one now production is up well shady 580 we got the nug smasher pro ready for you here just give us a call and we'll get this sent over whenever you're ready what else we got better than watching porn nick garden i'd agree with that porn for stoners i dig it complete wash 86 i could see there's a some similarities there so jared stallman how much material did you start with to get that much bubble hash at once was it nugs and trim or just nugs um for that i don't know the exact amount because our friends over at 11 11 cannabis company uh provided us with the bubble hash but it i do know that it was a fresh flower trimmed right off the plant it was still live so if that answers your question let's see what else danny thompson it's like watching da vinci paint i'm seriously considering picking up a nug smasher at harvest time this year i used to be into the whole backyard blasting thing but figure now that i'm growing the garden of my dreams with all my favorite strains why half-ass it when it comes to concentrates that keef was beautiful i'll always have a soft spot for keith full melts i definitely agree with you blasting is cool but rosin is a lot cooler all right i think that's enough for now let me know you guys thought of that we can keep reading them off like i said we read all of your guys's comments so try to keep it positive if you can [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] hey guys make sure you check us out at nugsmasher.com to check out all of our awesome products

welcome to another live stream can already take a few dabs and hang out it's just got done prepping for another hash wash damn it getting cold in here too because of that I might have to go grab my jacket but um yeah got the AC cranked to 62 degrees that the ice-cold water in the reservoir I've got a bag of ice for the washer and I've got six more bags ice out in the freezer I need to get a bigger freezer and all the materials well so later tonight after I get the kids down spend some time with the wife I'm gonna come back out here and knock out that bubble hash run uninterrupted probably gonna do somewhere between six to eight runs on it depending on how it looks and how everything is coming out [Music] anyways let's go ahead and get a - go in here I hope you guys are having a good day [Music] that was not clickbait by the way for those of you this joint this is a 104 grant or 100 Ford's a hundred grams now mixed strain hash frothing some cookies some sweet cream some

anyways let's go ahead oh it's so good yeah I need to go ahead and fill up a little bit char with that [Music] this was some 60 micron parabola for edibles [Music] this one still has a cush cake in it and this one has on a fish cake so those that's my head - cooks cake in a jar [Music] earth is [ __ ] cold and her alright so I would like you yet in my day did you imagine dabbing that whole thing just like here we feel [ __ ] half the Banger ease and the easily I wouldn't even try it it'd be a waste and a half that's good enough for me enjoy that for the week [Music] the 160 press was man very little in there so that's what that looks like when I end up putting it in the jar and then a lot of people would ask me how did you get that [ __ ] rossington to stick to the bottom of the jar look so neat [Music] here's I take the glove and you're just going to push it down around the edges towards the center you're doing a cold room that's good rosin a clean glove and just like that now it looks like that [Music] with that's hard to see but yeah that's how that comes out when you end up doing that push it down it comes out real nice and clean looking perfect for grams or so it's upload a bird [Music] all right so I gotta move my dad station over now I'm not pressing it back over here well I like it Kiyo is : grab yeah you can do with parchment - I have a little bit more control with the glove I feel like and it rarely gets sticky but parchment works to a more sticky stuff I will use parchment I'm gonna go grab a hoodie real quick [Music] [Music] whoa [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] whoo my tears my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] oh man the big dads always get my nose my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] about three days away from the harvest yeah we're on day 54

them on Monday [Music] five six out of the gate 58 [Music] [Music] I got some pictures of the plants I haven't even posted to Instagram yet pausing to share them with you guys real quick [Music] [Music] turn down the lights already this whole side is just [ __ ] Mileena should be up here these ones dried back a little bit too much almost too much but not too two months still prosti of [ __ ] 12 cars black out there my Spade going over there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's the current status in the Guardian you know just like oh my flesh for usually you're about seven days it's that but you know [Music] I had issues this run just like Ross Leafs his issues because he's in cocoa they're harder to detect early and so he faced the consequences of the buffering that cal-mag provides in coma cocoa I wasn't in at nursery iam so I was able to turn my issues around a little bit faster but you know basically what I'm saying is you know I had issues this run and the crop is still coming out pretty good so next run you know those issues will be corrected I'll make a video covering the issues that I ran into this grow and how I plan to correct them and I'll throw it up on the patreon hopefully you guys can learn from some of my mistakes you know I talked about on the show doing your own research and shape one of the things I researched if I should have used top-down broward rivers and when I talked to mango tech Abadi he told me to use two gallons per hours to avoid clog and that's what each use is but then I ended up getting water channeling that is too fast on the float and I cost a lot of issues I never really fed high enough of an ECE to have the easy build up nor did I ever push the plants that hard to cause them to have any lockouts it was all because my irrigation was wrong from the get-go with the water swim [Music] are you taking off right now that's one of the changes I'm implementing is not only am I going to get rid of the 2 gallon per hour but I'm going to go all the way down to like a point 3 gallon per hour dripper that could eat drawstring and stuff up here so yeah that'll fix a lot of issues right off to that that I believe uh Charles and pastor [Music] that Daffy got me hired balls rolling in on me now [Music] oh my bad I look here looking up and showers my phone [Music] there's no broad my issues going on in here all it is is either a they were different cuts or they were microclimates right he talked about the water channeling so you know phosphorus deficiency can learn to purpling stems and the plants that express themselves differently also has purple stems where I was the ones that didn't have the red bugs didn't have purple stems so I think it was more of a microclimate issue water channeling issue causing different uptake different nutrients and it just got exacerbated due to the lockout because of the water channeling so next one I'm doing is with wedding cake and I should be getting those clones in about two weeks so I have about two weeks to prep get the plants chopped harvested and everything I'll flip them right in the room that they're in right now I'm basically going to push the tables to one side of the room and then I'll go in and use a light rail for this up against the wall and I'll cut down on the one plant out of time and hang it on a trellis hanging from the ceiling and then I'll just hang all the plants from one light all right [Music] when my moustache hairs on the know it wouldn't happen I got trim my mustache geez so yeah basically just go one light at a time right down hole lights worth of plants hang them go to the next one cut those down hang out on a different trailer that's there the next one so I'll have three trellis nets hanging on the side of the room I'll have to retry this netting on that side of the room so after I cut down the whole left side of the room and those plants are hanging up there on that left side I'm going to disassemble the tables and walk them out of the room and then I can push that whole other table completely over to the middle of the room hang up all those buttons on the back side of the room or wherever in the room right and then basically I'll be good to go I'll get everything hung I'll turn off the shaker fan I'll just keep one of them on probably maybe turn it down to low or something and I'll just have to DEET you and AC going in there I'll be able to scrub down the you the four by twelve that's in there now scrub it down and get it reset and start making my adjustments to the room while I wait on my new 4 by 12 American Girl products they're probably they told me it was going to be issued early June like June 8th or 6 but they might be able to get it in sooner so I mean worst case scenario the room will be down for about three weeks while I wait on the new table but I'll just match all the plants on one table while I'm doing that perfect and then when I get my new table in I'll be able to go ahead and transition the plants over throw up my trellis mats and pretty much switch so you know that's the plan and like I said I'll document all the changes to the room it said of everything that I'd be like want to document the changes and yeah my keeper fee no cuts from honest genetics should be here in the next two to three weeks and solved a whole room full of wedding cake in there veg and flour that while I have a child my keeper he knows from our genetics and my new keeper you know caked up cherries wedding cake crossed with cherry something f3 I'm going to do the three-tiered setup but I'm waiting on him to send me the updated invoice for the new poles and as soon as I get those I'll be able to set it up and I'll have pretty much what I was thinking of doing them what happened to rekey poofy nose and I could basically put all of them on their own tier if I wanted and then have clones next to it or I could just put all the moms on one and then since I'm doing two tables at a time I'll just pick you know I'll have two tiers for clothes you know cherry cookies have three thank you thank you thank you I never remember like my keeper he knows from honest I don't remember what I was are either blue hurricane 27 crossed with white sunrise for the blue lion keeper and then scarlet sure is chocolate frosting crossed with something I think [Music] I trust my man on his genetics he tells me yo this is a [ __ ] you should run for a hash let's fire fire fire legs all right now you got it [Music] like I remembered it enough to purchase it and you know that's all that matters now that's all that matters now I need to show up in the garden [Music] so stoked I have I'll have the blue Hawaiian which is gonna have exotic super crazy unique blue Terps it's gonna be highly sativa dominant as far as the high goes and then the truck not the truck cherry but the cakes of cherries that's gonna be my cherry Fino right there so I'll have a blue of a cherry and then I have the gassy out of scarlet shirt so it's gonna be dope [Music] this is real the kind of light that I use for clowns are right behind either the raging raging kales and I actually got sponsored by science LED yeah so I will be getting now raging candle LEDs probably twice a year during two biggest ways that I do and it couldn't be [ __ ] dope it can really know and then every other month or so I'll be giving away a bunch of science LED swag hats ashtrays shirts things like that all be put on there grower spotlight on their homepage pretty shortly here I have some pictures that I have to take for them and type up some some information and what else asked me to leave to help them do research spectrum tuning and hash production so I'll be doing that so and then also the big thing I'll be an authorized reseller for their lights on my webpage as soon as it's up in a few days so as soon as the page is up I'm going to try and get them on there and I'll be able to resell a life through my page so that way you know they don't do they don't do coupon codes like people in the industry you got to use to coupon codes because of for flex and all that but what that does is it makes it so that you can't sell that product in brick-and-mortar stores anymore and in the hydro industry almost need brick-and-mortar stores still surprisingly to you know expand and survive because still a big commercial facilities go through these hydro stores and you know direct to these manufacturers a lot so they don't do coupon codes they're like let's say they offer a 10% discount code here in California right and somebody purchases a light from you know from me and using my promo code but they're in Oregon or something and or somewhere else where they maybe don't charge sales tax and now not only are they getting the 10% off but they're also getting like seven or eight maybe taking even up to 10% off of that because of no sales tax right whereas if they were to purchase it in the store you know the store would be able to make a profit but in order to compete with that price that they would get you know from using the coupon code the brick-and-mortar store would basically have to not turn a profit so it doesn't work out for them to be able to give people who coupon codes stacked as representatives of the brand so instead I'll be able to be a reseller and then just a very very small portion of the profit that they would make from that light will go towards me instead so I'll be an authorized reseller and then basically helping do research and you know passing that information you guys like I have been this whole time so anyways this is what we're working with they bought this is delicious delicious it's called cookie dough and it's amazing [Music] I don't suspect this is gonna last long you won't need a code to let them know who sent you because you're gonna go through my website to purchase they're working on other programs like referral codes and things like that but [Music] yeah I guess I should keep this on camera so people don't think that I'm like lying and I say I got a grandfather drive here we did well today it's real I wouldn't had a couple more but honestly you guys want to get jars of the grape Cosby and literally all I have left of this [Music] that's it but in this drawer it's maybe maybe seven grams six seven grams of the grape Cosby I think the other jars been scraped empty already yeah scraped empty great cause be gone on that one and then the hell a Koosh cake [Music] there's like maybe two to three grams to scrape out of here [Music] and this one I think is scraped completely empty yeah there's maybe like point two in here it's empty so there was 70 72 grams of the La Push cake and 60 grams of the Cosby [Music] but every time you come in here you [ __ ] promotin be real oh no no no who was it last time it wasn't beaver oh it was your boy the other one that's not good Bernhard that's who it was last time [Music] about your ass sorry yo for real alright here's the funny story that's how you guys are quick so the reason this one got called rape Cosby because [Music] my wife and I dabbed it and she got so [ __ ] high off of it it was like she got roofied like straight roofie I could have done anything I wanted to so I was like mother kali shake great cosby it tastes like grapes and knocks you the [ __ ] out like you did this it was between grape Cosby and roofie colada you know think of work 12 but you guys got to make sure you do it right [Music] it's great cause be like that lowercase G Capital are [Music] all right let's get [Music] a little credit given to me I need a label hood [Music] it's not for grams but whatever [Music] you know [Music] so we're gonna get some cookie dough on there a menace [Music] they push tape on there [Music] [Music] [Music] me up a man popular science [Music] my episode 5 right there alone [Music] [Music] there was a five [Music] [ __ ] bones knock out maybe this is episode [Music] all right hold on okay [Music] but right now it is [Music] but few days that idiot that ain't the one all right well [ __ ] it I'll get it uploaded I was trying to do it right now but I'm having a little bit of a hard time finding a you write for [Music] oh here it is [Music] [Music] that's not it either I have like a lot of different files in here that I have to go through [Music] that's three lighting maybe this is the right here number four [Music] okay yeah here it is and as this little my everybody [Music] alright I'll go ahead and get this uploaded to YouTube right you know [Music] I'm kind of done editing these I'm just gonna start uploading the RAW files and if people don't like it they can kiss my ass I don't have time to edit them together anymore that's why I put the PowerPoint how I did you know if I do the PowerPoint I don't have to worry about putting an intro and all that into the video it's just boom okay boss [Music] alright crap dude my science for plant nutrition are a cool description I'll edit that later now don't care playlist crafted science done no it's not made for kids don't have to restrict [Music] monetization please do [Music] public [Music] boom what is instant premiere oh [ __ ] we could watch it together at the same [ __ ] time let's [ __ ] do that right now I did not know we could do that that is really cool we can watch the video together yeah three minutes five all right it's 321 I'm gonna go in at 3:45 and help the wife for the day because that's the way it is [Music] I find on finishing of the loose jars oh that's the one section of illustrator [Music] this is it makes a great Cosby and Kush cake [Music] I don't know what I did mother two minutes [Music] okay a little poison for 30 minutes okay no accident since a wait okay I'll be in by say like 3:45 okay okay [Music] 59 seconds left [Music] very good dogs very good slowly giving them a little bit more freedom and hoping that they don't [ __ ] pee anywhere [Music] green jeans with Superdome [Music] Greenjeans was sooo Oberto 11 seconds 8 seconds that's called your video will premiere what's uploading and processing finished as well as the hundred percent uploaded is 95 percent process I have no idea how this is going to look for you guys I don't know how this works I've never done this before it is [ __ ] top-down so we're gonna check it out oh my god dollars people my DM right now [Music] all right you guys let me know what happens on your end when this is done hopefully I mean it doesn't take forever right now it's an remember you two processes videos one definition at a time so the low definition stuff is going to process and then like for whatever and then 720 and 1080 [Music] my phone right now it's just doing the load F [ __ ] the standard definition version we'll see whatever the [ __ ] back [Music] I'm really curious to see what this does though man that was such a good [ __ ] good [ __ ] episode and then episode 5 I'm glad we took a break because we were really [ __ ] burned out both of us and we needed a skip a week we came back and we didn't even have a PowerPoint or anything but it was still an amazing discussion Garrett jumped online from science at levy and he just [ __ ] to talk about what we wanted to talk about which was great just you know [Music] we just talked about troubleshooting it was [ __ ] awesome you know he get his perspective on things like walking into like a huge commercial facility and how you would troubleshoot their [ __ ] to figure out what's going on why certain part of the crop might not be doing its good versus another part things like that so it was really cool to get his perspective because you know as far as lost leaf goes he's a commercial facility but he's a one-man army and it's a small commercial facility it's the size of a house basically a one-story house and so and that's that's no diss whatsoever [ __ ] it's amazing what he's doing I wish I could be at his level but in the realm of commercial grows it's relatively small so you know his perspective is one and then Maya the home grower is another and then Gary brings a whole different perspective being that he's kind of more on the large large scale commercial and so it was really cool you know and go with it so unfortunately during this whole Cove 8:19 thing all of the HD recordings for webinars are being limited and only being allowed standard definition so this is not going to be best of qualities for the uploads that are going on right now from the webinars and there's nothing that we can do about that so you know [Music] check it on the patreon real quick make sure you guys got your post real quick [Music] are you guys waiting on me to take another dab is that what's going on [Music] I guess [Music] it's not what you guys I feel like a little [ __ ] a dab [ __ ] for you guys it's all you guys wanna take your dad show me his plan it's never hey SB Andy how's your day go what'd you do today need some help no I'm just [ __ ] one shot I already forgot what this one is again that's the coach tasted positive and he's more paper towels real quick cuz my house got so high I forgot to clean the [ __ ] banger after the last job that's [ __ ] I I guess I Cosby myself whoever said don't cause be yourself I can't be myself go clean it out real easy paper towels to clean [Laughter] [Music] yeah all of the rapidly science episodes go on patreon pretty much the same day or minimum a week earlier than YouTube a minimum and Matt doesn't post on lost leaf as a poster or anything like that out of respect for my patreon supporters he knows he waits again he's a week two to three weeks even suppose I mean it's not that I don't want the information out there for everybody but I wanted to I want to give some [ __ ] love to the people on patreon and economic access all that and they can pick my brain talk about it on live sessions or whatever brain different [ __ ] you know [Music] all right the tip of my II now is 395 and I need to grab another roll of paper towels real quick [Music] [Music] damn [ __ ] oh yeah [Music] oh [ __ ] [Music] in the filter [Music] oh Jesus son 525 that is a very very high [ __ ] gasps Jesus [Music] [Music] so the reclaim catcher works by basically a when you draw on the dab it gets stuck down here because all that reclaimed can't travel back up pretty much so what you end up with really is just tiny tiny pieces of the vapor that condensed back to rosin in here versus a shit-ton of replaying and if you have a really good deep-dish banger and you do low temp doubts your your reclaim actually can look really nice how well that looks but [Music] seeing us a thing FPV not everybody's email setup is the same not all coils are created equal so you got to get you know a good coil setup with this I can go three eighty and still get clouds [Music] you need some sort of cloud [Music] all right [Music] my emails from 7-10 coils and you have promo codes with them but up go my man go in the house [Music] did I even bring the [ __ ] Paper Towns yeah I did oh yeah okay don't really need to take another dad titanium holy [ __ ] [ __ ] son if you don't swap that over some glass you can get like a full email kit for around in 250 years [Music] [ __ ] [ __ ] that olive oil will get you bro oh alright you [ __ ] I'd have been dying for this dad for some reason or she dies or more yeah I got ahold of the giveaway winner and he commented all over my YouTube video and everything that following morning Jesus sweet baby Jesus my nose is already like crying thinking about these Turks [Music] Oh titanium is not 2008 oh my gosh bro oh [ __ ] that's funny I've already got throat tickle mmm take him to any dab my throats already got that little scorch to it oh but I'm a man up and finishing [Music] [Music] [Music] we [Music] that's how you beast down and down right there [Music] fire [Music] [Laughter] [Music] I'll have a lot of patience going back up there to deal with kids right now oh yeah [Music] cruising today today is flying by I feel like I woke up two hours ago [ __ ] took five dives I blinked and boom it's already about four here had to clean that tonight [Music] just blowing our play too much [Music] the function on Agentry is crazy [Music] so FPV ahead I wasn't enough cloud for you where are these jars just ridiculous [Music] [Music] [Music] well can't even open it with one hand [Music] you're saying horrible with the [ __ ] up-close [Music] so so good [Music] this lighting is any different was natural lighting appear it's that cookie dough [Music] all right you guys [Music] I'll catch you guys on the next one I'm gonna call it a night I had a bunch of other [ __ ] I gotta get around to these", "dc9wL5oTNWE": "[Music] Cannabis itself has been has been consumed for thousands of years and ever since people have been consuming cannabis they've been making cannabis concentrates and typically how these concentrates are made or just beating the raw material to extract the trichome heads and make what's called hash and there's a lot of plant material mixed in with this concentrate hash needs to be smoked hash oil can be vaporized there's actually no plant material involved hi I'm Mike I work with Rosen technologies I helped develop the pneumatic rosin press [Music] [Music] typically what people do to produce oil these days is with the solvent they'll take a solvent and they'll run out and over the plant material to where it dissolves all of the essential oils the problem went that way is there's those people that take butane and they pour it through glass to very unsafe settings like in a garage and one of the reasons we're so excited about this method of extraction it gives people a way to be able to get these essential oils of the plan without solvents you take the cannabis you put it under the heat and the pressure the oil will run from the heat and now you have just the oil separated from the plant material this is a cannabis oil that is made from just heat and pressures hi I'm David with rasen technologies I'm the innovator of the pneumatic rosin French we designed this product around being able to control that extractions right here at the top you have the digital readout the temperature that the heat Playstore at top and bottom is both heated on the side over here you have the ability to adjust the pressure we also have the two-hand anti tie-down features that keeps the user from being able to have their hand caught in this machine when operating this is actually an OSHA certified design just in case anybody action only took a toke and isn't paying attention they're not gonna hurt themselves yes you could say I'm that type of person that just builds things out of necessity if I'm doing something on a daily and I want to make it better make it more convenient then I'll go out and make something that does that for me we're perfecting our art I feel like it's always interesting to me to see something go to the next extent I think it benefits everybody to see the cannabis industry have an evolution forward [Music]", "l0Umw8g7cQo": "[Music] what's going on guys today we're at the ranch this is our property we have them South Colorado Springs we live in our trailers kick it great views great place to grow pot smoke down all right guys this is the press we are going to be working with today it is a 12-ton rosin press [Music] you can go air compressed or there's a manual option we're gonna go with the manual route today just because we don't want to mess with the air compressor we haven't ran it in a while so we're gonna go with the manual group so we're gonna power it up here it's a little bit difficult to see but we're gonna go ahead and set our temperature [Music] we're gonna be running it at 222 degrees Fahrenheit for this press and we're gonna go ahead and set both our plates that temperature as you can see then we're gonna wait for this bad boy to heat up and we're gonna go press some weed these presses usually run about $1,500 but we actually got quite a good deal and got it for a trade for a pound of weed so usually around 1500 got a fair economy all right everybody here is the weed that we're gonna be pressing in to rosin this is some of our homegrown wheat it is actually four different strains we got some granddaddy purp elephant [ __ ] and EOG tangerine Kush we're gonna try to get about 10 grams of our bud into this puck press and this is what we're gonna be using to press down our weed we're gonna grind up our weed and fill this up and once this is all the way fill you [ __ ] give it a twist and that will tighten it and you put this lid on you screw the lid on and I'll compact all the weed into one nice little puck for the press [Music] alright guys so now that you've seen how that process works we're just gonna fill up and grind up a bunch more weed and we'll see you when that puck pressure's filled up we forgot our big grinders so [Music] alright guys so we're just gonna screw on the lid here and now we're gonna press all the way down into a nice compact puck [Music] dance seven point six minutes all right guys we want to get to ten grams for this press so we're gonna go ahead and put the puck back in and repress the weed to try to get to ten grams [Music] alright everyone here is our new puck [Music] alright guys so the total weight of our puck is 13.8 grams so we're about three point eight over but we wanted but that's alright half an ounce you can see right up here is where we're going our we'd it's a pretty nice setup we'll show you inside in a different video all right we're looking to upgrade that right now so we'll show you the full loop setup when it's all finished we're about there on both of them it's hard to see but both are about two twenty two so we're gonna get the puck in she's ready to go all right guys we're broke as [ __ ] we're using the nonstick just great value parchment paper it works great for this that's all you need we're gonna go ahead and get our two pieces ready [Music] though here is our half of an ounce puck and we're gonna go ahead and put it the press there it is pressing it 222 degrees for roughly in banana half paper good make sure it's centered so we just manually press it together and should get a decent yield from this all right guys we're gonna release it we're gonna take this inside and scrape it oh yeah we got some little dirt here that's right oh yeah [Music] your [ __ ] dabs we're gonna go ahead and take a few so I looks like a good size tab a today's video thanks for watching those are [ __ ] rosin fresh we're gonna take these dad's right now [Music] yeah", "qXQTtjIjZ0U": "alright y'all how everyone's doing good today and in this video we're gonna be talking about rosin more specifically at least in this video we'll kind of talk about half rosin because really rosin is just heat pressure and canvas and really it's not that difficult to explain but when it comes to harsh rosin it's definitely a lot more complex and you can get a lot of different results light rosin with hash rosin you still need good herb but at the same time you can never judge a book by it's cover because at least when it comes to water hash and hash rosin you may not get the best yield if the bud you know looks super try come--and super frosty and all that you make like you may not actually get the best yield for all you know you may get a better yield from a bud that looks okay and it's kind of crazy with hash rosin because this process is so much more complex it actually costs you a lot more as well I mean it depending on the grade of the half-frozen it can be anywhere from like 80 to 140 dollars my obvious that's a big range but with cannabis there's a lot of different qualities so as for the two types of hash that they use for hash rosin it's ice water hash which most which really more than likely I'd say probably 99.9% of the time hash makers are going to be using ice water hash for their hash rosin but the other one is dry sift and that is basically just kind of you know the classic way of getting patched they take a drum that has a screen on the bottom or they have just a big-screen table and they basically just you know break down the buds and they just sift out the hash it's kind of like Keith yeah but in this case because the trichome heads and the glands are a lot more intact and because it's so fresh it's definitely gonna be more like hash because when you pick it up it's definitely gonna be a lot more sticky than it would be if you were to handle this Keith because it's been dried and cured and also until it you guys know what ice water hash is is it's basically putting all of your plant material into a washing machine with ice and water and then it just switches it all around you could some people use Wars or paddles other people use automated systems that just do it all it's itself which honestly is pretty cool I haven't actually seen one in person but these machines are crazy they can go counter clockwise or clockwise and you can set it for it to make two or three revolutions and then go the other way it's it's kind of crazy honestly and with ice water hash you're able to break off those trichome heads a lot more consistently because the way they agitate the buds and the plant material it does it so where it gets a almost perfect every time and then thus going into the filtration process it goes through micron bags which filters out all the plant material and the higher the micron number the more open the holes are and then the lower you go the more tighter than mesh gets there are different hash makers that make a 9bu a 73 and a full-spectrum but more than likely in that full spectrum they're not going to be using that 73 or the 19 I can just tell you that and then if you were really to only get just a single micron hash you really won't get as taste or full-spectrum effect out of it which is the reason why a lot more people like to use full-spectrum hash in order to make their hash process because that taste and the effect translates over so for most full-spectrum hash it's going to be anywhere between 145 to about the 25 range but really those ranges can all depend on the hash maker themselves because the highest amount is really not gonna get you a good yield and the very lowest amount will not get you a good yield at all really because by the time the wash gets down there goes pretty much little to nothing because really between the 70 to 90 micron range is really where you get most of your yield about 70 percent of it and a lot of hash makers they will just take off some of the top ones and the bottom ones and then use kind of everything else in between the reasoning for this is because with the 145 like 150 range even higher the look of it is a lot more green because it has a lot more of the bigger plant material in there so it's obviously not gonna look the best because people are more so looking for a like wider looking crumbly consistency and that's really where you get it from the 70 to 90 range so it's more than likely that they're not including every single micron bag that they use but if they're only doing so in order to maintain quality so like I was saying before how some strains don't really wash as well there's actually a test that some hash makers do it's basically just using a mason jar and putting in a half ounce of flour then ice and water and then kind of mixing it all around if you see the Tri cone heads fall off then you got some good but but if you see them kind of breaking off or the stock kind of breaking off halfway then it's not typically what you're looking for and of course most of the time these hash makers are going to be using live products and live basically means as soon as a flower is harvested they throw it right into a freezer basically or they just freeze it at sub-zero temperatures so it keeps all of the terpenes it keeps all of the cannabinoids and everything else intact as much as possible because if you were to just let it sit out and cure you will be losing most of that taste and the effect so I didn't even realize that there were even more forms of rosin there is a mechanical separation which basically is still rosin they've just extracted some THC a crystals from or they extracted the THC a which turned into THCA crystals and there you go so it's almost looks like a nice like sappy rosin with some diamonds in there which is kind of crazy I'll probably show you guys a picture somewhere because I got it I got this off of High Times as far as this article goes so so I thought the High Times for interviewing for pretty knowledgeable hash makers and providing us with this knowledge and the other method is called jar tech which basically makes the rosin look like a sauce and it's kind of crazy because I don't even know that I mean I mean know that rosin can come in different consistencies like that and then for you to make a rosin and then turn it into a sauce that's pretty cool so I think that's pretty much all that I wanted to talk about at least for rosin anyway if you guys can get your hands on it definitely try it out it is it can't well I mean it can be pretty expensive like I said it can be anywhere from 80 to 140 done 40-plus dollars so if you are able to find some for a good price hopefully not too cheap because you know sometimes the prices are too good to be true but you're able to find some good half-frozen definitely go out there and go try it and I'm also not promoting any underage or you know illegal use but yeah but you

doing today you're watching smoke when I'm doing a review on gorilla grapes from truly made by Blue River rosin this is what it looks like I've already got a dab pulled out so I'm gonna tell you how it feels when I'm done I'm really excited this is my first time trying it I'll let you know how it feels tell me how you think it feels how does it affect you I believe it's a hybrid I'm not sure I'm gonna take a quick look at it once I heat this up I'll let you know all right let's see yeah it's a hybrid so it should be half and half hopefully whoever cleans the bong have you ever cleaned a bomb the bomb water if you ever smoke just dabs out of a bong and then you got the dab resin in the bomb water and then you tried smoking that that taste tasted like this I'm not gonna lie it tasted a little meat starting to cover me up starting to start to feel this one sensation up here not necessary that certain how but through the noise I make another my vampire watching some TV I don't know I might need another one that might have been too weak for me straight up I feel like nothing happened absolutely nothing but that's just me personally what was that again no really great I'm gonna go ahead and try one more because I don't think I'm satisfied you know I think I'm getting a little bit of anxiety actually because it didn't do anything or in fact it might have done something and it's doing the wrong thing for me that's a possibility but good thing I have a different strain to like calm me down in case in case this one hides me up it's not it might be - yep or I'm just hyped up because they didn't nothing probably the secular but you know what actually I'm starting to get home videos and that's all I can feel the hunger bills right now but no stony feeling no stoned at all not strong at all y'all saw that glad you could hear you zoom in look at that little glob I have right now is it's not too small right it's a pretty decent glob oh there you go it's a pretty big size

better just a little bit but man it shouldn't take you stronger it'd be better for somebody who's a little bit like less a little bit less who has less tolerance but anybody else like me probably

is the very last bit I'm leaving duty Shelby's gonna too bad [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause]", "i2e0VGP2PQo": "[Music] a heads Manitou roughout studios and welcome to counter basics today we're going to learn how to make extremely potent cannabutter or cannabis oil using freshly pressed rosin we are going to be using the tea check THC tester version one in this video today if you'd like to pre-order version two of this awesome device please check out t checked ami and use the code roughhouse to save money now the first step into making rose and press cannabutter or cannabis oil is going to be to make some rosin wax now rosin waxes if you don't know that already we've covered this in some videos before so we're not going to go into too much detail but basically it's making concentrated cannabis by pressing between heat and enormous pressure your cannabis buds to squeeze out the rosin for concentrated form and this method we're going to use both the rosin that we press the concentrated version and we're going to use the leftover pucks to make this very strong can of butter so whichever method that you're using to make your rosin you're going to go ahead and do that first and I'm going to be using about three and a half grams I'm pressing about two grams and my first pressing I'm using this rosin TechEd products smash is the name of this device I'm using here I'll put links on where you can get different kinds of rosin Press devices and the description of this video as you can see there the pressure and the heat combined together and it squeezes out the concentrated cannabis now this concentrated cannabis is what we're going to be using as the basis to make this high-potency butter but we're going to go ahead and separate at the beginning the puck from the cannabis itself from the pressed out rosin because we're also going to be using the puck which is this piece here that you see to make our counter butter and the first infusion so go ahead and press the amount of rosin that you're going to use I'm going to use about three and a half grams so I've pressed twice and then the next step after you've pressed your rosin is going to be to infuse it now I'm putting my oven on 200 250 degrees Fahrenheit so make sure you do that at Fahrenheit or you'll burn your canvas up so pre-heat your oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit and I'm gonna be I pressed the rosin twice I'm only going to use one of the actual concentrated forms of the cannabis but I'm going to be using both of the pucks that are left over because the rosin press is not the most efficient way to pressure cannabis or between concentrates out of a cannabis there's quite a bit of THC left inside of those puffs so the first step in this is going to be to first infuse and whichever kind of oil you want you can use butter you can use olive oil in this case I'm using coconut oil and we're going to take our rosin pucks in a very small container I'm just using a metal and 1/2 cup measuring cup have broken those into really tiny pieces they're pretty easy to break it's already been decarboxylated by the pressure and the heat from when it was originally pressed so we're gonna be able to skip the press or the step that we usually do have decarboxylated I'm gonna go ahead and add in I'm using one tablespoon of the coconut oil into both of my pucks which is what's left from three and a half grams or 1/8 of cannabis I'm going to put that in my oven covered with some aluminum foil to keep down to smell for two hours [Music] now during this time I'm going to go ahead and scrape off the leftover or the rosin that I've pressed out in the original pressing and what are you gather this up and collect it on a small very small piece of paper smalls can trim down for the parchment paper there so I've trimmed that down I've got all my rosin right in one little spot here and we'll be adding that to our butter and a little bit later but before we do that we're going to filter our butter so what I do is I put the little Roz and paper down in the bottom of my filter pan and I put the filter on top because I don't want to combine that rosin into all these rosin pucks again the last thing we want is it for it to absorb back into our cannabis pucks so just for testing purposes here I've only infused the cannabis pucks here this is without the rosin add into it and just for our reference I'm going to note how much we have here for cannabis so we've got fifteen point five that's milligrams per milliliter there we're going to look at it in the tablespoon version so it's a bigger number that we can figure out so looking we've got two hundred twenty seven point eight milligrams per tablespoon prior to adding in our actual concentrate so now what I'm doing is I'm filtering out that plant material from the pucks and I've poured it right on top of that rosin that's on the parchment paper beneath there and we want to use the heat of the oil to remove the the actual rosin from that parchment paper so it's important that you do that later and put it back into that 250 degree oven for about 20 minutes after that oil gets up to about 250 degrees it's going to make sure that all the rosin has come off of that parchment paper and you can just take a spoon or a pair of tweezers or something and just slosh it around in that water and that that all that rosin that was on there it's going to absorb all the way into that and now we're ready to do our final filter and what I do here is I use a much finer mesh than I did before I'm just using a coffee filter and what's it leaks through your coffee filter good then you can squeeze it out to make sure that you get all of the cannabis out of your filter there I'm just gonna make sure that we have all the plant material out of our butter or our oil have a nice refined oil and at this point it should be very very concentrated because we've added in all of that rosin from the original so the next test now is going to be to just test it with our THC tester and see what kind of potency we have I can tell by the color of the oil it's probably going to be pretty strong but you can't really tell definitively that way so let's go ahead and test it there with our tea check let's see what we have over over the limit that's a good sign but it doesn't really tell us much because we really need to know the exact but it's over the limit of the device the testing limit so what we're going to do there is now we're going to dissolve half-and-half so we've mixed one half part of the unenthused oil with one part of the infused oil and then we were to retest it again and now we'll be able to multiply everything times two to get the accurate reading so our Teeples tablespoons is 574 milligrams per tablespoon that's great that's really nice and strong it's 39 milligrams per milliliter 190 1.4 milligrams a teaspoon and that's 4.2 percent total THC and our powder really happy with that and really it would have been amazing if I had added in all of the rosin from that we'd have had closer to 800 milligrams per tablespoon and amazing amount and now what I'm doing here is I'm taking one table or actually one teaspoon which is just about 200 milligrams per teaspoon and I'm adding that into about six ounces of melted chocolate and what I want to do is I'm going to make some candy bars and I'm going to be able to know how much THC is in these candy bars it's going to be plenty strong enough and without much taste so the one thing about this oil is it because we used a very small amount of oil we've got a high potency there but we also use the concentrated cannabis we have a much more pleasant taste that what if we had to add a lot of cannabutter to get the potency that we wanted or if we had used a full plant extraction on the whole way because the rosin has a lot more say pleasant agreeable taste and then does the full plant extraction in general so with these two candy bars I put two teaspoons and a little bit more still would have been equal to 400 total milligrams so I've got two bars here that would be 200 milligrams each bar but you can take those and chop them in half and what you'll end up with is 100 milligram candy bars which is a great thing to know and it's also a great amount of dosage with the this kind of candy bars too you can break off the little pieces and you know have like 33 milligrams per bar or like 8 and 1/2 milligrams per little section there and so that's just one of the many things you can do with a high potency infused oil I would like to thank the guys that teach at me for sponsoring this video you can save money on version 2 of the tea check THC potency tester that's coming out soon use the code ruffhouse at tea check me and again thanks to those guys for sponsoring us I hope you enjoyed this episode if you did please hit the like button and also make sure you subscribe to roughhouse studios and please follow us on Instagram Facebook and Twitter to know when we have videos coming out in life this is matt from ruff a studios thank you for watching", "JFsMt06dqD0": "[Music] since rosin is extracted using only heat and pressure it has a much more broad spectrum than any other extract that uses a solvent to soluble eyes the compounds it's trying to capture heat and pressure removes all of the oils that you're looking for we've been getting some feedback from our patients concentrates such as rasa are very good at giving immediate relief from pain anxiety or insomnia and it can also increase your appetite very rapidly rosin would be dosed using either a Dipper or the nudie pen or any other vaporizing product that a patient may have a feed onset is basically immediate and the duration is anywhere from 30 minutes up to the only four hours depending on the patient's tolerance", "1nDQEqUiV_o": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the cannabis sommelier i'm your host andrew friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis reviews today we have an awesome product category it's extracts i've only had one extract on the channel i personally love extracts it's mainly what i smoke it's what i'm used to vaporizing from the legacy market something that i hold near and dear to my heart and i'm actually going to show you my live rosin and hash rosin in a coming video from my garden you get to see some of the things that i've made and some of the cannabis i produce and kind of see how i'm holding people accountable to my standard but what do we have today a really cool product uh from an awesome company out on vancouver island from good buds we've got hash rosin and you might be asking yourself andy what's hash rosin well let's take both the words break them down hash being uh seething the glandular head off of cannabis either through a dry sieve or a wet sieve being bubble hash or dry sip i believe this one comes to us from a fresh frozen bubble hash because that's what they have on market right now and what their product card is saying now rosin if you're not familiar with the terminology rosin it's actually the way you can excrete the essential oils from the cannabis flower or hash by only using heat or pressure and then you squish out those essential oils and you leave behind any contaminant that may be there giving you a beautiful dabbable product there isn't very many uh products to dab on market right now so that's why i was excited to see the good buds hash rosin come out and at a reasonable price point this is a half gram and the half gram is 40 that's what i paid for it so not too bad now i see this it was packed on may 6 2020 uh net weight half gram and it's equivalent to two grams of dried canvas not bad at all the smoke from cannabis is harmful there are 800 milligrams of active thc in a full gram of this so 400 milligrams a lot of thc a lot of terps uh all the good things that you're looking for if you are have found that you've built a big tolerance to cannabis and you've never tried an extract before like rawson shatter live resin or even just hash i definitely would recommend uh supercharging everything up you can use these products in different ways today i'm gonna use them in a dab rig because that's the best way for me to assess the flavor but enough talking about it well i think i mentioned good buds is certified organic which is cool uh good buds this is from sun grown cannabis and the company was started out the back of a sprinter van i believe uh growing cannabis and evolved into an entire licensed producer so good for the guys out there for having the business acumen to bring something like this to market and be one of the first movers pretty cool in my opinion i don't know who processed it for them but if i was to make a bet on it i think it was whistler tech here we go let's break the seal underneath this camera and we've got this big package see our cannabis seal all of our good stuff let's get in there hope you're having a wonderful day oh can i get in with my just my thumbnail there we go and then it should be a easy peasy lemon squeezy and there is what's inside of our package which is another child proof container and there is our rosin let's inspect our container no contaminant doesn't look like there's any contaminant it's a little dark but we're not raws and racist here so we're gonna try it it definitely has that crust formed on the top it's been sitting packaged for a couple months now so that's fair um but let's dig in and then we'll start smelling it very soft you can see there buttered underneath that color goes all the way through i kind of like to break this out of here but let's smell it so this is a mixed hash they say that it's a bunch of mixed ones but i know they have lord of the apes and white glucky so i assume it's a mix of those two um on the nose there's like lemon lemon bar a little bit of lemon cream yeah definitely just those confectionary kind of cakey lemon bar aromas creamy sweet cream lemon it's quite simple that's all i'm really pulling out of it at first i had a bit of an aroma skunk but that skunkiness is gone let's see if i can pull this out of there there we go we can get it out pretty easy and uh we can get a little booty shot of our grain or our half gram here so you can see how it waxed up in there you can see the sheen on now that's been opened it's sweating a little so that's pretty cool uh oh no stuck to my finger okay so now most importantly let's taste it uh if you guys aren't used to doing dabs it's a little bit of a process there are more things you are going to need a rig now there's many different options you can use an electronic rig like the g pen rom that heats up and it's you know click of a button it all turns on i have reviews of that um or you can use the traditional rig banger and a torch with a carb cap today i think i'm going to do that since this is hash rosin i want to give it the respect i'm going to put the respect on it um so let's give that a little taste test out of my elbow dyno 2014 very cool check out elbow glass this is one of his original shapes um always wanted this piece very very cool i am using i forget what kind of banger this is and then there's a ruby insert in here we're gonna use the gordo scientific cap this is a blazer big shot torch in case all those things matter to you there's a lot of pieces to this dabbing thing but again as i mentioned vaporizing essential oils is what i uh tend to do the most it's the most time consuming but it's like smoking an entire joint in one puff and that's pretty all right if you ask me so there we go got it hot enough and now we're gonna wait a minute good thing i have a timer up here or else i would completely lose this we'll put that little guy into that bottom shot while we wait for it here well let's do it up here the dino just cooling down super cool love this piece absolutely love this piece um i was really happy actually me and my wife bought it together and we got hooked up through homeless hittings at homeless headies on instagram you should definitely check out homeless headaches if you're looking to get yourself a sick rig at a great price all right that's about our dab temperature and uh cheers okay so pretty good um things that i often look for in a hash rosin uh are that it has no plant matter taste um there wasn't any plant matter taste so that is a good sign and then the motto is there's always going to be a little bit of residual in the banger so you got to waste it to taste it but we're going to want to wipe out what's left over to keep our banger nice and clear we can really get a lot of indications off of the q-tip as well see if there's any contaminant anything like that and to me it uh it melted pretty clean actually um so pretty pretty good um what did i taste though i did try their white glooky's hash and i could taste that kind of wood chippiness come through from um that hash so maybe that's one thing i did take a decent size dab so i was really trying to taste it on the palate i got um i guess a little bit that lemon bar a little bit that sweet cream i definitely got wood chips i tasted a lot of like older hash that maybe had been quite oxidized but the finish is nice and long on my palette not bad at all i think it's a good representation of where the legal market can start and what we can evolve too i think it's probably competing with a lot of things on that legacy market right now maybe not the top top end um but it's not uh it's it's it's not too bad um okay well let's break down the good buds hash rosin from top to bottom how we liked it uh so the appearance it is hash rosin uh we're not rosin racist but i would like a much lighter creamier um more stable less sweaty as soon as i open it product there are a lot of things that uh this could go through to give it a different formulation so on the appearance i guess there's no contaminant the color's rough um we'll give it 15 points i think 15 points is fair for the appearance this is definitely maybe just a year behind where it could be um the smell wasn't too loud as i mentioned it is a simple rosin it had that sweet cream lemon bar kind of buttery lemon bar i don't know not anything insane again 30 points done the taste was good the finish is definitely the best part but when i did get that little bit of wood chippiness that didn't get me too stoked it would just kind of tasted like old hash um just being an absolute hash head i knew what i was tasting um so in that case for the taste i'd like to give it 13 points could have done better didn't taste bad had a nice finish um but the pieces of it that stood out to me i could kind of feel like it might have been i don't want to say faulted but i could i could tell that it wasn't um what it could have been uh overall experience based on my knowledge of cannabis rosin everything about this um it's like a 70 product so let's give it 14 points and that's my total i bet it's about a 70 percent uh hash rosin um ways to go good starting point not overly upset at my purchase for forty dollars and let's play with it once before we go in the camera so you guys can see the butter butter see the sweat mixing up but it is quite sticky and let's give it one last smell no nothing's changed just sweet cream and lemon awesome thanks so much for watching i hope you're gonna dab some extracts i hope you're out there i hope you're gonna move into that new world have you ever dabbed before let me know below let me know if i need to do a dab tutorial or something like that and cover it a little bit more in depth i really appreciate you watching have a great day make sure to like comment share and subscribe cheers guys what's my name what's my name the cannabis somalian", "eGv1Rp1Doig": "hello ladies and gentlemen for those of you that watch this after the fact this is going to be a rather long video and my rather long I mean we got a little bit of cleanup to do to make but obviously if you're watching this after the fact you probably already know that because the however long this video took it's probably in the corner of the thumbnail that you clicked on yes these are my bubbleman dry sip screens even begin to express how much dry sift and by dress if quality hash I've sifted off of some cannabis with these screens Jesus when you think about it in like monetary from a monetary standpoint if a gram of high-quality hash is worth 50 bucks oh my god the thousands and thousands of dollars I've made worth the passion with these screens anyway they come with LPI or mesh which is 200 110 and 90 and that's reversed from your micron value that makes this a 160 micron a 120 micron and that's about a 70 for a little closer to 74 that's 73 so let me get some jars and buy some jars that just means some things [Music] [Music] sometimes these fall or sometimes it'll move off the yeah you see Lily oh hey real quick shut up scope and stack here not familiar with this company scope and stack you should check them out on Instagram I reached out to them about an item when I bothe my torches was on me of course why would I have those on you at one time anyway um my red torch my original blazer I got they gave me an incredible deal on a silver brushed nickel very like very bright like the way your the way the nozzle looks when it's brand new and then as soon as you light you to torch the one time it starts to get brown on the edge you know what I mean like just bright beautiful clean bright silver so I put that one on my red torch and I hacked I just commented on it like right after I bought that from them which they gave me a great deal they posted the green one with a red torch and I just commented underneath they they're like oh man now I gotta get a green one too and scope and stack thank you guys I opened up the mail and sure enough there's my beautiful silver one I'm gonna cut in an incredible deal on already and you paired it with a green one as a surprise you guys [ __ ] Rock and for the record for anybody on the fence about these things like well that was a bad example because when are you ever gonna do that with a torch but the idea is that your torch is very very weighted very heavy if you're on a you know I'm not sticky if you're on a nonstick surface your torch is going to move before it's gonna fall over it's gonna mean like it's just it's awesome and then of course the heat guard anybody that has the Blazer knows you cannot do this for this long the silver part is [ __ ] hot by now yeah so on top of it looking [ __ ] fine they upgraded my torch game big-time man [ __ ] the red ones looking all sharp and the black one black and green ok I'm sorry take me this long to get started I press through the gun line but anyway cleaning to do just quit and buy a little bit of cleaning I mean we're gonna collect some dry sip and I don't use I don't use another banner or parchment or anything I prefer to work on stainless steel for a number of reasons number one parchment um you know all static electrons if you notice like when you're in a plastic bag and you have a little bit of shake left and it just spreads itself evenly all over the walls of the bag we could you static electrons are on the outside of the back that's the way that's where they're physically placed that's not really important with or wow that matters because with stainless steel if there happens to be any static it would have to be of course on the other side of the object or the side of the surface that I'm using um it's just uh that's a little deeper electromagnetic really we're getting into we're getting into physics now and oh my god chemistry is hard enough for me ladies and gentlemen and the physics is theoretical but the fun is real you better believe it but god damn that is uh that's not just easy-peasy having fun and I'm just doing a little extra white beauty I don't know I was packaging some things and then I'll just got a couple little daddy spots um so anyway there's a trifold reason there cleanliness number one because I can get stainless steel very sterile and yes I mean very sterile that's hilarious because either is or isn't but in a non c1v1 laboratory environment where I'm not completely Thai backed up and everything obviously I run the risk of contaminant it just is what it is so to combat that as much as possible we glove up we're clean our stainless steel by putting a little bit of liquid and wiping on it just a liquid actually does uh literally do that done the movement of the static electrons if there's any static on the table right now this house is it's dry out here the barometric pressure is high rocketed right now it is a static environment if I was to dry sift onto a bunch of pieces of parchment like this when I go to pick up pick it all up I mean my god it would be it's just a lot harder to collect um I do have a card somewhere around here but it's my old Montana ID so I got to make sure that down okay so let's get our little feet out and buy a little jar gonna make this possible for us I am not using material screen tonight and the reason I'm not using that tonight is because I am only after we're not doing the material I'm getting ready to bounce here and get her to dress it it's going to be further processed it'll be washed and to see how what kind of hash I can get off of it after this which I'm sure I'll have a lot because we're not going to be it uh but the reason I'm not using my top screws cuz I'm really only going anything that stays above this I want to put back in the bag anything that lands on here I'm going to use this screen Jesus Christ Carlo and Jamie I don't know how I didn't just break that leg anyway then I'll use this screen and my carting technique to actually see or sift the resin heads and then what we have waiting for us down here we'll make some [ __ ] and fire hash hash brazo or hash we'll see and if anybody cares the string we're going to sift tonight is yep the string goes in that sangria it's uh very familiar with with the growers that I work with right now is this amazing and this is one of the cultivars that he grows that is just phenomenal absolutely phenomenal looks like we got a couple people in the room let me hit the other side the camera here yo Joe what's up Stephen um no I didn't have to I started making them in college as a matter of fact but I think my background in chemistry helps because I am I'm one of the few extract artists that I know that I it's not a bragging point it's just the fact I can make every consistency of rosin you have ever seen I can I mean I can make rosin jam and rosin sauce and I'm gonna I got a bunch of it's City Hall behind me right now a right behind camera everything solvent lessly I can wash pretty witty high-quality hash I don't think I'm the greatest water hash washer or maker yet that's something that I will get better and better at but I can certainly make some very very high quality hash and I can make some very very high quality rosin and I can do some really funky things with that rosin on a press so that is just gasless and hydrocarbon free or solvent let's work my back ground in chemistry gives me the ability to not only do those things that we did in the 90s when I when I was in college but because I have a background in chemistry I can work with hydrocarbons safely so not only can I do everything that you whatever want to do with these things or let's see let's flip you back here can I flip you back [ __ ] it those that thing yeah that's a big ol gallon milk right there that guy anyway um so aside from getting every you know dialing in processes obviously I can safely use hydrocarbons and by that I mean active or passive closed-loop systems I am very very very familiar with vacuum purging essential oils and resins ovo resins to be specific to purge them free by part per million 0 ppm of their residual solvents and then of course now that's something that you can you can learn how to do pretty easily operating a closed-loop system especially some of the newer ones that are very automated can be pretty pretty simple or at least you can learn it within a couple months or something kind of thing you know and with it within a couple months you'll be putting out some fire when I started making oil we didn't have any of that stuff we had like I got like picture this bong except there's no bomb here at the bottom this is just like that's what the top end looks like and the other end comes to like a nipple and you turn that upside down and I mean the guys that were that didn't really didn't know what they were doing were just blasting with can butane at that point not even distilling their can of butane and then using clean Eugene but so aside from the fact that I can I know what I'm doing and I know my way around the laboratory because of my education I also I've also had the ability to kind of grow with the industry and always sort of stay ahead of it by the time they started producing even close to automated closed-loop systems around 2014 or so I was so used to passively recovering and that's just recovering my butane with nothing but temperature no pumps or anything like that that uh you know it's it's just it's been easy every every new thing that has come about whether it's been something that I've stumbled on or developed on my own or just seen it has been very easy for me to emulate because of my and aside from all those things it makes people take you a little more seriously when I of course then the next thing they want to know is like well yeah if you say you went to school or you say this and what you're kicking - look let's talk some chemistry and they want maybe they Google a couple questions or whatever for you out of [ __ ] no or maybe they really are chemists so they know what to ask you to see if you actually have an idea of like what what isomerization is or what decarboxylation truly is what it is to break off of a molecule and then of course the final thing I was going to say with my education that that my education provided for me is something that a lot of people in this industry either cannot do or it's one of the only things they do and again I can I make everything solvent list that you've ever seen any bras in our house rosin or hash I make any BHO that you've ever seen shatter crumble batter diamonds saw all of it and I can also not only run a short path distillation but a short bath distillation unit but I can also fractionally distill so when you're a short path to sailing you're you distill all the cannabinoids into one solution so then it's you know 97% THC and 2% other cannabinoids 99% cannabinoids great distillate I can then take that and with the proper head I can fraction that distillate and break the cannabinoids apart actually molecularly separating each compound within it to a point of pure liquid THC that's not the kind of thing that you just pick up in a garage I know I really really went off the chain there with Stevens question but um I felt like it was a good one but no you don't have to if you want to be a guy that wears every [ __ ] hat there is to where you might want to take a couple classes and if you're not a fan of taking classes then you might want to hire me for a consultation www 710 extraction is dot-com shameless plug right no I'm just kidding here we go what's up UK strange what's up bill annoy what's up Danny Brizard what's up Braden hey as my homie lifts and shaker you know what's up you know what's that man dog shut up all right you must be new brother I don't I don't really shut up homie and honestly if it wasn't for the fact that there's a couple other homies in the room right now that I'm gonna get this done for um Oh UK I'm not gonna send it homie I'm gonna bring it with me [ __ ] I should have said that I mean either way I want you know I want to come busy you all on hash you all the [ __ ] out but homie I uh if it wasn't for everybody else in here I probably just take like 20 minutes right now and tell a story about like the first time I tried to wipe my butt and didn't do a good job and ended up heaven stinging butt cheeks walking around middle school or high school that's not like a good story for you guys ah but yes so I uh what's up tell me what is your process for making those rods and diamonds very simple I take rosin right I think the vinyl mask whatever it is and I press it into rosin I let that butter I don't have a jar of that to show you once I have buttered rosin I then do a mechanical separation that gives me gh CA isolate inside of the bag when it's fully finished and what I pull off of that is the turkey infraction very much like the way you separated in a hydrocarbon crash in a jar Tech BHO after I take and this is some odor be great please the crystals these are why these are so much darker when these crystals right here are melted they are or when this THC a is melted down to crystalline it will be well crystalline but much much lighter in yellow and even almost white so once I've separated it into these two then with some pretty extreme temperatures I melt this into here and then I recombine as as the patient desires or as I see fit I mean by how much what what you know by how much of a syrupy infraction I get how much yield I get on the ice isolate that's it what setup do you recommend for a gainer to start an extraction be the shadow rock etc um so if you're beginning and depending on what's taking in but she's I don't know I was trying to think of [ __ ] anything [ __ ] to say that's all I could come up with anyway uh what's that we got here honey tubes you know me so for a beginner honestly and it shattered ax etcetera that of course sounds like pho so if you're if you're absolutely only interested in a pho or being able to make shatter and wax and being able to get 20 and 30 percent yields which is totally understandable part of the reason why that's my with my first specialization you're gonna need a closed-loop system and you can get small ones you know a one-pound closed-loop unit with the recollection vessel and you need some buckets and some dry ice and and a little hot plate or a source of warm water or hot water and if you are completely unfamiliar then I would reach out and hire someone like me for a consultation to help you to walk you through that process it can be dangerous people do blew them blow themselves up however sorry about that if you're not trying to necessarily or have to make shatter or BHO or wax I make rosin batter rosin sauce with diamonds in it that you see here GAC isolate the crystals the terpene sauce all of that is made here on this wroth impressed so it's a you know it's safe and if you're a beginner and you don't have much of a chemistry background then I think that's probably where you want to go bro we got 20 people in the room my belonging Bowl [Music] last time I bought getting water on plan um no I didn't forget it we got the truth check setup for later but I don't have any new hash or anything I've only been making stuff for work so I uh I thought we'd do this all right ladies and gentlemen here we go caliber of cannabis gardener that I'm working with gross and I think I'd like to take a quick second to bring you in on that again we are gonna be running some his name is Carlo Jan kita you can't the only thing you could promise to get to get to this is this provider number and that won't do anything for you cuz there's no way you could get into the Montana this metric system but anyway this strain were running tonight or gonna try sniff this sangria and this is a reduction bag so this is completely untrained and unkept just just D foliated we'll take a look here hey cryptic can you hook up Alex with that info for me brother the wet book it on the website it's probably the best way ma'am encrypt experiment the link if he's still in the room if you can help me out yeah you guys not even a zoom no flash on this [ __ ] I'm live on YouTube I can't have flash my homie grows a reson bro rosen Destin I'm glad you made it brother sorry I have gloves on it's so hard to zoom out okay we I just pulled this out of the freezer so I'm gonna get going WW 710 extraction is calm and there is a booking option on the on my website right there on the front on the cover page and that is the best way if you've booked an appointment through the website which has the mini availability and stuff like that then I get a notification immediately on my personal cell phone we've been out of the freezer.now for mmm a little over a minute on YouTube I need to take homeys advice and just shut the [ __ ] up because again this stuff needs to be kept as cold as possible Wow you're looking good my phone's gonna come out of this thing here sorry guys give me just a second there we go I'll give you the tilt where's the tchaikovsky I know bro I can't play that and make dress up at the same time and my god you don't want to hear me trying to play it try to tchaikovsky right now it's been it's been years since I've been on a piano since I've played regularly so keeping the material as cold as possible you can see it just barely lightly bounced and this again because I have multiple strings I'm not doing a single screen quick bounce deck or anything that would be just 10 seconds of agitation and then literally collect what's on the table underneath it but it is good it is good to not overload the string with math by a master material you want a nice small amount on here a lot of people would literally just dump this whole bag out I start moving trying to move it around you're not giving yourself enough room to let your screens work and the other thing is of course when you're using your card don't do this this pushes the Cannabis down through the screen you can either go like literally at a 90 and don't even touch the screen just touch the canvas and move it around back and forth or you can go under and pick it up and bounce it back down but don't force anything through this room that's essentially it so we're gonna shake this around a little bit you guys for those of you that are like oh me they want me to shut the [ __ ] up which I get that dude I get it YouTube is it's full of a lot of videos that are that are you know that condense all the information I'm going to put in this entire livestream into like a two minute video and I I don't lay out my information like that number one because it's not fun for me and I'm not here making money I'm here trying to have fun and then number two it's very hard for people to be able to replicate what it is that you're trying to share with them or do for them when you social media condense your information so my tutorials and my channel and my whole theme has never been based on the trailer or the cut down video or the the time last video you know I mean that's just I use this is a lot of time when a lot of other youtubers will literally take this entire process and in time lapse the whole thing and turn 30 minutes into one and during those 60 seconds they'll share a little bit of information with you other than the babbling that I'm doing like right now which happens a lot but anyway I try to use as much of the time that I have throughout the entire video to share as much information as possible and into questions like we have so far a couple of them in the comments there because in that situation if I do a good job hopefully someone watching this as its archived you know I've not as a live stream just later hopefully they can get and get the same answer if they were wondering that question too and Britney of you that are watching this after the fact this is a live stream so if you'd like to watch or look what people are commenting or if you're wondering what I'm talking about or who I'm responding to you always have the option to watch the live chat if you're on your phone or any kind of a mobile device you may have to select that or open the live chat to be able to see it and then you may want to change from the well you change it from whatever it's normally set on to all messages I think it's set on like I'm most popular or something like that or I don't know how it determines that metrics but either way you if you select the little message notification a little icon there you can you can change it to watching all messages and then as you watch this live stream not live you can see what the other people are saying is there is there watching so like right now you can see people saying like shut the [ __ ] up dude alright let's see let's see what I missed that is so I'll tell you this even um I I have a very odd variance of hourly rates and I can tell you right now though just like kind of ballpark depending on whether or not it's a fit like a person-to-person I'd fly to your city or to your place or you come to me or you know and that's and that's the kind of situation where I need to obviously set a lot more time aside that's uh that gets more expensive and there are single click just telephone call consultations that I do that are the cheapest thing that I offer and then video chat or voice chat or ansari video chat like hangout or skyping and that's the most common thing that I employ employer because it's uh I'm sorry the most common thing that I deploy use because it's uh it's I talk with my hands a lot there are a lot of times they when I'm doing my consultations I'll be you know in my workspace just like this or depending on what we've talked about it and I know what your consultation is gonna be about then I'll make sure I have some jars of some stuff to show you how I did what or how I got to here and then I you know ask you to get your pen and paper out and I walk you through those steps after all you paid for the consultation but to give you a ballpark range generally maybe somewhere roughly a hundred dollars an hour could be more expensive depending on what you're looking for could be significantly cheaper depending on how much consultation you're booking and you know what kind of what kind of information you're looking for and how then in-depth of that information is but generally right around a hundred dollars an hour and I also offer half hours so a lot of people after they hear that they ask me how I came to that price well I found five different extractors throughout one it was here in Montana but throughout the Pacific Northwest Northern California Oregon Washington and one here in Montana who are all doing consultations throughout the west coast and I found the one that had the least amount of experience and he happens to have about one-tenth the amount of experience was making hash that idea he has a little less than two years where I have about seventeen years so I have about ten times his experience I took $50 off of his rate and that's how I how I came up with my number I know the amount of information I can offer I know the amount of information I have in mind I know this person very well he's a good friend and I know how much more I have to offer than he does and he does not consult for anything less than 150 and up so that sounded very expensive to me but at the same time you need to I gotta feed the hurt so I gotta be able to I gotta be able to get what any okay guys it's time switch this over I don't have a okay guys I'd like to kind of take this and then pick it up with my last little back-and-forth and then of course when we're completely finished I'm sure you've already guessed and some of you are saying I'm sure dude why are you going to all that trouble to get that let's take a little piece you literally gonna pour the same string right back on top of that you're right but that material has not been moved around the screen and completely thought out and you know been beat up a little longer you add you take your material the more particulate or plant matter you're going to get into your hash so if you can't fit all the material you're going to fit onto your screen at one time then you need to make sure you clean in between I used to call this bounces but I just call this in between sifting but I don't know I learned a lot of the terminology for a lot of what I learned how to do in college and you know a lot of the chemistry when I came around to that when I came around making hash in South South Lake Tahoe it started to do it professionally um it was really funny because I had a I had quite the education to go through to learn the hash makers terminology for a lot of you know things well now like the greatest example is decarboxylation everybody used to call that activating it yeah sure you're making your thta THC so it is psychoactive but way more specifically your oxalate your breaking the carboxyl group but as you see enough material here that we can see plenty of screen in between and it's nuts not anything crazy or heavy we're just gonna keep on gently sifting sorry about that guys implore deploy and how I card my hash and how I make use of what this is is me how I take any and doesn't to be a card it can be literally anything a piece of [ __ ] glass just don't pick something that's gonna cut your screen you know I'm saying it's essentially how I literally move the Keith around or the dry sift around on the screen to to force the screen into doing its job that makes the screen does the work if you're if you're working with hash and you're you're making the hash to be made it's not going to be quality almost all of processes like this except of course if you're going to do like some kind of a BHO crude and then into a distillation that level of refinement obviously you can you can literally go for every single thing on the plant and then clean it back up in post process not this this we need to get the highest highest quality and only the highest quality off of here if possible so that when we go to press it I don't have to say oh man why did I spend all that time jabbering on YouTube about making dry sense and had to come out all darkened or not dark really because I didn't get the [ __ ] about the color I'm talking about the flavor and with this it would be significantly darker because there would be more chlorophyll in it this is pretty fresh chemists just harvested with him in the last I'd say was in the last 30 to 40 days I'm actually could be a little own that could be like 300 could be three to four months sorry I didn't check the metric tag but regardless it's another one of my favorite things about working with this gardener he knows how to cure properly so when he does is 100 day killer on a lot of his flowers the chief and chooses to do so on among many he is still playing it in the proper temperatures and with the absence of light so that when I process it and it's 120 days old I still end up with beautiful gold and unicorn feellike terpene fractions or some beautiful nice you know light color - and I love these obviously if you don't know this already solvent which processes are going to be less attractive by that I mean a little less a little darker color then most of you hydrocarbon processes and the reason for that of course is people usually can't afford the yield that of solvent less extractions will yield you without a little bit of manipulation BHO by using pressure and a solvent will get you everything off of the plant without having to beat things up so higher yield on solvent list means lower quality if you want incredibly high quality supplements then don't ask them what their yield percentages were alright that's the only I mean then then you see some broken hearts but in my mind when you go back to enjoying that hash [ __ ] that Bobby you know and by that quality I mean like 710 laughs quality there water - [ __ ] fire man some of the best water ash I have smoked and and for those of you wondering why I call it water hash that's what they called it in Europe when I first was introduced to it but yes I'm just talking about bub wash and we call it bubble ash your America because of oh man who made bubble bags and that's that's just random but it is passion made with water water is the solvent whereas in this case bonus points for the person in the comment section that guesses what the solvent I'm using right now is it's not a screen screen is the device that I'm using the filter what's the or the filtration device what's the solvent being deployed here what's getting things through the screen I'll give you a hint it's the most natural solvent it can be used in extraction well hello looks like there's a couple of you in here sup med TAC well hello sarih be a lot cheaper to make your own what you got it [Music] yeah um be Kelly freedom I'm not sure about that company but I like freedom farm sounds they got a great name so you know I would obviously just do a little bit of research first these are specifically the BC bubbleman screens and you can't even get these measurements anymore this is 24 by 36 now I think you have to go up to 48 to get 20 to get 24 inches wide yeah anything this wide is only 18 inches so a lot of them are long very very much more rectangular this I love the shape of this one be a lot cheaper to make your own yeah I'm sure do you mean them do you mean that be a lot cheaper than to I guess maybe you mean a lot cheaper than getting a consultation sure if you are trying to not spend any money at all and make a high-quality product and that is absolutely possible it just usually takes a little more time than most people have where I come in is where people want to work that incredibly lengthy period of trial and error and just jump right into about four years or five years in which that's what I look that's my advertisement and that's basically what I can always guarantee to get you to I will get you to right about where I was after four years and four to five years of trial and error and I was making some pretty fire hash so I get it if you're sure it would be cheaper in the initial cost but is it going to be affordable for you when you are wasting or destroying material because of possibly some trial and error well maybe not maybe you already know what you're doing maybe you know it's better and then that in that situation that's why I always tell people I offer half our state maybe you're the kind of guy that knows so much of what's going on you literally just have like two or three pretty in-depth questions that you'd like to have answered thirty minutes and that 50 bucks might be the best 50 bucks you spent this year I've helped some people very recently in North yeah North Carolina that are making some some very high-quality fire right now and I've just consulting by way of video chat and of course over the phone a little bit and then aside from that there's another company I just did a consultation for that is in the valley in California sorry guys my gloves are making this impossible had to plug in phones dying another company that I consulted for in the valley that they are they specialize in CBD and CBD distillation and then of course reactors which is another you do after the CBD dysplasia process to get CBD to crystallize its see these I can't believe it you can actually distill and get to that temperature and then you can of course bring it back to CBD a or CBD crystal if they're doing very very very well if Sara's still in the chat room right now she can even tell you about the products did being at their CBD they were able to ship me a sample of everything that they made from the first run or the first couple runs after our consultation and those products are all sitting on the stair go by my TV and my chair right now and they are excellent excellent job well done I mean honestly I I thought we had someone I thought we had more work to do and well you know what I was I was getting a letter that said hey I got some stuff to send here so for those people it was money well spent this entire video but on the other hand if I were to continue to tell you the same information over and over again a lot of you guys are [ __ ] bored you move it around on the string and you don't force it through the screen also you're generally as quick as you can beat without making a mess so I think your canvas doesn't it's still a song as I pick this up it still feels cold in the hand not as cold as it did when I first started sniffing but you want to move as quick as possible now obviously for for Hollywood sick the next step here would be finishing cleaning the screen off are you getting it completely cleaned up very very completely cleaned off and taking it and everything that's on this lid over here and putting it all back in the back and then of course we put that bag underneath here whatever Ben it goes cleanup is important as you're going throughout the lab are you a public contaminant but we're shooting a little livestream video a little tiny crisis not even a huge amount of biomass over here maybe yeah I don't know maybe not very much anyway this is my little bounce technique I do this in all four corners from the corner to the towards the center make sure that I've kind of let anything that might be stuck in the screen go in or on the next screen and now we're gonna start our work if the work is all to be done on the next screen down so that we can enjoy what is on the next screen below it again probably would sake take this anyone out of the room there we go now I will not be now I won't have any issues with contaminant let cetera let's see you guys oh that's as high as I can get you high as I can get you pun intended right met THC my THC you know I love it Oh Josh boom I love it Destin I love it Joe what's up Daniel Sarah you knew was that oh I liked it erosion could yes and of course erosion being caused by gravity though because obviously things would not erode if there wasn't a force pulling things yep I'm sure look at all we don't have to be particle physicists or theoretical or string theory but any you know we don't have to be higher but the world is flat I'm just kidding I brought you guys in here a little closer on the screen as you can tell because I just wanted you guys to see the sifting um it's it's actually um good question sorry guys I I just wanted you guys to see what's happening so I used a 160 micron plant matter or if you call with I like to call them work screen just to work on top of and then that is all that's in the other room and I'll pack up that canvas again and this what I'm on top of right now is that 120 micron and then below is a 74 so what we're going to do right now is use the 120 micron screen to clean up what we have on top of it and get that down very very very very dry Josh very dry and frozen for over 24 hours in a deep freezer oh thank you Sarah tell me it would be a lot cheaper for you to make your own screens these were incredibly expensive the reason why I chose to go with these is because for a long time I used my own screens for Sarah [ __ ] what six or seven years I just used my own screen it was way easier if I could just continue to buy fabric and it was what it was when I just went made the decision to pull the trigger on these these are such a godsend because they are so high-quality and I can't pick it up and show you but the way that the screen the way that the micron is fastened onto here does not come loose and it's evenly fastened all the way around and god I've been waiting to have an excuse to use this word in a video evenly fastened all the way around so that the screen is perfectly taut I love Mike Myers anyway with the three being perfectly taught that preserves our efficiency of a micron value helping to maintain an exact 120 micron throughout the entire screen even when I'm doing things like which of course is putting stress on the screen yes it would be cheaper but you know your screens as these are which you know they're not not impossible but if you're like me time is money and I would much rather pay a hundred dollars for someone to show me how to do it the right way then spend six months or even spend one week or even spend one day going back and forth and learning it through trial and error now that's only true for certain things in certain parts of chemistry in certain parts of our process trial and error is absolutely the way to go but once you are at the point where you're making hash or extract production levels or in patients are counting on you you know they've had the opportunity to just trial and error and trial and error and trial and error there's something that you or you'll find yourself a lot of job but as you guys can probably tell our little pilot project here is getting smaller and that's that's not because we have spread out but it's successfully this creative working now I've worked a lot right here so I'm going to move over in this area and then to this area and then to this area obviously if you stay in one section of the screen I mean I'm not in a freezing cold room right now so the higher-quality heads could absolutely start to come up and get caught in this room which that's a good idea to do your little technique at the end of your initial shift at the end of your flower agitation do your mouse technique at the end of that and then throughout your carding technique so there's one corner we've got just starting into the second quarter and we did a balance so we'll do about four little sections of card in here with this but if you want to go the house is starting to act a little differently see it's literally it's greasing up to the point in its beginning it's becoming a solid that's you might even have just heard it that's a great time that's a great great song when you're as your party if your house was already starting to grease up to the point that you could take it out and smoke it in a bowl that's why I tell people you know I'm sure you want to try this noise and I always tell people not if you're gonna send it to me in the mail because yes I want to try and yes yes it sounds tasty but I don't want to hear that you literally lost your freedom over this country I've been sifting and talking and sifting and talking so you know that me I don't even have a ring out or anything we got the old school ball right there and we're making some old school house all right guys we are check out the size of our pile of dry set now ladies and gentlemen remember the size it was when we started if you don't go ahead and use your the bar at the bottom meter screen whatever they call that ticker go back and look at the size of picado tricep when we started when we first picked up the price now do I want to keep one until this completely gone no but I do have one section of Street last thing we need to do after we play around with our last section let's just do a little quick spotlight inspection and then of course it's just - um sometimes I use my scope it's just a 45 40 40 X little pockets you can see whether or not you've gotten down to the point that you've gotten your head and what you have here are some pistols some stocks stock ends well no we're not done it'll be honestly the only thing that's probably gonna be left when we're done here are these pieces of hash this is let me put you guys in here real quick on the quality of a hat show you what's happening as we are sifting there's my sift file can you see the chunks starting to harden up look at the color of them I mean they're whitish grey gorgeous gorgeous sorry guys I was listening to uh Conan O'Brien needs a friend and the Billy Eichner episode on the way up here in [ __ ] funny where a death alright so I I'm not gonna take the time to bring you guys in on the light inspection but the light inspection is showing so much of a head percentage still and that's just the glistening this obviously you can see much plant matter and you can even kind of see what like the stock but the amount of listen that I still have is exactly why if I don't hurry up it's just going to chuck up and then it will never get through the screen which that's of course what we're going to do with throw this bigger chunk back on the other thing of course 74 micron screen of course as you can see it's been elevated so that stocks and things that of course would have a smaller circumference than an actual glandular trichomes head can fall through under the table depending on the just move the move to move them around until there's nothing left but the pieces of hash the greased down or greased up whatever you prefer to call it while we were drafting and for those of you that are wondering no that is not lint these are what we call angel hairs in the hash world just a little sticky sticky and sometimes they stretch when they look a lot like little hair so a little pieces of lint see how that one looks like it's got a little piece of house on it peach the hash on I can't talk sorry that's got to be brutal trying to look at that so that is not going to go through a screen ladies and gentleman that's gonna go that's just one of my [ __ ] lungs right now like right goodbye right now I mean like right after this next night god damn look how much I was stuck to the card look how my chunks were stuck to the card looks like [ __ ] rock they look like little pebbles anyway umm that's going to be a nice little [ __ ] snapper yeah this car is so gummed up I can't wait to use this to board an airplane somewhere alright ladies and gentlemen I would also since we've done this amount of work on this screen also this is another thing we're gonna smoke this by itself so rather than let this contaminate anything else or even worse be wasted I just picked the screen up and strained it up so that nothing in that direction you clean off our card as best we can if necessary you can use ethanol wipes or ISO but if you do that you need to let it sit on a heating mat or a pad of some kind for at least 10 to 20 minutes so that this can get warm enough that it doesn't melt and you also completely evaporate the isopropyl or ethanol ethanol won't hurt you but it'll [ __ ] up the taste of everything I so can actually not only be unpleasant but it can [ __ ] up okay so I just finally tapped in there right about the I've been gone to school for some of this and then of course having done this professionally for two decades the amount of knowledge that is common for me is certainly not common for everybody else or most people that aren't hash makers or chemists so if I had to find where my voice is heard and where it's most appreciated and in case any of you are wondering yes the little boy inside of me is jumping up and down right now because that [ __ ] pilot ship is gorgeous sorry I can't get you a better picture than that right now again the phone is almost dead it's the quality of our finest product damn no wonder that's greasing down already holy [ __ ] yeah I can't see it this well with my eyes I have to bring it over to the camera to see it like that um anyway I'm incredibly excited because wow that's how fast that greased up whoa so I'm incredibly excited number one because I think that this is one to make some amazing cash profit but I'm also incredibly excited because of this much quality or this many heads there's always going to be some goodness underneath and there's that little bit of goodness we've got right there now what we have next is we're going to see we brought it and how do we determine that by getting a weight of the actual amount of tricep and after we press it in a 15 micron bag ladies and gentlemen yes that's 74 micron dry snipped yes I could press it in a 70 micron bag and it would technically filter that as things warm up and aspects are pressed and stretched you don't get that good of a filtration I don't recommend anybody using a higher micron than 25 for any kind of if you're gonna use 25 micron it a micron rosin bag it needs to be 90 micron or larger head size or at ninety micron or larger pool you know your nightmare your 120 micron when you get down to the 73 micron and smaller and honestly 7300 up to 89 so you're 73 pull what this is this is 74 through 119 right yep this is 74 all the heads in that pile right there in theory except for the ones that we've gotten to go through the bottom you don't care are between 74 and 119 microns I am only going to skyrocket its quality by filtering it in a 15 micron back if I wanted to fit in a 37 micron bag I would get much more yield but that's not going to help me determine the quality because how could it all that's one could show me is that I got a bunch of Keith or a bunch of farmers friend Keith Nick did not melt and did not press into rosin by doing this with our press turn it on and put your place together bring in here book which you can see put the plates together up like that immuno heat up in equilibrate much faster all right so let's load the let's finish loading this 15 micron baggie here and then we'll get a tare weight with the scale and we'll see exactly how much dry see if we collect and then we will press it and we'll see what kind of rosin we get or you know what kind of you'll beget figure out our percentages from there telling us what kind of quality we got now before I pulled this up or anything I always look underneath because every once in a while depending on the string or whatever sometimes what makes me underneath in this situation I can see the sift on the table now [ __ ] look at it on camera you guys could see it right away so I can tell you already right now that a level of just just that level of yield we're probably gonna be putting that in the bag and yes that's going to lower our percentage or our percentage of return but because of the quality that this sip is or most of this is or some of this thickness it's going to be overall yield so we don't waste that [Music] there's some heads in there but you know it's not like amazing or anything so let's see what we got here to start with if this is only this is a tiny amount but if it's just tiny as I think it might be little abacus yeah we got an eighth the dry stuff in here I'm gonna go ahead and put the zero 273 micron in there as well and the reason I'm going to put that zero 273 mic on in there well it's exactly what I've just explained to you guys this is going to hurt my overall percentage but as you can see this will absolutely produce some rosin that [ __ ] that's not bad at all actually you do have my I do my spot check with the flashlight and then when I look at it on the camera I go like [ __ ] I wonder how many times I've said to myself like I know you're good if I would have just taken a second and looked at it through my camera lens oh [ __ ] press that [ __ ] okay see where we are here I get a 4 this is the weight of our bag I believe we're not zero zero yeah that makes more sense okay I was wondering how I had an eighth okay three point two three point one so this is literally almost exactly well we got some battery issues we've got some battery issues okay so the only thing that's going to stink about this now is because I've added my zero to zero to 74 sift two here there will be some that is actually there's going to be some stocks in here some tiny little bits of particulate a lot of it I've kept from static and things like that but there will be some particulate that will make it through our 15 microns hole having said that what are you gonna do so this is a very high quality very very high quality I can tell by the way it's acting inside of the bag already and by that I'll just show you its greasing up enough to the point that it's sticking to the sides already and all I really did was just push on right there oh nice little brick in here so maybe we'll get it and the other thing is I want to make sure to be reasonable with I'll crack the bag is because I want it to be able to expand sorry oh yeah I wanted to be able to expand and be able to get all my deals without blowing out and without double bagging because when we have this much sip depress jesus man I'm not gonna I mean it would just it seems silly to me to double back so point you over here that was pleasant anybody else get a seizure from that [ __ ] shake there wow it's crazy how far away the camera is here okay okay guys so we're gonna give my press another minut or to my bag you said yeah upside down when that cell remains folded Jesus yes I like that's why I long YouTube videos like this um okay these are equilibrating it very nicely the temperatures are starting to even out I don't have them set to 175 because I'd like to get a decent you press quick and we can press around 180 which is hot brash in my book but I get I give really great yields and if I press fast I can usually do okay in the case with dress it with water or bubble hash I'd like to present a very low temperature and take it slow and in the case of flour as many of you know I press it about this temperature or even a couple degrees colder and I take it very slow not in a rush to get anything done only thing I'm gonna rush to do is make a fire that's it don't know if you guys can see that or not but that's what I'm gonna rush to do alright I feel like you can't really see a whole lot there so that's do you like here's alright while the screen 37 of you hello hello and thank you for all the 10 likes hmm love Kelly feeling fine I was talking about making my own dress just kidding oh oh sorry buddy I'm sorry you guys are so far behind [ __ ] yeah dude Japan's killing it and I got that new [ __ ] tank replacement atomizer for it now it's bull I'm gonna teach you oh ha what stops a bear med THC Ontario is in the house thank you Sarah for answering everybody for all this [ __ ] I take like the pillow I'm going enjoy all day every day yes you can if you don't have strings you have one and Sarah can share with you a lot of times before I had these strains not only did I use my bubble bags there were times that it was so inconvenient I would cut my bubble bags all up just so I could use the bottoms of them or so I can wrap the bottom of it around a frisbee that I'd cut the center out of you know saying little frisbee I would use as a frame if you can see I can see you've been inside the cookie I must be buggin I'm a little bit lit you guys are if you're catching on to that you're absolutely right I can bail I fully agree with you as far as best overall all the way for not only yield but for quality is to wash with water dry properly whether you have a pharmaceutical free driver doesn't really matter that's just gonna change the amount of time it takes you to dry things but if you are properly drying your water ash and properly storing it and then pressing it all for I don't believe in the term full spectrum because I keep the chlorophyll out of it but for what I refer to as a broad spectrum rosin down the wrong pipe so yes for a broad-spectrum rosin love it 80% of tri contrast method is 27 yep yep agreed fully agreed you get much higher yields my dress if this this won't be staggering there are some bubble hash presses that I do where I get 85 and 87 percent yield on the hash of course not from flour to not that dry said my handle I'm just trying to get a little bit up here in the comments so I can oh when you guys think of the new Chi can you guys see yeah is wearing this the other day and my little girls were like daddies that's you yeah metaphorically bush trees baby push them trees all right so I fully agree with you my choice to do this this way tonight is because I left the house and came to work some hours ago with the idea that I was not going to [ __ ] with social media at all and I decided give and take but to just kind of give give give give which is what I get out of these live streams I basically get to dump my thoughts on to a camera and those of you who hear them hear them and those of you that get pissed say things like shut the [ __ ] up and leave you know like homie in the beginning which if you're still here dude that's amazing if you're not I totally understand I was probably not operating at your speed and I get that all right here we go let's see if I can get caught up here we go let's see that they did it did you do to Jim Jim Jim Jim you make well rosin hash yes absolutely edibles are really I think all of our favorite way to to make our our waste reusable yep you're absolutely right um the flour rosin it's a way for me to press it and get a little bit better of a yield from flour to melt then I do with the water hash and of course the purpose for that is not for when I'm making a product it's going to be a jar of rosin in the end the purpose with that is when I am trying to produce as much rosin butter as possible so that I can pull the infraction I thought it and so that I can isolate the taste yeah a lot of people are shocked by my flour rosin comes in right around 88 to 90 percent to you CA I get great great returns on my separations what is up 710 Daniel II nothing will go to waste you know it yep saris more 13 hit it right there hit it on the head all of that is happening and that's what that's what all these different jars are inside I mean nothing gets wasted if it's a B or it's a name - product it gets separated for its THC a if it's a an a product that's going to be separated towards th da it's actually the THC a is a bonus that's actually separated for its turbine fraction but anything that is not of a superior quality and I'm a [ __ ] snobby [ __ ] when it comes to my hash but anything that's not of the superior quality that's separated mechanically and and/or used in Apple's Oakley that all kind of clear things up there Oh 7/10 yeah I feel you homie I wish I could honestly I wish I could take a little bit of autonomous break Sarah don't hold me to that but I wish I could take a little bit of a tolerance break because then I'd like to get super super high you know yeah you'll feel after that break it's always a way I know I can't even remember other than like when I'm [ __ ] in like sitting overnight in a holding cell or some [ __ ] I'm smoking everyone I used to be able to say things like ten years ago and now it's like Oh Daniel you know especially being oh no I'm sorry I thought I was getting ready to throw you but the econ man but yeah you know what's up we love our economics over here she breaks are always getting 37 is a decently large room of people I thought so too right no one on the screen said he'd agree with us with the car yes so um now why I don't scrape against the other side it's because that's what I'm so sorry you guys I got lost I babble and I lose my train of thought what I was trying to get to with the static being on the outside of these static electrons being me on the outside of your plastic baggies your static electrons are on the outside of whatever working surface you're working on so I'd like to collect the rosin or the sorry that's dry sipped on the stainless steel surface because it's easier there's less static to deal with if any at all the underside of your screens have static there's that it's absolutely there and because some parts of the game plan are so so so so [ __ ] sorry about that so so so light when dry [ __ ] this right here is light enough to be picked up by that static and this is lighter so by the way that's what's gonna get wasted that little piece I just drop it so this right here is definitely I don't have to get picked up by that static I do my snapping and bouncing and flicking and all that to get as much as that is like you get and then I collect all that underside step and keep that in a bigger [Music] the little jar that I have and I just call this like my farmers grade dry sift this is everything that gets cleaned up after I do every any one of these and I have enough of this now that I'll probably have a little mixed rain press to do some time soon yes full easy and another thing about the other the number one screen bros that I don't know if you noticed or not that when I'm going through this there's so many of those small pieces of particulate around the end after I get done clean mouth [ __ ] sorry guys when I'm doing this there's so many pieces of little you know trim and particulate around the end here and again the static does it picks a lot of that especially when I move my tray to adjust my tradies or adjust the jars under my trays anything like that so that's why I stopped doing the scrape underneath and including it in what I'm going to press just because I don't want to squeeze anything green if I don't have to when I'm pressing flower it's either for economical reasons to provide patients with a melt that is incredibly affordable or to make butter for separation agreed a great few more steps and again this is dry sift that I just wanted to make so that I have something to enjoy for what's up stoney how you doing so they have something enjoy enjoy for tonight's truth tech says you know what's up baby AMA I'll take the 37 woman and leave Oh Sam hey I like you I mean two girls will break you sure will rather take them someone who knows 710 sigil 17th century digital boy my two girls were born on the same goddamn day twin twins rubber baby Estonia cheers to you too brother oh thank you um no I didn't I will have to go check that out I love Matias content um I know a lot of people find him kind of uh I think like this tastes fuller or something or they find maybe but I just think the dudes [ __ ] funny man he's funny and he's having a good time so I'm down with it and Wow to you two guys I feel like I'm so far behind all right here we go yes sativa and indica do have different sized stripes and that's a very good indication or definition or explanation for what the term sativa and indica are actually good for they are used to describe physical characteristics of the plant and of course physical is chemical characteristics chobe profiles etc but not too they're not terms that are used to describe psychotropic not necessarily gonna help you study or some dumb [ __ ] uh anyway giggity thanks max what's up Greg hashtag Greg reclaim absolutely same plant two different same plant suitable if it's the exact same plant and are you harvested to top let's say you have to the the top of it because the lowers were just a little bit unfinished and then five or six days later you harvest the bottom part of it as it's finished you're going to have two different size try it's just from that and of course if you're running different phenotypes which other they're all going to be different oh yeah brother you know all you need is a set of screens just get yourself set screens or even get like one screen that's 120 micron or you know what I mean or 90 micron or something like that so you can at least I don't know I would want at least two cuz I like to catch things in between like if I was you I get like a 74 and a 120 and then something to sift off the top you know but that's just me tell me where you gonna tell Stoney about I wanted now to salve I love press Rollins you know s'more with that knowledge more than knowledge yeah absolutely great point how could a plant be completely finished in every section of that plant this is how the gardener or the expert gardener decides when to harvest he's looking over his plant with his scope and decides when the most of it is perfectly finished or ripened if you will without letting it get to the point where all of it is finishing and some of the first stuff that finished is starting to degrade and produce TBN let's see so CBG is the precursor to a CBD and THC THC is the precursor to CBN you and me both study but Stoney Baker Otis rookie in the league baby everyone is at some point Daniel knows what's up Thank You 7-10 thank you appreciate it guys hey Stoney you're the boss Tommy I'm just I just got a stupid [ __ ] camera I appreciate you guys I'm so [Music] sorry hi Anna hello Sarah you do got to make it work with what you got wait wait he's just coughing over the tree puts trees baby okay that's that that was always copying over the tree he's pushing that tree baby push trees oh we fell down to 29 I guess I should cancel the live stream I have to have people watching me and validating my bath I have to I need value I can get it from nowhere else social media is it for me exactly Sal they either have the passion that they don't whether yes I didn't I sure do brother I do it in two ways rosin and a Terp sauce and one is a slow decarboxylation to get the consistency that I like into a nice drip that's very nice because it not only has a very high terpene content and flavor but it's also very very high in THC a and a broad spectrum of the Kaminoans when I am going for an incredibly high I just skyrocket even turkey analytics I do a mechanical separation and when I do a separation the just reeks I've only had one of those tested so far but it did come back just under 20% 19 plus percent overall terpenes it was a super super while yes I sure did that's right no I'm sorry sangria service are you right it's more you got it it was sangria you ready or no wait we're both wrong so we're both moms for the Cure that went into that that eventually the last time I wanted that little jug over there so the news Terp sauces mimosa too late break time I love it I love it come on man you got oh [ __ ] I can't catch that man you and nobody ever has to retract a message unless I mean if you want to hear whatever it's all you I love it gravity is dissolving any on top of it no these are just what I collect rosin this one is a collection of rosin sauce or a turkey fraction of rosin and then of course I mixed back in a large percentage of my thta chunks I left some of them obnoxiously large as you can see and I also powderized out some of it so that it would have a very royal jelly like consumed and this is literally just waiting up here for me to collect some more Robin aye that's another work to do so nope just sitting up on top of the press so that they'll be room temp to Gram bein 10 degrees ambient warmth so that when I go to collect and store in them they will they'll the consistency manipulation will take place for me without having to use any sort of excess temperature and by keeping that lid on tight I can get the rosin to butter very very easily without sacrificing any sort of the terpene evaporation or losing any Terps if you will it's because of your other purse I can buy in Canada gang honestly homie rah-rahs impress New York and the reason I think that is because everything that's an open cage design I can get into the back of it I can get into the sides of it all that and everything on this press has a lifetime warranty and because of the open cage design as soon as something breaks on it you take it apart you just take that piece off and send it back to them any sense you do you don't have to ship this press all over the place this that that's this press that press that you're looking at I will be pressing rosin on for possibly the rest of my life it has a lifetime warranty why not and it's so [ __ ] affordable that's the ten-ton I think it's around 700 and his 2 ton is around 400 400 [ __ ] dollars for a very very adequate rhotic rosin press that's just my opinion get up hit that top 7 777 Mohawk ww7 extraction is calm and there is a section on the website there for you to go ahead and fill out or book an appointment thank you s'more then get he playing on a line install what am I missing South Canadian Tire tents hey I like it rather di why you know what I'm saying that that might actually be your best bet because you probably can build it yourself for even cheaper than this if you don't have time and you want to have a warranty on all your parts because of course if you build it yourself as soon as anything breaks on it you have to pay to fix it if you want to spend a little bit more money and have it warranties that's the price I'd go with right there and if you want a little more power than that he has a 20-ton zero and if you wait one more month the 20-ton is coming out in a larger plate model those are three by fives the 20-ton that I'm getting next month has five by seven inch plates on it and I'm gonna put that right next to that unit and we'll uh we'll dial them both in together I like it Canadian Tire ten son Jack I love it he's got a DIY man absolutely and you can order the aluminum bar stock and with already with pre up of completely fabricated with the pre-drilled holes and everything and then you just need your femoral couplers and if I'm understanding this correctly the heat plate may come with all that already all like in a package with instructions on how you put it in and install it and you just kind of like like when you're watching Rambo set the the putty fuse bond you got a you have to pack those diodes and make sure that the thermocouples are going to be accurate thank you Oh sixty-five entries left deal so I want to take you to transfer my miniature sauce well if I'm doing it for mechanical separation I get it inside of three hours if I'm doing it through my decarboxylation method it takes about a week and the reason for that is because I D carve it at such a low temperature it actually is the breaking of the carboxyl group is dependent upon time at that point of course me too for sure Anna you go the salesmen I like it I like it family a poor baby I got told you twins Manish one Saturday morning I had a girlfriend that's Saturday night out of family for how much was the pressed $5,000 yes $700 $800 if you want I think it 775 if you want to get with a bunch of collections and a big plate and a ton of bags up a mold which i think is awesome if you're going to press hash frozen and you're going to dry it and store it the way that I prefer I don't think you really need a mold for it I prefer to keep it powdery appreciate you guys that's how I do carboxylate rosin and I do that so that it will of course be psychoactive and can be ingestible that is runny so that it can be you know it can be applied in a cartridge or it can be used as a sauce or to flavor TS yeah but even more importantly than that the decarboxylation has to take place because if i th see a rich rosin and cartridges number one the atomizer in most cases is not efficiently vaporizing it or be carboxylate in it so that you're going to get as high as you should but after some time you build up a little bit of pressure and that lemons will crash out in your cartridge I I got look at my Instagram there you have to scroll down a while in a long time since that's happened to me but this is some of the first times I accidentally grew diamonds inside of cartridges so that's the the purpose on that decarboxylation and I cut up nut smashers a great press very very similar in quality and different I believe between the two is and I really like my homie of rosin press New York so it seems like they both have great teams and great customer service the things that are comparatively different are that generally rosin press New York offers a little bit more pressure not to my shows like a one ton press I think a NES 5 or 7 here's our to 10 and 20 and these are significantly more affordable the cheapest nut Smasher rosin press cost about as much as the most expensive rosin press New York progress and yes no smashers a bigger but do you give a [ __ ] if there's a horse on your shirt that is playing polo and such a fancy white way or do you give a [ __ ] if your shirt keeps you warm and it's nice and company so you know that's what it's about absolutely what was like no um specific terpene volatility or that's how we know the drastic press is gonna go up gonna go well I just had my little jack stand upside down line and I probably should have my hand under there cuz if that falls good off well how's it going to dump out it's like a frickin oh that's wet through the bag alright again not doing any kind of not administering any kind of a double bag directional fold anything we are just pressing this [ __ ] this is a small enough full river that I can just monitor where the back of the paper is without even having to [Music] yeah he's monitoring the back already okay with half a sentence key I thought let it gel let it displace let it do its thing 800 bucks for your nook Smasher og and what's the amount of pressure that it will deliver oh yeah that stinks what about like also if you have a blowout can you get behind your plates easily and sasquatch frozen breast I hate that thing besides an end back and complete are completely caged and closed in and you like you put your parchment in the front and you better hope you don't [ __ ] anything up because if your rosin doesn't come out the front it's like a [ __ ] whether they call it scavenger hunt there you go just Gavin I'm trying to get you rather than what you think about the dead breast five by five five nine seven great great ooh love it great pair I don't I don't like the idea of not having it warranty but I'll bet you're gonna put that in this is two ammo junkies comment I don't like the idea of it not being warranty but I'll bet you're gonna put it together for so cheap that it doesn't matter I have no offense tre okay it wasn't put on a pity you know I ran at the president three of those deer that's what's up that's what's up sad that's it that's a nice low temps cages are very nice there's just a little price we are one minute two minutes into rest now we've given just enough time for everything to start gelling just a little bit and so now we're gonna bring down some pressure and honestly I cannot stress this enough I am NOT one for yield I'm going for a quality product to smoke tonight in tonight's truth check live session and considering this is a two hour livestream will spending some time I'm [ __ ] YouTube today man damn and I don't know if you guys are gonna be able to see anything coming out of there or not it's the back is pretty far back there bag of keep I think I'm gonna get and I'm hoping for a 35% you I'd like to see 50 or more but you know everything is this specific sangria it's not bad but I'm not in love it if this wasn't a half-frozen I would probably just let this butter and then mechanical separate but because this is from a tricep and from a hash it will it'll smell just fine there we go now right now our oil is displacing let's put some pressure on it we're three minutes and 45 seconds into our press so we really need to get done this pretty quick we at least minutes and anything this needs to be off the plate with within five minutes then that is Betsy that's a little long to be honest with you not everything goes now I need just a teeny tiny little thing to cover up this hole here we go [Music] so how many of you are thinking to yourself dude are you really going to go by when you do again right after this yeah and for those of you that are here if I see you over there to you Bobby Rock go ahead we're within 35 30 seconds now but I want to ring out oh [ __ ] let's do this I'm just over here with the scale and I'm going and now we had three grams of sift to start with inside of this bag [ __ ] the batteries are dead like deadish so I think we had around three grams and now there's about 1.4 so I actually did get about a 50% you'll let me share this with you I was not again I'm not super excited about the coloring but because it's from a hash I'm okay with it I got some nice color buttered rosin there and again this would be significantly lighter if I had gotten my hands on this material strain before up to four months old and it's still not beautifully so that makes me think that this specific bag that I had was 737 that is for you or not but if that's easy for you I think that's significantly older than what I'm used to pressing smoke it while you listen between funny it's like all these young kids they want [ __ ] white hash and I'm going like you'd rather have white house you really would rather have white hash than that I mean you got that's the color of it let's be real no it's not white no it's not super light is it [ __ ] amazing I mean look at the butter again look at the buttered sections the stuff that buttered right on the press yep and again I would rip the dab of this with you guys but that's not for you guys this is specifically for my truth checkers for those of you that are interested in seeing if you can embarrass me our truths tech Tuesday session for those of you that don't know what that means normally that I made doesn't have to be hashed that I made but me enjoying some high-quality hash out of some of my highest quality quarts and being that it is called truth tech I three lot dab of my truths debt quartz and I tell the truth no matter what the question you can ask me whatever you want worst thing worst-case scenario is I'll say I can't answer that or I'll get us all in trouble I smoked that sue them oh you know what's up you know what's up s'more oh I'm not in apopka but we are going to D an D now you [ __ ] rock channel cap silicon nitride [ __ ] Turk perilous things are so [ __ ] expensive and they're so cool man I dropped one drop it and because I dropped it because I'm idiot because do this so cool we [ __ ] seven five five of these I'm giving two of these away at some point here on YouTube but no puffs go for me brother I like glass I don't know where to put it down oh I got a little sure Batman will cover the hash nook with that alright ladies and gentlemen I love you if you don't know that you've been lying to yourself are you just being silly you know why I'm talking like a southern man who was probably a racist but cannot be pressed in your own I agree with your brother max great winterization number three Ella Oh if there was ever a consultation on hey what's up Conrad you did make it brother we've only been live for like an hour and 50 minutes so you you're not lady I'm just kidding the good news is that I'm literally getting ready to go live again and if yes what I was just going nuts over the fact that if there was ever a consultation owed I Oh Anna some winterization info I got I had a a company fall apart in the middle of the first productor trying to produce those videos and then in a second attempt at producing those videos youtube shut me down and then in the third attempt it's shooting those videos my job literally evaporated because the company went under so god Terk girls are [ __ ] awesome and homie that just made it and for those of you all that are still here and it's children and want to keep chillin I love you too s'more let's do this damn cryptic well you know I'm coming I'm coming to Oakland like [ __ ] next week I'm gonna put like I'm just I'm going strictly to break your atomizer and then go right back on all right so if you all want to keeps moving if you all want to keep doing this let us do it let me see where we are here okay truth tech Tuesday in about as much time as it takes for me to go like this and like this in this and this and then see how much battery is on that camera and see if I want to stand right here or if I want to go sit down in the litter cheers ladies and gentlemen let's get in on this I want to see if you uh what you guys to see if there's any any melt value to the low-quality sifter that we kept out of the rosin press because we want to depress our higher quality set so run the camera here we go yeah sorry good yep see this is why we kept it out of the rather than press almost no melt value ooh what is in the bottom of there that oh that's his [ __ ] chunks that's the chunks from the 74 micron screen it's gotta be just getting the hash I'm not crazy damn but the flavor on the back end is undeniable okay ladies and gentlemen we're going to go ahead and call this baby to a close stop this thing just under two hours so you know people can watch it after I the archived it it's not inconvenient for him because most people have at least two hours to give to YouTube every day right oh sorry guys for those of you that watch the net fun I hope you learned a thing or two or at least had yes it is dope enjoy emerge bush trees baby new homie seven in the comment thread there probably didn't pick up any new information but he was here sharing some of his information with everybody so if you didn't get it from me or if nothing else just watching my dumb fat ass walk around this room and be an idiot let's hopefully at least get a good laugh out of it but that's that time ladies and gentlemen first Tuesday of every month we do truth tech Tuesday and depending on what's going on in life I'd do it on the last Tuesday of the month too and this is the last Tuesday of February so here we go I love you ladies and gentlemen I will see much for those of you that I do not see in the truth text session I get it you probably had your fill at me and for those of you that just tuned in come on right back I'll be live again in less than 10 minutes Cheers", "6TkTTZ2R4Gw": "[Music] look guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm back and we're back for another straight review today we're checking out some more grapes some more grapes this stuff is called a humble grape soda first thing I'm gonna say about it is it's kind of confusing when you go to the brand's website it comes up as great tech calyx great leaks or however you save calyx calyx great calyx aka grape soda this is another one from up north I'm pretty sure this is the second time you've reviewed their product on the show probably the third or fourth time that we've smoked it looking up the obviously we like to do our homework if we haven't smoked the strain before we're going to you know to do whatever research we can online to get as much information about the strain as we can that is correct sometimes they get information something out there sometimes it's a little bit questionable yes this brand actually a website that we can go to and read the background of this so I'll set that aside good for you guys cuz it was pure gold just hit that they're great calyx take a grape soda the long experiment that were eventually yield great calyx began in 2012 with the cross between Durbin poison and pure Hindu Kush he knew that he knew that he knew punished from the Hindu mountain from their Cowan's garden carefully a home the strain incorporating dozens of sometimes rare and unlikely hybrids sfv og Platinum Girl Scout cookies and purple pine nuts to name a few super rare I'll be honest you guys lost me right there rare and unlikely hybrid nothing more rare than boji and cookies that will more rare than that you won't find that nobody's bed oh gee cookies and purple pineapple to name a few cherry picking the very best qualities from each strain finally they struck gold swollen calluses soaring THC levels and off-the-charts terpene profile thus great talents report great calyx but on the jar it says on the box it says humble grape soda I think there's a little bit of disconnect here no website and says gree Kaling's aka persona and that's a powerful name that crack that I don't care what you say like that tell me what that smells like well that remind you is it ring available yeah we talked about this just now this smells exactly like the if you guys have been following us from way back you're gonna remember 2012 maybe 2011 somewhere in that time period when we were on the dogs walk the dogs well are you sure we have a string of you up online if you want to search dogs Walt's train review dog waltz stringer video you'll find that da WG thing yep it was I think I want to see freak or burglar cool and the treads walk across oh it's great that's what this smells like for some reason it's the closest thing I found see that it actually looks a lot like it - it tastes like it too so looking at the packaging here we were coming in 17.5% th see there you're soaring THC levels storage obviously that's not high preferred today's standards but yeah yeah up north I think this is I think this is the second time we reviewed some of their flowers on the show probably the third or fourth time we tried it what would you say you know it's your first impression of this one overall about to dress to be honest I feel like it's a weaker version of the dogs wallets that used to smoke like you said honestly it's just I think it's like some pickle show I'm gonna keep it 100 I'm not trying to dog nobody but we keep it real we're not trying to dog wall - nothing like that but you know that I mean the one thing I'll give it is it does taste really good it really does bringing out bring back that flavor of the dog's walls but like I'm just not too impressed I agree with you on the flavor probably being the best aspect of this one this is the we smoked a little bit for the wagon baked this morning this is my second time smoking it yeah both today through tomorrow I'm back in the pine so I was hoping that it would you know looks decent but I've definitely seen you know better-looking tweed the nose line I do like the smell is just not very pungent yeah it's kind of just that sweet sweet creepy I mean if you're going off of the end smell that delay gave us here and there it basically sounds like a mud run yeah it sounds like they got about 20 different strains mixed in here and they're rare I don't know it doesn't really you know really the flavor is good but it's just not no it doesn't really have any traits that really make this wheat stand up yeah there's nothing that stands out exactly it's just you know it's just it's just like something else I'd rather probably just have to something else so in this case I'd rather have with dogs wallets yeah it's grapes we love it we're smoking it it's not great being creepy though like kind of like we've been talking about lately we've actually they're talking about grapes a lot more than usual lately you know it's it's not that pungent sweet candy creepy fruity grape that I really like when it comes to like a purple you know it is it's just it doesn't really have that and it's a lot more mild right so yeah going going to the rating it I'll probably start with the taste because it's its best feature but in the same it's nothing crazy so I'm gonna have to give that like a generous eight a generous that's like the best rating I'm gonna give this this flowers so a taste longer than eight as it is producing yeah tastes are go eight look I would go seven and effect in the way it you know that could smell I probably go five yeah for bug overall I'd say this is probably a solid six and a half six and a half to seven it's a good middle show it was Shino little cheaper and not something the other better flower that we picked up like like I keep saying them the REC shelves are slim pickins right now but we're trying to bring you guys you know good strains slim pickins for everybody man have these shops I mean compared to before the regulations dad like this selection is just really really hurting right now concentrate to specialty so do anything that'll mean more interviews right so yeah it's rough out there in these streets right now yeah we're trying to bring you guys quality content for all these drainages hope we're doing that what's strange is you guys want to see us review what are you smoking on right now that's fire know in the comments if you're still watching this video what's the best [ __ ] strain or cultivar you have smoked this year and we will go hunt it down we promise we will do our best I know people want us to stop saying strains all the super wieners yep and we nerds up there want us to stop saying strain because it's not technically correct what about strands but we got strain reviews and we've been rocking it like this for eight years now I don't remember the other people to say strand from like the strand with a D on yeah man that's my favorite strand now I guess we're supposed to be saying cultivar yeah anyway doesn't sound as good it doesn't have an ice-rink cultivar is that really what we're supposed to be saying stream refers more to life and the technical sense it would be like cannabis indica and then cannabis sativa is like a different strain of the cannabis plant and there's like ruderalis and [ __ ] you learn something new every day hi guys we're gonna drag your day out please like and subscribe down below hit that [ __ ] Bell ding dong hey hey hey I'm Dani flavors and trans in the CCC we're out [Music] [Music]", "ezRzBxPQpbI": "when you know that this is $75 and you're getting a big scoop of it I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there [ __ ] it this video is for mature audience if you're not a mature audience this video is not for you what's up everybody Cubans here and today we are going to get into some rather expensive concentrates I picked up a gram of some hash rosin today that was priced at $75 and it is one of the most expensive grams of concentrate I have ever purchased so let's take a close look at what we got I've had a gram of Summit connoisseurs genetic and concentrates Tiger's milk and this stuff looks like a nice little slab of peanut butter I'm pretty excited pretty excited abot both so you can get a look at the packaging here this is that Tiger's milk and it's testing at about seventy nine percent THC and then it does have a little bit of CBD a in there but you know what I am so excited for this let's just take it down where are my clothes at let's get a nice nice little scoop here out of the email all fresh and clean and I'm gonna see how it does does [Music] um yeah that was really good I'm gonna actually throw that on a courts now I'm gonna throw that around on a few nails and see if we like it but just to compare I picked up some cheap dabs this cost 75 a gram for some hash rasen 75 bucks for this it's pretty expensive most most of my concentrates I usually find deals and get a lot of good looking stuff like this this is some live batter I got for about 15 bucks a gram one-fifth of the price now sometimes I find live sugars live diamonds of batters around that 15 to 20 dollar price if I'm getting it on a deal it's not the everyday price so begin the deal you can get this stuff cheap so it's really interesting to pay five times as much for a single gram of concentrate I can't I can't believe I did it it's still interesting to me that this costs five times as much as this other gram of some delicious looking stuff but some hash rods and it's hard to come by especially here in Colorado Springs it's not super common to find rosin hash rosin so I guess you got to pay that top dollar because it's so rare but let's get some more dabs of this cone I'm not done with this yet let's see what I'm gonna do some cold starts when you know that this is $75 and you get in a big school but I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there okay [Music] it's throwing out a couple bucks in that [ __ ] it [ __ ] it and get a little bit more I need about three-fitty oh we got it okay okay just pricey tab right here damn it all right let's get a nice cold start here and see if it's super delicious on the court oh damn well damn okay okay that's good stuff so I just stabbed it a couple of times here and it's pretty good stuff but is it is it worth it is it worth paying five times as much as I do for some good live banner is it worth is it worth paying five times as much to get some solvent once that's basically the major difference is the fact that it's solvent list most concentrates are made with a solvent it's the easier method it's the most common method but with rosin they use heat and pressure to make it so they just basically squish the THC or they squish the extract out of the nugs or out of hash most of the time they'll make a hash and then they'll press the hash and that's what this is this is a this is hash rosin so it's a little bit more expensive and my understanding is the yield is a little bit lower it's it's a process to make the hash and then when you press the hash you wouldn't get the same type of yield as if you were doing like a butane or propane extraction so I think part of the process is it's a little bit harder to get high-quality product and you're typically going to get less with whatever amount of plant material you go into the process with so I think that affects the price it is pretty rare out here in Colorado Springs not a lot of people are pressing - I can find it in a few places some places have rosin and half chosen but it's not as common as BHO and pho and there's so many dispensaries that grow their own bud and they do their own in-house extractions so something like this I can I can pretty much get really cheap any day of the week if I'm looking around so for me to pay five times as much for this it's a little little far-fetched I honestly I'd rather have five grams of this and haven't done but yet and it's just I like volume I like to do a lot of dub so I'm gonna go back and forth on these we're gonna compare I just want to shave this I got this the same day I kick it costs literally one-fifth the price I'm just gonna see if it's if it's it if it's 20% it's good like it doesn't make oh god I just paid so much money but anyway anyway anyway yeah that's that's solid for the price that's sell it for $15 grand look um I I think it's good I think that that the rosin is good I'm gonna dab the rod let me have a bucket that was that was the I don't even know of the other strain is [Music] [Music] I mean it's definitely better [Music] the Robins better smoother and tastes a little better you can't really compare the highs because I'm better than both back for it but it's all about the taste for me and it is smoother is it pay five times the price smoother [Music] I don't think so because it's not it's not five times as good yeah I don't even know how you would get five times as give it something like this this isn't the best this isn't the best cheap batter that I've got but for something to be five times as good as this would be pretty impressive so this is not five times as good probably not worth five times the price if I see it on deals I may get it but I don't think it's worth anything that's worth three times the price two times the price even thirty forty five bucks I get why it costs so much it's a it's a little bit less common not as many people are making it and you get lower yields with it I get why it it costs more but it's not currently it's not at the price point where it's super worth it for me to only buy rosin maybe if I had a press and I could get amazing yields myself but I don't grow and I don't have any interest in growing so it's like I don't have to buy all my nugs anyway to smash it so kind of interesting I like finding deals so maybe I'll get excited about finding a deal in the future but yeah this isn't actually the most expensive gram of concentrate I've ever purchased a few years ago I remember purchasing a I purchased several grams actually a full melt bubble hash that I got remember the dispensary but I got some full melt bubble I think it was about eighty eight bucks a gram I think I remember paying just under ninety a gram it was really really good stuff it was like some of the craziest stuff I ever spent I I gotta go back and look for some pictures of it cuz it was a few years ago those full mount bubble hash grams I got were like pretty good but after I got a mouse this isn't worth eighty eight bucks a gram what the [ __ ] did I just do so I kind of feel that way here what the [ __ ] that I just do but we made a video that's what the [ __ ] we just did so let's do a few more dabs of this [ __ ] might as well I've only taken out several dollars off of it I don't see if we can take several more I'm interested in the cold start here so let's do that [Music] here's a few dollars [Music] yeah this is good stuff still I wish I could afford you dabs well this was actually pretty fun and I'm pretty blessed after all those naps and I'm glad I finally got to try this rosin up and see it in a bunch of dispensaries even if I did pay money for it but if you liked this video be sure to subscribe for more content in the future and check out my other social media I'll have links in the description below and for my live streams tune in to twitch at twitch.tv slash Cubans if you tune in at night I'm probably live right now getting high dabbing some much cheaper than than $75 a gram rosin unless you tuned in very shortly after this is made that I might have some of this left but uh come hang out and we'll see you next time [Music] I would say perfect balance but I'm going [Music] [Music] [Music]", "pWRMKzO6n7g": "hey you welcome to my push review a juveniles girls this is what I do smoke push past and shatter - go and check them out I try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now it's there to show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with cherry pie strength cannabis reviews so check it out looks like it has some very beautiful buds I never smoked that yet myself but I did open it out in the sumela and it does have a very nice cherry like smell to it and it does have a very sweet smell to it so what I'll do is I'll like this join up we'll pull out some buds and take a close look at it so it does have actually a pretty nice like cherry taste to it it's which is kind of surprising it really does taste nice it is really nice and sweet actually so it's definitely going to get a few points for actually tasting really nice it does taste really nice actually nice and fruity and very light yeah you could definitely taste the cherry in it it is really nice so that definitely going to give it a couple points on the taste rating but take a look at these buds they're like really really nice they actually got kind of like a blue tint to them it's very beautiful looking so it's actually kinda like a bit of a silver color but with really nice bright orange hairs like it is very beautiful looking and covered in crystals never actually see much bud that looks really like that that's really really nice look inside so well and they're all beautiful like that see every single one of them is beautiful like that looks very nice so I'll start off by writing the account that's supposed to be seven grams so I'll definitely give it a nice rating for it count actually kind of makes me question the rating that I've been given some wheat that's been really really good but this is really really good I'm going to give this a five out of five I think because this is some very really good weed it's a beautiful-looking it's a beautiful tasting I'm pretty sure that it's high THC because most of them if they look that good and taste that good are usually pretty high up there whoever grew this card definitely put a lot of work at heart then they're they're bucking plants and if you like my reviews you should look over the next one we'll be doing Acapulco gold live present that's gonna be some good [ __ ] so keep your eyes out for that that's gonna be up next oh come this way says the passion wants to say hi I guess this is my best friend Sebastian he's stashed our terrier that's a half German Shepherd and half pitbull trying to get in the way a little bit but it's alright now come here but yeah this cherry pie strain is a very good strain giving a top-notch rating five out of five beautiful tastings beautiful looking came in a nice big account make sure you check the description after I do the recording and stuff I always put it push through in fact in the description so you can learn more about the strength so maybe I'll go and take a quick bong hit of it and throw at the end of this video I'll show you that but I am really liking this cherry pie the rating is nice and everything so with that I guess I'll leave it there let me know if you ever tried cherry pie strain yourself if you've enjoyed it as much as I did or if your strain was as good it is very nice so with that I appreciate everybody that stops and spends time over here juvenile stars you guys have a good night peace now it's done I'll be back but I have to go now that we're all dirty stone but I got lots more videos so you can stay with shows so bust up some more fish to roll and watch another show now I'm glad to know [Music] you", "CoHhuHboSAA": "while medical cannabis is already available in more than half of American states and recreational cannabis nears its cusp of national legalization ensuring that the weed you buy from your local dispensary is as potent and as pure as advertised is still a bit of a tricky proposition especially when it comes to shopping for concentrate when you're buying flowers themselves you can check for the presence of chirping crystals on the surface for at least a rough estimation of its potency and give it a quick sniff to clue in on how it will likely taste but when it comes to concentrates you're generally at the mercy of the person behind the counter to set you straight of course if that sounds like a bit of a bum deal you can always make your own and that's where the rosin bomb rocket comes in this 13 pound tabletop rosin press is designed specifically to convert the THC crystals present on the surface of cannabis flowers into a solvent les dabble hash it does us in the same manner in which diamonds are formed within the Earth's interior through a combination of heat and pressure it's super easy to use just plug in the press turn it on and wait for it to heat up to around 210 degrees Fahrenheit while that's happening you just need to take the biggest stinkiest stickiest nug of cannabis that you can get your hands on and wrap it in a piece of heavy-duty parchment paper once the press is sufficiently hot separate the press plates wide enough to fit the paper wrap nug between them and then press the plates back together over the next two minutes or so the combination of heat and pressure will liquefy the rosin causing it to flow out of the flower and onto the parchment after you've extracted the rosin just wait five minutes for it to cool and coagulate then boom you've got yourself some concentrated resin which can then be scraped together and used in whatever dabbing method you prefer whether that's vaping it straight with a peak or crumbling it into a joint or over a bowl of green to give it a THC rich kick while the rocket is much quieter than similar presses that rely on hydraulics for pressure rather than its electric motor it is purpose-built for home use so don't think that you're gonna be able to start your own hash production business just because you happen to pick one of these up the other stumbling point for the rocket is its price this machine will set you back a solid six hundred dollars roughly the price of a mid-ranged average what's more you can achieve the same general results albeit with a much lower level of accuracy with a standard laundry iron or hair straighteners and some wax paper still if you're serious about your dabs or just don't trust the man with your hash stash the rosin balm rocket is worth a look", "A24Y3JyHLAQ": "this video is made of a user's request today I'm showing you how to winterize frozen in a small batch here I have almost a gram of rosin about a point 8 I made just before this video I'm placing into a beaker and adding 10 ml of Everclear I'm adding the alcohol to the rosin so that I can inter eyes it apply like bleep and mix until all of the rosin is dissolved into the alcohol [Music] here importing the rajma and alcohol into a graduated cylinder this is just for the purpose of the video [Music] I meant place it into the freezer and my cool for about 14 hours [Music] after freezing you can see that the wax fats and lipids have separated and sunk to the bottom [Music] here I'm using two syringes to pull out the fats and waxes as well as the alcohol separately this is also just for the purposes of this video to show you the difference [Music] it does help however to pull them out separately as it makes it easier to filter the cleaner portion compared to the waxy portion [Music] here I'm pushing them through a point to two microns syringe filter the syringe filter tracks the facts and waxes and removes them from the alcohol [Music] [Music] in the end I've caused it in alcohol and it's been winterized and I'm removed of any of its fats and waxes alright once you've done filtering you know how fully winterized rosin you can go ahead and use this for edibles or you can further refine it by boiling away the S&L and using it for bait pens or lowell devs my half plate has a built in magnetic stirrer it's a magnet that spins around and spins a magnetic stir bar this automates the steering process and speeds up the overall evaporation it may take some time for all the alcohol to evaporate keep checking back on it every so often so that you don't burn your rosin I don't recommend consuming concentrate that may have ethanol and then often if you are going to do this regularly you are better off getting it back through the final purge process [Music] after you've reduced most of the alcohol up I'd like to put another beaker on top to prevent any ball tools such as terpenes from escaping that having already in this final process removing the last of the ethanol now you can't truly remove all of it without a vacuum so I went to do this for as long as possible kind of medium to high heat right now it's heated at around 95 degrees Celsius I like to let it sit like this for a couple hours from four I feel it's safe to smoke and the ethanol has escaped [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "u40j5dYr4Qs": "all right there BAE hello and welcome back to another video with token Tim 420 it's a Florida Medical Marijuana review for Florida medical marijuana patients or those over the age of 18 if you haven't subscribed hit that button it's like I say hi to all the new subscribers if you like the video leave me a thumbs up if you don't leave me a thumbs down tell me why you didn't like it all right I was wrong earlier what I described as dry sift resin was actually live resin I was wrong - skater 539 I hope I'm saying that right told me I was wrong I was I smoked something got a little something here smoke alright it's partially my fault maybe partially true leaves I did said the same thing I said on the video - true leavin there like yep as what it is if you go to Blue River terpenes or whoever they are Blue Ridge some yeah blue river under the rose and it says it's cold they use cold and they use screens so I automatically assume bubble hash it's not what they're actually using is what it looks like to me it's actually dried flower but it's not really flower they're more likely using like the sugar leaves and then they're taking the screen and I guess they get the room cold or the stuff cold but it's already dried product it has cured flower and then they're sifting it through the screens are pressing it through the screens with their hands and because they make it cold the trichomes fall off easier so basically they're taking keef and then pressing it in a rosin press so that's what this is is dry sift is basically a Keef and I guess the other reason I keep it cold is so it doesn't the key for the dry sift or whatever they're calling it doesn't stick together when he gets warm and start oil and uh like I said it was half my fault when I've seen on their website how they made it it said cold and screens I automatically assume bubble hash so it's not this is made with dried flower or dried dry sift so I said they're taking the from what I read online it says they're taking pretty much sugar leaves and rub the nose so now I'm seeing why people say in the seventy-five our price is a little high so this isn't bud this is uh leaves and the leftovers I can't use for nothing else is what it's showing me I could be wrong again you never know but the process to make this is dried flower sipped it through a screen in a cold room but to keep it from clumping back up or whatever and then it's pressed so yes you could make this with Keef at home basically and press it if you press the bud you get regular rose and if you press key if you get dry sift so I hope that helps everybody sorry for missing Foreman everybody like I said I got excited when I seen the website and said it was cold and screams and that explains why it smells more like the dried flower than a green flower because a green flower is gonna have a different flavor so I hope that helps and thank you I hope it's a disc 8:00 or 5:30 I know if I'm saying that right we're pointing that out to me I'm not too big dammit my mistakes we'll take a look at that again in case you didn't see the other video on it there we go it's kind of like a sticky play-doh or something it is a little sticky but it's can whisk it around so as you can see it's kind of sticky but it does smell good so that's gonna be it for this video like I said sorry I misinformed you guys this is dried flower or dried leaves whatever they're using for it and that'll be it for this video guys if you haven't subscribed make sure you hit that button hopefully you guys

you guys later tonight then till then keep on token", "WE4H-gXnGJA": "yo what up boy bacon babe today I just wanted to do not really a Q&A but kind of respond to some of the questions that I've been getting in the comment section some of the comments as well we're not necessarily questions they're trying to tell me different ways to do things so I'm not opposed to taking advice only a fool would be but I am opposed to taking advice from people who are just talking but don't do if you don't actively press rosin don't tell me [ __ ] about how to do it because you don't know how to [ __ ] do it yourself I actually do it one of the comments that I had was that on one of my videos where I left a pre pressed puck inside the plates for too long while I was trying to prepare the camera so he did the material up a lot and when it came out it was a little bit darker than normal so a lot of people like to comment on that one and a lot of people are you know one person told me use less less pressure because you get more plant material in your end product and just let the heat lose it all out well that time [Music] Oh [Music] whoa whoa all right I'm still not over being sick completely sober all right so that's what I was saying um that's Bob that's backwards straight-up backwards you want more pressure less key you're not going to get more plant material in your product by using more pressure that's just not how it works the rosin bags that I use are 160 micron there from rosin evolution and they work perfect with my pre-press but you guys have to remember that when you're pressing out rosin the filtration bag excuse me those bags are not for filtration actually they're guesswork [ __ ] look they're just for containment so when you have that puck of flour and you go to press it it wants to expand and as it expands it will reach outside of those pressing plates and then you're not pressing that material anymore right so what the bags do is they don't filter to keep the plant material inside they just they keep it so that the plant material doesn't expand too far out because you could press nugs without any bags and still get all the oil without even collecting plant material the plant material only stays right along the very edge of the Google oil so again those bags aren't for filtering anything they're just for containment and make it a little bit easier what else pressing temperatures so temperatures - depending on your material you're gonna start as low as 180 and go anywhere up to like - 30 to 40 the fresher the material is the less heat that you need to use also the less time you need to press it if material is not the right humidity you're gonna have to press it for longer and you're not gonna get as good of a yield usually 60 to 70 percent relative humidity for your but it's good to start with and I'll usually press it fresh material like starting around 185 190 and if I'm not getting the yield I want but I'm getting the quality then I'll increase the the temperature by about 10 degrees until I start seeing the yield that I want now when you increase the temperature got to remember it's like a it's like a sliding scale right and right where they cross those two lines cross that's the perfect like settings right temperature time pressure so what you're trying to do is you're trying to get to keep high enough to make all of the oil lose out without degrading the actual material right so it's heat that degrades it not pressure so ideally you want as much pressure as possible without blowing out your bags right or breaking your parchment with as little heat as possible necessary to facilitate the flow of oil out of the material usually that ends up being around a thousand psi on your plates so for example my plates are 22 square inches right now to hit a thousand psi you know you're gonna have to get up there around like 13 14 tonnes because you take the max pressure that you're putting out so let's say you're putting out 10 tons that's 20,000 about 20,000 pounds of pressure now you divide that by the surface area of your plates which for me is 22 right and so I end up needing to be somewhere around like what is it I think like 15,000 psi or 15 tonnes will give me about a thousand psi so do the math on your own the base of yes the max pressure you want to get to and then you just change your temperature based on that so the higher the temperature the faster your product will start to flow right now this is where it starts getting tricky and it's a sliding scales because your temperatures too high you degrade your product but if it's too low then it has to sit in there and between those heated plates were too long even though it's a lower temperature it has to sit in there too long in order to start flowing and get the final yield so now you end up with the degrading product so like I said it's a sliding scale you want to have a high enough temperature so that you don't have to press too long but you don't want to have it too high to where it's degrading the product and then your pressure you're just going to keep ramping up the pressure until you don't get any more yield out of it so that ends up being like like I said fresh material 180 to 190 and about two and a half to three minutes for fresh stuff and then for older stuff it's usually I go a little bit higher and press rike around 210 or so for about three or four minutes but it also depends on the type of rosin that you want so a lot of people would see this and be like oh man that looks like like a big bunch of doodoo but this is your super Turkey stuff that's been pressed out at about 180 185 so you're gonna get more of the oily sheen on there right you're gonna get a lot of Terps and it comes out more like a sauce and this is cured this has been cured for about two weeks now and so this is just super super stable and this is really [ __ ] bomb but a lot of people don't like material that looks like this and keep in mind this would be super golden if I were to thin this out but a lot of people want like ghost rosin which is the stuff that is so clear you can almost see through it but people are into the purple rosin now there's a lot of trends but you can't let the color dictate everything because it's not just about the color right because of this stuff fresh bud pressed out at 180 there's a little bit darker and more Turkey than stuff that I've pressed out at higher temps of the same bud I pressed out at 2:30 you know and I've gotten slightly different looking material it was more shatter consistency way lighter color even though it was a way higher temperature right almost 40 degrees higher same pressed time actually was a little bit shorter with the higher temperature because it started to flow faster so I didn't have to press it as long you know this is some more 190 190 180 but you know you can get all different types of colors and consistencies and the point is that it doesn't necessarily dictate the quality it just dictates the parameters that were used when they pressed it so let's see what else you guys want to know cover filter bags temperature pressure time collection don't collect on anything too cold I made the mistake of collecting on top of some dry ice there was a protective surface in between but still the cold got the the rosin too condensate and create some moisture on top of the rosin and that's just because it got too cold so now I added moisture where I don't want to I want to remove it so that's a conditional time to cure and get that out properly but make sure that you have I would say like a couple is regular ice packs and then put it like a cookie sheet and I still look on mat on top of that and that should be enough to keep it just cool enough to collect easily but not getting moisture on it Oh a lot of people asked me about the the paper I use PTFE squares so I don't use parchment the reason I don't use parchment is because 90% of the markets parchment paper is covered in silicone silicon is very very easily broken down by a lot of different terpenes specifically D limonene which is very high and a lot of Turkey buds and so when you go to press you'll notice you have your little circle your puck of Bud and then around that puck there's like little box where it looked like it seeped through the paper or the bud is eating through the paper and that's actually the the terpenes eating through the silicon and then getting through the parchment paper so what happens when that happens is the silicon gets broken down by those terpenes and then when you're scraping up your rosin you're actually scraping up bits of broken down silica that get into your rosin and then when you when you ignite that or vape it burn it whatever that's toxic silica is extremely toxic when ignited and ingestion so those of you that are pressing on silicon treated parchment paper still chances are they're silica in your material you may not notice it but it's there now it seems a little bit easier to collect material off of parchment compared to PTFE if you do not have the correct temperature to collect it on if I were to place ice packs underneath this and then collect my material it comes up extremely easy way easier than parchment nothing gets stuck to this it's the most nonstick one of the most nonstick surfaces known and unlike parchment paper that is only heat treated or heat rated up to like 400 450 degrees PTFE is heat rated up to 500 degrees and pressure rated up to 500 pounds I think it is which is pretty significant nothing breaks through this in my experience I have not broken through a single PTFE sheet so that's why I use these I got a pack of one thousand four by four squares for 125 bucks from turkey roof comm or you can check out the version PTFE roll if you guys are doing bulk compressing with larger presses get a whole roll of this this is 14 inches across and I think this sheet was like maybe safety ET or something like that and this was like I think 100 something bucks it's worth it so think that covers and yeah it's depressing show me what you guys got if you guys have any questions comments please drop them below this was a very impromptu video I was gonna do like a whole little script and make sure I covered each bullet point but dabs happened and then I just started talking and here we are now so that said you guys have any questions about processing material growing anything like that drop them below I reply to almost every single comment if it's worthy of a reply show me what you guys would like to see in the next video and if you guys have any material that you want processed and you know the Southern California area hit me up and I'll press your stuff for you and I'll show you what it's like happy dabbing I'm about to hit this and I'm gonna be out of here [Music] [Music] we're hearing all the stuff in my email probably today because I'm impulsive and I have money right now all I need is another control box similar to the one that I built for my rosin press a PID controller and a plug-in spot for the coil that I already have so it shouldn't cost me a more than about a hundred bucks and I'll be able to build the control box for for the email and I won't be torturing anymore because [ __ ] this shit's annoying especially because I smoke in the grow room now because my wife is pregnant and I'm not trying to have her getting all secondhand smokey up in this [ __ ] so I don't smoke in the living room anymore which is where I usually chill and play video games so I got a run in here to take dabs or smoke and then run back out there in between rounds or games it's like man I wish the [ __ ] was just always lit always torched up ready to go I could just come in here drop it down and be out but I got to spend like a good minute and a half [ __ ] torching this [ __ ] up to get it clean and then let me cool off but it's all good oh yeah the I don't have any packs in here with me but I did make these little gel packs I rosin in coconut oil this shake is for I take four of those it's a wrap a rat I was in Chicago for business with my lady over this past week and that was what I would do I didn't take any flour and dab anything to smoke at all all I took was those pills I was a pill-popping animal and she would hate me like 3045 minutes after I take them and it was just kale like chili Hey [ __ ] dog barking for no reason Cheers [Music] I can't wait to not be sick [Music] whoo [Music] alright that's it for me they can be about catch you guys next time", "dU3AegiQpro": "what's up you two you know doing what he do best broken up that fire got some blunts on the bed got another strain to show you come up this time we go for good and um i'm about to bring you that uh hybrid dog f g i know a lot of you out there whoever got their license that hybrid oil fg is your favorite stream oh i know i got put on so yeah let's get into that fire hybrid all f g it's right there like and subscribe number one this time it's kicking in at 22.20 which is low if you ask me so this is a hybrid strain hybrid fg second cut once again 3.5 equivalent quincy and it's grown from advanced grow ads all right these are one of the best growers fresh sale i just popped it yeah one of the best growers i love it so yeah i was put on from one of my white boys he said yo marcel you need to check out the hybrid rfgs fire and i did so he was right it's fire but this time i see that the percentage of the tac i went lower and i don't know if i like that [ __ ] well give it here let's get a view of that string he won't give me the fire eyes 300 coat 250 baby suvi fly [ __ ] man so let's get into this apple cobbler apple fooders x grape pod and then streaking with diamonds already you know what i mean second cut so i'ma hurry up and dump that see how it's all shaking up already for my uh licensed car holders who don't know that's what second cut mean all right it comes out grinding halfway for the people who don't like breaking up me i get it it's cheaper now this string oh rip you can see how it got the hybrid to it like it's all solid and knocked up in itty bitty pieces as well with purple and orange and bright green and dark purple so this is some fire apple cobbler apple footers x grape pie you could tell just look at those two buds right there that's how hybrids look all right it's like this is how a hybrid look it's exotic so many colors and crystals all in one bar look like a snowball you see the purple fire not much blue but it's definitely green see inside these flowers is diamond out no matter which way you look at it the hybrid rfg 22.20 this time ago and i got my blunts ready sweet roman wild gary bro rolling up this [ __ ] fire purple x you know what i'm saying reduce this sign in or sign out hit that bell man if you want to stay updated to all this fire medication marijuana that i bring you you already know yes sir it's your boy and you know this man i got some other [ __ ] to show you too oh man good boy give y'all a good glimpse before we get a good smoke of it you heard it's already broken up back in dispensary stores purple green with the orange i mean out man you know we got this from johnny the icebox [Music] yo man my boy rolling that fire up let's see my boy doing that uh backwood with the raw leaf sorry all my movies out there real backwards that [ __ ] right there man hello man about to be witty in here man so yeah this is the fg in stores right now man all my lights car holders go get you some fire stream i don't know why it's 22 percent though that's pretty low yeah thirty one percent up dropping these strings out coming with different levels of scent thc and i'm going to hit you right here hello i'll buy what i like myself oh yeah by the way i'ma just add this in here this other string right here i just brought that the other dear girl and this is the orillica some [ __ ] whatever this strain is straight trash i'm not gonna lie [Music] it's a hybrid name whatever and it's kicking in at twenty three percent raka some [ __ ] and um this is not busting at all do not try this one this is straight up weak this is some strange be a hit or miss but this was a miss i was mad you know i spent 26 dollars for this at the dispensary and i really i barely got high it looks real good though it's real pretty and all that but it's not busting it's not it 23 too low watch your money back bro yes i do i am going to pull it out yeah don't do it yet but this is it man look at the crystals in here it's real pretty straight hyped up for nothing i don't like the strength maybe you guys might try my money gotta rico that's that [ __ ] that you just wrote big blunts yes i just smoked gotti's at this [ __ ] just to get rid of it so i'm also gonna put you on to the bads and the goods this one get ready so back to the fg that's that that's some [ __ ] i don't like that if you got your wii license in connecticut i guess don't get this [ __ ] thanks bro you ain't did you like it i didn't try it damn that's how bad it was we got rid of that asap so that's a no-go back to the fg man your number one weed channel expiration date tested date everything is there lab tested fresh now this is fire i would never say now about the fg the only thing i'm saying right now keep the percent tc's going up don't come down because i was going up with like 28 before almost 30 i remember watch my old reviews and check out the the percentage of the tc and with the change right now it's 22. so i'mma let y'all know how high i get because anything in the 20s and under 25 thc i don't know i don't like to buy it but i did it this time for you guys man i hope you enjoy it i blow up g signing out here bro y'all see the door", "XQMHIiu1JFs": "hello I'm venom 4:20 and today I'm gonna be showing you how to make caviar [Music] before we get started with anything else let's go ahead and take a quick dab so one of the big keys to how I'm showing you to do this for cheap is because I'm showing you how to do it with some reeds and you'll notice when you take a nice low temp dab you're gonna have a little bit of reuse I tend to keep mine in this little jar just like that got that out of the way so first off the things you're gonna need are some nugs something to do this over I'm using some parchment paper you're gonna need a little Bowl or a little dish to hold the key then you're gonna need the actual Keeffe itself just from the bottom of three-part grinder you're gonna need some type of oil to cover the nugs in so the idea is you're going to be covering the nugs and oil then rolling them and Keith this is all stuff I have already at home but it's even better to use like honey oil another good one you can use is distillate another good one is rosin and you're also gonna want some gloves too because this is going to be a sticky mess at some point so it's then good to sticky in here [Music] so now the goal is to wrap this whole bud in oil let's go ahead get this going and we'll just take a nice see there [Music] see that's just pretty gettin towed it already just coat it as much as you can [Music] now that's fully coded and then we're just going to take our little jar keep like that and we're just going to start pressing it down just like that [Music] [Music] and now it's probably starting to look a lot like something you've said you know we're expecting [Music] that is what I'm talking about right there that is a fully formed ball perfectly round Moonrock for you oh one down we're gonna go ahead and do this one more time I'm gonna go a little bit lighter on it than I did last time because this one's like a little bit like a play-doh ball you know it's it's too soft [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah that one's this one's mostly hash oil kind of the difference is a little bit this one feels a lot better just a little bit less oil I spread it out a little bit more even this one has a bunch better texture as this one's like a [ __ ] gooey mess I put on so much hash oil but it's just I mean look at that that's too much there's a little nugge pot in there but I mean not much so I'm actually I break that little tiny piece and make it its own little moon rock so that guy too he's an hour like it's so so and this one I can I'm just flying away that's just so like kief so oh yeah but way to get my channel on this one I am like I'm just pulling off the hash oil and rolling it in the key I think I'm creating my own new thing right now I'm calling these comments with AK a little venom comments and that's just pure hash oil and Keith rolled into a little low ball making new things the cat see Ziggy likes a chef I'm just glad he's sleeping on the chair next to me and not [ __ ] getting involved with this one cuz it's too messy those are cool they feel like a little like candies or something a little caramel balls but they're just pure oil drops rolled and Keith from the excess I had made off that moon rock just pulling it off now that I pulled off all that hash oil look how much smaller that is I was able to take all of that off of that by pulling out so I weigh over did the oil you don't want to do that because that actually sucked like this one and this one now are like perfect you got these perfect ones so now these ones have like a great consistency and these are kind of cool I like these little new inventions I came up with I'm sure it's been done I'm sure someone's had it if anyone knows about these put it in the comments below and tell me if anyone has a name form or anything like that because if not I'm coin in that [ __ ] they're little little comments but okay so got your moon rocks here and now these ones feel really good they're really solid and they're gonna break apart fine we got this little mini moon not here another way I like to do it is to take all that oil we got it and just start spreading it onto there we're gonna touch it for two seconds and really [Music] it's got all these little chunks honey there yeah Randy the same thing just go spread it over anything it sticks to alright so there you go that's another way to do it right there to is to take a paper cover it in oil cover it and keep and there you go I've heard these called caviar or moon rocks I think moon rocks is more of a thing that's been coined to a certain brand I think it's corrupt its corrupts moon rock that's it yep so I believe that technically moon rock is coined by that guy and that's like a brand that he grows and that's his thing so technically this is all caviar so let's let's clear that up I've been calling it moon rocks and a little insider knowledge on that as well as when caviar was first coming out I need someone who had you know the hens had just a dispensary they knew what was going on in there they worked there and he always told me not to get caviar and I'm like why and he's like well okay did the coming Aaron type thing is like the thing is is sometimes we get bud that's just really really shitty it looks like [ __ ] there's no crystals it just doesn't really do much for us so what they started doing is rolling it in oil rolling it in Keith and hiding it just like you know you could take something that's not very good and turn it really good you know what I mean you could take pretty much swag and make it besa got one more thing for you now the last one we're going to do is something called Sun rocks so what we're gonna do is actually instead rolling it in Keef we're going to roll it in all this and you'll see how there's all these shards they actually work a lot better if it wasn't so [ __ ] warm right now and every time you break it up you know there's a little tiny shards all over the place little flecks so we're actually going to be using that we have that all piled up put that to the side I'm gonna steal one last rap [Music] he's pretty much covered now we're gonna go ahead and take that and start rolling it [Music] [Music] [Music] and then you got one of those guys it's like a quantum Jim Rohn [Music] [Music] [Music] this is an OG Mike Montgomery double bubble bubbler Mike Montgomery is one of the original artists at the Chong glass company and this is a UV one it lights up really nice I'd like to eventually own a piece by like all the dudes who used to work there let's go ahead and load one of these [ __ ] up so I'm gonna go ahead and break that apart you can see it just [Music] crumbles and there you got the layers like to give a special thanks out to mr. Chuck I'm gonna put a link to his Instagram he helped me acquire this bad boy I love this thing so it's got the Homer smoking a blunt [ __ ] Satan Flanders to Satan Flannery's I should say and playboy Oh Marge oh yeah that's [ __ ] awesome awesome piece awesome moon rocks again gather so it was a little son rock here made ourselves some new little comments I don't know if that's a thing and also just I think the easiest way is to just roll it on paper and smoke it that way a lot of people put down the outside of the paper but that's kinda I feel like for show more which is fine sometimes because it's cool to can I don't look at it do its thing you know but it makes a mess I think when it's on the inside it only makes sense anyway so that's how I make my own caviar for next to nothing that's all from reuse I saved from my dabs and put my jar for later it's all from Keef that I collected on the bottom of the three-part grinder and it's from you know just any type of bud you want to use like I said I like making it myself because I know what ingredients this is the cheapest way to do it not the best you know what I mean you know all stuff that we've collected now if you get some really good distillate or some really good rosin or you know all these different ingredients you can make it yourself and excellent excellent quality this is just a really awesome link to experience if you even like it again super awesome thank you to everyone who helped make this happen thank you to everyone who watched go ahead and let me know how you like to make it I'm sure this is kind of an open thing this is you know what I'm doing isn't the way to do it it's just a cheap way to show you how to do it if you have other tips on that go ahead and leave it I think that's awesome anyway go

you guys that real quick and yeah peace out", "MS6BjTDtiOM": "cap dank here again in the smash lab today we're going to be using the nug smash or mini and we'll be showing you how to do a three and a half gram press on the new nug-nug smash 4 mini first of all what I wanted to show you folks is how to adjust the temperature setting on the mini itself you're gonna come to this particular button here you're gonna hit that button and then it's gonna start to flash and you can move your setting up or down and today we're gonna do this particular press at about 200 and let's say 15 degrees then let's make it to 20 okay once it's it can go over hit our button and we're ready to go now we have to wait for for the mini to heat up to our to our pressing temperature so in the meantime we'll get ourselves a three and a half gram hundred and sixty micron bag again we're gonna load it bottle textile so what we're gonna use today is we're gonna be using some of this key lime pie that was grown by Miller farms in rough-and-ready California just want to give a shout out to them so let's wake up three and a half grams of this beautiful flower I'm on the money okay like I said we're gonna load these this bag bottom textile which what that is it's been a load up and flatten into a coin versus some people just load them in flat and the nut smashers are really made for bottle tech that's how they design these and it's gonna give you maximum yield bottle textile so again what we do bottle textile is we fold in the corners right they use a little tool like this because it definitely helps to get the corners into place once you get the corners in I don't think to adjust it with my fingers yeah once again that's about what we're looking for bottle textile so let's let's lay it up beautiful flower okay bottle textile what we're trying to do is set up ourselves with a really good foundation here and just continue adding to that and what this will allow us to do is if it's packed in here correctly we will be able to you'll get a coin puck at the end of the press out of this and bottle textile should be something like that there okay that's about again what we're looking for once we load it up this point we want to cut the bag till we leave about a half an inch okay and again I'm gonna fold the top like a present and the last corner here it is when we load into the machine itself okay so looks like we're getting close to our temperature here so let me get a piece of parchment paper come down here you're gonna open up our open up our our plate these are 2.5 inch plates start our press what we want to do is slowly bring the plates up see how the bag is kind of accordion in on itself start the extraction process yes and we're gonna let our press go for 2 minutes and 30 seconds during the process with the mini you definitely want to keep it under maximum pressure and I think I see some rosin yes starting to flow they're golden beautiful resin about another minute here on the press [Music] about another 30 seconds or so here looking good ok we got 10 seconds left here paper together release your plates looks pretty good to me once again captain dick here in the smash lab with the nug Smasher mini", "QAkbtBShyp0": "hey everyone how's it going Eric here with peer pressure we're gonna be showing you our top five tips and tricks for getting the most out of your flower rosin so whether you're pressing at home on a hair straightener or using an industry-leading press like our peg speak rosin press we've got all the tips and tricks so you can get the most out of it tip number one quality in quality out this is the most important thing that you should know when you're making flower rosin or any rosin the better the material you're starting with the better your results are going to be and the fresher it is the better the clarity as material tends to age it's gonna oxidize and you're gonna find that that rosin is gonna come out darker so if you're looking to make the best flower rods and you possibly can get stellar material and press it as soon after its dried and cured as possible tip number two relative humidity makes a huge difference with flower rosin now you can go check out our other video where we did the full in-depth test but what you need to know is that your flower should be at least at 55 to 62% humidity before you press it this makes a massive difference in your yield so just make sure that your material is properly hydrated before you press it tip number three choose your temperature based on your desired results so we encourage a lot of experimentation and you're gonna find that most people are either pressing on the lower temperature range which is about 160 to 190 degrees Fahrenheit or the higher temperature range which is anything from 190 to as high as 250 degrees so depending on what kind of consistency you want to achieve that's where you're gonna set your temperature on the lower range you're gonna be looking at more of a butter on the higher range more of an oil or a shatter so when you have some material that you're playing around with we encourage you to try both ends of the spectrum and see which one you like the most tip number 4 choose the right micron bag type now you can absolutely press flower outside of a bag and get great results but that's usually only a gram or two you're gonna want to press in a 90 or 115 micron bag or at the most 150 we recommend not going any lower than 90 because that's when you're gonna see a huge drop-off in yield so if you're pressing flour in a bag make sure to stick in that range and finally tip number five if you're looking to make the highest quality flour on possible you absolutely don't need to overdo it on the pressure now you can definitely over press your flour rosin by applying way too much force at your bag and in fact we've seen great results not only with yield but of course with quality pressing at the lower end of the pressure range anything from around 550 to 1600 psi at the bag so when you're applying way too much pressure in the many thousands what can often happen is that you're pushing out plant fats lipids you know the waxes as well as all of those undesirable plant materials into the rosin really over pressing it so if you're looking for the highest quality rosin we recommend trying the lower pressure range and seeing your results thanks for watching we hope that you found that was helpful for more tips and tricks make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel and follow us on social media

just the smell of it smells really good I'm sober and this may be my first hit in a really long time so I'm excited to try it out here we go and my review will follow me cough a bit bit oh you know so I don't embarrass myself anyway sweet really euphoric berry you for it in fact that might have been one of the first things that I'd noticed was the euphoria very very little of that warm feeling was up your head it's almost like euphoria inner warmth euphoria the majority of it I could feel it just was great mmm kind of alert now definitely a little bit more alert than I was earlier I thought I finished it just I got a little bit left well let's finish it see what happens I'm definitely feeling more awake um which is which can be good for different things like if I want to stay awake and watch a movie and don't necessarily have like caffeine or something this would wake me up I can almost immediately tell the difference a minute ago I was just laying around and doing absolutely nothing not even not even wanting to do it with you I was like ma'am just you're gonna pass out no I'm awakened just like ding just right after that hit yeah so boo bleep is a hybrid but if you've been following me in your body chemistry is anything like mine this one will wake you up more of a more of a weak leg if you haven't stopped talking since I've hit it definitely a strain that makes the cop you know how like when you get to the bottom but I believe it tastes weird and tasted a mixture of like weird and okay a little bit alums better than that she's like my anxiety's bond didn't even possibly my depression I feel good and awake yeah all right guys that's my review take it easy I like and subscribe um if there's anything that you maybe want to see me improve on let me know I would like to know where I could improve thank you take it easy", "rPk6w7ylMq4": "hey there welcome back everybody this tab we're gonna be doing a follow-up video on the rosin tech 2015 last time I did flower rosin this time I was going to do a little bit of hash and make some rosin out of it so you guys can see how I do that I know I mean I was talking about it a while back in the last video and since then I know a couple of other people of many videos on it also which is cool this is just how I do it so and I said I was gonna do it so now I can't really back it out I'm kind of gonna be doing it on a smaller scale if it doesn't come out then I'll do some more on a bigger scale but I just got a little bit of this it's four star jack hair Herer whatever however you want to say it's definitely less than a gram I'm just trying to get a hit out of it and I don't want to make a big mess so and I think you'll get the idea first off you're going to need some parchment paper and the new tech that I was talking about in the last video which is I have some old pressing screens that you know you'd use for making hash you put your patties on it or whatnot and I actually had one that had a hole poked through it and I was I cut it up for various reasons so you're going to need one of those and I have a half of one of those and I have a couple of other sections like this that I've already done with it and then your hair straightener in your hash and that's about it okay so after that what you want to do is take these parchment paper the first thing you want to do is even if it is like this is a little bit fun it says this four star but I gave it a 3 star honestly so even if it's two-star it should be maybe not pressable but you should be able to you know congregate it and I've been doing a lot of three-star myself and even I mean even some two-star that I've had like the 160 that I did on the last run their barely was any of it but I I mean and it was 2 star but there's still a lot of big heads left in that 160 and 190 bag if you use them and it's still when I did this this is just how I start out here just like I'm smoking it I'm gonna go ahead and take flat iron and press it out just like that and let it cool off just a second but even when you have like two star you should be able to get something like this maybe it won't be as pretty or it'll be clumpy and it'll start falling apart but there should be some kind of gooey in there it's gonna stick it together and the reason that I do this is just I mean I just want to name one spot and I'm eating it a rolled up because I think I think the trick to doing the hash in the rosin tech is obviously getting it pretty small I don't like it any thicker than about a quarter of an inch I mean this is pretty good for bigger scale if I had I mean I could do it again with some more hash if this doesn't work out like I said but it's good because you can take like I've done like like four four grams plus and made a patty out of it and then done the same thing and it was a little bit more feasible like I could do with my two inch flat iron as opposed to the way that I tried it before when I put two grams and it was still all powdery and amended into the flat iron it like was leaking out the sides and it just wasn't working so this is the way I like to do it so anyway I get my little ball so now it's a little ball of hash however you get it to you know compact and stay together so it's not just falling all over the place and what we're doing with this is we're doing it it's like a filtration I'm using it so that I don't get contaminants and I actually have like little squares cut out that worked a little bit better but and I guess I can always cut this out if this is but what you want to do is is roll it up really tight and you can fold it or do this little parachute deal here but I think the tightness of this has a lot to do with me not getting much loss because whatever's touching the hash you can see the little bubble here where the hash is you can see the darkness this will not have any loss or hash left on it I found that it's really dry afterwards what ends up happening is it leaks up into this neck here and then that's where you get if there is and there's very little loss if you do this if this is tight but yeah I was watching in hash Church this last Sunday and they had soil growing on there and they were talking about Jeff was talking about how he does this method and so a girl wasn't really sure about it at that time and he was saying that it was because of the loss and I really don't think that this is a ton of loss there now I have mend everybody play with you know heat settings understand I recommend that everybody play with heat settings because you know it could just be like your D nail you know every hair irons a little bit different it's not like they're calibrating these things by some regulation it's just what the company whatever the company says whatever degree so what I would do is you know start out a little bit cooler a lot of people were talking about you know 200 225 degrees I like it a little bit hotter about 275 250 s what I've been playing with on my hair I I like the results of that it's shatter its taste food and it been it works I give up I think I believe we've good yield out of it so that's what I would recommend but I mean this is all new stuff and I think everybody should just experiment with it and see what's good with the equipment they're working with my buddies got a t-shirt press that's a more like commercial scale of this tech at least right now I've heard some people like on hash Church we're talking about a hydraulic press excuse me I mean there's all kinds of things that can be put into this tech I think that would make it viable for mass production so that's I mean I guess that's the next big thing I said in the last couple videos I probably wouldn't do this in my regular life I mean I probably won't do the flour rosin too often I mean it'll be novelty maybe at a party I'll be like hey did you know you could squish your bud and get oil I mean that's about all I could see me doing that but this 3 star with the the screen to filter out is really feasible I think you know it's it'll it'll turn some of my better tasting hash that's just 3 star into sticks star smokeable so I think it's really good all right I think the hair irons eat it up bad enough already again I have just a little piece of parchment paper because I'm just doing a little bit try to keep this as tight as possible press down pretty much as hard as you can since we're doing out in such a lower temp I'm gonna let it sit there for 10 or 15 seconds all right and that was literally like a dabs worth anyway and a lot of people give up and I mean this might be not work because it's just such a little amount but when I use bigger amounts I do three presses like you know like this I'll go in on a different corner because the parchment obviously be a little bit bigger so I'll just put the same piece right there give it another press on that bet we'll get something out of it for this a second press not really guess what it looks like after like three or four right here but I think this was such a small piece that we got all of it okay cool it's nice and easy as you saw let's take a look at this definitely enough for a dab maybe even two [Music] what do you think of that that's made from three star and now six star smokeable Jack her sweet okay so that's what we got out of it again I have a little bit more customized little piece of this cut out I would recommend that as soon as you do this like take the hash that's in here out don't let it sit there in a ball afterwards because it'll harden up and while it's still warm you know it will open if he cans up feeling real sticky so like I said that wasn't 4 star 5 star whatever they called it how much for residues left over and I mean this is all I'm gonna keep this to maybe put in some coconut butter oil excuse me but it's milked for sure it's dry and again show ya where it was did you see where the half actually sat it's completely drying clean and then around the neck here kind of that's where the the waste is but it really looks worse than it actually is I think I weighed again I have one of these and I put about 5 4 or 5 grams in here and it looks crazy it looks like oh my god and I waited before and after and I think my total yield off that 5 grams was like 3 grams of a six-star oil rosin and there was less than half a gram was like 0.3 0.4 23 I think it was really uh just a little bit was on the screen I think it's definitely worth it because when I press hash before and not put it on there it's dirty and it's yet and it has contaminant in it and it tastes like garbage and it looks like garbage and then you kind of press it and unless it's two-star now if it's two-star it'll all stay in the same area on the parchment paper without the screen and all the oil will press out maybe not as pretty as this but it'll be you know you know D level but if you're doing like three or even four star and you decide to do that then a lot of the contaminants are real oily too and they're gonna press out with it and then it's just it's not as good trust me I did not like toxin to begin with content for that situation that stuff is really stable I'm actually gonna cut this piece of paper in half because I don't want to look at all over the place there's lots of ways you can harvest this - the new way I like to do when there's a little bit more I'm good it's just the old way because there's just a little bit of it but I've been taking when all my harvest portion on a piece of parchment and then just dabbing it along and picks it up really well I found again you can roll it see the rolling method really works the stable stuff gets it nice and clean the next one again that second precedent really yield would only do a bigger one I'll press it a second time and it'll be a pretty good yield and then I'll press it a third time and it'll be obvious that it's pretty much all done I don't don't just give up a little that shuddered take a shot for Instagram all right get it off of this thing now stop showering you're all over the foot just be slow it's kind of like oil in that you know you move slow and it's this gets movable go hard fast showers a little place yep well definitely it down press it out so you can check it out so I hope that really explains hash rosin tech and maybe some of you did not know about the pressing screen as a filter now I know that this is the same material they make teacher simply do t-shirt screenings with - I think so I don't think there's any you know you're not you're not going very hot anyway you know two to three fifty two hundred degrees three fifty is the zone I would try to stay in and you're not going to have any issues with that I've used these screens a couple times and then afterwards you can just have a jar and just fill that with 99% or whatever clear and then just put your little put these little things in there Boop and then just pull them out in an hour - and they're pretty you know you can just strain them out and then rinse them off and they're ready to go again huh what do you think of my three star just six star Rossum I think
